# My.EU

## TODO

More data:
  - farming data:
    - need lat and lon from first half of postcode (outcode)
    - quite a lot; not looked at a map yet
  - research data:
    - have institution name and need location
    - have not yet plotted it
  - about page needs updating if we add these data

Pop-ups
  - currently all the same
  - can we source pictures from somewhere? google image search?

Frontend
  - injection of points via templating --- could use JSON?
  - social buttons are not styled correctly (should have the icons)
