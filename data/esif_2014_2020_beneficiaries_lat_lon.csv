1. Promotion of ESF opportunities: awareness-raising.
This will include web-based and e mail communications, social media, fact-sheets, leaflets, newsletters and press releases as well as a programme of  road shows and events with appropriate support materials to take forward our communications strategy. It will ensure that the target audiences receive the right messages, tailored to their needs.Tier 1: our national strategic partners such as DWP, the SFA and Big Lottery with whom we need to communicate regularly on strategy development and implementation Tier 2: our local strategic partners and stakeholders, such as Local Area Partnerships, Upper Tier  Local Authorities, HE and FE  sector representatives, voluntary and community sector representatives, business organisations etc., who are engaged in strategy development and implementation, but who are not likely to bid for ESI Funds 
Tier 3: the wide range of potential delivery organisations, many of which are based in our area, but also those outside it who have knowledge and expertise to bring to ESF delivery in Coast to Capital.
2. Building a strong pipeline of high quality projects to meet the ESF-related aims of our ESIF strategyThis will include: one-to-one meetings; small focused workshops; one-to-one advice; answering telephone and e mail queries. We will also provide strategic-fit related advice to applicants at outline and full application stage as well as signposting to the MA and the relevant co-financing / Opt-in Organisation (OiO).
We will work closely with the MA to ensure that the referral process works smoothly.  Our support will not duplicate the MA’s and/or Opt-in Organisation’s support to applicants which will be aimed at ensuring technical compliance. Our support will focus on local skills, employment, social inclusion priorities and labour market intelligence as well as strategic fit. We will also provide information on putting good bids together, match funding and other subjects in addition to that which is available from the MA or OiO where there is clear evidence of local demand.
3. Delivery partner-broking and networking
We will use the ESIF pages on our website (which are already well used) in addition to social media, e.g. Linked-in groups, as well as “meet the partner” and other networking events for potential applicants. 
Once projects are underway, delivery partners will be supported to exchange good practice. We have already received requests for more networking opportunities and access to peer group support. 
4. Strategic Partner engagement 
We will continue to engage strategic partners through one-to-one and small scale meetings, encouraging their active participation in communication and through consultation (meetings, events, questionnaires etc.) to identify changes in local circumstances, successful projects and lessons learned. 
5. Monitoring of the TA project itself and continuous improvement 
We will monitor the TA project continuously and conduct an annual progress review to ensure it is meeting its objectives. Results will be used to drive continuous improvement of activities delivered through the TA project through identifying what has worked well, or not so well, and requires improvement.

The development will contain a dedicated meeting room facility, with dedicated shared facilities provided for a photocopier, other office equipment and kitchen facilities to assist new incubator companies. This will allow the existing ERDF Cumbria Growth Hub (CGH) to offer advice to potential business start-ups as well as giving continued advice to the occupier businesses.

The project will be delivered by Allerdale Borough Council (ABC) as the client/sponsor. ABC will be responsible for obtaining all the necessary statutory consents for the project including the land, environment and planning.

ABC will procure a design and build contract to construct the managed workspace using their in-house procurement team who will align the internal process with ERDF procurement guidelines.

Reedlands Road is in Workington, Cumbria. The general area is known as Clay Flats and is an established employment area with a range of older industrial estates and retail warehouse outlets. Whilst vacancy rates are high, this is largely due to the unsuitability of premises and there has been no development to deliver modern start-up units for a number of years.  There is also a lack of ‘churn’ in the market as growing businesses are reluctant to move due to a lack of move-on space. ABC have commissioned a Market Needs Analysis which will conform current stock condition and supply as well as demand for new start-up space which will provide useful evidence to support this application.

The development of the units will create opportunities for new business start-up and existing businesses currently situated elsewhere who are looking to expand and grow into larger premises. The development will also assist with giving business incubation advice by working in partnership with the CGH.

The project is dependent on the receipt of ERDF funding. ABC own the site and it is anticipated that all statutory approvals and the procurement of tenders can be completed to take advantage of any ERDF award with an immediate start on site following acceptance of any ERDF offer of assistance. This can be achieved by August/September 2017.
