The before mentioned situation also calls for a paradigm shift from only landfilling with excavation material in a direction to re-use the excavated material by nearly 100% as valuable new raw material in other industrial processes and sectors.\nTherefore the overall goal of DRAGON is to develop new work flows and new techniques in order to guarantee a) a fast detection of useable materials; b) an immediate separation of high value materials already within the underground construction site and c) the recycling of that material on the backup system of  the tunnel boring machines.\nBased on that research results a number of different prototypes will be developed and tested throughout the project duration.\nAnother important impact of DRAGON is that the LCA (life cycle analysis) is going to provide scientific evidence that the re-use of excavated tunnelling material will result in more resource-efficient and more closed-loop related systems (even in industry-related economy) in Europe.\nA complex project such as DRAGON can only be addressed by joint and concerted actions of outstanding experts: DRAGON`s scientific partner MUL belongs to Europe`s leading tunnelling experts; the 4 participating SME partners are highly specialised companies which are active in environmental niche markets; HK as market leader of mechanized tunnelling systems guarantees the market power and brings in the corresponding market knowledge whereas PORR as end user partner will mostly benefit from the newly developed equipment and the way to save costs either by commercializing valuable excavation materials or by re-using excavation material as its own raw material.", 331777.0, 3650165.0, "DRAGON", "Utilisation of excavated materials from tunnelling projects", "An EU project team is developing a new system which enables the detection, processing and utilisation of valuable mineral resources directly on a tunnel boring machine (TBM).

The entire chain from characterisation to classification and processing of the excavated material will be conducted completely underground.\n\nThe process steps in detail: Excavation process: Excavation of material at the heading face by the TBM`s cutting wheel, including characterisation of rock properties using a disc cutter load monitoring system. Main material flow: Discharge of the excavated material via the TBM's main belt conveyor. Sampling: Splitting the bypass material flow using a hammer sampler. Elemental analysis: Material preparation by crusher and bypass belt conveyor, followed by high-precision microwave moisture measurement and online x-ray elemental analysis. Grain size analysis: Photo-optical analysis for parallel determination of grain size distribution. Sorting: In-stream sorting of the excavated material based on the online classification results.\n\nThis approach would substitute a large amount of primary mineral resources and substantially reduce environmental problems and CO2 emissions involved in landfilling and transport.\n\nAnother important objective is to assess the resource efficiency of different usage scenarios on a quantifiable basis and thus provide a sound basis for decision making by national/international authorities.\n\nThe project duration is 3 years.

In addition to the motor development, new active cooling designs will be investigated and novel numerical methods will be developed for 2D modelling of superconducting motors at the level of individual turns in the windings and for 3D modelling of motor components.

These are then used to categorize breakthrough technologies (e.g. piston topping, intercooling & exhaust heat exchangers, and advanced propulsor & integration concepts). This classification approach gives a structured way to combine and explore synergies between the technologies in the search for ultralow CO2, NOx and noise emissions. The most promising combinations of radical technologies will then be developed for a short range European and a long range intercontinental advanced tube and wing aircraft.\n\nThrough the EU projects VITAL, NEWAC, DREAM, LEMCOTEC, E-BREAK and ENOVAL, the ULTIMATE partners have gained the most comprehensive experience in Europe on conception and evaluation of advanced aero engine architectures. Existing tools, knowledge and models will be used to perform optimization and evaluation against the SRIA targets to mature the technologies to TRL 2. Road maps will be set up to outline the steps to develop the technologies into products and bring them onto the market. These road maps will also provide a way forward for future European propulsion and aviation research.", 83699.0, 2626574.0, "ULTIMATE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.rolls-royce.com", null, "h2020_193233_999945356"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5BH", "America in the Obama Years", "BROOK LAPPING PRODUCTIONS", 237523.0, "Barack Obama came to office arousing more enthusiasm world-wide than any previous American president.  Using exclusively the testimony of decision-makers and participants, this series tells the story of America in the years of Barack Obama, America's first black president:  his rise, the resistance he's faced and how he has led America over eight tumultuous years.No previous US President has so excited world hopes and enthusiasm.  Also because his speeches   notably in Chicago on election night, in Cairo on foreign policy, in  Prague on disarmament, in Tuscon after Gabriel Giffords was shot, and many others   caught the world by the throat.  So viewers will want to know how exactly did he come to say that.  And  what happened when he tried (or not) to deliver as he promised?  Viewers will discover how the world economic crisis and opposition in Congress together presented unique challenges to his ambitions - and how President Obama dealt with them.Stories we plan to include: how Obama defeated Hillary Clinton for the nomination; why he failed to close Guantanamo; how he overruled financially cautious opponents in Congress and got the US economy growing again (though his liberal supporters thought he did not go far enough); how he won a partial success on health care; how he handled Iran and Egypt and Libya and Syria; how he turned the US from Europe towards Asia; how his policies provoked the Tea Party to oppose him, but their extremism  made it impossible for the Republicans to win the 2012 elections; how, in the wake of horrific shootings, he found it impossible to get new legislation on gun control. Each is a great story.  Each will be told by people at the centre of events   and by their opponents in the room when the policy arguments exploded.

ZF is a vehicle industry company compared to Rolls-Royce which produces aero engines.  The skills, knowledge and experience the apprentices will gain from working in both companies will be invaluable and will broaden their skills base.  The project in ZF will allow our apprentices to learn specific skills that are not available to them within the United Kingdom and which are unique to our German  partners.  \r\n\r\nThe planned duration of the project is 3 weeks, where the host will offer skills which meet some of the apprentices NVQ units.  ZF are world experts in their field and have a host of skills, task, processes, materials and tooling that is not available within our apprentices workplace across the UK.   \r\n\r\nWe will  focus on language, technical language, working practices, and how to work across transnational boundaries.   The learning will be aligned to their NVQ to ensure that their learning during the mobility is relevant to the individual.   \r\n\r\nAs well as the excellent technical learning we will offer a first class linguistic and cultural learning package prior to commencing the mobility, which as well as focusing on social language, will also cover technical language.   Cultural experiences will also be planned for the participants to experience the history, culture and current events of the area that they are visiting.  We will utilise Europass to formalise the learning of our apprentices, as well as NVQ's and Core / Functional Skills.  \r\n\r\nOur objectives are to:\r\n\r\nMake apprentices aware of their potential employment mobility throughout Europe, \r\nProvide them with skill sets unavailable to them in the UK \r\nExpand the apprentices vocational mobility and their job assignment throughout Europe. \r\nIncrease self-esteem for the apprentices and aid their assimilation of culture, linguistic knowledge and information regarding sector employment opportunities throughout Europe using their Europass CV\r\nGive apprentices exposure to different technical solutions to similar problems.\r\nEnhance their knowledge and experience in driveline and chassis technology\r\nLearn different ways of working and best practice.\r\nImprove skills, knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nAll of the above will be utilised to disseminate the outcomes of the project and to facilitate the adoption of any best practices identified as a result of the mobility project activities.

Europe is characterised by its linguistc and cultural diversity. As a continent where three dozen languages are spoken, it is known for the high number of cultures that border on one another. But Europe means more than being able to travel and work without frontiers and customs: Europe is a true vision of society and understanding.\r\n\r\nWithin the framework of globalisation, there is a greater demand than ever for multilingualism. Hardly any company can survive without international links. There is a growing need for international staff who speak foreign languages. As citizens of Europe we must be able to communicate and co-operate across borders and cultures...\r\n\r\nBackground and Participants:\r\nStudents completing a vocational education as Commercial Assistants at the Kolping College of Commerce and Foreign Languages in Heilbronn enjoy a predominantly theoretical education. In order to enhance the quality of their training and to improve the employment prospects of our young students, it is desirable for their education to include a period of practical experience abroad. Within the framework of this project, a total of approximately 25 future commercial assistants from both the first and second years of the course will take part in three-week study trips to Spain or Great Britain during the spring of 2019. At this juncture, they have yet to gain any practical experience in a foreign country.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nThe activities comprise instruction in the foreign language and business administration at partner institutes, company visits, excursions and school projects, as well as cultural events. Participants orient themselves by the GUIDE they themselves have created and, in addition, complete their project \"A DIFFERENT DAILY ROUTINE\". The contents of the trip are organised so as to complement and augment the mostly theoretical education provided by the College.\r\n\r\nAims of the Project:\r\nThe study trips are founded on the three elements of the foreign language and culture, and the world of business, and are designed to achieve goals relevant to the students' education. The knowledge students have acquired of the foreign language in the classroom can be tried out and deepened in another European country. Students are given the opportunity to undertake operational tasks while gaining an insight into the business life of the foreign country and familiarising themselves with its work culture and lifestyle. The encounter with the country's culture takes the form of their daily routine combined with visits to museums and the theatre.\r\n\r\nProcedure and Implementation:\r\nWe remain in continuous contact with our partner institutes, so that we can involve students, parents, teachers and the college as a whole during the course of the year leading up to a study trip. As soon as assurance of support has been granted, the project managers contact our partner institutes in order to co-ordinate the details. Host families are selected by our partner institutes. The project management team deals with the organisation of the trip and the formalities of insurance and legal contracts, also communicating with the parents of the participants on these matters. The students themselves finally draw up the supporting programme as well as their GUIDE as part of their course in project management at the College.\r\nAims and Benefits:\r\nParticipants write reports in which they present their results and how they personally have benefited from the study trip. \r\n\r\nThe results we aspire to achieve are to increase participants' abilities in the foreign language as well as their intercultural competence, and to improve their school marks and education. In addition, they gain practical experience, a more attractive profile for their CV, and contacts at companies in other European countries, all of which are beneficial when seeking future employment. There are long-term gains not only for the future careers of our participants but also for firms, inasmuch as they are provided with well-educated skilled personnel.\r\n\r\nOne result our institute strives for is to foster close and trusting ties  to our co-operation partners in other European countries and the willingness to conduct further mobility and other EU projects.\r\n\r\nA final positive effect is the promotion of the European vision through the international orientation of our vocational training. \r\n\r\nThese study trips may be interpreted as part of a great story helping us to understand others, the people we live together with as Europeans.", "http://www.ahk-london.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004513_4"], ["6QT", "S.O.F.T.
