Novel synthesis strategies for tides, which utilise membranes for key separations will be created. MemTide will consider both step change improvements to solid phase tide synthesis, and the realisation of a completely new concept of tide synthesis based on solution phase synthesis coupled to membrane purification. The applications of these technologies will be through the industrial partners. The project is multidisciplinary, involving chemists, materials scientists and chemical engineers. The consortium is intersectorial, comprising 3 universities/research institutes, a technology SME, a fine chemicals company and a large pharmaceutical manufacturer, and will have a strong emphasis on knowledge creation, technology commercialisation, and entrepreneurship. The training programme involves Early Stage Researchers (ESR), at both university and industrial partners, each of whom will complete a PhD thesis through a combination of local and network wide research experience. Experienced Researchers (ER) will complete their training through development of entrepreneurship and project management skills.

EU-funded researchers worked on developing novel membrane-enhanced tide synthesis technologies for myriad applications.", "Tide synthesis techniques \u2014 solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and liquid-phase peptide synthesis (LPPS) \u2014 have issues with purity, yield and batch variability.\n\nScientists of the 'Membrane enhanced tide synthesis - A new paradigm peptide / oligonucleotide synthesis technology' (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/memtide (MEMTIDE)) project worked on combining membrane technology with tide synthesis techniques to cost-effectively optimise quality and yield of tides while reducing batch variability.\n\nResearchers developed and optimised novel methodologies for membrane-based tide synthesis after comparing different cross-linkers, coupling agents and solvent compositions. They prepared and cross-linked integrally skinned asymmetric polybenzimidazole (PBI) nanofiltration membranes. These PBI membranes are able to withstand harsh chemical environments and can thus be used for pharmaceutical purification processes utilising acids and bases.\n\nMEMTIDE then synthesised three peptides of higher purity and yield using OH-BTL-resin with SPPS rather than Wang resin. They also tested various commercially available soluble supports to identify the most promising candidates.\n\nScientists combined organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) with LPPS and successfully produced the peptide 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-RADA with high yield and purity. Fmoc is normally used to ensure amino acid functional group protection. This methodology required fewer equivalent amino acids for coupling when compared to SPPS.\n\nFor oligonucleotide synthesis, LPPS was combined with OSN and led to the synthesis of 5-mer DNA oligonucleotides. This technique shows promise in large-scale manufacture of oligo-based therapeutics. However, certain challenges and process improvements must first be undertaken.\n\nProject activities were published in 11 papers with several more on the way and the team participated in 11 oral and 16 poster presentations at 15 international conferences. These activities have also fostered further research collaboration.\n\nProject partners have filed patents for commercial application of the processes and products developed during the project. Overall, LPPS with OSN shows promise as a technique for cost-effective scalable manufacture of peptides and oligonucleotides. Applications include peptide- and oligo-based therapies for development of designer drugs and vaccines as well as antibody and enzyme production. Besides this, technologies and processes developed could also be adapted for chemicals' manufacture, food and other industries.", null, "http://duramem.evonik.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/147580.jpg", "fp7_92671_999730210"], ["0AF", "Implementation of Membrane Technology to Industry", "Evonik Membrane Extraction Technology Limited", "The IMeTI proposal aims to create a programme of applied research for implementation of membrane technology into industry based on experience and knowledge transfer between Academia and Industry.

The overall scientific and technical aim of the IMeTI project is to make important paradigm shifts in organic solvent nanofiltration and high temperature gas separation/purification, using cutting edge technologies based on membranes. The project involves the integration of the invention of new membranes and applications in the University/ Research Institute Partners with the subsequent development of the necessary membrane technology up to processing scale by the SMEs. A key feature of this project will be the interdisciplinary nature of the Partners, and the fact that they bring inter-sectorial competence to the network.

The catalysts will be constructed using components at the nano-scale in a bottom-up approach. Hereby, catalytically active metal complexes will be linked with nanoparticles such as polymeric microgels, hyperbranched polymers or hybrid systems consisting of silsesquioxanes attached to hyperbranched polymers. Further hierarchical organisation of HiCat catalysts will be accomplished by interconnected networks formed from the assemblies of catalytic nanoparticles using end-functional T-responsive polymers that can interact with functionalities on the surface of the nanoparticles as binding agents. Recycling of the catalyst-nanoparticle entities in multi-batch operation will be studied utilizing the change of solubility of the polymer supported catalysts by external stimuli. Based on polymer-nanoparticles linked by T-responsive polymers, new types of films and membranes with graded porosity can be prepared by varying the size of the nanoparticles and the length of T-sensitive polymers. This opens new opportunities for integration of catalytic steps and separation within the hierarchically structured system and, hence for continuous reactor operation. The proposal combines the superiority of homogeneous metal-organic catalysts often possessing nearly 100 % selectivity with the advantage of efficient separation by grabbing a new concept for building up hierarchically organised catalytic systems. Structural principles of tailor-made ligands will be transferred into tailor-made functional surfaces of nanoparticles.

Several simple and economical synthesis routes were developed and patented. Scientists also demonstrated for the first time proof-of-principle for a novel class of polymer (microgel)-supported metal catalysts. These were used in two reactions and relevant patents will be filed shortly.\n\nThe consortium developed important technology for hierarchical formation of layers of NPs of homogeneous NP size and different functionalities. Data support the excellent potential of microgel NPs to yield separation membranes with tailor-made properties. Finally, commercial applications often require spiral-wound membranes, flat-sheet membranes rolled into tubular form. HICAT demonstrated fabrication of suitable membranes into spiral-wound modules, further increasing commercial applicability and readiness.\n\nPowerful novel catalysts incorporated into porous membranes of tailor-made functionality and commercially relevant shapes open up new opportunities for integrated catalysis and separation.
