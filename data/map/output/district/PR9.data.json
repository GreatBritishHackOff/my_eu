Working together, the Churchtown Family \u2018IMAGINE- BELIEVE and ACHIEVE\u2019 and as a team we constantly strive to achieve the very best. Education is a partnership and our involvement in this inspirational project will be at the forefront of our vision for the near and longer term future of our innovative, inspiring learning community.\r\nWe respect and value all individuals and are respectful of others individual needs. We foster independence, determination and perseverance helping our children become confident ambitious young people.\r\nWe have a very large staff and we are committed to developing the training we provide to include as large a number of teaching and non -teaching staff as possible.\r\nWe have been developing a widening a range of skills in a number of areas and have been involved several in a number of activities that have been embraced by the whole school and its community - Continuing Professional Development is a major part of this.\r\nIn our ever changing world we feel it is important to demonstrate to other staff and to our pupils the importance of visiting other European countries, widening our knowledge, taking appropriate steps to develop and acquire an intercultural understanding and appreciation of our fellow Europeans.\r\n\r\nOur project objectives are:\r\n*to further enhance both our indoor and outdoor learning environments, particularly with regard to Early Years\r\n*Discover more about creative teaching approaches in Early Years education\r\n*  increase competences and confidence to deliver first class teaching in all areas of the curriculum meeting the local needs and also the National requirements\r\n* develop skills and competencies to deliver a creative and more globalised curriculum in line with our commitment to our International School Award work\r\n* develop staff expertise in dealing with an ever challenging curriculum and enhance Teaching and Learning\r\nthrough effective use of Teaching Assistants and Support Staff\r\n* develop staff abilities to work within a European context and increase linguistic and cultural skills\r\n* develop links with schools abroad \r\n* broaden our vision and understanding of systems in other countries\r\n* raise the confidence and motivation of our teaching staff, support staff and pupils \r\n*to promote wellbeing in education \r\n\r\nTo achieve our far reaching objectives we have made a commitment to offer these staff mobility experiences to 24, carefully selected members of staff on 6 highly relevant structured training courses which will be delivered in Italy, Spain, Sweden and France. Our staff have a range of experiences- are enthusiastic and keen to further their knowledge and experiences on a personal and educational level.\r\n\r\nOur staff have a track record for disseminating new skills and knowledge in relation to whole school improvement. This will ensure the sustainability of our projects as we share the drive and extend the expertise we have learned amongst others, taking forward the initiatives and leading and influencing others.  \r\nWe are determined to ensure that this aspect of our school reaches a high level of accomplishment and as such we will strive to select those staff to participate, that we feel will have the greatest impact across the school.\r\n\r\nThese projects will improve our overall curriculum and:\r\na) Raise expectations\r\nb) Provide challenge\r\nc) Identify strengths and weaknesses\r\nd) Prioritise actions for improvement\r\ne) Improve self-evaluation \r\n\r\nWe believe that the impact and long term benefits of the training undertaken by the 24 participants can be multiplied through an effective dissemination and sharing strategy, both within our school and the local LEA, through the networks and Learning Partnerships with whom we work.\r\nWe consider this project to be a significant step in supporting our commitment to standards of learning and teaching excellence within the school\r\n\r\nWith staff professional development at the forefront of our future plans, and led by our School Improvement Plan, this Erasmus + KA1 training grant would enable Churchtown Primary School to achieve our ambitious future plans.\r\nWe want to lead the way in developing these opportunities. Working alongside our wider community we can motivate and encourage others to embark on their own individual learning journeys, in turn, inspiring their own staff and pupils as we continually endeavour to do.", "http://www.churchtown.org.uk", "Churchtown Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036002_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PR9"}
