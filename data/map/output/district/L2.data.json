Our social innovation is to attract people to lifestyle change through the personal connection and loyalty to the club they support. Our aim is to use this social innovation to change physical activity and sedentary behaviour, specially targeting low-SES groups, and men as well as women. EuroFIT is supported by UEFA and top football clubs.\nWorkplan: End-users and policy-makers are involved throughout. We will: a) produce a device (SitFIT) that provides real-time feedback on objectively measured sedentary time and physical activity; b) deploy and evaluate smartphone games to drive activity through social interaction (MatchFIT); c) integrate these with state-of-the-art evidence on behavioural change and its maintenance in a web-supported lifestyle programme delivered by top EU football clubs (EuroFIT)). We will evaluate EuroFIT in a multi-centre randomised controlled trial to assess impact on physical activity and sedentary behaviour, physical and mental health and weight. We will investigate the correlates of long-term changes and impact on participants\u2019 families. Finally we will develop a robust strategy for replication of EuroFIT\nImpact:  We will generate excellent research evidence on the use of social innovation for health. Social impact will include reductions in health risk, improvements in well-being and the decreased inequalities as more men, especially those in low SES groups, are attracted to lifestyle change. Research impact will be achieved through new understanding of the how health indicators respond to change in sedentary behaviour and physical activity and through new knowledge of longterm maintenance of lifestyle changes.

Yet, at present, the industry is insufficiently aware of such benefits, to its detriment, and adequate collaboration has not been achieved.\n\nThe EU-funded http://euro-vip.eu/ (EUROVIP) project aimed to coordinate European maritime SMEs and related organisations, and to promote application of research results. The purpose was to promote operational and technical collaboration. The 21-member consortium ran between June 2011 and May 2014.\n\nProject partners devised two sustainable means of achieving its objectives. First was the European Maritime Collaboration Portal (EMCP), a website enabling industry members to collaborate. The EMCP offers a searchable database listing innovative services and technologies, their providers and opportunities for collaboration such as tender calls. Users may build partnerships according to their needs and resources.\n\nThe project's second solution was the Technical Collaboration Platform (TCP). This provided an integrating and coordinating environment, supporting design and engineering software tools such as computer-aided design and computational fluid dynamic. The core functionality was the web-based ticket system, enabling automated online computation. Such mechanism is cheaper and more efficient than conventional solutions.\n\nEUROVIP prepared six case studies showing how EMCP and TCP benefit the maritime industry. Two operational-level examples illustrated effective use of the EMCP for finding tender calls and potential collaborators. Further examples illustrated TCP use for novel online computation services and for collaborative design work.\n\nDissemination activities included a project roadshow, and a series of events held across Europe. Such events expanded the participating membership almost 10-fold, and the pool of EMCP users increased from 30 to over 200. The project was able to promote three business success stories.\n\nThe team prepared system documentation, including best practice guidelines, and other user information such as instructional videos and presentations.\n\nEUROVIP facilitated collaboration among maritime industry members by offering two sets of online tools.

However, rather than assessing the ship performance in terms of global design factors such as ship motions and noise, the human element studies have primarily focused on local design features (e.g., bridge design) that are relatively easy to fix and tune towards required effects on the crew. From the formal point of view, the key element that has been missing and therefore preventing the integration of the human element into ship design projects is a comprehensive quantification of crew performance failure. Given the natural uncertainty of the maritime environment, such quantification must be probabilistic and therefore commensurate with safety-driven ship design methods such as the Risk-Based Design.\n\nIn project FAROS, the rationalised nature of the Risk-Based Design will be used to integrate the human element into the ship safety framework and deliver ship concepts (ro-pax and tanker) that are safe, economic and \u201cgreen\u201d. This will be achieved by (1) quantitatively linking global design factors to the crew performance failure modes (fatigue, gross and fine motor skills etc.) and (2) optimising multi-disciplinary ship performance using state-of-the-art tools, methods and empirical knowledge.\n\nIt is expected that the societal and personal risks on tanker and ro-pax ships can be reduced at least by 30%, provided recommended amendments to design rules are implemented and the developed ship design assessment framework, which takes into account the crew performance at sea, is used in daily ship design practice by parties relevant.", 379319.0, 3107932.0, "FAROS", "Exploring and quantifying the link between ship design and human performance failure", "The design of a ship can adversely affect human performance, which may lead to maritime accidents.

Building on previous projects, the overall goal is to demonstrate how human error aboard a ship can be mitigated by its design. The project specifically focuses on early design stages such as concept design, for drastic design modifications at this stage can still be cost effective.\n\nDuring the first reporting period, the work began with analysis of state-of-the-art research in the GDF influence to crew performance and human error. Findings showed that noise, vibration and ship motions affect attention management capability, while the layout of the deck and the location and accessibility of equipment influence the efficiency and safety of performing various tasks by crew.\n\nResearchers quantified risk contributions from such casualties as crew injury and death, ship-to-ship collision, grounding, and fire that affect the entire ship and hence all people onboard. Risk models were then developed linking GDFs to human performance and errors. The models were combined to create a comprehensive risk assessment framework to be used for passenger and cargo ships in a risk-based design process.\n\nVirtual experiments were carried out in machinery spaces (simulated in virtual reality) and on bridge simulators to determine the conditions under which the crew is most likely to fail. These conditions were then compared to corresponding design rules and guidelines, looking for relevant deficiencies and loopholes.\n\nWith a better understanding of the causal link between ship design and human performance, FAROS will offer improvements to ship design process that will lead to safer ships. These improvements will also be helpful while developing more effective safety procedures and better work and living conditions on board.", "http://faros-project.eu", null, "/docs/results/images/2015/156070.jpg", "fp7_105337_961840361"], ["2DH", "New Strategy for Re-Naturing Cities through Nature-Based Solutions", "Liverpool City Council", "Urban GreenUP aims at obtaining a tailored methodology (1) to support the co-development of Renaturing Urban Plans focused on climate change mitigation and adaptation and efficient water management, and (2) to assist in the implementation of NBS in an effective way.
