The trainees in the Ortenaukreis, as well as the training companies, the zweiteSchule gemeinn\u00fctzige Gesellschaft (a non-profit organization), and the Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen Lahr work closely together for the mobility project. Local companies have been sending their trainees to European subsidiaries and other cooperating companies for several years as a mobility activity. It is indispensible for local companies depending on export to encourage their trainees\u2019 language skills. The results of the mobility activities over the last years have shown that the participants not only improved their language skills but furthermore enriched their intercultural and methodological competences, not to speak of their positive personal development. The involved companies and the Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen Lahr are committed to an improvement of these competencies. \r\nThe mobility project is going to take place from August until December 2014. Our trainees are going to do their job placements in the UK, France, Ireland, Iceland, the Czech Republic, Spain and Switzerland. The trainees of the Duales Berufskolleg are required to complete a job placement for several months during their training. The training companies completely support this measure since they profit from the knowledge and the skills that the trainees acquire in the partner companies abroad. An important part of the mobility measure is the realization of a project which usually deals with current European topics. It is supposed to improve first and foremost the trainees\u2019 linguistic and social skills. \r\nWork on the topic \u201can international comparison of goals and measures of integration policies\u201d within the EU poses the question, which results are to be expected. \r\nThe chosen topic \u201can international comparison of goals and measures of integration policies\u201d is supposed to reveal proven, sustainable results.
