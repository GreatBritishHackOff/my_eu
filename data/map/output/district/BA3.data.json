It has 188 pupils (3 to 21 years), with serious and permanent SEN. In our school we are 70 professionals working hard to achieve the highest levels of autonomy and independence for our students, that allow them to participate in their social environment, in tight collaboration with their families, who are very important in this process. We also have an adapted basic qualification training programme. \r\n\r\nNecessities and aims\r\nOn one hand, our pupils\u2019 heterogeneity requires that all the professionals do a continuous learning on many different fields for attending the students,e.g.: augmentative and alternative systems of communication, intervention in conduct, sensory integration, music therapy, basal stimulation and multisensory stimulation, transition to the working life period\u2026On the other hand, the Administration is aiming to the adoption of functions as resources schools by the SEN schools, so that we support the mainstream schools of our environment for attending their students with SEN.\r\n\r\nThe learning aims of our project refer, on the one hand, to autism and specific motor disability  methodologies, teaching practices promoting creativity and innovation, music therapies, language therapies, sensory therapies, behavioral therapies... and, on the other hand, programmes for the transition to the working life period. We could get to know educational systems that promote inclusion, where SEN schools  are resource institutions, and see how they organize and manage it. Finally, this project also aims to improve the linguistic competence of our professionals, to promote the international dimension of our school and to establish synergies with other organizations for new projects in the future.\r\n\r\nProfessionals' profile \r\nFor designing and developing the project, we count with 14 professionals who carry out different functions: therapeutic pedagogy teachers, hearing and language teachers, physical education teachers, a music teacher, a community worker and a guiding psychologist.

Both institutions serve as resources schools in their context supporting the attention of students with SEN.\r\n-In Dorset (United Kingdom) 3 people will visit a school that provides education for students with autism and develops specific methodologies as: music therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy...\r\n\r\n-Finally, in J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 (Finland) we will visit 2 schools:\r\n-1preschool and primary education and another for professional training, 3 and 2 people respectively.
