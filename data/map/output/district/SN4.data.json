Promoting a 'single service for every device' vision, webinos will move the existing baseline from installed applications to services, running consistently across a wide range of connected devices, ensuring that the technologies for describing, negotiating, securing, utilizing device functionalities and adapting to context are fit for purpose. Innovations in contextual description will be broad covering but not limited to device capabilities, network access, user identity and preferences, location, behaviourally induced properties and finally the more complex issue of the users' social network context.webinos will directly address security and privacy issues as part of Quality of Service that users of web services expect. The addressed challenges comprise: how to provision and adapt security across a range of devices, services, networks as well as how individuals can gain control over the privacy aspects of their web presence regardless of the service that is being used. Context and privacy are intimately intertwined: rich context is valuable but without user controlled privacy it becomes a liability.webinos will boost the industry migration towards web-based services. webinos can back this by providing inter-operable, standardised, open source technology utilizable across domains with direct commercially exploitable value. webinos will also act as an industry catalyst to encourage collaboration and discourage fragmentation in this space.There are strong industry moves towards Internet friendly and Internet integrated offerings, and there exists a window of opportunity to place this Web OS technology on a robust open foundation that will remove economic barriers to engagement, embody policy on data privacy in concrete technology (protecting consumers and enterprise) and creating a centre of web centric expertise (benefiting technical competitiveness).", 846233.0, 11516728.0, "webinos", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_95793_983902041"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9DJ", "2 I = het Internationale team in onze school versterken en Inclusief onderwijs uitbouwen", "The Ridgeway School and Sixth Form College", 10702.0, "Saint-Lambertus 4 is a school with technical and vocational training.\r\nOur school has fifteen years of experience in internationalization. By applying for the Erasmus + program, we want to explore new opportunities for international cooperation and implement effectively;   improve the quality of internationalization in our school and improve staff professionalism by international contacts.\r\n\r\nSince 2015 every school in Flanders is legally  requestedto implement the M-decree in order to realize inclusive education. This decree is originated in an international context since Belgium adopted the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Schools in other European countries that have ratified the Convention have the same obligation. There are obvious mutual similarities between internationalization and the implementation of inclusive education. This is exactly the reason why we have chosen to help achieve both of these challenges for our school with a KA-1 application for financial assistance for an international course for three people as well as for job shadowing and peer review in other European schools for nine people.\r\n\r\nFor inclusive education the participants in the project  are: directors who are responsible for care, the care coordinators and care teachers. They made a list of questions regarding inclusive teaching and identified the target groups. They also have  prepared some cases. They want to reflect and discuss with foreign colleagues about the way they already deal with these problems  through job shadowing and peer review.  So we can benefit from their expertise. The job shadowing takes place in Dutch, German and British schools. These schools are also working on the realization of inclusive education. We can learn from them how to get there. The result of this process, which runs over two years,  is the development of a comprehensive care culture in our school, based on a long-term vision.\r\n\r\nConcerning internationalization we want the coordinator internationalization, a director and a young colleague to enroll for an international course organized by Euneos, \"How to make your school more international?\" The process of improving the quality of internationalization and eventually the realization of international internships for students in vocational and technical education will be supported by a larger group of colleagues. The various meetings and training courses that are required for this will be self-financed by our school.  This will result in a new policy plan in our school for the next ten years, a strengthened international team and the option to organize international internships. This way we want to make internationalization sustainable in our school and we guarantee that the EU-investments pay off in the long term.", "http://www.ridgewayschool.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-BE02-KA101-034607_1"], ["9DJ", "Vergleich des Umgangs mit F\u00f6rderbedarfen", "The Ridgeway School and Sixth Form College", 17244.0, "We want to compare the way that Special Educational Needs are dealt with in the participating schools in order to find out in how far the theory (the policy in place) matches practice (the way it is experienced by outsiders) and in how far we can learn from each other about how we deal with SEN.\r\n\r\nWe do this by devising instruments to (a) compare the systems/policies in theory and observe how these policies are excecuted/experienced by outsiders. Sending teachers to visit each others' schools in order to make observations and come up with ideas for themselves and the schools they visit. On return home, each school writes a report about how they experienced the way SEN is dealt with in the schools they visited so that each school in the end gets reports on how SEN is experienced and practised from other schools, together with recommendations and how things can be improved.\r\n\r\nThe final steps are: Look at which improvements the school wishes to make on the basis of their own observations abroad but also the observations made by visitors from abroad and see whether the prevailing law allows them to make these improvements.
