The modular platform will enable the design of diverse active nanosystems per diagnostic or therapeutic application as defined by their active agent compositions. For diagnostics, superior tracers will be developed for molecular MR/PET and gamma camera imaging, enabling efficient diagnosis and guided surgery respectively. Novel functionalized nano-core systems will be conjugated with semi-confluent active shell layer. Three types of shell layers will be design: (1) novel iron oxide nanoparticles as advanced MRI contrast agents and/or (2) DOTA complexes for MRI (with Gd3\\), or PET (with Ga-68), or gamma camera (with Ga-69); (3) Integrating within one tracer both iron oxide nanoparticles and DOTA-Ga-68 complexes for a sequential or simultaneous MR/PET imaging. For therapeutics, active nanosystems will be developed to deliver (1) therapeutic siRNAs or (2) anti-MP-inhibitory-scFVs. These non-classic anti-tumor drugs will be designed based on an extensive tumor degradome analysis for combining blockage of selective matrix MPs, thus preventing basic invasive and metastasis steps, with siRNA based neutralization of secondary molecular effects induced by the specific protease inhibition. Individualized degradome analysis will be developed for potential profiling of anti-MP and siRNAs based therapy per patient. To facilitate the above diagnostics and therapeutic effects, advanced tumor targeting and penetration active agents will be linked to nano-core functionalized groups, including a biocompatible PEG layer linked to tumor selective MMP substrate molecules and highly safe and potent novel somatostatin analogue peptides targeting SSTR overexpression.", 298538.0, 11482642.0, "SAVEME", null, null, null, null, "http://www.nhance-technologies.co.uk/", null, "fp7_98079_975090464"], ["0BY", "Develop and demonstrate a \u2018Mini-factory\u2019 concept for production of personalized skin care products for elderly population", "nHance Technologies Limited", "Skin alterations within ageing are significant and visible, and therefore disturbing feature in the quality of life of aged people. Economic importance of this population is dramatically growing in Europe in the last decade. Regular skin care preparations are capable to cope with ageing symptoms to some extends, i.e. wrinkles, age spots and skin dryness, but limited in protecting skin from microbial contaminations, inflammation, irritation and other ageing related manifestations. A novel flexible customized skin care approach for better skin treatment is proposed by SuperFlex, combined with cost reduction of 30%, significant reduced environmental impact and a 50% reduction in time to market.\nSuperFlex low cost and environmentally friendly concept will be a result of: 1). Low energy manufacturing of water/oil emulsions; 2) Green packaging; 3).Centralized management serving the on-site mini-factories; 4) Flexible units for on-site and by-demand production diminishing inventory needs; 5) LCA and LCC studies for platform optimization.\nSuperFlex manufacturing concept of central factory and mini-factories extensions raises a mechanism for sophisticated options analysis of products to be designed and produced at operational level. An advanced cloud based ICT platform will include: 1). Integration of the manufacturing IT system for distributed control and monitoring of the production network [Enterprise Resource Planning; Secure Information Systems; Manufacturing Execution Systems; Standard for the Exchange of Product model data]; 2). A new Cyber physical system-enabled infrastructure approach for equipment integration; 3). A decision support system for cosmetic formulations according to biomarkers profile, expert evaluation and client requirements; 4).Mobile device supported customer feedback system.\nSuperFlex achievement will be demonstrated within project period by design manufacturing and treating elderly population with personalized skincare products", 7089.0, 7515899.0, "SuperFlex", null, null, null, null, "http://www.nhance-technologies.co.uk/", null, "fp7_109254_975090464"]]}}, "outwardCode": "W13"}
