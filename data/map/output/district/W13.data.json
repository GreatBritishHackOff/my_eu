The modular platform will enable the design of diverse active nanosystems per diagnostic or therapeutic application as defined by their active agent compositions. For diagnostics, superior tracers will be developed for molecular MR/PET and gamma camera imaging, enabling efficient diagnosis and guided surgery respectively. Novel functionalized nano-core systems will be conjugated with semi-confluent active shell layer. Three types of shell layers will be design: (1) novel iron oxide nanoparticles as advanced MRI contrast agents and/or (2) DOTA complexes for MRI (with Gd3\\), or PET (with Ga-68), or gamma camera (with Ga-69); (3) Integrating within one tracer both iron oxide nanoparticles and DOTA-Ga-68 complexes for a sequential or simultaneous MR/PET imaging. For therapeutics, active nanosystems will be developed to deliver (1) therapeutic siRNAs or (2) anti-MP-inhibitory-scFVs. These non-classic anti-tumor drugs will be designed based on an extensive tumor degradome analysis for combining blockage of selective matrix MPs, thus preventing basic invasive and metastasis steps, with siRNA based neutralization of secondary molecular effects induced by the specific protease inhibition. Individualized degradome analysis will be developed for potential profiling of anti-MP and siRNAs based therapy per patient. To facilitate the above diagnostics and therapeutic effects, advanced tumor targeting and penetration active agents will be linked to nano-core functionalized groups, including a biocompatible PEG layer linked to tumor selective MMP substrate molecules and highly safe and potent novel somatostatin analogue peptides targeting SSTR overexpression.", 298538.0, 11482642.0, "SAVEME", null, null, null, null, "http://www.nhance-technologies.co.uk/", null, "fp7_98079_975090464"], ["0BY", "Develop and demonstrate a \u2018Mini-factory\u2019 concept for production of personalized skin care products for elderly population", "nHance Technologies Limited", "Skin alterations within ageing are significant and visible, and therefore disturbing feature in the quality of life of aged people. Economic importance of this population is dramatically growing in Europe in the last decade. Regular skin care preparations are capable to cope with ageing symptoms to some extends, i.e. wrinkles, age spots and skin dryness, but limited in protecting skin from microbial contaminations, inflammation, irritation and other ageing related manifestations. A novel flexible customized skin care approach for better skin treatment is proposed by SuperFlex, combined with cost reduction of 30%, significant reduced environmental impact and a 50% reduction in time to market.\nSuperFlex low cost and environmentally friendly concept will be a result of: 1). Low energy manufacturing of water/oil emulsions; 2) Green packaging; 3).Centralized management serving the on-site mini-factories; 4) Flexible units for on-site and by-demand production diminishing inventory needs; 5) LCA and LCC studies for platform optimization.\nSuperFlex manufacturing concept of central factory and mini-factories extensions raises a mechanism for sophisticated options analysis of products to be designed and produced at operational level. An advanced cloud based ICT platform will include: 1). Integration of the manufacturing IT system for distributed control and monitoring of the production network [Enterprise Resource Planning; Secure Information Systems; Manufacturing Execution Systems; Standard for the Exchange of Product model data]; 2).

Here it is stated that international activities are important for Rijn IJssel in the perspective that they contribute to improve the quality of the education for the students and support innovation topics.\r\nObjectives are:\r\n\u2022 Enlarging the amount of students involved in international activities The aim for period 2015-2020 is to establish 2285 mobilities( including 1075 for student \u2013 and 265 staff mobility in Erasmus, 800 in framework of Interreg project Learning Euregion, 25 staff will participate in Erasmus mobility organised by The Dutch Alliance and 120 mobilities will be established by own funding of the students and or the college)\r\n\u2022 Improving the quality of international mobility by applying ECVET \r\n\u2022 Providing study visits for professionals as a support of innovation topics. \r\n\r\nIn the Plan for Excellence, 2015-2020 objectives are described regarding international contacts, for the targetgroup of Excellent students. 5 Type of programs are selected:\r\n\u2022 Excellence within the Learning Euregion\r\n\u2022 Excellence on world-scale\r\n\u2022 Excellence for professionals using foreign language as instruction language\r\n\u2022 Excellence by transition programs towards foreign universities\r\n\u2022 Excellence by transition programs towards labourmarket abroad.\r\nIn het framework of Excellence it was also decided that every department will participate in 1 skills competetion.\r\n\r\nWith the current Erasmus-application we make a step in the direction of establishing the mentioned strategic objectives. In this call we describe the flows for in total 390 students ( in 2016 this was 265 students) and 50  staff ( in 2016 this was 45 staff)\r\n\r\nWe want to mention the following developments regarding the mobility of students and staff:\r\n\u2022 The interest in Germany and the German language is increasing: in call 2015 we mentioned 15 mobilities to Germany, in the call 2016 95 mobilities, and in 2017 115 students will be involved.\r\n\u2022 The workingmethod of the so-called Language-internship ( Taalstage), in which the learning of the language is applied directly to assignments in companies, is successful. It will be applied to the English, Spanish and German language.\r\nRijn IJssel aims to connect staff mobility to support innovation-topics. In call 2017 we involve 3 staff study visits (we add the description):\r\n\u2022 German as instructionlanguage, to Duisburg, Germany\r\n\u2022Susatainable gastronomy to Parma, Italy \r\n\u2022 English language as Instructionlanguage to Cheltenham, UK.\r\nIn line with the projectplan Ecvet in Rijn IJssel, departments are developing sustainable links towards Memoranda of Understanding. In 2016 we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with a Finnish and with an Austrian school. In 2017 more will follow. Sustainable cooperation with partners will confirm the quality of international activities. \r\nAside the Erasmus-mobilities, other international activities are developed and established. In this perspective exchanges are planned with German schools, supported by the Interreg project of Learning Euregion. Furthermore the first Excellence / International activities will be offered to students and staff; Germany will have a central place here. Also staff will participate in study visits organised by The Dutch Alliance and students will be visited at their practice place abroad.", "http://www.werkkit.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA116-034962_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "W13"}
