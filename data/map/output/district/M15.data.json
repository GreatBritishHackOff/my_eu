The project will develop an intelligent image acquisition and analysis system to enable more comprehensive and objective inspection of the track without the need for the  increasingly unsafe and subjective track walking inspection. The project will also develop track sub-components with self monitoring capabilities to promote timely and knowledge based intervention for maintenance and renewal, while giving greater visibility of residual life and the need for future investments. These innovative developments are directed towards increasing the effective availability of the track infrastructure, increasing the life of new or renovated asset, reducing the cost of maintenance by timely intervention based on objective measurement of degradation and thereby provide a high quality reliable service to the end user.\nThe project has two key drivers; firstly to contribute towards the realisation of a 24 x 7 railway by minimising the disruption caused by activities such as inspection, remedial and reactive maintenance, and track renewal. Secondly, the introduction of novel sensor and inspection technologies that focuses more on the monitoring of degradation through the measurement of deviation from identified benchmark data known as a \u201csignature tune\u201d.

Microbes may be thought of as biological 'micro-machines' that process information about their own state and the world around them. By sensing their environment, certain bacteria are able to move in response to chemical signals, allowing them to seek out food, for example. They can also communicate with other bacteria, by leaving chemical trails, or by directly exchanging genetic information. We focus on this latter mechanism.<br/>Parts of the internal 'program' of a bacterial cell (encoded by its genes, and the connections between them) may be 'reprogrammed' in order to persuade it to perform human-defined tasks. By introducing artificial 'circuits' made up of genetic components, we may add new behaviours or modify existing functionality within the cell. Existing examples of this include a bacterial oscillator, which causes the cells to periodically flash, and cell-based pollution detectors that can spot arsenic in drinking water. The potential for bio-engineering is huge, but the process itself is made difficult by the noisy, 'messy' nature of the underlying material. Bacteria are hard to engineer, as they rarely conform to the traditional model of a computer or device, with well-defined components laid out in a fixed design.<br/>We intend to use the inherent randomness of natural processes to our advantage, by harnessing it as a framework for biological engineering. By allowing our system to evolve, we use natural selection to build new functional biological devices. We begin with a large number of simple DNA-based components, taken from a well-understood toolbox, which may be pieced together inside the cell to form new genetic programs. A population of bacteria then absorb these components, which may (or may not) affect their behaviour. Crucially, the core of our bacterial computer is made up of engineered microbes that can detect how well they are performing, according to some external measure, such as how well they can flash in time with light pulses.The better bacteria are allowed to release their program components back into the environment in much larger numbers than the other, less impressive cells. As these 'good' components are then increasingly taken up by the population of cells, in a continual cycle, we gradually refine the internal program, until the whole population performs well. There are many potential benefits to this work, from both a biological and ICT perspective. By evolving new functional structures, we gain insight into biological systems. This, in turn, may suggest new methods for silicon-based computing, in the way that both evolution and the brain have already done.

We work locally, nationally, and internationally to provide life changing opportunities for the next generation of creative leaders, artists, and audiences.Contacting the World is a unique youth exchange project which brings young people from across Europe (and the world) together to build relationships, exchange ideas and learn more about each other\u2019s cultures.  Contact has partnered with four creative venues in Europe, who have an outstanding reputation for working with young people. Each partner organisation we are working with is committed to diversity and supporting young people from all socio-economic backgrounds to access arts and culture. 60 young people from the UK, Belgium Denmark and Portugal will engage with the project for six months. They will collaborate digitally between January \u2013 June 2016, and will then meet in Manchester for an exchange in July.During the digital collaboration process participants will be challenged to respond to monthly creative tasks which will stimulate them  think about issues pertinent to young people in Europe (voting, immigration, social and economic degeneration etc.). The participants will be encouraged to exchange ideas, debate differences in opinion and be open to learning from their peers. The exchange in Manchester will involve workshops, discussions and creative activities all themed on the topics which have come out of the exchange process. The young people involved will take the lead in planning and delivering workshops, skill sharing sessions and discussions for their peers.  The exchange is a way of uniting young people from different countries and cultures, engaging them in a unique shared experience and empowering them to use creativity to incite social change. Contacting the World creates a unique opportunity for young people who would never normally meet to interact, form relationships with, and learn from each other. The project aims to facilitate intercultural dialogue and mutual understanding through a creative process. Collaborating will improve the young people\u2019s digital skills, their ability to discuss and debate with their peers, and their ability to use creative methods to explore social issues.  Youth agency is at the heart of the project and through participation the young people will develop leadership skills, raise their aspirations and understand the power they have to improve and inspire their communities. Through this project we will create a network of creative young people in Europe who have learnt first-hand the cohesion that can be achieved through collaborating with, being open to, and respecting others. Beyond the life of the project the participants will be encouraged to develop their creative practice and use it as a positive outlet to facilitate discussion and initiate change, in this way the life of the project can continue to grow and embed itself within their communities.", "http://www.contactmcr.com", "The Manchester Young People's Theatre Limited", "erasmus_2015-2-UK01-KA105-014133_coordinator"], ["6BH", "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "THE MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY", 33919.0, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

We are entering a period of change in terms of language learning where languages are likely to become compulsory in KS4 and we are also developing new provision in KS5. We want to make sure that our languages teachers are fully equipped to meet these challenges and continue to provide outstanding MFL provision giving our pupils the best possible opportunities and continuing to promote a love of languages and interest and curiosity about other cultures. We want to encourage high uptake of languages KS5 and continue to build uptake in KS4. To do this we want to ensure that staff are fully confident in their language skills and cultural knowledge and have access to new and innovative teaching strategies and high quality resources.We want to increase the amount of target language used in the MFL classroom and increase extra-curricular provision so that learning can be reinforced. We will create new teaching materials which will incorporate more authentic resources and focus on increasing target language, reinforcing literacy concepts and promoting the value of other cultures. We want our whole school to reflect the importance of languages and other cultures, involving many different departments staff from different roles and backgrounds in promoting language learning. We want to introduce a European dimension into other subject areas and help pupils to recognise the status, value and importance of language learning and its relevance to their own lives. We want to create further international links to give our pupils a real insight into how children of their own age live in Spain and France, develop friendships with these pupils and become more open to other cultures and experiences.We want all of our staff to have access to high-quality CPD. We want support staff to increase their role and responsibility and be better equipped to respond to pupils\u2019 individual needs. MFL staff will become more flexible in their role and increase their skills and staff from other departments will add a new dimension to their teaching so all staff are better equipped for their future careers with an increased professional profile. We want staff to experience life within a different school setting and different educational system to to share their own good practice and assimilate the best practice of others.We have planned a project that will achieve our aims. We plan to send 5 members of MFL staff on one mobility each to Spain and France and also send other members of staff on Spanish/ French immersion courses over a two year period. By involving staff from many different areas of the school, we hope that this will have the maximum impact on our school\u2019s international dimension. We would like them to take part in training courses which include intensive language learning, cultural activities, teaching ideas, methodology and placement in a school. The skills acquired will mean that we are better equipped in terms of staff competence to be able to deliver languages at KS4 and KS5, and ensure that our provision remains outstanding. There will be increased use of target language both within the languages classroom and across the school as a whole leading to higher attainment. Languages, other cultures and the European dimension will become visible across our whole school and integrated into every aspect of school life. Parents will be more involved in learning and teachers will be equipped with the skills and ideas to promote cultural events resulting in improved community cohesion.Involving the whole school in this project and developing links with French and Spanish schools will lead to a more open and accepting attitude among pupils, staff, parents and the community. Our pupils will become more outward-looking and more open to new opportunities in their future lives and careers. They will become more enthusiastic about languages and other cultures.There will be more extra-curricular provision introduced as a result of improvements in staff skills and knowledge and better resources. We will also use the activities from this project to help us achieve the full ISA.The impact will spread beyond our school through dissemination and training activities. We will support other schools within our cluster and in particular we will develop training activities and resources to support our main local feeder primary schools.The impact of our project will be significant, affecting our own school and community, other schools and also our potential Spanish and French link schools. We have planned that project outputs will be usable in the long term and can be adapted by others resulting in a multiplier effect and long term, sustainable impact.", "http://www.trinityhigh.com/", "Trinity CofE High School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-024123_coordinator"], ["6BH", "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "THE MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY", 7753.0, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.
