The West African region is central for understanding desertification and degradation processes, which are already severe and widespread as a consequence of climate change and human impact. An improved understanding of the effects of desertification and degradation processes is obtained on a local to regional scale by integrating remote sensing information with sound field data on biodiversity and soil as well as socioeconomic and climate data. On this basis decision support models and tools will be developed and introduced to natural resource managers. UNDESERT also includes two very practical aspects, 1) restoration through tree plantations, which will be certified for CO2 marketing as the first restoration site in West Africa, 2) ecosystem management based on scientific data and best practices developed in close collaboration between scientists and local communities. As a demand driven project, UNDESERT activities will be implemented by employing 17 young PhD students, who will receive training to enhance future capacities to manage risks and uncertainties in the frame of future demographic and climatic changes. The scientific results will be used to combat desertification and degradation directly and will be transferred to international programs in order to contribute to the implementation of relevant international strategies, initiatives and commitments of the EU and African countries.", 160498.0, 3750442.0, "UNDESERT", null, null, null, "http://www.undesert.neri.dk/", "http://www.brdt.org", null, "fp7_94546_990426067"], ["4UX", "Protecting patients with enhanced susceptibility to infections", "Edinburgh Molecular Imaging Ltd", "The Microbes in Health and Disease research programme at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) proposes the Doctoral Training Programme PRONKJEWAIL (\u2018a real gem\u2019) in the field of hospital care and infection.

While cells in a population are often phenotypically different, most of our current analytical approaches still probe metabolism only at the population level. Because strong evidence exists that metabolic cell-to-cell heterogeneity has, for instance, disease relevance, researcher from MetaRNA will overcome this severe analytical limitation through exploiting exciting opportunities emerging from the RNA field. Such synergy potential between the metabolism and RNA research fields has until today not been exploited, because they are separated from each other in Europe and worldwide. Through consequently missing research training programs we thus lack experts with combined knowledge in metabolism and RNA. The aim of the MetaRNA proposal is therefore to establish a European Training Network (ETN) that educates specialists for academia and industry - fully trained at the interface of these two fields - in the development and application of RNA-based sensors to investigate metabolism at the single-cell level, to apply these tools for novel biotechnological applications and to provide a framework for their future use in diagnostics and therapeutics.

We educate 117 pupils and are made up of 45 staff members. We are a Scottish Attainment Challenge School and one which has been invited to take part in the Positive Action School\u2019s Edinburgh-Paris Partnership Project. Both initiatives have been pushed forward to help raise attainment in Scottish schools based in poorer socio-economic locations.\r\nWe are applying for Erasmus+ KA1 funding for 7 of our staff members to participate in two of Le Francais En Ecosse\u2019s Language Immersion Courses, one in France and the other in Spain. The group of participants planning on going on these professional development opportunities include four teaching staff and 3 non-teaching staff, all enthusiastic about language learning and teaching. \r\nOur main objective as a School is to close the current attainment gap through excellence and equity. The ways in which we believe we can do this include the following; firstly, promoting foreign language learning in the Castlebrae Cluster from an early stage, in Primary 1 to S3, as part of the Scottish 1+2 Language Initiative. The most important factor in being able to do this is ensuring we have a confident team of staff who are skilled in the teaching of a foreign language. The target languages will then be embedded across the School and reinforced through extra-curricular activities. Trained staff will foster good practice throughout the Cluster by disseminating information taken from the Le Francais En Ecosse Immersion Courses in France and Spain. Workshops, presentations, shared resources on SharePoint and development days will allow our staff to reach our cluster colleagues effectively. \r\nSecondly, we aim to increase pupil uptake of languages in the senior phase with opportunities to work with European partners on exciting new projects. We want to provide our pupils with authentic experiences and up-to-date materials that will engage and inspire.  Staff on the immersion courses will be able to exchange ideas, make links with new schools and learn how to successfully develop European projects on platforms such as E-Twinning.\r\nThirdly, we need to develop better literacy skills across the curriculum. By learning about new methodologies and language teaching strategies, staff will be better equipped to facilitate the teaching of reading, talking, listening and writing across the curriculum in a way which will support all our learners in their literacy development. \r\nLastly, we aim to increase parental engagement with the School through various channels. We intend on sharing our achievements with language learning in our Castlebrae Bulletin, in our Newsletter, in the Community news website for East Edinburgh and on our School Twitter accounts. We want to have a group of trained staff who are confident about language teaching and its benefits so that they can engage parents at events such as Parent\u2019s Evening, our Course Choice Fair and special assemblies. \r\nOn applying for this funding, we plan to arrange several \u201cworking group\u201d meetings whereby staff will prepare for the courses and discuss important next steps. We will liaise with the course provider LFEE before commencing the course and then keep a detailed learning log of our activities during our time abroad. We will use this and the materials we collate to write up an evaluation of our training once we have returned. Long-term planning and evaluating will take place after the courses have finished to measure the impact of our training on the staff, School and wider community. \r\nWe aim to share our experiences nationally at public events and on our course provider\u2019s website to inform others of the opportunities available. In doing so, we hope to share good practice and instil confidence in staff to successfully engage with Scotland\u2019s Curriculum for Excellence and its initiatives. \r\nBy attending the two courses, we hope to gradually meet our School\u2019s objectives and raise the profile of Castlebare as an institution of excellence for all. Castlebrae is committed to life-long learning and will use the links made in France and Spain to successfully create new projects with a European dimension. We would envisage future exchanges and/or excursions where pupils would get the chance to visit or volunteer abroad.
