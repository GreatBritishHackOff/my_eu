This would be accomplished through the generation of new formulations of biological control agents (BCAs) based on entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes within integrated pest management strategies. The strategies exploit synergies between BCAs which result in higher pest mortality. The proposed strategies: (1) contribute to reduced pesticide inputs in sustainable agricultural-horticultural systems, (2) offer potential savings for growers, (3) promote biodiversity and (4) offer solutions for both organic and conventional growers, thus ensuring the competitiveness of European growers. INBIOSOIL also includes risk assessment studies which should accelerate registration of new BCA products. The goals will be accomplished through 5 complementary work packages carried out by 15 European partners. The experienced, multidisciplinary team includes researchers from academia and SMEs. The project meets the challenges of globalization, climate change, and new plant protection policies leading to the production of high-quality and safer crops; it is in accordance with the scope of the Eco-Innovation call FP7-ENV-2011-3.1.9.-1.  INBIOSOIL contributes to implementation of EC regulation 1107/2009 and Directive 2009/128/EC which make it obligatory for EU Member States to implement principles of IPM with priority being given to non-chemical methods of integrated pest management. INBIOSOIL addresses direct and indirect impacts, as well as primary and secondary effects, and clearly demonstrates a substantial improvement of the sustainability performance of BCAs along the entire life cycle of the proposed solutions and considers rebound effects with respect to currently available state-of-the-art technologies or solutions.", 80138.0, 5076051.0, "INBIOSOIL", "Controlling soil dwelling pests with biocontrol agents", "Scientists are developing new methods of pest control using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes that attack insects, with the aim of reducing chemical pesticide use on European farms.", "Around 70 % of insect pests spend at least part of their lives underground, making them particularly difficult to control. Together with recent legislation in the EU that requires farmers to stop using several common pesticides, there is a need for innovative pest control strategies.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Innovative biological products for soil pest control' (http://www.inbiosoil.uni-goettingen.de (INBIOSOIL)) project is addressing this problem through biological pest control. Specifically, the project aims to develop and test new formulations of entomopathogenic fungi, nematodes and semiochemicals to target soil-dwelling insect pests. \n\nResearchers have tested six different fungi, and selected two for further testing specific formulations in an \u2018attract and kill\u2019 strategy due to their effectiveness against specific pests. They also tested 20 different semiochemicals for 'stress and kill' pest control strategies. \n\nSeveral new protocols have been developed during the project lifetime, in particular focusing on direct and indirect side-effects on beneficial (non-pest) insects. Other tests have been developed to assess the effects of these formulations in field trials. \n\nThe project team completed field trials of two different formulations - one against wireworms in potato fields, and another against western corn rootworm larvae. The field trials showed the formulations to be effective so long as fields are treated early in the season in case of wireworms and at low pest densities in case of western corn rootworms. \n\nINBIOSOIL has also analysed the socioeconomic impact of using biological control agents, demonstrating that they are a viable alternative to conventional pesticides. Further project work will focus on testing more formulations and commercialising the more successful products.", null, "http://www.neembiotech.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/149300.jpg", "fp7_103962_988272085"], ["1SX", "Technological platform to develop nutritional additives to reduce methane emissions from ruminants", "Neem Biotech Ltd", "This proposal aims to provide a technological platform for SME\u2019s to develop and progress further knowledge on the successful use of nutritional additives to reduce methane (CH4) emissions from ruminants: SMEthane. CH4 is the second most important greenhouse gas, after CO2. At a global scale, livestock farming contributes up to 18% of total greenhouse gas emissions. The inhibition of CH4 formation by ruminants has long been an objective of ruminant nutritionists, but a number of barriers to the development of novel dietary additives have been identified. SMEthane is designed to remove the restriction that SME\u2019s face in successfully developing and marketing novel compounds, in particular plant extracts. We will establish research and development platforms to allow SME\u2019s to determine: the means of delivery of such compounds in the diet, knowledge of the dose response curve for such compounds under different production systems, the persistence of the inhibitory effect of such compounds on CH4 production over long periods of time and the potential \u2018side effects\u2019 such as change in flavour of the final animal product. SMEthane Research Consortium combines the capabilities of five major research and educational organizations from 4 European countries plus 6 enterprises with long experience in developing nutritional additives. The governance structure of the project has been established to ensure effective direction and management that maximizes the expertise and facilities available at each RTD to better meet SMEs\u2019 needs. Training and dissemination plan considered within SMEthane aim to provide training for the SME sector and its customer through different workshops based in key areas relevant to the development and usage of novel dietary additives to decrease CH4 emissions.

CH4 is the second most important GHG produced mainly from fermentation in the digestive tract of herbivorous animals.\n\nFor a long time, ruminant nutritionists have tried to reduce CH4 formation by developing novel dietary additives, such as plant extracts. However, a number of barriers to the development and marketing of additives exist, especially where SMEs are involved.\n\nThe 'Technological platform to develop nutritional additives to reduce methane emissions from ruminants' (SMETHANE) project aimed at addressing the challenges faced by SMEs in this area. The consortium consisted of five research and educational organisations from four European countries, as well as six enterprises with expertise in developing nutritional additives.\n\nOne aim of the project was to look at the stability of active molecules in plant extracts. Researchers incorporated the extracts into a feed meal and pelleted diet. They found that the stability of the molecules was compromised at higher temperatures, and during the pelleting process even at low temperatures.\n\nIn vitro tests showed that the success of five compounds in reducing CH4 production depended on their concentrations and animal size. Certain concentrations affected volatile fatty acid (VFA) production that plays a crucial role in energy supply to the ruminants.\n\nIn vivo tests showed no direct correlation to in vitro tests, particularly in required doses, with intermediate doses being more effective in in vivo trials. In addition, the team found that the effectiveness of additives and doses differed between small and large ruminants.\n\nResearchers also used farm trials to determine the effect of the additives on productivity and product quality. One finding here was that essential oils resulted in a significant increase in milk production and daily weight gain.\n\nBy the end of the project, the team had much data on the effectiveness of nutritional additives in dairy and beef cattle, as well as small ruminants. This should aid the successful production, marketing and sales of the compounds by the involved SMEs.", null, "http://www.neembiotech.com", "/docs/results/images/2013-10/56383.jpg", "fp7_97038_988272085"], ["1SX", "Valorisation of mushroom agrowastes to obtain high value products", "Neem Biotech Ltd", "The project aims at the valorization of agricultural residues coming from mushroom (Agaricus Bisporus) farming residues as a case to set up new cascading possibilities using innovative procedures to extract high value bio-based additives (antioxidants, antimicrobials, proteins), convert lipids into bioplasticizers and polysaccharides (glucans and fermentable sugars) into biopolymers using remaining side streams in substrates to close the agricultural cycle by composting and/or biogas synthesis. The funguschain project will demonstrate its industrial viability by building a new biorefinery that will use cost-effective extraction technologies (MAE and HWPE) revalorizing more than 65% of waste into valuable additives.\n\nThese additives will be incorporated into high added value products and industrially validated towards 3 key value chains in the European economy (food, cleaning and plastic sectors). Industrial lines from end-users will be modified and adapted to the developed products. These products are: food supplements for elderlies, cleaning products, novel biobased thermoplastic masterbatches, bioplasticizers and industrial film products (thin bags and gloves <15 microns, partially recycled thick bags >50 microns and mulching).\n\nA business strategy to valorise the products in a collaborative manner will be designed, leading to safe, sustainable, economically viable and attractive products acceptable to consumers.
