This condition contributes to morbidity and loss of Quality of Life (QoL) of Diabetes Mellitus sufferers, most especially the elderly.  We propose to develop a unit prototype, based on our proprietary pulsating negative pressure technology that can be used at home or nursing homes, for treatment of DFUs, and their prevention.\n\nOver 55Mn Europeans between 20 and 79 years of age are currently suffering from diabetes; 55% above 60 years old. The incidence of diabetes is expected to grow as the population ages. Diabetes sufferers have a 12 to 25% lifetime risk of developing a DFU. Over 8Mn Europeans coudl be suffering from DFU in their lifetime. A morbid display of DFU is the lower limb amputation; 85% of the amputations in diabetes sufferers are reported after unsuccessful DFU treatment this means between 290,000 and 450,000 amputations per year, an annual cost  in the order of \u20ac2 \u2013 2.5Bn.\n\nWe believe that introducing PreventDFU technology for home and nursing home use for the primary purpose of DFU prophylaxis during sleeping hours and for the secondary purpose of assistive therapy of mild DFUs may reduce DFU incidence in the elderly and prevent a significant number of DFU-related toe, foot and leg amputations. If Prevent DFU technology can only help 5% of the DFU sufferers, this would mean substantial QoL improvement for over 400,000 Europeans and over 2 Mn sufferers worldwide, substantially reduce associated healthcare costs and give a considerable boost to the European Medical Device Manufacturing, Nursing and Assisted Living sectors. PreventDFU technology could benefit elderly pressure ulcer (PU) suffers by providing timely prophylaxis by increasing the blood flow in the legs; it has been reported that 95% of all pressure ulcers occur in the lower part of the body while 70% of those occur in persons over 65 years of age.", 13340.0, 1035355.0, "PreventDFU", "Device for diabetic foot ulcers", "Over 55\u00a0million Europeans suffer from diabetes, and 8\u00a0million of these patientsare at risk of developing a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU).

A prophylactic device prototype called FlowOxTM will be developed to prevent or treat DFUs for use in homes or nursing homes. This device will modify existing pulsating negative pressure technology and use it to increase blood flow and prevent wound formation or stimulate healing at the ulcer site. \n\nScientists also worked on determining the optimal means of restoring blood flow in the lower extremities or limbs of diabetic patients using pulsating negative pressure. For this purpose, the prospective patient cohort will include diabetic or non-diabetic patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease along with healthy subjects. Requisite ethical approvals for the study were obtained successfully and pilot experiments have already started. Study outcomes will help determine optimal treatment protocols and negative pressure settings. \n\nPREVENTDFU scientists completed a comprehensive literature review encompassing the medical and biomechanical aspects of the device. Also, user trials were conducted to gain their perspective on DFU treatment requirements and issues with orthoses, externally applied devices used to modify the structural characteristics of the neuromuscular and skeletal system. \n\nBased on those for ankle foot, design specifications were incorporated into the principal design and a preliminary risk analysis carried out. This resulted in the manufacture and testing of wearable leg-and-foot chamber prototypes to further optimise design. In parallel, work is ongoing to develop and optimise the other device components such as the control system, pump, valves, user interface, power supply, pressure sensor, data logging system and housing. \n\nUltimately, the FlowOxTM device will improve the quality of life of diabetic patients by reducing their risk for DFU-related toe, foot and leg amputations.

This course will be fully completed and complemented by the immersion course in Spain.  As a follow-up the teachers will confidently implement and teach Spanish in accordance with the four capacities contained within the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence guidelines.\r\nAlso, they will ultimately share their learning with others whom they will train as future facilitators of Spanish to pupils throughout the school.  The techniques learned and used will be applied to other modern languages, such as French, since our pupils will be learning both languages.  This will include both teaching the language, culture and geography and historical aspects of Spain/France.  A variety of methodologies and strategies will be used and in particular the use of ICT to enhance the learning and teaching of Spanish.  We will continue to use the resources on the platform provided by LFEE which will ensure our use of ICT with the pupils.  We will use the methodology of active learning to involve and immerse our pupils in the language of Spanish.  This will involve us making use of games and songs, especially in the early stages of primary school where we will concentrate on the talking and listening of the modern language.  As our pupils become more confident we will ensure that they are using the four language skills of talking, listening, reading and writing.  We will also follow the guidelines issued by Education Scotland that outlines exactly what material the pupils should be learning at each primary stage of school.  At present Education Scotland has got P1 stage ready and is working on the other stages of primary school.  Doing all of this will ensure that Spanish is embedded into the life of our school.  Included in this are the parents who will be informed and given the opportunity to discover more about their child's learning in this area.  At the same time, we intend to share our knowledge and good practice with other cluster schools in our network, other schools in Scotland via Education Scotland website and European colleagues via links established on immersion course and platform.", "http://www.stjohnthebaptistprimary.org.uk", "St John the Baptist Primary", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-001998_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["8BB", "NHS LANARKSHIRE*LANARKSHIRE HEALTHBOARD", 187196.0, "Third programme for the Union's action in the field of health (2014-2020) (17.03.01)", "fts_2016_11212", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "G71"}
