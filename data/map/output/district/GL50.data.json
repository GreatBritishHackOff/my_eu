These circumstances cause extensive problems for policy makers, institutions and NGOs, to build up efficient and sustainable open data strategies. Further, identifying gaps in and opportunities for open data publishing is almost impossible. Finally, on a pan-European level there is a lack of analysis on this topic which hinders the large-scale reuse of open data.OpenDataMonitor provides the possibility to gain an overview of available open data resources and undertake analysis and visualisation of existing data catalogues using innovative technologies. By creating a highly extensible and customizable harvesting framework, metadata from diverse open data sources will be collected. Through harmonization of the harvested metadata, the gathered information can be structured and processed. Scalable analytical and visualisation methods will allow the end users to learn more about the composition of regional, national or pan-European open data repositories. For example the aggregation of catalogues of one region or country can be easily visualised to draw an exact picture of the open data situation and allow comparison to other areas. Analysing and visualising metadata will reveal hidden potential and essential insights from existing resources and identify gaps where additional open data are needed.To guarantee the availability, usage and reuse of the created plugins and components during the OpenDataMonitor project, established open source software like CKAN will be adopted and extended.

This makes chip design enormously complex and imposes  a large effort for the programmers to develop their applications. For this reason, new and more efficient tools for software development are needed to ensure software productivity and time to market of new applications. In particular, the automation of the software design process starting from high level models all-the-way down to a customized and implementation on specific architectures is a key factor to increase programmer productivity.<br/>The ToucHMore project will develop software tools that facilitate energy efficient and robust software for Heterogeneous Multicore Systems (HeMCS) with the goal to reduce the time-to-market in the design of such systems by at least 15%, as well as the cost of software design through the automation process by 20%.<br/>In more detail, the center of the methodology is the high level modeling language (UML/SysML) that will be used to describe the target platform and application. High level modelling allows an architectural independent description of the application and for this reason it is prone to customization for different architectural templates.  In ToucHMore, customization will be performed in an automated way through automated generation of parallel code for multicore tiles and the required mechanisms to manage reconfigurable DSPs/accelerators.In addition, the ToucHMore tool-chain customization environment will focus on energy efficiency and robustness of the generated code, where the uncertainties due to fabrications of transistors in nanometer technologies will be hidden, thus mitigating their impact in terms of energy and performance. From a research perspective, ToucHMore is a pioneering project from the perspective of taking a pragmatic approach to bring variability issues into the software design flow.

This can lead to inaccuracies, misinformation and incomplete data.\n\nTo address the complexity of food chains, the EU-funded http://www.glamur.eu/ (GLAMUR) (Global and local food chain assessment: A multidimensional performance-based approach) project is integrating the economic, social, environmental, health and ethical dimensions associated with the production and consumption of food into comprehensive decision-making tools. The tools will examine, assess and compare global and local food chains, ultimately turning the knowledge gained into practice.\n\nDuring the first reporting period, a systematic review explained how the performance of food chains is communicated in the public, scientific, market and policy domains. It also considered how such performance is measured in science literature. This led to a repository of local and global food performance across a range of criteria, including real costs and benefits, resilience and food security. As sustainability is a multidimensional concept, measurement of food chain performance aims to capture this multidimensionality.\n\nA database has been designed and developed that will contain all information on food chain performance. A policy report identifying the key policies that influence local and global food chains and several critical points that may affect their performance was delivered.\n\nThree dozen case studies covering pork, dairy, fruits and vegetables, wine and grains are underway. The comparison and contrast of various food chains has also begun, with the ultimate aim to support actors in their decision making processes.\n\nGLAMUR is taking a holistic approach to the intricacies of food chains.

They are disconnected and/or marginalized from nature, society, politics and economics. At the same time, it is the young generation who will have to address and adapt to the unfolding consequences in the future. What they need is empowerment and inspiration to craft meaningful responses. A better vision on our own personal and professional journey \u2013 where we are coming from and where we are headed, as well as accepting and claiming responseAbility for our own and societal development is called for.More than ever before it\u2019s necessary that the current generation of young people is able to improve the society of tomorrow. The greatest contribution they can make is to find and develop their own individual response based on their passions, talents and potential. A pre-condition for this is to re-connect to our concerns about the world, and the emotions and feelings that arise when we do so. Change makers need to ground their actions in acceptance, gratitude, hope and compassion in order develop responses that are powerful, appropriate and resourceful. With this training course we create a space for building that responseAbility through reflection on our concerns and passions as well as becoming more conscious of our personal learning process. We believe that gaining a deeper understanding of who we are and what we can do for others is an empowering process which can lead to positive changes for the future of society.Moreover it is necessary that youth workers know how they can support young people in facing their own challenges and thereby continue to grow as a person. After the training, participants will be able to lead young people in their organisations and communities through a personal learning journey to craft and find powerful and meaningful responses to the sustainability challenges of the 21st century.The objectives are : \u2022 to explore the concepts of responseAbility, positive change and active hope \u2022 to explore acceptance, gratitude, hope and compassion in order to improve our abilities to develop our responses \u2022 to raise awareness of our identity through reflecting on our challenges, concerns, talents and passions \u2022 to encourage a learning mindset which realizes that everything is possible\u2022 to stimulate the creativity, vulnerability, confidence and resilience of the participants\u2022 to encourage and serve the participants in planning their learning process also after the training course and also implement with their target groups\u2022 to learn more about the Erasmus+ program and its actions, and Youth pass as a tool of recognition of the key competences", "http://www.eauc.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-3-DE04-KA105-013366_8"], ["2RH", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE LBG", 9956.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.glos.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE LBG", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-012708_coordinator"], ["1HX", "Sprachcoaching im Englischunterricht der Primarstufe mit Job-Shadowing als Erfahrungserweiterung in integrative Formen des Unterrichts.", "English and Vocational Academy (EVA) Ltd", 50467.0, "Since 2004 English has been an integral part of foreign language learning in primary education in the federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.

In addition, there is the added value of the intercultural aspect.Further added-value and the sustainability of the project lie in the fact that the personal learning advancement (language fluency) is directly coupled with the intercultural classroom experience (Job-shadowing) and, as such, can find immediate application in the everyday classroom scenario.

Here it is stated that international activities are important for Rijn IJssel in the perspective that they contribute to improve the quality of the education for the students and support innovation topics.\r\nObjectives are:\r\n\u2022 Enlarging the amount of students involved in international activities The aim for period 2015-2020 is to establish 2285 mobilities( including 1075 for student \u2013 and 265 staff mobility in Erasmus, 800 in framework of Interreg project Learning Euregion, 25 staff will participate in Erasmus mobility organised by The Dutch Alliance and 120 mobilities will be established by own funding of the students and or the college)\r\n\u2022 Improving the quality of international mobility by applying ECVET \r\n\u2022 Providing study visits for professionals as a support of innovation topics. \r\n\r\nIn the Plan for Excellence, 2015-2020 objectives are described regarding international contacts, for the targetgroup of Excellent students. 5 Type of programs are selected:\r\n\u2022 Excellence within the Learning Euregion\r\n\u2022 Excellence on world-scale\r\n\u2022 Excellence for professionals using foreign language as instruction language\r\n\u2022 Excellence by transition programs towards foreign universities\r\n\u2022 Excellence by transition programs towards labourmarket abroad.\r\nIn het framework of Excellence it was also decided that every department will participate in 1 skills competetion.\r\n\r\nWith the current Erasmus-application we make a step in the direction of establishing the mentioned strategic objectives. In this call we describe the flows for in total 390 students ( in 2016 this was 265 students) and 50  staff ( in 2016 this was 45 staff)\r\n\r\nWe want to mention the following developments regarding the mobility of students and staff:\r\n\u2022 The interest in Germany and the German language is increasing: in call 2015 we mentioned 15 mobilities to Germany, in the call 2016 95 mobilities, and in 2017 115 students will be involved.\r\n\u2022 The workingmethod of the so-called Language-internship ( Taalstage), in which the learning of the language is applied directly to assignments in companies, is successful. It will be applied to the English, Spanish and German language.\r\nRijn IJssel aims to connect staff mobility to support innovation-topics. In call 2017 we involve 3 staff study visits (we add the description):\r\n\u2022 German as instructionlanguage, to Duisburg, Germany\r\n\u2022Susatainable gastronomy to Parma, Italy \r\n\u2022 English language as Instructionlanguage to Cheltenham, UK.\r\nIn line with the projectplan Ecvet in Rijn IJssel, departments are developing sustainable links towards Memoranda of Understanding. In 2016 we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with a Finnish and with an Austrian school. In 2017 more will follow. Sustainable cooperation with partners will confirm the quality of international activities. \r\nAside the Erasmus-mobilities, other international activities are developed and established. In this perspective exchanges are planned with German schools, supported by the Interreg project of Learning Euregion. Furthermore the first Excellence / International activities will be offered to students and staff; Germany will have a central place here. Also staff will participate in study visits organised by The Dutch Alliance and students will be visited at their practice place abroad.", "http://www.inlingua-cheltenham.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA116-034962_8"], ["1HX", "ALTERNANZA SCUOLA LAVORO NEI LICEI", "English and Vocational Academy (EVA) Ltd", 76302.0, "The USR (the School Regional Office) of the Marche Region has always been promoting policies of innovation, quality and internationalization for the school within the territory of the Marche Region (North-East of Italy).\r\n\r\nFollowing the National reform, the USR Marche as a consortium coordinator for this project and through cooperation with local lyceums, responded to such needs of training and educational system in Italy by introducing the programme called \u201cAlternanza Scuola Lavoro\u201d engaging all students from Italian Schools to complete a number of working hours, in the form of internship, before the students complete their study path and obtaining their high-school diploma.  This restructuring initiative is now compulsory even for Lyceums.\r\n\r\nWork-based learning integration is one of the pillars of the \u201cEurope 2020\u201d strategy and thus also at European Level, such type of integration of practical training can support a wealthy and inclusive growth of the participants, students and future workers. \r\n\r\nThese are the project\u2019s specific objectives:\r\n1) Improve the training curriculum of the Lyceums of the Marche Region through the support of the European and International values;\r\n2) Accelerate and strengthen an innovative approach of pedagogical and educational methodologies;\r\n3) Consolidate project management through the acquired competences;\r\n4) Improve the skills and competences of the training staff and of the procedures related to the programme of \u201cAlternanza Scuola Lavoro\u201d;\r\n5) Promote international mobilities for personnel of schools based in Italy;\r\n6) Acquire more knowledge in the field of professional and practical training; \r\n7) Support the teachers in the acquisition of stronger relational competences;\r\n8) Promote the idea of a innovative teaching methodology; \r\n9) Contribute to a better strategy in the evaluation and recognition of the mobility abroad especially for the programmes of \u201cAlternanza Scuola Lavoro\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s activities involve the school staff of 20 different lyceums based in the Marche Region. The mobility lasts one week and these are the hosting countries: \r\n- Germany;\r\n- Ireland; \r\n- Denmark;\r\n- Malta;\r\n- United Kingdom;\r\n- Holland. \r\n\r\nThe Consortium supports a programme which is mainly a job-shadowing activity hosted by other partner schools abroad or by other related entities, that have a long experience in the management of Work-Based Learning paths. \r\n\r\nThese are the expected project\u2019s results: \r\nFor Project\u2019s Participants: \r\n- Acquire new teaching methodologies;\r\n- Improve the management and planning of paths for Work-Based Learning (\u201cAlternanza Scuola Lavoro\u201d Programme);\r\n- Educate to the values of work including values of equity, freedom, solidarity and social cooperation;\r\n- Better management of classes where there is the presence of students from different background and culture (processes of integration and social inclusion);\r\n- Development of new teaching methods with the inclusion of project-based learning and of Work-Based learning;\r\n- Integration of new teaching tools such as webquest and eTwinning;\r\n- Increase the foreign language skills and competence especially the English language;\r\n- Increase the knowledge of other European countries\u2019 teaching methodologies and strategies;\r\n- Increase cooperation with the world of work and a major comprehension of the market\u2019s needs; \r\n- Improve the cooperation of the teaching staff with their colleagues who take care of paths such as the Work-Based Learning programmes; \r\n- Get acquainted with the procedures for a better evaluation and recognition of the competences acquired. \r\n\r\nSchools involved with this project will be supported by acquiring a better connection with the hosting companies from the different professional sectors regarding the programme of \u201cAlternanza Scuola Lavoro\u201d. \r\nFurthermore, schools will acquire a better knowledge of possible cooperation and exchanges for their students at European and International levels. \r\nThe Schoolteachers in this regard, will be more satisfied and knowledgeable about the Work-Based Learning programmes and will increase also the number of students, more reliance from families, other students and also stakeholders.", "http://www.inlingua-cheltenham.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT02-KA101-047357_6"], ["2RH", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE LBG", 49029.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.glos.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE LBG", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-047056_coordinator"], ["1HX", "Auslandspraktika, internationale Auszubildendenprojekte und Lehrerausbildungen des RBZ Wirtschaft .

Due to the fact that some students are under age 18, a teacher needs to accompany them. In addition, among the applicants this year is a young single mother asking for extra assistance concerning child custody. \r\nFurthermore we are applying for funding on our existing partnerships with France and Hungary in our educational cooperations. Annually students at our vocational school (apprentices/dual system) and students trained to be commercial assistants do work placements in Brest/France or Szeged/Hungary. From now on a further education course on the field of business (B.A.), run at our school, is interested in sending their students abroad to gain more work experience internationally and is applying for three mobilities.\r\nSince our last application we have been able to realize some of our objectives:\r\nIn order to enhance the methodology and language skills among our staff and accordingly to our internationalisation strategy we are planning to send staff abroad on training purposes, i.e. particularly to Great Britain and France. Teacher training courses offered in Montpellier/France and Bournemouth as well as Cheltenham/GB are suitable for the needs required by our staff.\r\nCurrently we are running an exchange programme with our new partner in Great Britain, the South Devon College. Furthermore, we carried out a successful school project with a new partner school in Norway, the Gj\u00f8vik videreg\u00e5ende skole. This project is supported by the federal state Schleswig-Holstein and the Norwegian region Oppland. Our plan is to arrange an Erasmus- KA2 application. We are also in close contact with one another in terms of teacher training.\r\nAll in all, our internationalisation strategy is proving valid, even better than expected. Regular network meetings took place at our school in the past months . The German National Agency NABIBB and the federal Ministry of Justice, Europe, Consumer Protection and Gender Equality of Schleswig-Holstein were among the organisors. In March 2018 we are having another network meeting. Recently, we have received a number of enquiries for new partnerships, e.g. from Greece, Denmark and Italy.\r\nAs regards the resources at our school this quick development comes along with some problematic issues. As the number of students is decreasing, the number of additional paid working hours is cut while the administrational work is increasing. Just through a determined and large team of teachers interested in European issues we are able to tackle matters. Whether we remain successful in finding colleagues willing to participate might turn into a problem. This is the reason why courses focussing on issues such as new resources and happiness in lessons might help find and convince them to participate.\r\nWhereas teacher training courses in GB and France enhance our language teachers` teaching competences, teacher training courses provided in Finland help develop overall innovative ideas to be implemented at our school. We pursue the idea to send staff regularly, if these courses will be evaluated positively.\r\nThe teacher training programme is varied and as such meets the requirements of our school.", "http://www.inlingua-cheltenham.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA116-004940_2"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["2RH", "The Core Growth Hub Service", "University of Gloucestershire", "Addresses challenges in business support accross Gloucestershire.
