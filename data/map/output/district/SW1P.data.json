Emerging chemical and microbiological risks will be identified from new types and sources of animal feed materials and new production processes. These will direct the development of rapid, low cost screening tests to enable high quality and safety standards to be met.

The team has set out to provide such an assurance better, faster and more economically.\n\nFirst, the QSAFFE project team is developing and implementing cost-effective tests that can detect contamination incidents involving animal feed very early, before farm animals have consumed anytainted feed. Secondly, the project is aiming to ensure that there are no fraudulent practices taking placein the feed supply chain.\n\nThe project is also devoting significanteffort to predict emerging risks in the feed supply chain as a result of changes in global economics and climate change.

Therefore the approach adopted is to include both an EU-wide application of existing concepts and develop and experiment with new concepts. This will be carried out within an overall coherent structural framework designed to address the key issues of productivity and value for money. The indicators are divided into two broad areas, market services, whose performance are crucial for raising growth in the EU relative to its competitors, and non-market services, mostly government run, where it is important that tax-payers can assess how far public spending is effective, as well as their contribution to the economy. For market services the project will construct indicators that describe trends in growth and productivity in service sectors and indicators that are useful in analysing determinants of growth, such as innovation, ICT, intangible capital, competitive environment and foreign presence. In view of the global financial crisis, financial services will be covered in greater detail with new output measures developed and applied to a large set of EU countries. For non-market services much of the analysis will focus on indicators for health and education where significant new research is required on both the conceptual framework and practical implementation.

We have formulated 7 key questions: 1) How can we avoid a new BSE outbreak, or other possible future prion infection of livestock? 2) Why did decontamination of meat and bone meal fail; is there an effective way to decontaminate feedstuffs, soil etc? 3) What is the risk of humans being infected with each of the different prion strains known thus far? 4) Which are the best strategies to implement feasible prion eradication programs? 5) How can we develop a pre-clinical prion blood test? 6) How can we identify human cases with potential secondary transmission? And 7) What is the origin of atypical human CJD cases? We will search for decisive data on the structure of PrPSc, the molecular basis of strains and species barriers, the mechanism of prion conversion, the cell biology of PrPSc, the function of PrPC, and the mechanisms of PrP-associated pathology. This information will be translated into a better estimation of current exposure risk to humans from TSE, evaluation of current intervention strategies, and development of improved decontamination techniques and prion tests. With all this, we will be able to respond to the questions formulated and thus advise the EC on TSE policy for the protection of European consumers..", 36795.0, 6686523.0, "PRIORITY", "Protection from prions", "Proteins in general are good for us; but mis-folded proteins known as prions that caused the infectious mad cow disease are a different story.

Extensive research is required to prevent or deal with emergence of diseases due to prion infection.\n\nFunded under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), the PRIORITY project sought to protect Europe's food chain by improving our understanding of prions. The EU-backed project focused on four areas related to prions: structure and function, detection, transmission and their epidemiology.\n\nTo investigate the structure of different prions, PRIORITY used cryo-electron microscopy and tomography, as well as various biochemical approaches. The project also studied how prions spread within an organism (including the brain) and the infectivity dynamics of blood and milk. Researchers found that prions spread from exposure site to brain via accumulation in follicular dendritic cells (FDCs).\n\nPRIORITY confirmed that the ban on meat and bone meal (MBM) was the most significant factor supporting the containment of BSE, and recommended continuing the ban.

While firms undoubtedly are at the centre of innovation and productivity growth, their activities are hard to analyse empirically.

The EU-funded project 'Intangible capital and innovations: Drivers of growth and location in the EU' (INNODRIVE) investigated the capacity of intangible capital to generate growth at corporate and national levels. It defined intangibles to include innovative property, scientific and non-scientific research and development (R&D), licences or patents, software, spending on reputation (advertising), firm-specific training and organisational capital. \n\nthe study led to an important set of findings related to the impact of intangibles on the economy. To illustrate, the project team found that gross domestic product (GDP) in the EU was 5.5 % higher after including all intangible investments. This meant that ignoring intangibles in national accounts implied an underestimation of GDP by 5.5 %, as well as an underestimation of labour productivity growth by 10\u201320 %.\n\nin addition, the project team developed new data on intangibles at the company level using expenditure and performance-based estimates of intangible capital. This has yielded a much clearer picture of intangible assets, narrowing the notable gap between market values and book values of assets. The project shows that company-level organisational capital produced by management and marketing usually exceeds company\u2019s own R&D effort. \n\nnoting that innovation is much more than R&D, the project emphasised how investment in intangibles such as a firm's competencies including organisational investment reflect a more accurate measure of innovation intensity. In this sense, a key message emerging from the project is that the diversity of intangible capital should be emphasised so that policies do not promote R&D investment alone.\n\nthe project team then looked at intangibles in specific EU countries including Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, France, Hungary, Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It also studied Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain (PIGS), whose investment policies notably rely more on tangible than on intangible investments.

A relevant problem is the existence of infected wildlife; the best known examples are the European badger (Meles meles) in UK and the Republic of Ireland, and the wild boar (Sus scrofa) in Spain. Besides this fact, there is only a limited knowledge about other potential underlying causes, such as (1) the real contribution of cattle-to-cattle transmission at the same area (neighbouring farms and communal pastures) or after movement of animals; (2) the role played in the epidemiology by other domestic animals, or (3) the effect of interferences in the diagnosis tests.

Exposure to chemicals added to food, such as flavour enhancers and contact with packaging, have become the focus of food safety research among European scientists.\n\nHowever, according to the research project 'Flavours, additives and food contact material exposure task' (FACET), bottlenecks exist in exposure assessment. These include access to national food consumption databases, difficulty with food categorisation, limited knowledge on food chemical occurrence, and lack of data on food chemical concentration and packaging substances. The 20-partner FACET project is tackling these shortcomings through the creation of a food chemical exposure surveillance system, focusing on flavourings, food additives and food contact materials.\n\nThe consortium, made up of academia, industry, SMEs and national governmental agencies, is working on a database of targeted food chemical concentrations and their intake, as well as creating publicly available software with the data already integrated to help with exposure risk modelling.\n\nWork to date on the food additives side has focused on evaluating high-risk candidates (where the theoretical estimated intake is higher than the acceptable daily intake). But it will also illustrate different situations for additives authorised in the EU for future exposure assessments. Linking these additives with foods consumed in representative regions of the EU, and with concentration data is underway, according to the FACET team.\n\nAs for flavourings, data for both added and natural substances is being analysed for a limited number of target substances. Classification of foods according to a hierarchical tiered system, which meets the needs of the three chemical groups, has been completed, the consortium confirms. Database managers from eight countries (France, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Finland and the UK) are coding their national consumption surveys according to this tiered system.\n\nA targeted survey of the occurrence of food additives, flavourings and food contact materials available in each of the eight countries is nearing the end of the planning phase (minimum of 3 000 products). A database for logging information contained on these product labels is well underway, say the researchers. And cluster analysis of consumption patterns in EU countries has been completed using available data. This technique provides a method for identifying countries with similar food consumption profiles.\n\nDevelopment of the exposure model is well advanced, including an investigation of techniques to improve the treatment of uncertainty in the modelling. The first prototype of the software was released in January 2010, and the feedback collected will guide subsequent versions.
