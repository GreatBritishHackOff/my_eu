After building in the results of two earlier Erasmus+ projects, there are still plenty of areas of education to be improved, professional challenges to face, which is impossible without a dedicated, well-prepared and motivated teaching staff. As the number of foreign students enrolling at our school is increasing, it is vital to get to know the latest and the most state of the art European methods and good practices, to integrate them into our every day work so that all the cultural, educational and language gaps could be bridged. The permanent language improvement of colleagues teaching non-bilingual classes to acquire confidence in their language use is essential to both support their students\u2019 education and communicate with parents efficiently. There is also a growing demand on higher level German language studies at our school, therefore, one of our German language teachers will also take part in a teacher development course in Germany.\r\nJob shadowing in support of theoretical professional development courses has become an important part of our project this year.  It is essential to study the diverse educational systems of Europe in depth and get an insight into their good practices to gain invaluable first-hand experience after theoretical establishment, in a helpful English speaking environment. \r\nOur Polish project partner is a primary school in Warsaw, excelling at teaching English at a high level and actively collaborating with our primary teachers in an eTwinning project this year. Our colleagues will get an insight into the education of children with learning and behavioural difficulties as well as into the methodology of teaching English from an early age. The knowledge gained during this visit can be fully applied in their everyday work in the classroom and can satisfy the parents\u2019 professional demands and priorities as well.\r\nIn the previous academic year our secondary school students carried out a successful online project with the pupils of our partner school in Folkestone, England. One of the aims of the job shadowing activity there is to get acquainted with high level (A-level) education of natural sciences in Britain. The experiences gained can be used to improve the project orientated learning, deal with talented students and facilitate the innovative use of modern IT tools and methods. \r\nFocusing on individual needs of gifted students is one of the strengths of the partner school. The applied methods and good practices can be used to facilitate both our language teaching and the preparation of our students for higher education. One of our colleagues teaching English language and British Civilization gets motivating, inspiring and cooperative teaching ideas from them.\r\nThe improvement of digital competences can be regarded as one of the major challenges of our changing world that all of us need to face, especially those who participate or plan to participate in eTwinning projects. Some colleagues will take part in professional development courses which will promote a better understanding of these areas.\r\nThe decreased motivation of students and their higher threshold of response are other challenges of the digital world. For modern bilingual and science education, it is vital to renew the motivational tools of our secondary school colleagues by their participation in European teacher development courses.   \r\nThroughout our 2017 Erasmus+ project 11 colleagues take part in different mobilities. The job shadowing activities have 4 participants, 2 teachers in Poland and 2 in the UK. The four primary and seven secondary teachers involved represent the whole school, covering the most important areas of the profile of our institution.  As a result of the courses and job shadowing activities, the repertoire of the school\u2019s good practices will be enriched. The experiences and fresh inspiration obtained will be shared with students and parents during everyday work and colleagues and the wider pedagogical environment on dissemination events.\r\nBoth the preparation and implementation phase of the project and our multiplicator role during dissemination have positive impacts on collegiality and the revival of our school life. The increasing motivation of teachers and students makes the teaching process more effective and enjoyable, leads to obtaining more universal knowledge and achieving better results.
