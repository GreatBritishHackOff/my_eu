The indicators of adults participation in continuous education has decreased from 4,5% in 2012 to 3,5% in 2015 and is much below the EU avarage-10.7%. This participation is usually the lowest among people who especially need  their skills development, i.e.  peopla with elementary education, people over 50 years old and people aho are not active on the job market.\r\nIt is  important to develop adult education offer to meet the needs of adults of disadvantaged groups or those  with low key competencies, especially basic competencies (e.g. reading, writing,  mathematical reasoning, using ICT),\r\nThis decrease has made the CKU in Toru\u0144 look for new solutions for adults continuous education  which will help to improve the quality and efficiency of adult education in kujavian-pomerianian region.

The host institutions have prepared and interesting programme of the methodological course in andragogy, which will be run during mobilities in local schools for adults. 16 teachers of secondary school for adults from CKU will participate in the courses.Two groups of 8 people will take part in methodological courses in andragogy : the first one in Barcelos in Portugal, the second one in Plymouth in the UK. This will improve professional competencies of teachers connected with teaching adults, using ICT and managing behavioural problems.\r\nThe project will also help improve the participants language skills within the vovational language and it will develop their cultural understanding.
