As our college is only about 3 km away from the Dutch border, the focus of our school programme has always been on internationalisation.\r\n\r\nOur aim is not only to prepare students to be able to live and work in the Euregio region, but also to pave their way for an increasingly global job market. Preparing them for the job market, however, is not our only goal. With the work placements we want to give them the chance to gain positive experiences with people from other countries and cultures. In our opinion, an understanding between people from different nations can grow best if people actually meet. Also, having yourself experienced what it is like to be a \u201cforeigner\u201d in another country, will help you approach people without prejudices in future.\r\n\r\nThe project \u201cFirst vocational experiences in Europe\u201d is based on these considerations.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at two target groups. On the one hand there is a group of 152 students from the full-time initial vocational training and on the other hand there are 18 trainees from the dual system (taught at college for 1 \u00bd days and at a company for 3 \u00bd days). In the next two years 140 of the participants of the full-time initial training at our college will take part in the additional vocational qualification \u201ceuregio competence\u201d. In 2004 this additional vocational qualification has been developed together with the 5 partner regions in the Euregio Maas - Rhine region and has been offered to the students with great success. It consists of 4 competencies: language competence (the students choose either French or Dutch as a second language), information competence (course: Living and working in the Euregio Maas- Rhine region), intercultural competences (one focus of the language courses) and a work experience in the region, the students are learning the language of. If the students have successfully passed all the segments and successfully passed an additional language test they will be rewarded with the Euregio competence certificate, which is accepted in all partner regions.\r\n\r\nThe other 12 students of the full-time vocational college will do their work placements in England, Spain or France apart from the above mentioned additional qualification.\r\n\r\nFurthermore there will be 18 participants from the dual system (trainees). They will do work placements in England.\r\n\r\nAll these activities are aiming at consolidating and extending their language skills, at acquiring a larger intercultural competence, as well as getting insights into the world of work and the social structure of their host countries.\r\n\r\nThe work placements of our college in the Euregio region will be organized by our school. We will find accommodation for the students. Our partners in Belgium and the Netherlands will help us find work placements and together with the students we will choose the most suitable for them. We will also take care of the students during their work placements. Our colleagues will meet the students during their time abroad. Usually at the end of their work placements they will see them in their companies.\r\n\r\nApart from that they can be reached by email or telephone any time. The vicinity of the work placements and the commitment of the teachers involved have enabled us to take good care of the students so far.\r\n\r\nTo implement and supervise the work experience in countries which are further away needs more support by our local partners. They provide vacancies for work placements, accommodation and are contact persons for the students and companies.

First and foremost we have seen more self-confidence as they have coped with the demands of their work experience on their own. For many of them it is the first time that they have to organize their daily routine by themselves and in foreign surroundings. After successfully coping with this they are rightfully proud of themselves.

There is a lack of strong individuals who would participate in an individual foreign practical training. However, they uttered need and interest to carry out vocational training abroad as a group for a short period of time. Thus, we have planned a14-day training with 2 accompanying teachers at schools focused on the same branch. The 1st week (29/06-06/07/2014) has been arranged with Reaseheath College (lab training, excursions and a trade show in Birmingham).For the 2nd week (07/07-13/07/2014) we plan to verify lab and technology skills in Duchy College. With regard to the profile of the group and the fact that there is a hearing-impaired student with learning difficulties and 2 students who will turn 18 within July, we assume that presence of 2 accompanying persons is necessary (enlisted within activity 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The 2nd target group is made of 5 experienced adult participants with excellent moral and personal background. They are students and graduates of both secondary and higher vocational schools, who have been indicating true interest, have mastered English and experienced a stay abroad. We have planned a 3-week individual training in food labs, which will verify and develop their key vocational and language competences.

This project will enable VET practitioners to increase their understanding of educational systems and allow them to learn, understand and reflect on international ways of working which will enable them to create positive change to their institutional systems and processes. The UK has large numbers of socially excluded young people in vocational education and training, there are several factors which cause this which include; background, race, religion, interests, wealth and personality as well as people with learning needs due to teachers not having the skills and resources to be able to handle this is mainstream education. This creates divides in education and therefore creates minority groups and can lead to exclusion, bullying and even mental health issues in some cases.

The former organization is a representative of craft guilds. It is a voluntary organization uniting associations, representatives of larger firms, craft businesses and entrepreneurs. The latter mentioned organization is an umbrella organization of educational centers of the construction industry of Berlin and Brandenburg. There has been a long-time mutually beneficial cooperation between S\u0160SSaD and both German partners. The cooperation with the British organization Europa Training (UK) Ltd started tarted in January 2012. In November 2014, the study branches suitable for this project were discussed.

The students, together with the  German apprentices from the training center, will get familiar with and learn how to implement new technologies and materials used in their branch. During the whole stay the group will be supervised and monitored by a teacher from  S\u0160 SSaD. The teacher will also organize free-time activities for the students.\r\nDuring the second run which will be realized in spring (March - April) 2016, seven students of three-year branches of Carpenter, Plumber,  Electrician, Machine Mechanic and/or Tinner will be individually attached to companies (members of the Chamber of Crafts) according to their profession.

We are planning mobilities to six European countries (Cyprus, United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy, Slovakia). Compared with previous projects we have expanded the program and in addition to the pupils of the chemical industries that predominate, we involved in the project  also the pupils of the study programmes newly taught at our school (Chemist of fire protection, Cosmetic services, apprenticeship Hairdresser).\r\nVocational practice is a way how to achieve new knowledge and practical skills. Foreign professional internship is a priceless experience with a different work and cultural environment and also a strong motivation for students\u00b4 further learning. Moreover it increases the quality and attractiveness of vocational education. In accordance with the curricular reform of the vocational training the internships contribute to the development of civil society, key and professional competences and also to the implementation of cross-cutting topics. By the completition of language preparation and, subsequently the internship itself, students enhance their language portfolio. They improve their communication skills and extend their vocabulary in the field of terminology. Also a great benefit can be seen that the students gain an overview of the demands put on their profession, they discover possibilities of studying abroad and working on the European labour market.\r\nIn the area of chemistry mobilities will take place at the workplaces of chemical or pharmaceutical companies or at educational institutions (secondary technical schools of similar type, technical faculties). In case of Italy, Germany and Slovakia there will be a reciprocal exchange. Partner schools in these countries are together with our school members of the network CREDCHEM. Under this arrangement we cooperate on the implementation, development and experimental testing of the European credit transfer system ECVET for the chemistry sector.\r\nStudents in the study programme Chemist of fire protection receive vocational training at the secondary vocational school in \u017dilina, which has excellent technical background in the field of fire technology.\r\nThe students of Beauty Cosmetic Services  and Hairdresser receive training in cosmetic and hairdressing salons of secondary vocational school in Bratislava. These internships will be reciprocal.\r\nAll internships will be certified by Europass-Mobility document and will be recognised as an integral part of the educational cycle.\r\nThe project is also designed for teachers of vocational subjects in our school. Professional education has gone through significant changes in recent years, for example in the structure of disciplines in technology education, in using of new teaching resources, in the composition of students, it must face the low interest of pupils to study technical and scientific disciplines. These changes put higher demands on teachers of vocational subjects and laboratories, teachers must more closely follow news in their field, work with a new technique that supports teaching, use ICT more and collaborate with teachers of other subjects, especially mathematics. The need for the project stems also from a lack of foreign experience of teachers, from the need to increase their language and technical expertise, from the need to increase the attractiveness of vocational training, to improve the quality and innovation of teaching and to prepare school graduates on the labour market not only domestic, but also European.\r\nThe intention of the project is to initiate personal and professional development of teachers and the transfer of new trends in vocational training. We want to achieve this by allowing our teachers of vocational subjects to visit schools in two EU countries (Italy and Cyprus) where they get new experience with vocational training in schools of a similar focus, gain new ideas and examples of how to use modern teaching means and methods based on ICT. They will get to know the level of cooperation between schools and employers and other social partners, they will increase their motivation for further cooperation at European level.", "http://www.europatrainingltd.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-CZ01-KA102-013266_7"], ["8BX", "Europejskie sta\u017ce uczni\u00f3w Zespo\u0142u Szk\u00f3\u0142 Ekonomicznych im.

It will also help to raise the level of  independence, confidence and responsibility of the participants.. \r\nThe project will enable the students to get acquainted with the  requirements of British employers and promote the mobility of employees in the European  labour market. \r\nThe beneficiaries of the project will be 30 students of Logistics of the second and third grades, as well as the graduates leaving  the school in 2016. The students will serve a four-week apprenticeship in logistics centres in Plymouth, UK in two groups of 15 people in July 2016 and March 2017. \r\nThe project will be implemented in two stages: the first stage in the Secondary School of Economics in Brzeg will include conveying information about the project,  recruiting  participants,  providing cultural, linguistic, psychological and  pedagogical preparation. The second stage is the training abroad in the logistics enterprises in Plymouth. It will be followed by the students' obtaining credits and certificates of having accomplished the apprenticeship. Finally, the results will be  assessed, evaluated and disseminated. \r\nThe effect of training abroad will be the development of professional competencies of the 30 students participating in the project. The participation in the training shall increase their opportunities for future employment, not only in the region of Silesia or elsewhere Poland, but also in other European Union countries thanks to acquiring  additional knowledge,   practical skills and obtaining the Euro-pass Mobility Certificate. The students will also improve their language skills in terms of using vocational English and everyday language. The participation in the apprenticeship will influence the personal development of the participants. It will contribute to increasing the students' self- confidence and the motivation to learn the profession. It will also raise their  career aspirations and  the motivation to learn foreign languages. \r\nThe long-term benefits arising from the project are:  development of international cooperation,   exchange of experiences in practical training,  modification of school curricula in the logistics profession, better quality of the school's  educational offer. The beginning of an international exchange programme will let the Secondary School of Economics in Brzeg get on the European track of development and will lead to accomplishing similar projects in the future.", "http://www.europatrainingltd.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-PL01-KA102-015353_1"], ["8BX", "Ucze\u0144 jako przysz\u0142y pracownik - m\u00f3j przysz\u0142y zaw\u00f3d w Europie", "Europa Training (UK) Ltd", 87177.0, "The project is designed for the third grade students of secondary technical school.

This is also reflected in the educational and the work market. Preparing for responsibility, adapting of forms and methods in the work with a modern student, which is more often culturally and nationally different, continuous activity is one of the many tasks of the school. Therefore, the overriding goal of our project is to improve language skills, shape openness to linguistic and cultural diversity, use of modern technologies and innovative teaching methods.\r\nThe project is addressed to teachers of comprehensive subjects, in particular Polish language, culture and foreign language teachers, because it is they who, showing students the heroes of literary works, are responsible for preparing them for respecting cultural diversity and living and working in multinational teams. The subject of professional development within the project \"School success through teachers\u2019 mobility\" focuses on building the skills of effective communication in English or in Italian. To fulfill this goal, the most important functions of the language: speaking and understanding are evenly developed. Constant activities in the form of job shadowing are activities such as observation, work in groups, workshops, discussions or meetings with various groups of the school community. The supplement to foreign professional training is a program of extra-curricular activities, clubs of interest , which enables further improvement of professional skills. Mobility regarding teaching assignment will allow us to check teaching skills in an international team and promote Polish culture, region and school. Getting to know Spoleto, Plymouth, local traditions and interesting places are the next activities included in the program of foreign trainings. Participation in foreign language courses will primarily increase the ability to communicate in English and work in international teams.\r\n  The expected results of the project are an increase in the competences and knowledge of participants, a greater involvement in international type projects e-Twinning, abandoning traditional teaching methods, acquiring the skills of teacher self-reflection, sensitizing students to linguistic and cultural diversity, developing students\u2019 civic activity and encouraging active participation in social life at both local and European level in the near future of youth exchange programs. In the long-term perspective, the expected impact of the project is also the introduction of CLIL in our school (teaching subjects or selected elements in foreign languages). \r\nTeachers who are involved in the implementation of the project and its effects will be implemented in various fields - related to subject didactics, educational work, and work with students with specific educational needs.

International and literary mobility will be developed through international cooperation, trips, constant contact, social networking sites and e-mails. This, on the other hand, will serve to overcome social and mental barriers between European citizens. Thanks to foreign training, participants will develop their speaking skills in English or Italian. They will also improve the ability to deal with stress in culturally different situations. It is worth emphasizing that the content implemented as part of the project is complementary to school curricula. Thanks to such actions, we have the chance to educate the citizens of Europe who are confident, open, communicative and respect each other. Thus, personal and civic competences will increase.\r\nThe project involves Azzurra, Gastronomic Academy - Hotel Management in Spoleto in Italy and institutions that conduct foreign English language courses at various levels in the UK with the participation of Europa Training Ltd. 10 teachers and the community of host institutions and language trainers will participate in the mobility.

In this way, outdoor learning has a potential to strengthen \u2018key competences' \u2013 knowledge, skills, and attitudes. \r\n\r\nOn the international level the projects connects to and is a contribution to the development of international education policy strategies. Development of curriculum based outdoor learning practices corresponds with two of four pillars of learning, defined under the UNESCO projects, global networks for learning: Learning to know and Learning to do. These aspects includes learning of key competences such as literacy, communication, maths, science, learning for sustainability and use of digital tools.  \r\n\r\nThe schools will develop and demonstrate good practices in outdoor learning. Each HEI will supervise and report on the school projects.\r\n\r\nAn evaluation kit for good practice and learning outcomes will be developed for assessment in the project. \r\nAn online learning platform will be developed for sharing ideas and methodology.\r\n\r\nDuring the project period several meetings will be held. All meetings have a clear agenda and during all meetings the progress, budget control and deadlines will be discussed. This is to ensure quality in project management. \r\n\r\nThere will be two Multiplier Events. One event mid-term and a final conference. In these events the project participants will disseminate results from the GOaL project to local, national and European policy agencies.\r\n\r\nThe project will deliver an online learning platform that can be used by schools, both during the project and after. The learning platform will be developed by the project in cooperation with the partner schools.\r\n\r\nGuidelines for curriculum based outdoor learning will be published as booklets and on the online learning platform.\r\n\r\nAn assessment kit for learning processes and learning outcomes will be published.\r\n\r\nAn end-of project report with description and evaluation of the projects, learning outcomes and recommendations for best practices in the different countries will be published.\r\n\r\nThe project results will be disseminated within the schools and institutions themselves and in national and international networks and conferences. The report and written materials will be available in open formats. The institutions will provide information on their websites and the learning platform developed will be available online.\r\n\r\nThe project will try to involve the national Ministries of Education to make suggestions for activities, methodology, curriculum and best practices to be incorporated into the national curricula and studies for teacher education.  \r\n\r\nIf, as hoped, the recommendations are incorporated into national curricula, the impact of the project will be long-lasting.", "http://www.beechwood-primary.co.uk/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NO01-KA201-034123_3"], ["8BH", "Mathematics for the Million:'mathematics for my world'", "UNIVERSITY OF ST MARK & ST JOHN", 377236.0, "Mathematics for the Million: \u2018mathematics for my world\u2019, is an extremely exciting, innovative and relevant project that has significant and far reaching potential influence to positively address the key features of a successful mathematics curriculum and purposeful pedagogic delivery. \u2018Maths for my world\u2019 articulates meaning to and of mathematics for pupils and aims to make mathematics purposeful and accessible to all in today\u2019s world.

Learning mobility, that is transnational mobility for the purpose of acquiring new skills, is one of the fundamental ways through which individuals, particularly young people, can strengthen their future employability as well as their personal development (European Commission 2009).\r\n\r\nThe success of the placements abroad depends a lot on the extent to which the trainee gets in contact with the lifestyle, mindset and habits of the hosting country. In this process that is both personal and intercultural for trainees, the role of hosting organisations is central. SMEs represent the trainee\u2019s \u201cpractical handbook\u201d in the world of work and also for the country\u2019s identity and environment (economic, social and cultural).

On the one hand there are SMEs and similar organizations hosting mobilities, intermediaries facilitating EU mobilities and EU mobilities sending organizations. In other words the three sides of the process will be approached, their viewpoints considered and their observations and recommendations will be embedded in the learning materials. The aim is that each of these three types of actors is satisfied with the final products and sees value in adopting the materials for building intercultural competence. Knowing that all involved possess the necessary intercultural competence will bring more trust in their partnership and will facilitate cooperation. All these actors will be involved at different stages of InterMobil implementation \u2013 in the research phase, focus groups discussions, prototype workshops and small-scale events organized by the partners.

Still, the growth has not been equally strong across all innovation dimensions and indicators. While Europe has been getting stronger in Innovation Enablers and Firm Activities, a notable decline in EU SMEs\u2019 Innovation Outputs has occurred. The share of SMEs with product/process innovations has shrunk by 1.7% and that of the marketing/organizational innovations by 3.3%. Sales of innovative products have declined by 0.8%. The discrepancy between innovation inputs (enablers and firm activities) and innovation outputs proves that Europe still has to tap into its innovative potential and is yet to poise itself better to be able to fully cash in on its innovative products and services.Commercialization of innovation is becoming an urgent problem. The most recent Innobarometer survey (2015) confirms EU SMEs experience difficulties in bringing innovative products or services to market. It also states that SMEs face more constrains to commercialization of their innovations than bigger companies. Lack of marketing expertise has been a problem in commercializing innovations for 39% of SMEs, compared to 23% of bigger enterprises.Among SMEs, young firms (0-5 years old) have the highest potential for innovation, growth and jobs creation (DynEmp, OECD). At the same time, they represent the most vulnerable group due to:1. low survival rate \u2013 in a majority of EU Member States only 40% to 60% of firms born in 2008 survived until 2012 (Annual Report on European SMEs 2014/2015);2. shortage of skills related to planning and managing innovation process and bringing innovative ideas to market (same as above).The data analysis reveals a need for training which will provide young SMEs with fail-safe methods of introducing innovative products/services to market and gaining commercial success. The INN-COMMERCE project addresses this challenge setting up the aim: to foster commercialization of young SMEs' innovation by improving their knowledge and skills in promoting and marketing innovative products or services through gamified training, specifically tailored to their needs.Specific objectives include:- Developing curriculum and e-learning content addressing the challenges young SMEs face in commercialization of innovative products/services;- Providing young SMEs with an open educational resource complete with learning materials on the innovation process with special focus on commercialization of innovation;  - Delivering clear guidelines for young SMEs and C-VET institutions on using the developed materials and resources in their practice;- Collecting SMEs\u2019 best practices in applying marketing strategies for successful commercialization of innovative products and services.The project employs life-cycle methodology, which implies a sequence of activities for planning, executing and disseminating the project results.

With social enterprises focusing on a number of state-related services, their increasing number is expected to result in widespread gains for public budgets. According  to European Commission, social enterprises in Europe is expected to constitute a dynamic entrepreneurial movement encapsulating the drive for new business models that combine economic activity with social mission, and the promotion of inclusive growth. However, the survival and growth of social enterprises is still hindered by several internal key constraints encompassing lack of viable business models, high reliance on the public sector as a source of income, lack of entrepreneurial spirit, skills and spesialised advisory services.

As regards partners, only Lithuania and Italy performed very good in mobility quality, followed by Germany and UK classified as performing good, and last in the ranking are Bulgaria and Portugal with no data provided. \r\n\r\nGiven this conceptual problem and relying on EP Resolution of 12 Apr 2016 on Erasmus+ and other tools to foster mobility in VET, STAYMOBIL concept was prompted by the importance of:\r\n+a common European education area grounded in a strong mobility component for developing stronger European identity and enhanced citizenship\r\n+improving VET mobility programmes so as to deliver added value for all participants as regards qualifications, recognition and content\r\n+improving social responsibility (SR) skills as part of mobility learning outcomes. \r\n\r\nThus, STAYMOBIL project sets the overall aim to improve quality assurance in transnational VET mobility through socially responsible behavior of all VET mobility actors, thus promoting and further developing quality in mobility and sustaining learning outcomes. \r\n\r\nSpecific objectives\r\n~to provide mobility organizers with an innovative framework to assess, monitor and promote QA and sustainability at all stages of VET mobility\r\n~to foster mobility organizers to verify and continuously improve quality of mobility activities through the development of a new to date practical approach for self-audit\r\n~to enhance applicability and facilitate transferability of the project innovative approach through the provision of a set of recommendations, strategies and good implementation practices\r\n~to enable mobility users to assess their SR performance as essential part of learning outcomes, thus increasing broad awareness of good ethical and socially impeccable behaviour during mobility.\r\n\r\nProject is aimed primary at: \r\n1.Mobility organisers: \r\n+VET institutions, sending and/ or receiving VET learners and staff\r\n+Intermediary organizations involved in mobility\r\n+Companies providing mobility placements\r\n2.Mobility users\r\n+VET learners (apprentices and VET students) \r\n+VET staff (teachers, trainers, etc.) \r\n3.VET policy makers at national and EU levels.\r\n\r\nWithin project lifetime 4 IOs will be developed: \r\n1.Reference Framework for Sustainable Transnational VET Mobility setting up a series of quality indicators to assess, monitor and promote QA and sustainability at all mobility stages.\r\n2.Practice Kit aiming to verify, assess and improve the quality of activities provided at all mobility stages based on O1 quality indicators matrix. It will comprise: Guidance Manual for Implementation, Evaluation and Review, Web-based Self-Audit Tool and Progress Portfolio.\r\n3.Recommendations Booklet providing guidelines for applying and facilitating transferability of O1&O2 outside project consortium. It will comprise: Good Practices Dossier; Strategy Cards for Successful Employment of O1&O2 and Tips Packet for Enhancing Transferability.\r\n4.Performance Skillbox serving to raise awareness, evaluate and enhance mobility users\u2019 level of SR before and after mobility as essential part of learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nTo ensure visibility and encourage wider uptake of project IOs a series of multiplier events will be held:\r\n1.Small-scale conferences in 5 partner countries to popularize the project to relevant stakeholders \r\n2.Open Event in Brussels to gain wider publicity of project results and attract the attention of EU authorities and VET related alliances at EU level  \r\n3.Final Conference in UK aiming to spread information to a wider audience about the project results, seeking further exploitation of project IOs and follow-up activities.\r\n\r\nSTAYMOBIL project will result in raising the issue about common understanding of \u2018quality through SR\u2019, provision of high quality mobility and higher level of satisfaction from the experience, thereby sustained learning outcomes and increased number of mobility organizers and users, contributing to European internationalization of VET organizations in Erasmus+ Programme countries and creation of a genuine European labour market.", "http://www.europatrainingltd.com", "EUROPA TRAINING (UK) LTD", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA202-036666_coordinator"], ["8BX", "Sustainable Tourism through Networking and Collaboration", "Total Innovation EU Ltd", 237334.0, "There is a new sense of urgency about improving sustainability of the tourism sector. Europe is becoming more and more popular tourist destination, commanding a market share of the world tourism industry bigger than 40%. Along with this positive economic impact, however, tourism puts a significant strain on European natural environments and socio-cultural authenticity.  \r\n\r\nMany initiatives have been undertaken in the EU to raise public awareness of sustainability and to ensure sustainable management of tourist destinations, businesses and products. Numerous Europe-wide reports, however, prove that the workforce employed in the sector still lacks the right, green skill set for implementing principles of sustainable development.\r\n\r\nTourism sector in Europe is dominated by micro and small enterprises (MSEs), which often have lack of resources to invest either in sustainable practices or in workforce skills development. At the same time, many sustainable tourism practices have already proven their economic viability to micro and small enterprises. Moreover, affordability and cost efficiency of such practices increase significantly, if MSEs create clusters and combine efforts to implement them.\r\n\r\nThe Sustain-T project, therefore, aims to enhance the sustainability performance of EU micro and small enterprises in the tourism sector by raising their managers\u2019 awareness of sustainable tourism practices and improving their networking and collaboration skills for establishing new green alliances and implementing joint sustainability initiatives.\r\n\r\nProject\u2019s specific objectives are:\r\n1. Develop an on-line training package, addressing challenges tourism MSEs face in transforming their business model towards sustainability;\r\n2. Create interactive tools, facilitating collaboration of tourism MSEs in developing joint sustainability initiatives;\r\n3. Provide tourism MSEs with an open educational resource - an interactive learning platform containing all Sustain-T training material;\r\n4. Deliver guidelines for MSEs and for VET providers on using the developed materials and resources in their practice.\r\n\r\nThe project utilises life-cycle methodology, which implies a sequence of activities for planning, executing and disseminating the project results. During the project lifetime, the following intellectual outputs will be developed:\r\n1. Sustain-T curriculum, based on a genuine research into challenges tourism MSEs face in improving sustainability performance of their firms;\r\n2. Sustain-T learning content, structured around the four main themes of GSTC criteria;\r\n3. Interactive Self-audit, Resource-mapping & Ideation tools, allowing for: reflection on the current state of sustainability of a tourism enterprise; analysis of available resources for sustainability improvement; and collective idea generation for developing and undertaking joint sustainable tourism initiatives;\r\n4. E-learning platform \u2013 a virtual learning environment, containing all Sustain-T training materials and e-tools;\r\n5. Guidelines for MSEs and Handbook for VET providers, facilitating usage of Sustain-T training package by the project\u2019s target groups.\r\n\r\nThe project is targeted at owners and managers of EU tourism micro and small enterprises and at VET providers, trainers and learners interested in sustainable tourism issues.

It is the first project of its type to do this. It utilizes a  recently devised method for this process - Transformative Evaluation (TE) - which in the UK context has been shown to both significantly develop youth worker's ability to demonstrate impact, re-engage youth workers in the evaluation process and develop high quality youth work. It focuses on 'story generation' and starts with the voice of young people. This is enhanced through a process of peer and stake holder discussions to establish definitely the impact of youth work in that context. The context for this project is the Europe-wide call for youth work to better establish its outcomes and impact (EC, Strategy for Youth, 2009; EC, 2014, Working with Young People; EC, 2015, Quality Youth Work). The outcomes of the project ( national partner country reports, E-book and briefing papers will be used to address this directly.The aims of this project are:1.To establish a European network to identify, develop and communicate the impact of youth work across 5 European countries. The objectives of the project are:2.  To embed the innovative, highly effective,  robust and sustainable method of evaluating youth work - Transformative Evaluation (TE) - developed in one national context (UK) in youth work organizations across 5 European partner countries.  3.  Demonstrate new knowledge  and evidence across Europe of the impact of youth work to inform local regional, national and European Policy.These aims will be met by the following objectives:(i) Training youth workers in the Transformative Evaluation (TE) method and then implementing 3 cycles of the process in 3 youth work organizations, in each of the 5 partner countries, over a one year period.(ii) Youth workers from these organizations supported by the coordinators will train other youth workers across their organization, and in other youth work organizations and settings, thereby developing a new 'community of practice'.(iii) Create a sustainable on-line training resource in TE to enable youth workers across Europe settings to be better able to evaluate their practice, and identify the impact of their work.(iv) identifying, comparing and contrasting the impact of youth work on young people and upon their wider communities across the 15 youth work settings in 5 European contexts.(v) Identifying what works, the processes which brought about these outcomes and how they were achieved. (vi) Communicate and disseminate this new knowledge via reports, policy briefings and an open access e-book(vii) Produce recommendations for policy makers / funders.(viii) Disseminate outputs through an International Conference.The project will have 5 phases1) Training in TE2) Embedding TE in youth work organizations3) Identification of the Impact of Youth Work 4) Establishment of  a new 'Community of Practice' & Production of a web based multi lingual resource 5) Dissemination through Reports, E-book and international conference The project is lead by Dr Jon Ord (University of St Mark & St John) Associate Professor in  youth work and there are 4 other universities, of HUMAK, Toulouse, Bari, Tallin coordinating the work in their native countries. There also 15 partner youth work organizations, 3 from each of the 5 countries.  Many of these are from deprived regions such as Cornwall, in the UK and Puglia in  Italy. The project will be expanded as youth workers share and train other youth workers through peer to peer training to significantly extend the reach of the project, creating a 'Community of Practice'.The results will be:- A significant demonstration of the impact of youth work across Europe. - The establishment of a 'community of Practice of youth workers trained in to demonstrate the impact of their work (TE)- The project has a sustainable paradigm as it is designed to grow and develop after it has been completed through the production of the Multi lingual Web based resource, the E-book and the community of practice that has been developed.

Creating a book trailer involves the use of media in didactics, has a strong educational value and uses the methodologies of learning by doing and learning among peers. \r\nThis kind of didactics is not  purely disciplinary, but is mainly subject to the formation of the person and his needs, centered on laboratories techniques and very attractive, which works starting by problems and aims at their solution with the cooperation and sharing  of all.\r\n We decided to use booktrailers in order to stimulate the students to read.\r\nThe partnership is made up of 6 partner schools (Greece, Italy, Latvia, Romania, Spain, Uk), which have developed in the past successful collaborations. They belong to similar segments of education ranging students from 6 to15 years old in the various countries. Each school has classes with children with disabilities and/or disadvantages of various kinds and will be involved in the activities of the project. \r\n. The partners share materials and resources, and develop units of cross-curricular\r\nwork in literacy, and production of booktrailers that are tested/implemented in primary and secondary schools. The\r\nobjectives of the project are to improve the quality of education:\r\n- strengthen teachers' skills and provide them with a tool that encourages students to read and to learn to create something new, that is the booktrailer;\r\n-  fostering the provision and the assessment of key-competences, including basic skills and transversal skills, facilitating the interaction between visual and textual language and multimedia techniques .\r\nThe methodology used is designed to engage students using  languages familiar to and interesting to them, and  keeping with encouraging them to read books,  novels or also the same school books. The need for having to explain themselves through a different language bring them to learn different reading codes.\r\nThe desired impact at local and regional level: is the development - through an international event such as MEET Festival -  of a new approach and a new relationship between young people and the world of culture and cinema. On these international festivals young people will be given the opportunity to catch their territory to be better known and appreciated in Europe through films made by the students themselves and by professional film makers during the festival. \r\nWe envisage to reach the project objectives also beyond regional, national and European level.\r\nWe want to give  participants the opportunity to experiment new pathways of improving their knowledge and competences. We expect young people and adults involved in the project to widen their mental boundaries and look at their everyday life through a new perspective, with an increased European consciousness, feeling of being part of the Community both in individual or communal levels.
