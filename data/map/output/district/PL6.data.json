As our college is only about 3 km away from the Dutch border, the focus of our school programme has always been on internationalisation.\r\n\r\nOur aim is not only to prepare students to be able to live and work in the Euregio region, but also to pave their way for an increasingly global job market. Preparing them for the job market, however, is not our only goal. With the work placements we want to give them the chance to gain positive experiences with people from other countries and cultures. In our opinion, an understanding between people from different nations can grow best if people actually meet. Also, having yourself experienced what it is like to be a \u201cforeigner\u201d in another country, will help you approach people without prejudices in future.\r\n\r\nThe project \u201cFirst vocational experiences in Europe\u201d is based on these considerations.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at two target groups. On the one hand there is a group of 152 students from the full-time initial vocational training and on the other hand there are 18 trainees from the dual system (taught at college for 1 \u00bd days and at a company for 3 \u00bd days). In the next two years 140 of the participants of the full-time initial training at our college will take part in the additional vocational qualification \u201ceuregio competence\u201d. In 2004 this additional vocational qualification has been developed together with the 5 partner regions in the Euregio Maas - Rhine region and has been offered to the students with great success. It consists of 4 competencies: language competence (the students choose either French or Dutch as a second language), information competence (course: Living and working in the Euregio Maas- Rhine region), intercultural competences (one focus of the language courses) and a work experience in the region, the students are learning the language of. If the students have successfully passed all the segments and successfully passed an additional language test they will be rewarded with the Euregio competence certificate, which is accepted in all partner regions.\r\n\r\nThe other 12 students of the full-time vocational college will do their work placements in England, Spain or France apart from the above mentioned additional qualification.\r\n\r\nFurthermore there will be 18 participants from the dual system (trainees). They will do work placements in England.\r\n\r\nAll these activities are aiming at consolidating and extending their language skills, at acquiring a larger intercultural competence, as well as getting insights into the world of work and the social structure of their host countries.\r\n\r\nThe work placements of our college in the Euregio region will be organized by our school. We will find accommodation for the students. Our partners in Belgium and the Netherlands will help us find work placements and together with the students we will choose the most suitable for them. We will also take care of the students during their work placements. Our colleagues will meet the students during their time abroad. Usually at the end of their work placements they will see them in their companies.\r\n\r\nApart from that they can be reached by email or telephone any time. The vicinity of the work placements and the commitment of the teachers involved have enabled us to take good care of the students so far.\r\n\r\nTo implement and supervise the work experience in countries which are further away needs more support by our local partners. They provide vacancies for work placements, accommodation and are contact persons for the students and companies.

First and foremost we have seen more self-confidence as they have coped with the demands of their work experience on their own. For many of them it is the first time that they have to organize their daily routine by themselves and in foreign surroundings. After successfully coping with this they are rightfully proud of themselves.

There is a lack of strong individuals who would participate in an individual foreign practical training. However, they uttered need and interest to carry out vocational training abroad as a group for a short period of time. Thus, we have planned a14-day training with 2 accompanying teachers at schools focused on the same branch. The 1st week (29/06-06/07/2014) has been arranged with Reaseheath College (lab training, excursions and a trade show in Birmingham).For the 2nd week (07/07-13/07/2014) we plan to verify lab and technology skills in Duchy College. With regard to the profile of the group and the fact that there is a hearing-impaired student with learning difficulties and 2 students who will turn 18 within July, we assume that presence of 2 accompanying persons is necessary (enlisted within activity 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The 2nd target group is made of 5 experienced adult participants with excellent moral and personal background. They are students and graduates of both secondary and higher vocational schools, who have been indicating true interest, have mastered English and experienced a stay abroad. We have planned a 3-week individual training in food labs, which will verify and develop their key vocational and language competences.

This project will enable VET practitioners to increase their understanding of educational systems and allow them to learn, understand and reflect on international ways of working which will enable them to create positive change to their institutional systems and processes. The UK has large numbers of socially excluded young people in vocational education and training, there are several factors which cause this which include; background, race, religion, interests, wealth and personality as well as people with learning needs due to teachers not having the skills and resources to be able to handle this is mainstream education. This creates divides in education and therefore creates minority groups and can lead to exclusion, bullying and even mental health issues in some cases.

The former organization is a representative of craft guilds. It is a voluntary organization uniting associations, representatives of larger firms, craft businesses and entrepreneurs. The latter mentioned organization is an umbrella organization of educational centers of the construction industry of Berlin and Brandenburg. There has been a long-time mutually beneficial cooperation between S\u0160SSaD and both German partners. The cooperation with the British organization Europa Training (UK) Ltd started tarted in January 2012. In November 2014, the study branches suitable for this project were discussed.

We are planning mobilities to six European countries (Cyprus, United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy, Slovakia). Compared with previous projects we have expanded the program and in addition to the pupils of the chemical industries that predominate, we involved in the project  also the pupils of the study programmes newly taught at our school (Chemist of fire protection, Cosmetic services, apprenticeship Hairdresser).\r\nVocational practice is a way how to achieve new knowledge and practical skills. Foreign professional internship is a priceless experience with a different work and cultural environment and also a strong motivation for students\u00b4 further learning. Moreover it increases the quality and attractiveness of vocational education. In accordance with the curricular reform of the vocational training the internships contribute to the development of civil society, key and professional competences and also to the implementation of cross-cutting topics. By the completition of language preparation and, subsequently the internship itself, students enhance their language portfolio. They improve their communication skills and extend their vocabulary in the field of terminology. Also a great benefit can be seen that the students gain an overview of the demands put on their profession, they discover possibilities of studying abroad and working on the European labour market.\r\nIn the area of chemistry mobilities will take place at the workplaces of chemical or pharmaceutical companies or at educational institutions (secondary technical schools of similar type, technical faculties). In case of Italy, Germany and Slovakia there will be a reciprocal exchange. Partner schools in these countries are together with our school members of the network CREDCHEM. Under this arrangement we cooperate on the implementation, development and experimental testing of the European credit transfer system ECVET for the chemistry sector.\r\nStudents in the study programme Chemist of fire protection receive vocational training at the secondary vocational school in \u017dilina, which has excellent technical background in the field of fire technology.\r\nThe students of Beauty Cosmetic Services  and Hairdresser receive training in cosmetic and hairdressing salons of secondary vocational school in Bratislava. These internships will be reciprocal.\r\nAll internships will be certified by Europass-Mobility document and will be recognised as an integral part of the educational cycle.\r\nThe project is also designed for teachers of vocational subjects in our school. Professional education has gone through significant changes in recent years, for example in the structure of disciplines in technology education, in using of new teaching resources, in the composition of students, it must face the low interest of pupils to study technical and scientific disciplines. These changes put higher demands on teachers of vocational subjects and laboratories, teachers must more closely follow news in their field, work with a new technique that supports teaching, use ICT more and collaborate with teachers of other subjects, especially mathematics. The need for the project stems also from a lack of foreign experience of teachers, from the need to increase their language and technical expertise, from the need to increase the attractiveness of vocational training, to improve the quality and innovation of teaching and to prepare school graduates on the labour market not only domestic, but also European.\r\nThe intention of the project is to initiate personal and professional development of teachers and the transfer of new trends in vocational training. We want to achieve this by allowing our teachers of vocational subjects to visit schools in two EU countries (Italy and Cyprus) where they get new experience with vocational training in schools of a similar focus, gain new ideas and examples of how to use modern teaching means and methods based on ICT. They will get to know the level of cooperation between schools and employers and other social partners, they will increase their motivation for further cooperation at European level.", "http://www.europatrainingltd.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-CZ01-KA102-013266_7"], ["8BX", "Europejskie sta\u017ce uczni\u00f3w Zespo\u0142u Szk\u00f3\u0142 Ekonomicznych im.

It will also help to raise the level of  independence, confidence and responsibility of the participants.. \r\nThe project will enable the students to get acquainted with the  requirements of British employers and promote the mobility of employees in the European  labour market. \r\nThe beneficiaries of the project will be 30 students of Logistics of the second and third grades, as well as the graduates leaving  the school in 2016. The students will serve a four-week apprenticeship in logistics centres in Plymouth, UK in two groups of 15 people in July 2016 and March 2017. \r\nThe project will be implemented in two stages: the first stage in the Secondary School of Economics in Brzeg will include conveying information about the project,  recruiting  participants,  providing cultural, linguistic, psychological and  pedagogical preparation. The second stage is the training abroad in the logistics enterprises in Plymouth. It will be followed by the students' obtaining credits and certificates of having accomplished the apprenticeship. Finally, the results will be  assessed, evaluated and disseminated. \r\nThe effect of training abroad will be the development of professional competencies of the 30 students participating in the project. The participation in the training shall increase their opportunities for future employment, not only in the region of Silesia or elsewhere Poland, but also in other European Union countries thanks to acquiring  additional knowledge,   practical skills and obtaining the Euro-pass Mobility Certificate. The students will also improve their language skills in terms of using vocational English and everyday language. The participation in the apprenticeship will influence the personal development of the participants. It will contribute to increasing the students' self- confidence and the motivation to learn the profession. It will also raise their  career aspirations and  the motivation to learn foreign languages. \r\nThe long-term benefits arising from the project are:  development of international cooperation,   exchange of experiences in practical training,  modification of school curricula in the logistics profession, better quality of the school's  educational offer. The beginning of an international exchange programme will let the Secondary School of Economics in Brzeg get on the European track of development and will lead to accomplishing similar projects in the future.", "http://www.europatrainingltd.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-PL01-KA102-015353_1"], ["8BX", "Ucze\u0144 jako przysz\u0142y pracownik - m\u00f3j przysz\u0142y zaw\u00f3d w Europie", "Europa Training (UK) Ltd", 104628.0, "The project is designed for the third grade students of secondary technical school.

The main objective is to hold a professional practice with a foreign employer, which is extremely valuable for professional  and personal development as well as improving language competence.\r\nStudents will acquire skills relevant to the curriculum for each profession. The project responds to the need to adapt vocational training to the needs of modern labor market not only in Poland, but throughout Europe. For students enrolled in technical professions, it is important that foreign companies often represent a higher technological and organizational level than Polish companies and already widely apply solutions that are new to the Polish market.\r\nStudents will get familier with the technical solutions, technologies, organization of work and equipment that are already in use in Europe. Not only will they be able to move them to the Polish ground, but if in the future theywill work in Polish enterprises, which apply the western style of work, they will already be prepared. During the project the level of education will be adapted to European standards by comparing the requirements from students and trainees at the place of practice. The resulting documents: Europass Mobility and Language Passport will help participants move in the labor market in the future.\r\nThe project will contribute to the improvement of teamwork and linguistic competence of both students and teachers involved in the project.\r\nAn important element is to break the language  and culture barrier, which will allow for flexibility in establishing contacts and exchange experiences. Students will learn the customs and culture of the French / British.\r\nThe project also aims to improve school performance in terms of the methods and content of vocational education and relationship with employers.

This is also reflected in the educational and the work market. Preparing for responsibility, adapting of forms and methods in the work with a modern student, which is more often culturally and nationally different, continuous activity is one of the many tasks of the school. Therefore, the overriding goal of our project is to improve language skills, shape openness to linguistic and cultural diversity, use of modern technologies and innovative teaching methods.\r\nThe project is addressed to teachers of comprehensive subjects, in particular Polish language, culture and foreign language teachers, because it is they who, showing students the heroes of literary works, are responsible for preparing them for respecting cultural diversity and living and working in multinational teams. The subject of professional development within the project \"School success through teachers\u2019 mobility\" focuses on building the skills of effective communication in English or in Italian. To fulfill this goal, the most important functions of the language: speaking and understanding are evenly developed. Constant activities in the form of job shadowing are activities such as observation, work in groups, workshops, discussions or meetings with various groups of the school community. The supplement to foreign professional training is a program of extra-curricular activities, clubs of interest , which enables further improvement of professional skills. Mobility regarding teaching assignment will allow us to check teaching skills in an international team and promote Polish culture, region and school. Getting to know Spoleto, Plymouth, local traditions and interesting places are the next activities included in the program of foreign trainings. Participation in foreign language courses will primarily increase the ability to communicate in English and work in international teams.\r\n  The expected results of the project are an increase in the competences and knowledge of participants, a greater involvement in international type projects e-Twinning, abandoning traditional teaching methods, acquiring the skills of teacher self-reflection, sensitizing students to linguistic and cultural diversity, developing students\u2019 civic activity and encouraging active participation in social life at both local and European level in the near future of youth exchange programs. In the long-term perspective, the expected impact of the project is also the introduction of CLIL in our school (teaching subjects or selected elements in foreign languages). \r\nTeachers who are involved in the implementation of the project and its effects will be implemented in various fields - related to subject didactics, educational work, and work with students with specific educational needs.

International and literary mobility will be developed through international cooperation, trips, constant contact, social networking sites and e-mails. This, on the other hand, will serve to overcome social and mental barriers between European citizens. Thanks to foreign training, participants will develop their speaking skills in English or Italian. They will also improve the ability to deal with stress in culturally different situations. It is worth emphasizing that the content implemented as part of the project is complementary to school curricula. Thanks to such actions, we have the chance to educate the citizens of Europe who are confident, open, communicative and respect each other. Thus, personal and civic competences will increase.\r\nThe project involves Azzurra, Gastronomic Academy - Hotel Management in Spoleto in Italy and institutions that conduct foreign English language courses at various levels in the UK with the participation of Europa Training Ltd. 10 teachers and the community of host institutions and language trainers will participate in the mobility.

The pedagogical study will focus on the following key areas: The critical role of classroom management for efficient teaching and learning; Organizational support for effective classroom management \r\n- Behaviour improvement approaches and strategies; Disciplinary interventions: responses to inappropriate/ low-level and high-level disruptive behaviour; Teacher-student relationship and its influence on student behaviour; What conditions exist in the Bulgarian VET schools that facilitate effective classroom management practices; How the Bulgarian VET systems supports effective classroom management at schools.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the BEHAVE project will develop new strategies and best practices for managing student behaviour; create new ways to promote effective classroom management for enhanced students\u2019 engagement and achievement; improve institutional practices by creating opportunity to trial new ways of working. This project will enable VET practitioners to gain an in-depth understanding of pedagogies used to tackle inappropriate student behaviour, as well as to create environment conductive to effective teaching and learning. It will enable the creation of a best practices guide that other VET schools will be able to use to improve their classroom management practices.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nThe overall objective of the project is to create conditions for improving classroom management at UK VET schools. The specific objectives are to: \r\n- Reflect on the existing classroom management practices used at VET schools\r\n- Gain an in-depth understanding of pedagogies used for managing student behaviour at VET schools\r\n- Understand the strategies and develop techniques for effective classroom management and for encouraging positive behaviour at VET schools\r\n- Create best practices guide for VET practitioners in the UK\r\n- Broadly disseminate the best practices guide to UK VET schools\r\n\r\nWe are working with 16 teachers from 8 vocational schools in Plymouth who have face problems with disruptive student behaviour. Based on our long term relationships and research among the local VET schools the principles and teachers have agreed and pointed that they would greatly benefit from the European exchange programme where they can experience and learn best practices from another countries educational system. All participating teachers are key to the development of vocational subjects in their school and have designed and developed programmes to support vocational learning.  The participating teachers have an interest in their self-development, and an interest in how other EU countries schools work and deliver high quality teaching results (including through effective classroom management).\r\n\r\nWe intend to visit four different VET schools in Bulgaria. \r\nThe daily programme will consist of:\r\n- Presentation of the School\u2019s profiles, understanding how the school fits into the educational system including how it support    effective classroom management and helps to create positive learning environment.\r\n- Consultation/discussions with teachers \u2013 discussions about competencies, understanding methodology, review of example session plans and schemes of work, how do they encourage positive student behaviour.\r\n- Visiting sessions \u2013 Shadowing sessions to observe classes and gain a better understanding of how the sessions work in practice.\r\n- Session evaluation \u2013 Participants and Teachers discuss the observation and discuss the involved methodology and best practices to create recommendations for our educational system. \r\n- Group evaluation - The whole group evaluates the day and can add to their reflective journal.\r\n- Cultural - These focus on society differences to the UK, discussions about active citizenship and opportunity to reflect on the day and share experiences, and discuss competencies and skills.\r\nWe believe that from this project we will be able to present our findings to the educational authority and disseminate these results to the rest of Europe, in addition to this we will create an impact report and report which we will disseminate though a wide variety of channels including: The institute for Leaning, Department for Education, Local education boards and directly with schools, colleges and other institutions.
