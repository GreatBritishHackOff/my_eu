Our highest priority and main objective  is to increase our teacher's competence and boost confidence in delivering exposure to Modern Languages. \r\n\r\nNumber/Profile of Participants\r\nAfter a presentation and selection process 1 of our teachers was identified as having a clear need to increase their language skills to allow them to gain greater confidence in delivering languages as part of the new curriculum.\r\n\r\nDescription of Activities:\r\nTo complement the training provided by the local authority, the  teacher will take part in  language immersion activities in Germany. The course content has been adapted to meet the needs of our teacher provided - language teaching methodology in Early Years Education combined with gaining enhanced skills in the target language, therefore boosting confidence in speaking the target language.\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used:\r\nAs head teacher I have identified with my teacher their development needs and looked for  high quality providers to run immersion courses abroad in conjunction with the Goethe Institut.\r\nTogether we have developed the course content to the specific needs of our teachers' requirements in line with advice for the new national curriculum in Scotland.\r\nAs head teacher I will monitor the experience of the course - there will be an evaluation of participants by the course provider\r\nand a evaluation of course  by participants:\r\nThrough the evaluation of the course and the subsequent interview with each participating teacher I expect to get a clear picture of how successful / effective the course was.\r\n\r\nDescription of results/impact envisaged:\r\nAs head teacher I expect  longer term benefits as we are looking forward to our teacher becoming more fluent and more confident in their understanding and talking of the target language. Our pupils will greatly benefit from an enthused teacher who is able to speak accurately in the target language and will learn about foreign cultures first hand.", null, "Pitteuchar East Primary", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000166_coordinator"], ["5JL", "LFEE Immersion course", "Auchmuty High School", 2520.0, "The participant is currently teaching at Auchmuty High School, in the region of Fife in Scotland. Over the years, the school has been offering  two main subjects (German and French )to our pupils. For the first time this year, our pupils have the opportunity to learn an additional language( Spanish). At the moment, only a non qualification course is being provided. On completion of her Spanish degree at the Dundee University in June this year, our member of staff will be a qualified teacher and will therefore be teaching the language to more pupils and at qualification level, from S4 to S6.  The head teacher is committed to the language learning and has offered financial support to the participant to complete the degree. This will then give our pupils more course choices and expand our modern languages department. We endaevour  to promote and foster the European Dimension into our learners' lives by recognising our interdependence with other countries, raising awareness of other cultures and reflecting of our own culture. By learning a foreign language our pupils are made aware that they acquire skills that will enable them to be active citizens within Scotland as well as the UK and the EU.We also feel that it is time to start reversing the \"vicious circle of monolingualism\" in Great Britain. Too many pupils are lagging far behind their European peers, with many unable to understand basic phrases. Poor language skills in the workforce affect our economy. In our organisation, we believe that languages are vital in education for UK competitiveness, for individuals and society at large. We feel that the attitude to foreign languages has started to change for the best,  and the Scottish government is helping tremendously towards this change with the implementation of the initiative of 1+2 in all the primary schools.To encourage the uptake of languages at National 5 and Higher levels depends on the role teachers play in the classroom. Our pupils are fast changing along with our society and are no longer passive recipients but active participants. We need to move away from traditional methodology and inspire them. We need to adapt to their changing needs and aspirations. Resources should be authentic, relevant, challenging and motivating.  We need to allow our pupils\"to travel\" within the boundaries of the classroom, send letters to pen pals whose language they are studying and embrace  new cultures by studying topics of interest such as music, art...Although the participant is eager  to integrate all those new aspects into her teaching, she feels that she would benefit from professional development to help pupils embark on a new journey while learning a foreign language.
