The process is assisted by solar radiation, nutrients and sea water microalgae. This approach is based on the technology developed by the Partner Biofuel Systems (BFS) to produce bio-oil. In order to develop such technology, several innovative approaches are proposed:\n- New algae strains production optimization and CO2 energetic balance improvement.\n-Optimization of photo-bioreactors\n- Study and adaptation of separation of algae components based on hybrid technologies.\n- Production of algae derived chemicals for surfactants applications and amino acids for food applications\n- Production of bio-based resins from algae based fatty acids and bio-oil aromatic moieties.\nSimilar studies have been carried out at laboratory level to obtain a broad range of algae derived chemicals, however BISIGODOS\u2019 project aims to work at semi-industrial scale using the BFS industrial photo-bioreactors facilities. Results obtained at this scale, under a well controlled process, will permit to validate the lab scale results and to develop new ones (mainly in the bioresin field) gaining a real knowledge of the industrial-market possibilities that the microalgae technologies offer and contributing to define the roadmap of the technology", 83579.0, 4437678.0, "BISIGODOS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.sunchemical.com", null, "fp7_110873_951094022"], ["4QT", "Second Generation Unit Load Device to improve the Security and Efficiency of the Aerospace Logistics Industry", "George Utz Ltd", "The SAFEGUARD project presents a new technology to improve the security and efficiency of air cargo through the research and development of a second generation Unit Load Device (ULD). With 1 million ULDs around the world worth over 900 million Euros, they are a crucial element of the global aviation industry. For example, in 2009, 80 million tonnes of air cargo was carried by the existing ULD fleet. However, 26 million tonnes of this cargo (33%) was transported on passenger aircraft and industry experts agree that air cargo is the weak link in the supply chain. Considering the potential security problems around the global air cargo supply chain, there is an urgent need to review and improve existing technological solutions. Over the last 20 years, incremental improvements have primarily focused on weight reduction, which has resulted in compromised security within the supply chain. The research and development of the SAFEGUARD technology will result in a step change improvement in the security of air cargo supply chain, in addition to large economic savings and logistics improvements for airlines. The proposed technology will overcome the existing security concerns in the supply chain, as well as reducing the ULD weight, minimising supply chain imbalances for ULD availability and the current high maintenance requirements. Following the research program, the new technology will enable our SME consortium partners to jointly commercialise a new product, with forecast revenues of 105 million Euros to 2020 and significant advancements in air cargo supply chain security.", 23211.0, 1100820.0, "SAFEGUARD", "Better aviation cargo containers", "Unit load devices (ULDs) are special containers for aviation cargo, and generally arrive at the aircraft pre-loaded. While very successful and ubiquitous, they also represent the weakest link in aviation security.", "The EU-funded SAFEGUARD project aimed to develop an improved device. To begin, the eight-member research group reviewed existing technological solutions for improving aviation cargo security without increasing weight. Objectives included developing a prototype of a lightweight, hard-sided ULD having a stacking density greater than 4:1.\n\nThe project also planned to simulate a sealing system, based on electronic locking technology and including radio frequency identification (RFID). The two-year project concluded in September 2013.\n\nAfter a phase of preparatory research, the project pursued three avenues of technical development. These were: design and optimisation of a folding polymer-reinforced ULD; development of a prototype electronic sealing system; and exploration of power harvesting.\n\nThe project pursued an advanced nesting concept, leading to patentable improvements to ULD design. The new concept yields a stacking ratio of 3:1, which addresses the global imbalance of ULD availability. The use of reinforced polymers reduces weight of the secure design while also reducing maintenance costs. \n\nTeam members also studied RFID systems, focusing on international legislation, approved products and transmission protocols. A comprehensive analysis of regulations and technical criteria resulted in the decision to adopt a multi-frequency approach. The multiple frequencies available for listening and response mean a design able to be used anywhere.\n\nThe project team also developed a handheld reader with integrated Wi-Fi and 3G connectivity. The device allows RFID tracking information to be exchanged and stored. The ID information interfaces with a project-developed on-board locking system, which includes a new 12C protocol integrated by project partners. The hand-held device uses an electronic Dallas iButton key for users not wishing to establish an RFID system. Power optimisation tests were performed to increase battery life.\n\nThe group also developed a passive energy-harvesting device, incorporating information tracking and security sealing applications. Developments include a low-power data logger that records the time of impacts. The information can be stored for long periods and interfaced to a computer.\n\nSAFEGUARD helped to improve the technologies used to secure aviation cargo. The developments also mean considerable cost savings for airlines.", null, "http://www.georgutz.com/", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/149393.jpg", "fp7_101433_967610406"], ["4BR", "Innovative Design and Top Quality in Gold Jewellery Casting through Integration of Applied Computer Simulation, Design-of-Experiments and Rapid Prototyping", "Specialist Refractory Services Ltd", "The European jewellery industry is facing a severe competition from Far Eastern countries on both home and export markets. The import of large volumes of low cost jewellery puts the margins under pressure. European companies, often employing less than 10 persons, traditionally show poor attraction for co-operation and research. This attitude hinders changes and innovation, though current production methods have rejection rates up to 20 or even 30% and up to 25% of job places could be lost in the sector over the next five years. Aim of this project is to introduce a new approach into jewellery design and production, through the development of a simulation tool on broad basis, the exploitation of the full potential of existing Rapid-Prototyping Technology and the use of Design of Experiment. Detailed research and analysis will be carried out both on materials properties and on processes, the latter being examined both at a laboratory and industrial scales. The SME proposer group represents the entire chain of suppliers, manufacturers and developers of jewellery materials, equipments and technology. RTD performers consist of complementary research partners with large and worldwide recognised experience. The strength of the consortium is unique, guaranteeing actuality and quality to the work to be performed, resulting in an estimated increased turnover of 20% in the first two years for the SMEs. Research results will be filtered, with the aim of extracting the main outcomes and recommendations of general applicability relevant for process innovation in the gold jewellery casting industry. Training sessions will be held, aiming at focussed transfer of the increased knowledge to the casting technicians, production engineers and product designers.

Obesity is a key economic and healthcare challenge for Europe. Effective interventions and commercial programmes for weight loss are widely available, but most people re-gain their lost weight. Currently few comprehensive solutions exist to help Europeans manage weight loss maintenance (WLM).\nCurrent research suggests the most promising evidence-based behaviour change techniques for WLM are self-monitoring, goal setting, action control, building self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation. Recent research also suggests that stress management and emotion regulation skills are key enablers of relapse prevention and weight-regain.\n\nInformation technology offers attractive tools for teaching and supporting these techniques, some of which are currently delivered through resource-intensive face-to-face therapies. ICT-delivery includes networked-wireless tracking technologies, weighing-scales and activity sensors, online tools and smart-phone apps, multi-media resources and internet-based support. A broad choice of tools is most likely to be acceptable to users, who can pick and choose their own preferred technologies. \nThe NoHoW project tests whether ICT-based delivery of the most promising evidence-based behavior change techniques is effective for WLM. We will carry out a large-scale international 3-centre trial of information technology tools that implement the most up-to-date behavioural science research. This trial will establish the effectiveness of these ICT tools in supporting WLM, linked to studies of European consumer needs and behaviour.\n\nImpact: The project will directly feed results into development of new products and services from the UK\u2019s largest commercial weight-loss provider, Slimming World providing immediate benefit to 500,000\\ consumers.
