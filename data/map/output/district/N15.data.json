The platform will encourage a new wave of young international designers working on innovative closed loop/ circular economy design. It will provide a platform for these young designers to launch careers, it will provide visibility and mobility for these young designers and foster creativity and entrepreneurial activity, whilst encouraging new business models and market development in partnering countries. It will also provide transnational mobility and networking opportunities for the cultural organisations and introduce them to a new working model. REED will take waste materials from businesses such as hotels; cardboard, bottles, plastic, paper, towelling etc. and to turn these waste materials into high quality up-cycled products that can be offered back to the hotels for use in the hotels. Thus introducing a new sustainable business model for each partnering country and in turn provide opportunity for the setup of a sustainable social enterprise. REED is an international project including partners from UK, Czech Republic, Spain, Armenia and Slovakia.  Each partner will run a design project linked with a college or design institution, and a business or hotel in their respective countries. The design institutions will select a group of  approximately 20 students  from 1st or 2nd year of degree (or equivalent) design courses . Each partner/ college will select a group of students to produce a selection of works made from waste materials and for each to work on the project for a period of 3 - 6months culminating in an exhibition(s) in each partnering country of the final products. From these final exhibitions x3 designs/ pieces will then be selected from each country to go forward for an international touring exhibition which will be toured in selected European venues.", "http://www.actiondog.net", "ACTIONDOG CIC", "creative_559665-CREA-1-2015-1-UK-CULT-COOP1_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["4RX", "INVOLVER EDUCATION LIMITED*", 42507.0, "European Public Spaces (16.03.01.05)", "fts_2016_57169", 2016], ["4RX", "INVOLVER EDUCATION LIMITED*", 38195.0, "Communication of the Commission Representations, Citizens' Dialogues and 'Partnership' actions (16.03.01.04)", "fts_2016_59564", 2016], ["4RX", "INVOLVER EDUCATION LIMITED*", 76933.0, "Communication of the Commission Representations, Citizens\u2019 Dialogues and \u2018Partnership\u2019 actions (16.03.01.04)", "fts_2017_50962", 2017], ["4RX", "INVOLVER EDUCATION LIMITED*", 49718.0, "European Public Spaces (16.03.01.05)", "fts_2017_55902", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "N15"}
