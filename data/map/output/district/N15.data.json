REED will take waste materials from businesses such as hotels; cardboard, bottles, plastic, paper, towelling etc. and to turn these waste materials into high quality up-cycled products that can be offered back to the hotels for use in the hotels. Thus introducing a new sustainable business model for each partnering country and in turn provide opportunity for the setup of a sustainable social enterprise.

In 2009 we started with three interns abroad - today in 2014 we have more than 20 students who want to do placements for 6 weeks or for one year at our partner organisations all over Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first time we would also like to apply for two staff mobilities. On the one hand for a teaching assignment of one of our arts teachers at our partner organisation in Palermo, Italy. In cooperation with the local staff, she wants to offer a creative workshop for children and teenagers entitled \"Imagining Ideal Living\". This workshop might hopefully initiate a strategic partnership in the long run. On the other hand we apply for a staff training mobility for one of our foreign language teachers and project co-coordinators in form of a job shadowing/observation period at our partner schools in England. The main objective here is to gain a deeper insight into the British educational system. This seems vital to us with regard to a professionalisation in giving advise and support to our interns at English partner institutions and to modulate and match our joint vocational training programme for the students' \"year of acknowledgement\". We plan to present the outcome of these experiences at our school/ on our homepage etc. and hope to motivate and encourage other staff members to benefit from a mobility abroad. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides intensifying and consolidating our contacts to already existing partner institutions for long term mobilities, one of our objectives for 2014 is to enlarge the possibilities for short term mobilities for our educators and educational therapists in order to encourage them more easily to go abroad, develop their professional skills and intercultural competences and widen their horizons. Altogether we would like to offer 7 short term mobilities for educational therapists at institutions in Austria and 7 short term mobilities for educators at institutions in Austria and Denmark. 14 long term mobilities we would like to offer to educators and educational therapists at institutions in Italy, Turkey, Austria and England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared, however, that we might not be successful in achieving our last objective as requested, because the new Erasmus+ grant support for long term mobilities for German students has been cut considerably (around 30 % compare to the former Leonardo grant support). The consequence of this is that the students in their \"year of acknowledgement\", especially those who do their work placements at communal schools in England, would need to be economically priviledged and be able to finance their mobility abroad from own resources. We can't expect them to work for an additional income because they have to do full time work placements.", "https://www.welbourne.haringey.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000162_3"], ["6NU", "Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsbildung durch Sensibilisierung f\u00fcr Gemeinsamkeiten und Unterschiede in der EU-Bildung", "Triangle Children's Centre", 87532.0, "Target group and training objectives\r\nOur target group are students being trained to be state registered educators.

It has hosted a number of staff from these schools over the past 2 academic years and is seeking through EXPERT to cement and progress the link with these schools.Gladesmore  aims to address the key concerns of raising attainment in basic skills through more effective and innovative teaching methods, particularly in supporting independent learning at home and at school. The objectives of this project are:To enhance the capabilities of staff to improve assessment techniques to benefit and support learners with diverse learning needs.To develop staff competences in the use of ICT to support a range of subject areas.To introduce staff to new technologies and build confidence in applying them.To progress primary-secondary liaison and communication, with a particular emphasis on provision for students with additional educational needs.To improve skills and techniques of staff in teaching English as an additional language.To share good practice and develop expertise in preparation for migrants and second language learners in both countries.To introduce new teaching methods to staff in the three  participating schools and to  disseminate this learning to a wider network of schools.24 staff, teaching and non-teaching, representing all curriculum and intervention areas ,will participate directly in the EXPERT mobilities over the 2 years, with the remaining  GCS staff benefiting from the visits by our Finnish colleagues  and the disseminated results.The 5 day visits to Finland will comprise job shadowing, observations and meetings to share resources, expertise and methodology. Staff will visit primary and secondary schools.
