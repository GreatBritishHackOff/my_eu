Proctor Group Limited", "Europe can become the leader in CO2 emission reduction by applying innovative solutions to its built cultural heritage. According to the European Recovery Plan one of the actions that needs to be taken to tackle the current crisis, is investing in energy efficiency. Historic urban buildings consume 4% of all energy and are responsible for 3% of CO2 emissions. Therefore, improving energy efficiency in historic buildings and historic districts is essential.\n\nNevertheless, most of the current developments in energy efficiency address new construction without dealing with the unique problems of historic structures. A number of technologies and products have been developed, however many of the solutions are not acceptable for historic structures due to the necessity of preserving integrity and authenticity.\n\nTherefore, the main goal of EFFESUS is to develop and demonstrate, through case studies a methodology for assessing and selecting energy efficiency interventions, based on existing and new technologies that are compatible with heritage values.  A Decision Support System will be a primary deliverable. The environment in historic buildings and urban districts is controlled differently from modern cities and accordingly the project will also develop a multi-scale data model for the management of energy. In addition, new non-invasive, reversible yet cost-effective technologies for significantly improving thermal properties will also be developed. Finally, existing regulations and building policies may not fit cultural heritage specificities so the EFFESUS project will also address these non-technical barriers.\n\nThese outcomes will be achieved through 10 work packages, performed by an interdisciplinary consortium of 23 partners from 13 countries. Due to the attractiveness of this niche market, 36 % of the project budget is allocated to SME\u2019s, which will work together with large companies, research institutions and end users throughout the duration of the project.", 95645.0, 5383898.0, "EFFESUS", "Energy-efficient heritage buildings", "An EU project is improving the energy efficiency of historic buildings, without affecting their cultural value. The project is adapting existing technologies and developing new candidates, with implementation to be guided by a decision support system (DSS).", "Europe is rich with historic buildings; however, energy efficiency was not a design consideration when they were erected. Although improving such buildings' efficiency would significantly contribute to meeting greenhouse targets, current technologies are often incompatible with maintaining a building's historical integrity.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Energy efficiency for EU historic districts sustainability' (http://www.effesus.eu (EFFESUS)) project aims to improve the situation while preserving heritage value. The project plans to advance new technologies, and develop and demonstrate a DSS for assisting users with implementation. In addition, the project will offer a training and awareness programme. EFFESUS runs for 4 years to August 2016, and involves 24 partners.\n\nWork during the project's first 18 months consisted of collating existing data on historic buildings. The phase included defining impact indicators regarding new technologies, analysing EU national policies and development of a structured categorisation method. The project also created a multi-scale data model for energy assessment.\n\nThe group developed a repository of existing technologies for improving energy efficiency. Work included characterisation of a retrofitting solution, and describing present options for supplying renewable energy within historic districts. The group collected best practices and analyses of historic building management, and structured the information within a component of the DSS to be developed.\n\nEFFESUS also adapted existing solutions to improve energy efficiency in historic cities overall. The project matched building demand and supply of utilities using a geographic information system. The team also analysed the opportunities presented by a smart grid solution, involving locally generated renewable energies. Other options included energy storage technology and optimised indoor climate solutions.\n\nResearchers investigated optimised insulated window designs, a radiation-selective coating, aerogel insulation for blow in and advanced mortar . Strategies for integrating the methodology and the DSS have been defined.\n\nProject efforts will result in methods and systems allowing the introduction of energy-efficiency technologies to old buildings, without compromising their historic value. The main tool will be a DSS, which will help to minimise the environmental impact of the target buildings.", "http://www.effesus.eu/", "http://www.proctorgroup.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/153629.jpg", "fp7_105775_953436475"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["7JB", "CASTLE WATER LIMITED", 69.0, "Buildings and related expenditure \u2014 Commission Representations (16.01.03.03)", "fts_2016_66863", 2016], ["7JB", "CASTLE WATER LIMITED", 46.0, "Buildings and related expenditure \u2014 Commission Representations (16.01.03.03)", "fts_2016_70653", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "PH10"}
