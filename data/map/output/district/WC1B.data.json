Their period was marked by political stability and an astonishing florescence in every field of endeavor. The Gupta kingdom and its networks had an enduring impact on India and a profound reach across Central and Southeast Asia in a host of cultural, religious and socio-political spheres. Sometimes characterized as a \u2018Golden Age\u2019, this was a pivotal moment in Asian history. The Guptas have received considerable scholarly attention over the last century, as have, separately, the kingdoms of Central and Southeast Asia. Recent advances notwithstanding, knowledge and research activity are fragmented by entrenched disciplinary protocols, distorted by nationalist historiographies and constrained by regional languages and associated cultural and political agendas. Hemmed in by modern intellectual, geographical and political boundaries, the diverse cultures, complex polities and varied networks of the Gupta period remain specialist subjects, little-mentioned outside area studies and traditional disciplinary frameworks. The aim of this project is to work beyond these boundaries for the first time and so recover this profoundly influential dispensation, presenting it as a vibrant entity with connections across several regions and sub-continental areas. To address this aim, three PIs have formed an interdisciplinary team spanning linguistics, history, religious studies, geography, archaeology, Indology, Sinology and GIS/IT technologies. This team will establish a scientific laboratory in London that will generate the synergies needed to delineate and assess the significance of the Gupta Age and its pan-Asian impacts.

Pottery vessels are no longer viewed in western archaeology as a material correlate of sedentary farming life in the Neolithic. Despite recognition of pottery vessels in hunter-gatherer contexts in some parts of northern Europe and the former Soviet Union, their impact on, and role in, hunter-gatherer lifeways has been regarded as peripheral to mainstream European prehistory. This proposal seeks to rebalance the evidence and the debate, placing the innovation, dispersal and use of pottery vessels among hunter-gatherers in NE Europe at the heart of the enquiry. Virtually nothing is known of the choices underlying the adoption of pottery vessels or the uses to which they were put. Similarly, there is little understanding of the environmental contexts that led to the emergence of pottery or the timing and dynamics of its apparent westward dispersal across NE Europe, nor its legacy following the introduction of food production. Addressing these lacunae is the motivation for this proposal. INDUCE will tackle these important challenges with an integrated approach to reconstructing the contextual life histories of over 2000 pottery vessels, enhancing chronological control of early pottery horizons through 600 14C dates, investigating the typology of several thousand vessels from across the study region, creating spatio-temporal models for the spread of different pottery traditions and documenting the impact of the introduction of farming on the use of vessels for resource utilisation.

The project involves, as partners, a world-renowned museum, an archaeology institute, and research partners working in the manipulation of 3-D objects, semantic analysis and ICT integration. The project is driven by the needs of the archaeological institutes, exemplified by a pertinent use case, the Salamis collection shared between Cyprus and the British Museum.

We anticipate that the insights to be gained from the use of these tools will lead to faster and more accurate reconstruction of cultural heritage objects for study and exhibition, to greater opportunities for reunification of objects between collections and greater insights into relationships between past societies which can be communicated as coherent narratives to the public through new forms of virtual and tangible displays, involving the reconstructed objects themselves as well as 3-D printed objects and digital visualisations.", 338137.0, 2152617.0, "GRAVITATE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_197127_998580760"], ["3HH", "Evaluating mHealth technology in HIV to improve Empowerment and healthcare utilisation: Research and innovation to Generate Evidence for personalised care", "Npms-Hhc Cic", "EmERGE will develop a mHealth platform to enable self-management of HIV in patients with stable disease.

In this process, the powers of capital have increased while trade unions have lost ground. \r\n\r\nIn response to globalisation, trade unions throughout the world have been placing increasing importance on transnational relations. Such relations are even more important for Turkey and the Turkish union movement. Admittedly, with attempts to bring its democracy up to Western standards and to enter the EU, Turkey will move to expand international connections. Global economic and politic trends, especially in European nations, have historically been influential on evolution of trade unions in Turkey. \r\n\r\nIn Turkish mixed economic system, the state has been not only a party in industrial relations, but a major employer. The state continues to be the largest employer in Turkey. Over one million workers in the public sector are members of a union, while the number of workers under collective labour contracts is approximately 600 thousand. On one hand the state is the legislator deciding on social policies and on the other it is subjected to the very same laws and liable as an employer. \r\n\r\nTrade union activities in the public sector are gaining momentum and scope of the contracts made are extending. The public sector holds a special position in employer-employee relations, because it is involved in matters of public interest directly. Since interests of both workers and the public have to be reconciled simultaneously, labour disputes regarding public services are trickier than those in the industrial sector, which makes affairs of public sector unions very crucial. Furthermore, officials carrying out negotiations with unions find themselves on a difficult spot, because working conditions for the public sector are determined by law. \r\n\r\nThe health sector is among the largest in the public sector. According to statistics published by the Ministry of Health, there are more than 124 thousand medical doctors in Turkey, while total number of health workers exceeds 700 thousand. Given their publicly critical duties and responsibilities, it is clear how complicated and arduous it can be for health workers to pursue union rights compared to other public servants. \r\n\r\nThe European Commission\u2019s 2014 Progress Report of Turkey voices serious criticism regarding social and union rights and working conditions. The report mentions many issues such as strike delays, workplace accidents, union obstruction and child labour. According to the report, laws and regulations concerning union rights need to be revised and a more permissive environment should be created for trade unions. Rights to unionisation, participation in collective bargaining and strike need to be adjusted in accordance with the EU acquis and international standards. The report states that small amendments to union rights made by the government are not satisfactory and that fundamental issues and violations of social and union rights persist. \r\n\r\nBy analyzing advancements and applications relating to the future of trade unions in Turkey and globally, impediments to public sector unions can be overcome. To do so, forming active union policies, developing collective struggle strategies, presenting resulting propositions to the public, and opening social dialog are among the practices required. Considering the pioneering role of public sector unions, if they become weak and ineffective, private sector unions as well as the Turkish union movement in general would suffer. \r\n\r\nConsequently, education and training in union affairs for the public sector is of critical importance. This project involves training of 20 union representatives and officials in an EU member state. The participants are going to gain awareness, knowledge and experience in trade unions of EU standards. Following the mobility activity, a workshop will be organized and resulting reports and booklets will be distributed along union branches throughout Turkey and will be presented to the Ministry of Health. Seminars will be organized in various health institutions in order to disseminate gained knowledge to other health workers.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-1-TR01-KA104-017025_1"], ["3QJ", "Handweit Europa 2016 - Handwerkerweiterbildung in Europa 2016", "Language in London Ltd", 24699.0, "VIMOB Pforzheim e.V.
