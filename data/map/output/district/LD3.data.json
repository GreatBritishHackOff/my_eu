The EU only produces 4.1 % of the total world ethanol, the US has become in recent years the biggest ethanol producer in the world with 48% of the world total and more than two fifths of the global fuel ethanol supply was produced in Brazil in 2006. The major different types of biofuels are between first and second generation biofuels. First generation biofuels are made from food crop feed stocks while second generation biofuels are made from cellulosic biomass. The primary pathway for producing bioethanol fuels from lignocellulosci biomass is biochemical conversion (acid hydrolysis which is an expensive procedure and produce low yields 10 to 40% and enzymatic hydrolysis but unfortunately cellulose is difficult to digest, produce low yields &lt;20% and take 2 days, in addition although research is continuously improving this process, at present biochemical conversion is not been proven at industrial scale). The project concept involves development of a multipurpose prototype for the reaction of various types of cellulosic biomass on a continuous or batched basis using microwave plasma or combined microwave plasma and chemical/enzyme hydrolysis. This technology will breakdown the cellulose molecule structures and allow an efficient (90% yield efficiency) and rapid release of the sugars for the fermentation reaction (&lt;1/2 day). In addition, by using microwave plasma we will use 10 times less energy, chemicals, infrastructure accessories and solvents making the conversion of cellulosic biomass into bio-ethanol an economical procedure.", 339029.0, 1192770.0, "MICROGRASS", null, null, null, "http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/BLT/BEST/RFM/micrograss/index.htm", null, null, "fp7_107794_996479449"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0SG", "Violencia entre la juventud europea: Situaci\u00f3n y respuesta.", "Powys Youth Group", 14426.0, "CONTEXTMany young Europeans are getting the wrong message about how they have to behave to different faiths, races, sexual orientations and genders. The news confirm the fact that youth violence, both psychological and physical, is increasing and occurs in different situations, which must be eradicated from a democratic and tolerant Europe.\"Youth Violence: current situation and response\" is a project, in which young people from Finland, Germany, Poland, UK and Spain wish to meet each other between 10 and 18 June 2016 at the Salesian center Urnieta, Spain, and intend to discuss this issue and seek solutions to share in their home society.OBJECTIVEThe objective of this project is to analyze the reasons why  those  situations of violence take place in their respective countries and the answers given. To Analyze, through team work, what type of social support groups exist in our communities, how these structures work and what kind of requirements are needed to be part of them. We use this information to develop democratic and tolerant values among young people.PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTSThe group consists of 50 boys and girls in equal amounts, and aged between 15 and 17. Some of them come from rural areas,  and this is a great opportunity for them to travel and experience other cultures.ACTIVITIESThe project will be used as a launch platform where young people through non-formal learning (workshops, debates and conferences) develop various skills. (ICT, language skills, artistic skills, etc)., Because we want to encourage young people to become more involved in their community, make them feel proud of their European citizenship and help them transmit the values of a real European democracy. Also, we will meet  political authorities and we will show our concern about it. Finally, we will perform an interactive public event in one of the busiest places in town to convey our concern and our message.METHODOLOGYOnce the project is approved, the project leaders will keep in touch online through Skype or email. As the dates of the meeting et closer, they will specify more issues. The leadership of the workshops will be distributed, and presentations and evenings will materialize. Similarly, through a brainstorming, we will reach a consensus document by all standards. We also, as the host country, will take care of logistics and security measures and transport.During the meeting, the education will be non-formal, with group dynamics, where they develop social and language skills on the theme of the meeting as well as multiculturalism.IMPACTWe hope this project will also have an impact on local communities in the future. The most widespread media in the area will be invited, such as El Diario Vasco, UTB (Local Television Urnieta) AIURRI (weekly and biweekly in the area), BERRITU (a local magazine) SALES BERRIAK (  Salesian school local magazine) and local radios, and thus enhance the international dimension of youth activities. Also making use of ICT, we will publish our meeting and its evolution in two websites: www.boskotaldea.org and www.gazteaukera.euskadi.net (Basque Government) and the facebook of our association (https: //www.facebook .com / profile.php? id = 100009306422338 & f ref = ts) and on the Facebook page created for this event only.We hope to create a model of \"learning democratic and tolerant values\" in which local young people can learn together and from each other. We believe the representatives and student councils as well as youth parliaments, where they exist,  to be very useful tools for participation and welfare of young people, and to be very good examples of democratic learning in our societies. We hope that once the meeting ends, the young extend what they have learned in other forums with the help of the audiovisual material that we will provide. In addition a Youthpass Certificate will be issued attesting them as participants in these meetings sponsored by Erasmus +, which surely will have changed them for the rest of their lives.We want young people to make use of good manners, and thus use technology to spread what they have learned,  and we want to encourage society to do the same, use technology for good aims, and not  to slander.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-3-ES02-KA105-006897_2"], ["0SG", "\"Me, you, EU - Together we are better\"", "Powys Youth Group", 8112.0, "\"Me, you, EU - Together we are better\" - is an international short-term project to enhance international cooperation among actors on the field of European youth work and to ensure better quality in european youth projects. 10 different organizations from eight different cEuropean countries are going for the chance to exchange experinces, to learn from each other, to make arrangements, to set up new projects and to make the new program erasmus+ a success for all.

Young people from Finland, Germany, Romania, Sweden and Wales gather together to talk about the current refuge situation in Europe. The participants are between 15 and 17 years old, who want show that young people are also interested about politics in Europe and want to influence. The aim of this project is to gather information about the current thematic of refugees. See, what is going on in different European countries concerning refugees and to think, what could young people, as well as European Union, do to help refugees. Lots of propaganda against refugees is spred in internet and social media, where young people are active. Young people should learn to read and think critically, and construct  their own opinions, learn to be more open-minded and tolerance. We believe, that refugees should be distributed between the EU countries equally. Each country should take responsibility of the situation according to their capacity. At the moment the southern European countries feel that they are left alone and the east European countries protect theirselves. Dublin 3 - agreement has been dismissed, national interests of the EU member states are becoming more and more the upper hand and the Schengen agreement threatens to fail - all to the detriment of refugees but also to the detriment of the EU. In UK and Wales- the home secretary Theresa May wants to regulate a new law. The immigrants coming from outside of Europe, who want to stay longer than 5 years, should have approximately 35,000 pounds income annually in order to remain in England. In Finland the biggest issue at the moment is sexual harashment of women in public places. New nationalist and populist groups has been founded, like for example \"Soldiers of Odin\", whose members always wear black jackets and who claim to protect the native Finns from the refugees - especially the women. Sweden takes in most of the refugees  in Europe after Germany in relation to their population. The aim is Sweden is to integrate the refurees to the labour market as soon as possible by offering them for example language courses. Thus sweden has started controlling the incomers on the borders. At the same time the problem in Romania is, that nodoby of the refugees want to stay in Romania. The refuge camps are all most empty and  the people want rather to go the central Europe, where the richer European countries are. In Germany the pressure of the current government so high, that it can sooner or later also lead to a failure.  Against this background, we want to broach:- Causes of migration  (unemployment, war, religion, environmental issues, etc.)- What are the positive and the negative aspects of migration.-  Perceive migration as an opportunity- What happens in the project partner countries - which sociopolitical debates are there?- Demonizing Islam? What impacts have been caused by the terrorist attacts in France and Denmark?- How can we promote a democratic development?- Refugee policy is more than just policing, surveillance and border protection ..", null, null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE04-KA105-013634_3"], ["0SG", "Heimat: Europa", "Powys Youth Group", 29638.0, "\"Heimat: Europa - Native Country: Europe\" is a project, which tackles questions of EU awareness, democracy, international relations and culture. Together with our partners from Wales/GB, Finland and Romania we want to give young people (aged 15-18) the chance to discuss the European crisis and the debate over future progress within the European Union. Central piece of this meeting is how the participating countries view/assess their role within the EU and how they deal with this. The comprehensive role/function of the European Union will, of course, also be an important topic. Furthermore, we will deal with terms (and definitions of those), like 'home country', the EU's motto 'In varietate concordia' and the current political debate over national tendencies/the enforcement of national interests vs. the European idea/attempts to stay united. Together with our partners from Finland, Romania and Wales, we intend to give particularly young people from the participating countries the chance to learn viewing and dealing with situations/questions like these objectively and constructively-critically. With this meeting we hope that they will be able to relate to each other the specific situation within their home countries and start thinking about what they themselves can do to make things better.\r\n\r\nThe word 'home country' or 'Heimat' is a word that does not necessarily exist in other languages. It is a concept that is hard to put in words or describe. It might mean, remembering one's village, where one used to live long time ago. It might mean, finally having found a club or association, where one feels at home, because there are people who share a frame of mind. The exact meaning of 'home country' can be given only by each individual person, but are these ideas/feelings applicable to 'Europe'? Many British citizens have found the answer to be 'No' in 2016. Negotiations about Britain's leaving the EU have begun. However, since then the voices demanding a second referendum have become louder. A recent survey by the British institute YouGov found that 58% of all British participants in the survey think a second referendum should be held. 47% of them even think that 'Brexit' was a mistake. Nevertheless, officially, Great Britain is still on its way out.\r\n\r\nFinland, Romania and Germany do not think about leaving the EU, however, the number of Europe-sceptics are on the rise and have been so for a few years now.\r\n\r\nAgainst this background we would like to discuss:\r\n- What does 'Europe' mean to each individual participant in this meeting? What is meant by 'European values'?\r\n- What does the term 'home country' mean? AND is 'Home Country: Europe' an oxymoron?\r\n- How can one develop a common/mutual identity, if we are/are not speaking a common/mutual language?\r\n- Which (possibly competing) identities can be found within Europe?\r\n- What is currently happening in the participating project countries - what is part of their current political debates (shift to the right in Germany, 'exiting Brexit', etc.)?\r\n- Where does patriotism end and chauvinism begin?\r\n- What are the possibilities offered in the 'European idea' (a united Europe, a peaceful world)?\r\n- What can we personally do to promote and support a democratic development/movement?", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE04-KA105-016528_2"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["0BW", "Delivering Nutrient Management Plan (DNMP)", "Wye and Usk Foundation", "This multi-partner project will correct environmental problems and issues with the county\u2019s infrastructure currently impacting on the economy of Herefordshire.
