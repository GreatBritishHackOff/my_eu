However, there is growing evidence to suggest that retinal neurodegeneration is an early event in the pathogenesis of DR. For this reason, it is reasonable to hypothesize that therapeutic strategies based on neuroprotection will be effective not only in preventing or arresting retinal neurodegeneration but also in preventing the development and progression of the early stages of DR (ie. microaneurysms and/or retinal thickness).\nEUROCONDOR (European Consortium for the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy) is a solid and well balanced consortium (ophthalmologists, endocrinologists, basic researchers) which has been created in order to implement the first clinical trial using eye drops for treatment of the early stages of DR. The participants are top leaders in their field and central readings will be performed by the Coordinating Centre of the European Vision Institute Clinical Research Network (EVICR.Net).\nThe main objectives of the project are the following:\nPrimary objective: To assess whether the selected neuroprotective drugs (brimonidine and somatostatin) administered topically are able to prevent or arrest neurodegeneration, as well as the development and progression of the early stages of DR.\nSecondary objectives: 1) To determine the prevalence of functional abnormalities related to neurodegeneration in those patients without or with minimal microvascular damage under ophthalmoscopic examination. 2) To compare the effectiveness of the selected drugs. 3) To evaluate the local and systemic adverse effects of the selected drugs. 4) To identify those patients most prone to progressive worsening (characterization of phenotypes and circulating biomarkers). 5) To determine the molecular mechanisms by which the selected drugs exert their beneficial effects.", 258521.0, 6173319.0, "EUROCONDOR", null, null, null, "http://eurocondor.eu/", "http://www.gloshospitals.org.uk", null, "fp7_102516_990769932"], ["8ER", "Factory ECO-friendly and energy efficient technologies and adaptive autoMATION solutions", "Spirax-Sarco Limited", "The production landscape is changing. Traditionally, energy costs represented a small part of the production expenses, meaning that the design of production facilities usually neglected efficient energy usage in favour of maximization of production throughput; the energy consumption of factories has been always high, but energy cost has increased dramatically in the last decades, pushing industrial representatives to search for higher level of efficiency. According to the International Energy Agency, manufacturing is responsible for approximately 37% of global primary energy consumption being the largest energy consumer and CO2 producer. Improvement of energy/resource efficiency is the key to reduce environmental impact and is mentioned as driver to reach European 20/20/20 goals.\nIn order to achieve such results, an overall optimization of the whole concept of Factory has to be pursued, introducing a new holistic vision of the production environment both at methodological and technological level. Factory-ECOMATION project will aenable European manufacturing industries to overachieve Europe 2020 program targets developing breakthrough innovations for cost-effective, highly productive, energy-efficient and near-zero-emissions production systems, by means of:\n\u2022\tDefinition of a holistic perspective of the economically and ecologically oriented production environment;\n\u2022\tDevelopment of a comprehensive sensing, monitoring and data evaluation system which could grant access to an organic view of all the materials, energy, wastes and emissions flows within the factory;\n\u2022\tExtension and development of new technologies to increase energy efficiency by reducing its consumption at machinery and production level, and by recovering it whenever wasted;\n\u2022\tDevelopment of advanced emissions abatement technologies\n\u2022\tIntroduction of a new adaptive management and automation platform to optimize production taking into account not only productivity targets but also eco and energy-oriented ones.\nFactory-ECOMATION will focus on two industrial sectors, relevant for European economy and crucial to achieve the EU 20/20/20 objectives: the iron&steel industry, a highly energy intensive industry, and the woodworking industry, a high carbon footprint industry, to demonstrate the effectiveness of project outcomes on low-energy domains characterized by discrete processes. This two-pilots approach will grant the inter-applicability of the project results to other continuous and discrete industrial sectors as well.\nTo assure the impact on European economy, Factory-ECOMATION partnership includes relevant Industrial players in technology development and manufacturing, together with highly-recognized Research Centres and IMS partners granting a global scope to the project objectives.

The 'Factory eco-friendly and energy efficient technologies and adaptive automation solutions' (http://www.factory-ecomation.eu/ (FACTORY-ECOMATION)) project continues to work to develop new production systems that can be productive, cost effective and energy efficient. These new systems will hopefully play a pivotal role in achieving the EU\u00a020/20/20 objectives.\n\nResearch is being conducted through the analysis of two environmentally prominent sectors: the iron and steel industry, and the woodworking industry. The project began by analysing the targeted end users and formalising the project framework and requirements. The three main pillars of the framework serve as outlines for the research and development activities of the partners. The first pillar involves awareness of the complete performance of a production environment. Technology has been developed to provide more comprehensive monitoring of both productivity and environmental impact.\n\nThe second pillar looks at increasing the efficiency of the equipment directly involved in production. FACTORY-ECOMATION is working on solutions to deal with wasted energy, such as low-temperature equipment to save heat and high-efficiency wood working machines.\n\nFinally, the third pillar analyses the impact of decision making, management and control systems on energy efficiency. Decisions rely on the performance of the equipment, which is dependent on the control systems, which are constrained by the decision makers. Thus, solutions to improving the quality of both the control systems and decision making are being developed.\n\nResearch and analysis of results already achieved continue in pursuit of the ultimate FACTORY-ECOMATION vision. This vision is of factories that fully incorporate environmental concerns into their structure and management, and monitor, manage, predict and prioritise their own environmental effects.

Glaucoma is an age-related major cause of blindness. The eye disease is characterized by an irreversible damage to the optic nerve head caused by increased intra-ocular pressure. The current screening and basic diagnostics for the disease involve intra-ocular pressure measurement, visual field tests and detection of structural damage to the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fibre layer. The present methods have high rates of false positive or false negative results since the in depth analysis of optical nerve head damage is not possible due to the poor resolution of available optical technologies. A leading candidate is optical coherence tomography (OCT), but the required axial resolution is ~1 \u03bcm, well beyond the 3-5 \u03bcm resolution of commercial systems.

The progressive use of Biojet Fuel (BF) is one of the most effective to tackle this, with clear targets already set globally. However, two issues hold back the development of the BF industry: 1) Cost: biojet fuels are currently around 3 times more expensive than fossil based kerosene. 2) Feedstock sustainability and availability: edible oils currently represent the most economically viable option as feedstock for BF production, but this raises strong concerns in terms of competition with food production. To capture the huge potential of this market, Green Fuels Research (GFR) has developed and patented a technology for producing BF from biodiesel obtained from any raw material, including waste cooking oils and fats, through a process bolt-on to existing biodiesel production facilities. This allows obtaining a fuel with the necessary properties to be certified as BF within the ASTM standard D7566, through a process which presents the following advantages with respect to the alternative approaches: 1. Flexible feedstock: process input is biodiesel, which is already largely produced from many primary feedstocks, including Used Cooking Oils (UCO) or vegetable oils. 2. Scalable and low capital intensity: the GFR process is highly scalable, less complex and capital-intensive to operate. 3.
