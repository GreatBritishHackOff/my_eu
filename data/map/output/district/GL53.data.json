However, there is growing evidence to suggest that retinal neurodegeneration is an early event in the pathogenesis of DR. For this reason, it is reasonable to hypothesize that therapeutic strategies based on neuroprotection will be effective not only in preventing or arresting retinal neurodegeneration but also in preventing the development and progression of the early stages of DR (ie. microaneurysms and/or retinal thickness).\nEUROCONDOR (European Consortium for the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy) is a solid and well balanced consortium (ophthalmologists, endocrinologists, basic researchers) which has been created in order to implement the first clinical trial using eye drops for treatment of the early stages of DR. The participants are top leaders in their field and central readings will be performed by the Coordinating Centre of the European Vision Institute Clinical Research Network (EVICR.Net).\nThe main objectives of the project are the following:\nPrimary objective: To assess whether the selected neuroprotective drugs (brimonidine and somatostatin) administered topically are able to prevent or arrest neurodegeneration, as well as the development and progression of the early stages of DR.\nSecondary objectives: 1) To determine the prevalence of functional abnormalities related to neurodegeneration in those patients without or with minimal microvascular damage under ophthalmoscopic examination. 2) To compare the effectiveness of the selected drugs. 3) To evaluate the local and systemic adverse effects of the selected drugs. 4) To identify those patients most prone to progressive worsening (characterization of phenotypes and circulating biomarkers). 5) To determine the molecular mechanisms by which the selected drugs exert their beneficial effects.", 258521.0, 6173319.0, "EUROCONDOR", null, null, null, "http://eurocondor.eu/", "http://www.gloshospitals.org.uk", null, "fp7_102516_990769932"], ["8ER", "Factory ECO-friendly and energy efficient technologies and adaptive autoMATION solutions", "Spirax-Sarco Limited", "The production landscape is changing.

According to the International Energy Agency, manufacturing is responsible for approximately 37% of global primary energy consumption being the largest energy consumer and CO2 producer. Improvement of energy/resource efficiency is the key to reduce environmental impact and is mentioned as driver to reach European 20/20/20 goals.\nIn order to achieve such results, an overall optimization of the whole concept of Factory has to be pursued, introducing a new holistic vision of the production environment both at methodological and technological level. Factory-ECOMATION project will aenable European manufacturing industries to overachieve Europe 2020 program targets developing breakthrough innovations for cost-effective, highly productive, energy-efficient and near-zero-emissions production systems, by means of:\n\u2022\tDefinition of a holistic perspective of the economically and ecologically oriented production environment;\n\u2022\tDevelopment of a comprehensive sensing, monitoring and data evaluation system which could grant access to an organic view of all the materials, energy, wastes and emissions flows within the factory;\n\u2022\tExtension and development of new technologies to increase energy efficiency by reducing its consumption at machinery and production level, and by recovering it whenever wasted;\n\u2022\tDevelopment of advanced emissions abatement technologies\n\u2022\tIntroduction of a new adaptive management and automation platform to optimize production taking into account not only productivity targets but also eco and energy-oriented ones.\nFactory-ECOMATION will focus on two industrial sectors, relevant for European economy and crucial to achieve the EU 20/20/20 objectives: the iron&steel industry, a highly energy intensive industry, and the woodworking industry, a high carbon footprint industry, to demonstrate the effectiveness of project outcomes on low-energy domains characterized by discrete processes. This two-pilots approach will grant the inter-applicability of the project results to other continuous and discrete industrial sectors as well.\nTo assure the impact on European economy, Factory-ECOMATION partnership includes relevant Industrial players in technology development and manufacturing, together with highly-recognized Research Centres and IMS partners granting a global scope to the project objectives.

These new systems will hopefully play a pivotal role in achieving the EU\u00a020/20/20 objectives.\n\nResearch is being conducted through the analysis of two environmentally prominent sectors: the iron and steel industry, and the woodworking industry. The project began by analysing the targeted end users and formalising the project framework and requirements. The three main pillars of the framework serve as outlines for the research and development activities of the partners. The first pillar involves awareness of the complete performance of a production environment. Technology has been developed to provide more comprehensive monitoring of both productivity and environmental impact.\n\nThe second pillar looks at increasing the efficiency of the equipment directly involved in production. FACTORY-ECOMATION is working on solutions to deal with wasted energy, such as low-temperature equipment to save heat and high-efficiency wood working machines.\n\nFinally, the third pillar analyses the impact of decision making, management and control systems on energy efficiency. Decisions rely on the performance of the equipment, which is dependent on the control systems, which are constrained by the decision makers. Thus, solutions to improving the quality of both the control systems and decision making are being developed.\n\nResearch and analysis of results already achieved continue in pursuit of the ultimate FACTORY-ECOMATION vision. This vision is of factories that fully incorporate environmental concerns into their structure and management, and monitor, manage, predict and prioritise their own environmental effects.

The current screening and basic diagnostics for the disease involve intra-ocular pressure measurement, visual field tests and detection of structural damage to the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fibre layer. The present methods have high rates of false positive or false negative results since the in depth analysis of optical nerve head damage is not possible due to the poor resolution of available optical technologies.

To capture the huge potential of this market, Green Fuels Research (GFR) has developed and patented a technology for producing BF from biodiesel obtained from any raw material, including waste cooking oils and fats, through a process bolt-on to existing biodiesel production facilities. This allows obtaining a fuel with the necessary properties to be certified as BF within the ASTM standard D7566, through a process which presents the following advantages with respect to the alternative approaches: 1. Flexible feedstock: process input is biodiesel, which is already largely produced from many primary feedstocks, including Used Cooking Oils (UCO) or vegetable oils. 2.

Apprentices and students in the fields of nursing, midwifery, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, special education and in medical technical assistance in radiology, laboratory, functional diagnostics, and surgical technical assistance are invited to participate in this project. By participating in an internship abroad, students will be able to further develop their practical skills and expertise as well as improve their foreign language and social skills. As a pool project, participation is open to all vocational students of health care specializations throughout Germany. Prerequisites for participation and application forms are available on the project website (www.dezernat4.uni-hannover.de/eu-praktika).Additionally this project offers ten teachers from the vocational schools actively involved in the network one to five-week mobility exchanges for a short training and/or teaching period abroad in educational institutions, companies or organizations active in the European health sector. Teacher mobility exchanges include teaching and/or training at a vocational school or job shadowing and/or training at a relevant enterprise or organization.Over 45 vocational schools throughout Germany are actively involved in the project partner network \u201cHealth Care Work Exchange\u201d administered by the EU Liaison Office (EU-Hochschulb\u00fcro Hannover/ Hildesheim) at the Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover. Meanwhile more than a hundred partner organizations throughout Europe, such as university teaching hospitals, private medical practices, rehabilitation centers, public and private hospitals and clinics offer such Erasmus+ internships. In addition, numerous educational institutions offer their services in securing and organizing internships in their region. Together this network aims to create a mobility project to meets students\u2019 needs for high-quality and technically challenging internships abroad. Emphasis is placed on designing internships that meet each participant\u2019s specific needs for gaining practical experience in their profession and that serve to improve social skills with regard to communication, perception and reflection when interacting with patients of different age groups and cultural backgrounds. Internships lasting from 4 to 22 weeks will provide students a means to learn more about various approaches to health care and different types of social systems, to gather new experiences abroad, and to improve their foreign language skills. In this manner, they will gain a more comprehensive understanding of their profession and improve their career opportunities. The internships satisfy the practical training requirements set up by the state ministries of education and the vocational schools, while at the same time incorporating the personal interests of the students. Thus such internships can enhance the attractiveness of vocational training mobility throughout.This project can also contribute significantly to the internationalization processes of the partner organizations.

Leonard Cheshire Disability has grown to have over 200 services throughout the UK over 65 years. We support over 21,000 disabled people in the UK, providing innovative services that give disabled people the opportunity to live a life without barriers. We believe that disabled people should have the freedom to live their lives the way they choose - with the opportunity and support to live independently, to contribute economically, and to participate fully in society. The needs and aspirations of disabled people are at the heart of what we do. The EVS project will take place in three Leonard Cheshire services, located across the UK: Marske Hall, Mickley Hall, Gloucestershire House. The project involve 6 volunteers, 2 volunteers per every service and will last 12 months with starting dates in September and October 2016. The volunteers come from Spain, Germany and Greece. Volunteers selected for this project have background in social work, psychology or physical education and have some experience supporting people with disability. They are great candidates with the right among of experience and interest in disability issues, and they all express their wish to continue working towards bettering the conditions and rights for people with disability and interest in developing their competences in the field social care and working with disabled people.The overall aim of this project is to empower and enable disabled people to access social, leisure and employment activities. This is achieved through the following objectives:1.  To accompany residents with the activities they wish to do inside and outside our care homes2.  To assist with and introduce new activities to the activities programme and introduce intercultural perspective3.  To support residents in fulfilling personal long-term goals4.  To support fundraising efforts to raise funds that will support the above mentioned aim5.  To raise disability awareness for the volunteers and in the local communityThe EVS volunteers support our staff teams in providing an active and stimulating environment for our residents. Our volunteers are actively involved in shaping their EVS experiences by developing the activities plan with residents and staff. We encourage volunteers to bring their own ideas, skills and passions to share with residents. As a result, the role is varied depending on their own skills and interests, and the needs of residents and the activities they like to engage in. Our residents make sure their home has a lively atmosphere with activities such art and craft workshops, quizzes, IT workshops, music group, cooking and gardening. The care homes also organise special events such as fundraisers, holiday celebrations, cultural evenings or sports nights. Volunteers also support on social outings, day trips and educational events such as attending college classes. Hence the delivery of activities is heavily influenced by the skills and motivation of our volunteers to design a creative and fun activity programme.EVS volunteers have lasting impact on many different aspects of our service users\u2019 lives. Volunteers enable disabled people to be more independent, enjoy a greater choice of activities and form a healthy social relationship. The local community learn more about other cultures and disability.  With support from EVS volunteers we are able to host more  local social events that spread the EVS program and disability issues, as well as creates a warm and welcoming environment within our care homes.  An active and varied social life for our residents is often key to their health, happiness and quality of life.  Thus the impact of the EVS project at addresses a very basic human need of developing real and meaningful relationships, which is a fantastic result. Leonard Cheshire Disability is a huge supporter of the EVS program due to the massive flow on effects this program has for our residents, local communities we work with, staff and our volunteers.
