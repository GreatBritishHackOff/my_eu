This illness, which affects 5 citizens in every 1000 over the age of 60, is chronic, degenerative and currently incurable. Although there are promising therapies on the horizon, the best patient outcome available today can only be delivered on basis of early and accurate diagnosis, leading to superior management and care planning, resulting in enhanced quality of life for the patient. Across the developed world, the population is ageing, leading to increases per capita in neuromotor conditions. Based upon Manus\u2019 existing technology, it is intended to develop: \u2022 A novel intelligent decision support system, trained against live patient data capable of discerning markers of PD \u2022 A communications framework, supporting secure data transfer between remote clinics and healthcare centres and the MANUS central service \u2022 An enhanced version of the unique and patented hand-held stylus, capable of detecting the minute movements indicative of Parkinson\u2019s and other neuromotor diseases \u2022 A preclinical trial, conducted at the University Medical Centre Groningen (Netherlands), demonstrating the efficacy of the system.

Early onset of PD is characterised by movement disorders such as tremors, rigidity and slow movement that is later followed by behavioural and cognitive disorders.\nScientists of the EU-funded 'Diagnosing Parkinson\u2019s Disease by neuromuscular function evaluation' (DIPAR) project are working on developing a device for early diagnosis of PD.\nThis consortium consists of five European small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and four research and technological development institutes.The DIPAR device will incorporate a communications framework and intelligent decision support system with the hand-held device developed by one of the project partners.\nThe final prototype will be evaluated in pre-clinical trials for efficacy in determining neuromuscular function and differentiating between PD and other disorders.\tDuring the first project period itself, considerable progress was made.\nResearchers compared studies on PD patients with healthy individuals to develop baseline values for data analysis.\nProject partners successfully designed a functional discrimination script to automatically differentiate between healthy and PD patients.\nThey also developed an innovative preliminary prototype diagnostic platform and a data communication network with collaboration tools.For the hand held stylus of the device, researchers selected suitable sensors for future integration.\nAll the requisite ethical approvals were obtained and the first clinical study was completed using the diagnostic prototype.Future work will focus on optimising the device as well as the diagnostic and communications platform.\nThe clinical studies will compare PD patients with other patients having muscle disorders and test its efficacy.\nEfforts will also be made to develop a model for commercialisation of the device after clinical validation and obtaining approvals.Putting the DIPAR device on the market will boost European and global healthcare systems and improve quality of life for PD patients.\nThe revenue from sales and support will also enhance the competitiveness of participating SMEs.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112515.jpg", "fp7_96874_988270048"], ["3BE", "Energy Local Storage Advanced system (ELSA)", "Gateshead College", "Integration of distributed small/medium size storage systems can allow operating distribution grids much more flexibly, thus realizing smart grid features like local demand-supply balancing, congestion relief, peak shaving and effective RES integration. \n\nHowever, few technologically mature decentralized storage systems are commercially available today at affordable prices, while both viable business models and the underlying legal and regulatory framework are lagging behind. \n\nAs an answer ELSA will implement and demonstrate an innovative solution integrating low-cost second-life Li-ion batteries and other direct and indirect storage options, including heat storage, demand-side management, as well as use of intermittent RES.\n\nThe core idea is to consider Storage as a Service towards building and district managers for local energy management optimization, and towards DSO for enhanced network operations. ELSA will adapt, build upon, and integrate close-to-mature (TRL>=5) storage technologies and related ICT-based energy management systems for the management and control of local loads, generation and single or aggregated real or virtual storage resources, including demand response, in buildings, districts and distribution grids. \n\nData models ensuring interoperability among building, districts and DSOs and novel business models enabled by energy storage \u201cas-a-service\u201d will be developed.\n\nDifferent configurations will be demonstrated along six test sites, where a set of different storage technologies will be integrated. Safety issues and social acceptance will be dealt with by communication and product reliability demonstration.\nA technical, economic and environmental validation, involving relevant stakeholders, will be carried out to nurture the European-wide replication of the ELSA concept, prepare the ground for a concrete roll out of the resulting TRL9 technologies and provide input for regulatory framework adaptation.", 554705.0, 10702647.0, "ELSA", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_194415_963932166"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1HH", "Gateshead - Goes Local", "Gateshead Council", "This application will help develop the Local Action Group (LAG) and formulate Local Development Strategy (LDS) as part the Gateshead \u201cGoes Local\u201d CLLD programme.
