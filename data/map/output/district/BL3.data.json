An Integrated Pan-European Approach", "The University of Bolton", "This industry-academia proposal addresses the development of technology which will enable understanding of regeneration of injured or degenerated tendons. Biomimetic fibrous composites will be designed and developed that will mimic the structure of native tendons. The project objectives are to fabricate an optimally stabilised and effectively functionalised three-dimensional collagen-resilin composite scaffold to match the properties of native tendons. Evaluation of the optimally stabilised and effectively functionalised biomimetic constructs will be conducted in vitro (cell studies, structural and mechanical properties) and in vivo (small and large animal studies). Using textile technologies, we aim to fabricate fibre extrusions that will allow future commercialisation of the three-dimensional biomimetic construct. In meeting the scientific and technological objectives of the IAPP Programme, an inter-sectorial academic industry multidisciplinary approach will be taken which maximises the potential offered by contemporary technologies This IAPP Programme will foster increased scientific dialogue between academics, industry and clinicians. One of the key benefits will be the transfer of key scientific and experimental knowledge between the institutions enabling the consortium to widen the scope of their work, beyond what is available within their own institution and merge the available technologies. This programme will provide training of both seconded and recruited staff, both in the host and parent institutions.

Tendon injuries are not only painful but also disabling as they take a long time to heal.", "The EU-funded TENDON REGENERATION project is a collaboration between industry and academia working to develop a 3D scaffold that mimics natural tendons in order to promote tendon healing. Scientists will design and develop fibrous composites of collagen\u2013resilin in a 3D construct to match the properties of tendons and enhance the tendon regeneration process.\n\nTo obtain collagen\u2013resilin composites, the preparation processes for collagen and resilin were first successfully optimised. Suitable biocompatible cross-linking methods were selected to obtain stable collagen fibres that resemble native tendon structure. Several composites of fibre have thus been produced, stabilised and functionalised using different combinations of cross linkers and functionalising molecules. These are currently being evaluated using in vitro and in vivo tests.\n\nIn addition, cell isolation and culture protocols for tendon stem cells and tenocytes (also called tendon cells) were optimised to maintain their phenotype in culture. Studies are under way to assess whether the novel collagen-resilin composites can maintain tendon-derived cell phenotype and differentiate other stem cells towards tenogenic lineage.\n\nResearchers will further optimise processes to develop prototypes of collagen\u2013resilin composite constructs with and without tendon derived cells that are suitable for clinical application. Successful outcomes will provide effective therapeutic options for patients suffering from tendon injuries.\n\nStudy outcomes have yielded novel insights into the role of the biophysical characteristics of the 3D collagen-resilin composite on the cellular behaviour, scientific publications in high impact factor journals and several podium presentations and invited talks in international conferences and meetings.

The success of the Web 2.0 services has encouraged Telcos to expose their assets as Telco services in order to provide third parties with facilities to build their business. Moreover, the exposure of network infrastructure as services is facilitating the entry of new API-driven telco agents that bring traditional telco services (telephony, messaging, IP location, etc.) to the Web.<br/>Yet, the technologies underlying each of the different mashup types are heterogeneous, which makes integration challenging. Also, mashups do not offer a universal composition model either, since mashup development is not vendor independent.<br/>In this landscape, OMELETTE aims at researching on the development, management, governance, execution and conception of converged services with a specific focus on the telco domain. OMELETTE will create a sound model of mashups that follows the REST architectural style (also supported by standard widget technology), as well as a standard specification of a mashup-containing platform that may guarantee portability and interoperability among different vendors and versions. These concepts will be based on a solid theoretical model of mashup foundations and the specific requirements gained from the telco domain.

Cutting across these levels of scale is the categorisation of changes as exogenous or endogenous relative to forms of learning and to the TEL community.
