Indeed, WBL and transnational mobility experiences are important to (re)motivate VET learners (preventing early school leaving) and to provide them with the competences required by the companies. \r\n\r\nTherefore the DUAL MOB project will give students the chance to develop technical competences and soft skills \r\nthrough WBL mobility experiences abroad. These experiences will be carried out during VET qualification path and with the final aim of assessing and validating the learning outcomes acquired during the mobility so as to facilitate future inclusion of the young participants in the labor market or to continue their studies.\r\nThe project will involve 300 students (1/3 suffering from economic/social/cultural disadvantage) enrolled in VET courses in one of the 150 VET Centres run by the Consortium Members in 18 Italian Regions. \r\n\r\nThe project has a wide sectorial and geographical coverage. The sectors in which the students will have the chance to take their internship are the following:\r\n- Agribusiness (Backery and Pastry; Agriculture)\r\n- Arts and Crafts (Fashion, Wood)\r\n- Mechanic and Construction (Mechanics, Masonry, Electric, Electronic, Thermo-hydraulic)\r\n- Graphics\r\n- Administrative, Selling\r\n- Tourism and Catering\r\n- Personal Service (Beauty and Hairdressing)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the partnership will involve 16 partners from 6 different countries (ES, IE, UK, FR, DE, FI). Such a wide partnership will result in fruitful experience for the students, suitable to any professional path. \r\n\r\nThe DUAL MOB project promotes 2 different types of Transnational Mobility: 1) 3-4 weeks internships in a company abroad, carried out by students attending an Initial VET course; 2) 3-4 weeks in a VET centre abroad, with periods spent in company or other context, carried out by students attending an Initial VET course. \r\n\r\nThe Learning Outcomes will be valorized and recognized through the ECVET system. In fact, the Consortium Members will take advantage of the experience and the ECVET tools developed during the GORES project. \r\nThe project will have an impact on the development of professional and transversal skills of VET students and staff involved (accompanying persons), as well as on the offer of VET  training provision which will be possible thanks to the improvement in the use of the WBL approach and by strengthening the mutual trust among project partners.\r\n\r\nThis project will also lay the groundwork for enrichment in terms of organizational and teaching methods that the sending organisations may exploit during the pilot project related to the Dual System in Italy.", "http://www.cambria.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005930_8"], ["7AB", "Apprentis Europ\u00e9ens 2017-2019 : l\u2019Europe, pour se former et s\u2019ins\u00e9rer en confiance", "COLEG CAMBRIA", 347857.0, "This joint project, managed by Apprentis d'Auteuil, and coordinated nationally by a steering committee for the second consecutive year includes 11 French establishments of the Foundation, involved in these mobility\u2019s projects formany years.

These internships play a key role in their development on a personal level, strengthening their adaptability and self-confidence. They become more autonomous and mobile, a huge advantage in terms of employability, in particular for these young people who have very often experienced failure and of exclusion.\r\nSix adults, working for the vocational schools involved will also benefit from these mobility experiences. They will exchange on teaching practices and will discover ways to improve their skills.

The aim of their professional internship is an opportunity to acquire new information and knowledge and to grow professionally. In the school year 2017/18 we have planned the mobility for teachers of electro-technical subjects.

We want to link the project Erasmus with other our project - the Centre of vocational training and education for electro technology, which is currently being prepared. The content and form of teaching have to meet with requirements of quality, technical facilities, new technologies and new teaching methods. But there are also some essential aspects - the management of the school, improvement the quality of school, spreading its goodwill and the competitiveness in the region.  School management`s mobility will be focused on these aims. We expect successful implementation of the Centre of vocational training and education and its use in cooperation with project partners.\r\nWe would like to realize 7 turns with 60 pupils and 6 teachers.

So as to achieve the goals set out in this strategy, we seek to develop a gradually more comprehensive project in terms of mobility opportunities, especially for young people attending vocational education. There are already very positive effects on learning, methodologies, performance, motivation of students and teachers, as well as on the organizational culture of our School, highlighting as well European citizenship in its different dimensions. The participation in mobility programs and the contact with different cultures/ realities have contributed to the enrichment of the participants' professional curricula, the acquisition of transversal skills and the development of language skills, which can only be achieved in activities that take place in contexts of diversified training.\r\nIn what concerns the School management, the implementation of the mobility projects allowed establishing teamwork dynamics, flexibility and time management, diversification of intervention strategies among students and a greater openness to innovative projects. It also contributed to the increased sense of belonging to the school community and to the sense of identity of the School.\r\nPursuing the implementation of the Internationalization Strategy, and taking into account the increase in the number of students at school, as well as the excellent results achieved, we intend to maintain the activities developed in the previous application, extending the possibility that more students from the 1st and 2nd years of the professional courses may participate in mobilities, which favour the contact with the realities of other schools/ training centres from European countries.\r\nThus, the GPS-5 project foresees the execution of three types of activity, addressed to all the elements of the school community, and to be carried out according to the planned schedule:\r\nA1 - 25 mobilities (5 flows/ 5 groups/ 5 students) for the 12th grade students (55 days for the development of practical training in companies) in partner institutions from Spain, Malta, Italy and Austria; and 6 mobilities of 150 days in companies for graduate students, in partner institutions from Spain, Italy and Poland;\r\nA2 - 50 mobilities of 16 days for periods of training in schools/ training centres abroad for the 1st year students (30 students) and the 2nd year (20 students) from professional courses in partner organizations from the United Kingdom, Croatia, Austria, Poland and Finland;\r\nA3 - 10 staff training mobilities abroad with partner organizations from Greece, Spain, Cyprus, and Finland.\r\nThe increase in the number of mobilities in A2 aims not only to respond to the students\u2019 requests, but essentially to promote educational success, increase the motivation levels for the school/ professional journey and thus fight against school dropout among young people from disadvantaged socio-economic contexts. With the previous participation of the 1st year students in mobilities, there has been an improvement in the levels of students performance, in terms of attendance, behaviour and reduction of modules left to do. It has also increased the number of applicants seeking the school just because it provides learning opportunities beyond the traditional classroom/ workshop context.\r\nSince most of these students are under 18, we consider it essential to include in each flow a teacher who will accompany them throughout the mobility period. In the case of A1, where there is also a large number of underage students who have never been abroad, the monitoring of a teacher in the first week of mobility is of the utmost importance in order to support the students\u2019 integration in the social, cultural and labour context.\r\nThe changes in the partnerships are related to the change of our courses, and we tried to adapt the flows and the labour contexts to the profile of the courses and to the participants themselves. In the selection of the partners, we took into account the training areas of the groups involved so that the participants could observe and compare the educational and formative realities of the countries involved.\r\nIn the longer period mobilities, the official language of the host country was also taken into account, so that the language barrier would not be an obstacle to the efficient performance of the planned activities/ tasks. The selection criteria for participants will remain identical to those of previous projects, always bearing in mind the equal opportunities concerning gender and special educational needs. They also assure that any student wishing to participate in a mobility can be selected. \r\nThe GPS 5 project still includes both a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the different activities, as well as the internal and external dissemination of the good results, so as to enrich and share good practices.", "http://www.cambria.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PT01-KA116-035423_11"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LL12"}
