According to the WHO the burden of cancer can be reduced by systematic and equitable implementation of evidence based strategies for cancer prevention, early detection and management of patients with cancer.  33% of the cancer burden could be reduced if detected early and treated adequately. The WHO concludes that, early diagnosis of cancers could save the developed world an average of \u20ac40 billion per year on medical costs and \u20ac80 billion per year on realized productivity. The direct savings on medical treatment alone would be more than \u20ac10.000 per patient if early detection was possible. Early cancer diagnosis today consists of recognition of some of the \u2018early\u2019 signs by the patient themselves or detection from screenings carried out on specific population groups.    If something suspicious is found the next step is to perform a blood analysis and/or to look with non-invasive imaging techniques. Current imaging techniques are widely used in diagnostic procedures but they cannot give conclusive evidence of  cancer. Today, only a biopsy and the subsequent pathologist\u2019s interpretation can give a definitive diagnosis of cancer  and this is not always enough EDOCAL will use a tunable blue laser to selectively excite an accumulated photo sensitizer, called proto-porphyrin. This sensitizer is taken by the patient to enhance contrast between healthy and cancerous tissue. Reflected light is filtered using state of the art ultra narrow photonic crystal technology. Initial studies have shown that it is possible to detect cancerous tissue using blue light in combination with FDA approved sensitizers (ALA-5 and Proto-Porphyrin). This tool will be based on the principle of preferential retention of proto-porphyrin by cancer cells. The purpose of this project is to create a breakthrough tool for early cancer detection by combining state of the art laser and imaging technology with leading medical research.", 1025286.0, 1562673.0, "EDOCAL", "Early cancer detection by laser", "Early detection of cancer saves lives, improves quality of life and reduces health care cost.

EU-funded \u2018Early detection of cancer using photonic crystal lasers\u2019 (http://www.edocal.eu (EDOCAL)) project aims to create a breakthrough tool for early cancer detection.\n\nCell in the tumours tend to create additional blood vessels to support their growth. The molecule protoporphyrin (PpIX) is generally present in blood vessels and exhibits red fluorescence when excited with blue light in the 375 - 425 nm range. Cancer cells could be detected by observing the red fluorescence at a matching excitation wavelength. To increase the intensity of the red fluorescence, a porphyrin prodrug (Pp) can be administered either orally or locally to create additional PpIX in the cancerous tissue. By using a tuneable laser system and combination of endogenous fluorescence and exogenous fluorescence (produced by administration of a Pp), it is possible to accurately distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue.\n\nDuring 2 years of the project researchers developed tuneable blue laser system for research purposes. The spectra from 290 sites in the oesophagus of 77 patients were registered and showed that it is possible to detect early cancer with 80 % sensitivity and 81 % specificity. Proof of concept has been achieved for early detection of cancer based on a tuneable blue laser technology. The first patent application has been filed and new filings for the latest results are under way.\n\nThe project achieved the goal of creation of the device that can be used as the first line cancer detection. This device will reduce the need for biopsies, make the diagnosis more reliable, less dependent on human interpretation and make early cancer detection available to more people.", "http://www.edocal.eu", "http://www.2mel.nl", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58269.jpg", "fp7_95907_994769921"], ["6HQ", "Development of a combined sea anchor and connector to be deployed by helicopter in order to prevent sea vessels in drift from grounding or colliding with offshore installations", "Dr. Vernikov Magnetics Ltd", "The European Union is the largest maritime power in the world with 40% of its fleet. Almost 90% of its external and over 40% of its internal trade is transported by sea. The natural wealth of the ocean has an intrinsic value for the biodiversity of Europe as well as for the support of key functions for adjacent regions and populations. Oil spills have a catastrophic impact on the marine environment and incurs enormous costs and suffering in the aftermath. A large part of the oil spillage comes from drifting ships running aground or breaking up.   The project idea is to develop a novel and salvage tool by innovatively combining a light-weight sea anchor and connector. The system will be deployed by helicopter onto a ship in distress, thus reducing drift velocity and through that the chance of grounding or other potential disasters by providing extra time for Emergency Towing Vessels (ETVs). Further functionality is added by including a towing connection to the sea anchor, thereby providing arriving ETV with an easy-to-access pick-up buoy, which relieves them of the hazardous task of connecting to the ship in distress. A major issue in the project is lowering the weight of the system to enable helicopter transport. This calls for studies in material science and will influence the dimensioning of the anchor, which will be based on simulations of multi-body behaviour at sea under the influence of wind and waves. At the ship and tanker traffic increases there is a reduction in ETV preparedness, leading to a potentially unsafe situation. The ShipArrestor will aid in restoring and improving the oil spill prevention and salvage preparedness for ships up to 100,000 tonnes. In addition to the obvious environmental benefits of introducing the ShipArrestor, fisheries and tourist enterprises, of which a vast proportion is SMEs, will not have their livelihood ruined from oil pollution.

The Recommendation of the Council of the European Union spells out fundamental principles of best practice in early detection of cancer and invites EU Member States to take common action to implement national cancer screening programs.\n\nReports from the US state that Oral Cancer is the most expensive to treat.

This gives an additional cost to the medical health care system of  \u20ac6.944B per year.\n\nHistorically the death rate associated with this cancer is particularly high not because it is hard to discover or diagnose, but due to the cancer being routinely discovered late in its development. Today, there is still no comprehensive program to opportunistically screen for the disease, and without that; late stage discovery and high mortality rates are most likely to continue.\n\nIn a previous Research for SMEs project: (EDOCAL),  the SMEs 2M, CST and TG developed a preliminary test system for early cancer detection using state of the art telecom laser technology.

It is recommended to do this test at least 4 times a day. Many diabetics fail to do so even once for a number of reasons:  pain avoidance, disliking the sight of blood, cost of the test strips, the test protocol and the risk of infection. This failure to manage blood glucose levels has serious long term implications. Heart disease and blood vessel disease are the biggest complications that people with uncontrolled diabetes face. Blood vessel damage or nerve damage also lead to chronic foot and leg ulcers called diabetic foot that can result in amputations. More than 60% of leg and foot amputations not related to an injury are due to diabetes which is also the cause of new blindness and kidney disease. Our solution is a non-invasive glucose monitor that will allow people with diabetes to monitor their blood glucose levels in a quick and painless manner, for a low price.  \nWhen using normal Raman Spectroscopy very little light undergoes Raman scattering, therefore high integration times are required to achieve a usable signal-to-noise ratio.
