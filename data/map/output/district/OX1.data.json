To achieve this, EPAD will also provide the analytical infrastructure to make correct observations regarding an intervention\u2019s value as an agent for secondary prevention. All this must exist in the right ethical, legal and social context. It must also be sustainable by being of value to numerous partners and stakeholders in the long term. The EPAD Consortium has been carefully designed to achieve the aim of secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nCurrent and recent drug development programmes in AD have been limited through the collection of heterogeneous samples of patients with advanced brain disease and an inability to measure effectively an index of disease course modification.\nRecruiting participants from clinics and the community for AD prevention trials with limited clinical background is both a risky and cost-inefficient strategy. Creating a disease register of people consented to enter secondary prevention trials delivers a degree of readiness that ensures better knowledge of a participants suitability and a more rapid throughput of screening for the trials. The EPAD Consortium has the necessary reach and influence from its partners to develop such a \u2018readiness\u2019 cohort.\nBy delivering an earlier, risk stratified population with run-in data in the EPAD Cohort across both clinical and biological domains; we can ensure a more homogenous population for study. We can also track changes in disease status as the basis for deciding on an intervention or combination of interventions likelihood of success in larger Phase 3 confirmatory trials.\nMost of the scientific community still consider A\uf062 dysregulation as central to AD so targeting this pathological process is a rational first step in what will be a standing trial. Other disease processes can be targeted when candidate interventions and intermediate phenotypes to reflect success are available.\nEPAD High Level Structure:\nThe IMI-EPAD Consortium will form the third part to a proposed IMI\u2013AD Platform (with IMI-EMIF-AD and IMI-Aetionomy) to produce a globally important superstructure for the secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nIMI-EPAD brings together all the major cohorts in Europe purposed for the exploration of disease processes and risks for dementia. In drawing from over 40 cohorts with almost 250,000 participants in 11 countries we have the basis for the EPAD Register from which we can draw the EPAD Cohort. Expertise in basic neurodegenerative sciences, epidemiology, statistics and trial design ensures that the standing proof of concept adaptive trial will have the optimal chance of delivering meaningful and definitive answers on an interventions likely success in confirmatory trials.\nIn establishing the International Scientific Synergy Group (ISSG) we have ensured that our work is visible to similar international initiatives and vice versa hence, through pooling know how and sharing data we can collectively overcome this devastating global disease.\nEPAD Work Packages and National Leadership:\nWe have created 8 work packages with 4 of these bound together in the EPAD Delivery Cluster which includes the scientific bedrock (WP1), the statistical engine room (WP2), the aggregation of suitable subjects (WP3) and trial delivery (WP4). These trial delivery activities are supported by project management (WP5), dissemination (WP6), business model and sustainability (WP7) and ethics, legal and social implications (WP8).

EMIF aims to address this by developing a common Information Framework that enables improved access to these data sources, enhancement through linkage of the different sources and collection of additional new information.

Resistant bacteria dramatically reduce the possibilities of treating infections effectively, and drastically increase the risk of complications with a fatal outcome.  Antimicrobial resistance, however, is an unavoidable consequence of antibiotic use and therefore new, effective antibacterials will always be needed and once developed should be used carefully, avoiding the overuse which can drive resistance.  Despite the recognized need for new antimicrobials for clinical use, the reality is that only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to market in the last 30 years and many drug developers have left the field.

Societies are in constant flux, and have become more diverse than ever before. It is thus not surprising to see, within the social sciences (and also in politics and public debate), concern about the impact of these changes for societies. In fact, this increasing concern has escalated to pessimism about the possible effects of diversity and multiculturalism. Robert Putnam (2000) in his book Bowling Alone showed that in diverse communities, people tend to have less trust in neighbours, lower political efficacy, lower levels of voter registration, and are less likely to work on community projects and contribute to charity. Since then, this negative view of diversity has been voiced across multiple social sciences (e.g., economics, sociology, and political science). The present project proposes to evaluate critically these pessimist findings. First, the increasing mobility of people around the world sets a range of challenges that clearly require certain forms of both identity change and development of new identities for individuals and their societies.

One of the main schemes proposed for the realization of a quantum computer is linear optical quantum computation (LOQC). In this scheme, the quantum information carriers are photons, and the computation takes place by their propagation through optical devices that change their respective states, followed by the measurement of their final state.\nFor robust manipulation of the multi-photon states, integrated photonic circuits have been recently introduced. Up till now, however, all experimental demonstrations of multi-photon manipulation with these devices used up to four photons, due to the difficulty to create many identical photons at once.\nThis is since the current single-photons sources are all random, having success probabilities lower than one , and thus the probability of simultaneous emission of N such sources  decays exponentially with N. The exponential speed-up promised by quantum computation algorithms is therefore canceled-out.\nOne way to overcome this could be the use of quantum-optical memories. These devices can store single photons for a pre-determined period of time.

They either do not address the issue, or give conflicting advice (e.g. the same codes that condemn complicity in torture also state that the physician should act in the best interest of the patient, but these professional obligations could conflict when the patient is a torture victim).Though medical complicity can have significant effects and is presenting medical professionals with unresolved ethical dilemmas, problems of medical complicity have received little sustained theoretical treatment in medical ethics. Most existing discussions either remain at the level of complex philosophical theory, or at the level of practical decision-making with little philosophical basis. This project aims to bridge this gap. It will do so by developing a clear account of medical complicity, and by deploying this account to yield concrete guidance for medical professionals and policymakers confronted with dilemmas of medical complicity.

The chosen applications require extremely rapid \u201cfront-end\u201d data processing, event selection, efficient transmission, and high-selectivity\nThe training programme is based on 5 technical work packages, focused on VDSM CMOS technology, 3D vertical interconnectivity, Silicon Photonics and Optical Wireless Communications, FPGA and CAM memories, and ACTA backplanes. The network comprises 5 academic nodes, 4 European Lab nodes, and 2 companies (Philips and THALES-SA) for a total of 11 full partners, all leading in their respective fields. Such a multi-disciplinary approach will provide unique opportunities for the career progression of the trainees and strengthen important research partnerships within Europe. International associated partners in Europe (CERN, and other leading companies), the USA (FNAL and companies) and Korea (Seoul University and Samsung) bring advanced and complementary technical capabilities.

All of these events are associated with transient radio emission, a tracer both of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, and coherent emitting regions with huge effective temperatures. By studying radio bursts from these phenomena we can pinpoint the sources of explosive events, understand the budget of kinetic feedback by explosive events in the ambient medium, and probe the physical state of the universe back to the epoch of reionisation, less than a billion years after the big bang.

The first is that contrary to popular belief, traditional medicinal knowledge is not under threat from western society introducing new plants and ideas. Researchers found that rather than traditional knowledge being handed down unchanged through generations, non-indigenous or newly introduced plants have long been incorporated into traditional practices.\n\nPLAWOMAD also addressed the misconception that pharmacological properties of plants alone explain their healing properties, when in fact their symbolic value is just as important.

First, semantic and pragmatic approaches to natural language meaning have diverged into two separate fields, with independent sets of assumptions. While this has been useful in uncovering a number of phenomena, many scholars have pointed out that the division is artificial and prevents linguistic theory from properly exploring a large number of central phenomena in natural language at the intersection of the two dimensions of meaning. Second, a better integration of semantics and pragmatics will have significant practical consequences both for linguistics and for applications in industry.

Recent studies show that plants can fine tune their metabolism in response to a decline in oxygen concentration by switching to alternative pathways to avoid internal anoxia. One of the characteristic features of the response to oxygen deprivation in roots is the very substantial increase in the production of nitric oxide (NO). This small, lipophilic free radical is synthesized in virtually all organisms and is used as a signalling molecule that directly interacts with cell thiols or the catalytic metal centres of proteins.

It will build the necessary resources and know-how for the entire research continuum: basic research, early and late translational research, clinical research, epidemiological research, implementation in care and population based outcome research. There will be a strong focus on discovery-driven translational cancer research in five selected tumours: breast, head-neck, lung, malignant melanoma and pancreatic cancer. Joint structures and programmes for early detection will contribute to optimal treatment, and novel prevention research programmes will integrate prevention activities in clinical cancer centres as well as public prevention. Collaborations will also include molecular pathway-driven clinical research supported by joint structures for omics, biobanking and biomarker validation to support clinical trials aimed at enhancing patient benefits by individualised treatments.\n\nEurocanPlatform is unique in its nature and represents a commitment from cancer centres to join forces and resources in order to fight cancer.", 110281.0, 12655504.0, "EUROCANPLATFORM", "Structuring the European translational research in cancer", "Cancer is one of the major health issues affecting our society and its incidence is predicted to increase globally as the population ages.

To make matters worse, the number of patients having cancer will escalate from 28 to 82 million in this period. However, European countries have resources and expertise that can be exploited for improving the translational cancer research.\n\nFunded by the EU, the project 'A European platform for translational cancer research' (http://eurocanplatform.eu/ (EurocanPlatform)) is a unique collaboration between 28 European cancer institutions and organisations. The programme targets the whole cancer research continuum (early and late translational cancer research) in an effort to improve cancer patient outcomes and reduce mortality. To realise project objectives, the platform focuses on three key research areas: prevention, early detection and better treatment.\n\nThe project is working on establishing a robust and sustainable infrastructure for translational cancer research \u2014 i.e. sharing resources, technologies and competences. The project has hosted two workshops on roadblocks and remedies for the use of cancer registries in translational research. The platform created a library of video materials and its education programme discussed methods for sharing educational resources among centres. These actions should ensure that quantity and quality of training is equal for all.\n\nThe consortium runs several projects in breast and lung cancer (LC). Expression data from normal breasts, benign breast lesions, ductal carcinoma in situ and breast cancer have been collected from different partners and analyses is ongoing. The ovarian cancer project completed kinome sequencing of 148 high-grade cancer DNAs and 44 matched normal DNAs. Preclincal researchers used genetics to identify potential targets to treat LC with selective c-Raf inhibitors showing promise against certain LC types with worst prognosis. Progress has been made in the development of a suitable intervention model for small-cell LC.

Amongst candidate systems for transporting quantum information, photons are the most promising as they can both maintain coherence over long distances, and interact strongly with electrons to generate nonlinear effects and allow transfer of information between subsystems. As a result, use of photons as 'qubits' has led to ground-breaking demonstrations of quantum entanglement, quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography. However in many of the devices being developed for use in quantum photonics, particularly solid-state devices such as single photon sources, decoherence suffered by the participating electrons is a key limiting factor, reducing the interaction strength and randomizing the quantum state of the photons. In order to minimise the effect of electron decoherence, such devices must generally be operated under cryogenic conditions; even then, in many cases, other noise mechanisms are revealed which limit device functionality. As a result of these practical obstacles and performance limitations, single photon sources have yet to find widespread use and photonic quantum information is largely confined to laboratory demonstrators.The WASPS project seeks to overcome these major bottlenecks in the technology by taking a revolutionary approach. Namely, we plan to exploit the potential of cavity quantum electrodynamics in the bad emitter limit where decoherence is mostly due to the artificial atom. In this limit, preliminary results show that cavity filtering properties and the Purcell effect can be used to engineer the electron-photon interaction, thereby turning electron decoherence into an advantage rather than an obstacle.

Epigenetics are signalling changes that modify gene expression without altering the DNA itself to produce a dynamic epigenome responsive to environmental or other stresses.\n\nChromatin \u2014 DNA with a scaffolding of proteins such as histones \u2014 is a vehicle for cell-to-cell transmission of epigenetic information. EPIGENESYS has built network models of chromatin remodelling using fluorescently labelled proteins and differential labelling of isotopes of 'heavy' and 'light' amino acids.\n\nUsing new tools to visualise the dynamics of heterochromatin during mitosis, new mechanisms have been discovered. Novel software and proteomics methods have revealed interacting proteins during DNA damage repair.\n\nProject researchers are working to link genotype to epigenotype. Extensive bioinformatics analyses revealed different types of sources (origins) with different sets of epigenetic mark enrichments. To predict the epigenome from the original DNA sequence, computational tools were developed to explore methylation dynamics and to predict some regulatory mechanisms that would change gene expression.\n\nThe epigenome is shaped by a wide variety of factors, including nutrition, stress, hormonal input and cell repair. Models of resultant transient signalling giving long-term heritable changes have been assembled. One of the models has shed light on the pluripotent stem cell state where a stem cell can give rise to any of the three germ layers in the mouse trophoblast. As such, this avenue of research has great potential in the field of developmental biology and stem cell therapy.\n\nUltimately, the goal of the EPIGENESYS project is to create an integrated computational framework for epigenetics. Research is also underway for creation of a toolbox for epigenomic analysis.

I address this challenge by proposing a disruptive and novel method to produce graphene nanoribbons directly on arbitrary substrates via a unique probe-based nanomanufacturing approach that combines nanoscale catalysis and nanomechanical exfoliation for a scalable, manufacturable process. This would be a very significant enabler for large scale manufacturing of high performance graphene devices, as this would allow us not only to make standard graphene devices, but also allow one to rework or repair existing chips, create wearable electronics and pattern on arbitrary substrates such as plastics.

The project focused on how people's awareness of the democracy and human rights status of their home regions and countries and of potential migration destinations, affect their migration intentions. The research population consisted of 2 000 individuals aged 18-39 in each of the four research countries: Morocco, Senegal, Turkey and Ukraine.\n\nAttempts to migrate to Europe are preceded by migration aspirations. These migration aims may be assumed to be linked with the perceptions on democracy and human rights status of both Europe and the country of origin. Our definition of human rights and democracy incorporates aspects such as corruption, safety and security, freedom of expression, cultural freedom, job opportunities, social security, and quality of health care/schools. Insight into these perceptions and aspirations as well as their possible interconnections and determinants may therefore be a necessary condition for an informed migration policy in Europe.\n\nThe results of the EUMAGINE project demonstrate the relevance of perceptions on human rights and democracy in the home country and the migration destination in explaining migration aspirations. Perceptions of human rights and democracy status were operationalised by looking at people's views on job opportunities and corruption levels, educational opportunities and gender equality. The analysis showed that negative views on job opportunities and corruption levels in the country of origin on the one hand and positive perceptions of employment and corruption levels in Europe on the other positively affect migration aspirations. It should however be noted that perceived corruption levels at home and in Europe were not found to have significant effects on the migration aspirations of respondents in Morocco, while respondents in Turkey and Senegal were not significantly affected by perceived corruption levels in Europe. Interestingly these results indicate that perceived job opportunities in their own country and in Europe play a more important role in shaping migration aspirations than perceived corruption levels.\n\nIn addition, evidence was found for the level of importance of several individual and/or household characteristics in predicting migration aspirations. Factors such as gender and lifecycle-related characteristics (e.g. age and marital status) were shown to have an impact. So too were household wealth and education, albeit to considerably varying degrees across countries and regions. The cross-country qualitative analyses demonstrated that, in women in particular, marriage and / or parenthood was associated with fewer migration aspirations.\n\nEUMAGINE project outcomes will contribute towards updating the state of the art and joint international research efforts.

Enabling room-temperature operation is a big victory for most technologies. Anything that can be done without fancy cooling or heating minimises complexity, maximising the likelihood of success. It also maximises the likelihood of subsequent uptake because it lowers investment costs and operating difficulties.\n\nSolutions to observed noise issues have now resulted in the ability to store and retrieve gigahertz broadband flying photons in a programmable way in a very low-noise environment.

Since these plasmids can be lost each time bacteria divide, PLASREVO experimentally evolved a highly unstable plasmid to show how it eventually stabilises within a population.\n\nResearchers found that bacterial populations rapidly overcame disadvantages to hosting plasmid parasites by incorporating compensatory mutations that allowed the bacterium to adapt to the plasmid. Antibiotic exposure further reinforced plasmid stability through positive natural selection, since antibiotic resistance genes provided a benefit to those bacteria carrying the plasmid.\n\nIn a kind of feedback loop, benefits provided by the plasmid increased natural selection of bacteria containing compensatory mutations, and vice versa.

The challenges encountered in developing vaccines to elicit broadly-neutralizing antibodies capable of blocking infection with diverse HIV strains, together with the wealth of evidence showing the importance of HIV-specific CD8 T cells in control of virus replication, have prompted efforts to develop T cell-inducing vaccines to combat HIV. However rational vaccine design is hampered by the current lack of understanding of features of an optimally-protective HIV-specific T cell response. HIV\u2019s ability to evade T cell control by mutating to escape from T cell recognition suggests that it may be critical for vaccines to elicit broad T cell responses to limit viral escape. However T cell escape mutations can have fitness costs that may offset the effects of escape; furthermore transmission of unfit virus could lead to reduced viral replication in the recipient. We propose to perform an in-depth prospective analysis of viral interactions with the host CD8 T cell response in acute HIV infection to determine the importance of i. the fitness of the transmitted virus ii. the extent and kinetics of viral escape from the earliest CD8 T cell responses and iii. the viral fitness cost incurred in escaping from these early responses, in determining the prognostically-important set-point persisting viral load.

HIV can evade T cell control by mutating, so it may be advantageous for vaccines to induce responses from which little escape occurs. However T cell escape mutations can also limit HIV\u2019s replication capacity (termed viral fitness), so responses that drive mutations with high fitness costs may also be beneficial.\n\nThe EU-funded project UNFITHIV (Understanding the importance of viral fitness impairment after transmission of HIV: Implication on HIV vaccine design) explored how the fitness of the infecting virus and reductions in viral fitness caused by T cell escape mutations affect the outcome of HIV infection. Nine acutely-infected individuals controlling infection either well or poorly were studied to allow analysis of the relationship between T cell responses, viral fitness and disease prognosis.\n\nUNFITHIV found that there was a trend for individuals controlling infection well to be infected with viruses of lower fitness. Further results suggested that induction of a broad primary HIV-specific T cell response, escape from which occurred slowly and/or incurred high costs to viral fitness, was also associated with good viral control. This emphasises the need for vaccines to elicit a breadth of T cell responses to conserved viral epitopes, any escape from which will reduce viral replication capacity.\n\nThe project partners also tested the hypothesis that CD8 T cells recognise novel epitopes derived from the terminal regions of the HIV genome. While these regions were previously considered to be untranslated, the founder virus sequence was found to be rapidly mutating there over time, and some of these mutations were shown to be driven by T cell responses.

X-ray observations of neutron stars allowed astrophysicists to look into the behaviour of matter under the most extreme conditions of density and magnetic field strength. On the other hand, accreting black holes were the only astrophysical objects where they could study phenomena occurring within a few gravitational radii from their source.\n\nThe study of ACCRETION STATES scientists was based on observations of more than 10 black holes and 50 neutron stars. This is the largest available sample of observations that is expected to provide a reference point to classify their behaviour into distinct accretion 'states'. Distinguished by different spectral and temporal properties, these states reflect the geometry and radiative efficiency of accretion flows.\n\nDuring the so-called hard state, observed in the initial rise of accretion, the X-ray spectrum is dominated by Compton emission and shows high variability. It precedes a soft state of roughly constant luminosity. As thermal accretion dominates, the luminosity of the source slowly decays until a reverse transition to the hard state occurs. This behaviour, known as hysteresis, was found to be common among both neutron star systems and systems harbouring black holes.\n\nThese findings have been described in numerous publications in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international scientific conferences.

This analysis is linked directly to the texts themselves, which makes it easy to switch between philological and philosophical modes of research. This linkage between conceptual and textual analysis embodies a radically new way of thinking about Indian philosophical texts that is located at the very frontier of the discipline and has never been applied to the study of philosophical texts before.

Magmatic volatiles (H2O, CO2, S, Cl, F), including metals will largely be lost from the magma upon eruption. However due to the relative timing of degassing and quenching by eruption trace amounts of volatiles remain frozen in time within the melt. For this project I suggest an inverse method to study magma degassing, whereby the variations in volatile concentrations within the melt will be studied. Such a method has the advantage that it can also be applied to study the output of unobserved or prehistoric eruptions, whereby the volcanic gas has long dissipated. A combined modeling, experimental and observational approach will be used. Metal emissions, particularly in dynamic systems, depend not only on the relative equilibrium partition coefficient of a metal between gas and melt phase, but also on the availability of metal and complexing agents. Thus diffusion of metal towards a gas bubble as it grows and ascends may become an important, limiting factor in the effective emission. In this project we will model the relative contributions of diffusion and equilibrium partitioning to volcanic emissions.

They are using this information to integrate some components of the C4 pathway into a C3 crop, aiming eventually to create entirely new C4 crops.\n\nIntroducing the characteristics of C4 photosynthesis into C3 crops should improve yields, reduce land area needed for cultivation and allow the crop to tolerate drought.

String Theorists made some strange and exciting conjectures about Calabi-Yau 3-folds, known as &quot;Mirror Symmetry&quot;.

We will establish common processes, procedures and communication channels in the network linked to relevant stakeholder organisations and local \u201cgrass root\u201d\u201d sites to contribute to a structural and systematic prediction, identification, modelling and surveillance of (re-)emerging infectious disease health threats and pathogens. Our focus will be new zoonotic viruses that may cause epidemics and viruses already present \u2013 but yet unrecognised- in humans. Within this focus, we will attain proof of principle of the functioning of the network and the techniques, systems, procedures and resources in the following RNA viruses: Flaviviruses (e.g. Dengue, West-Nile virus), Alphaviruses (e.g. Chikungunya), Orthomyxoviruses (e.g. Influenza), Paramyxoviruses (e.g Henipah,) Coronaviruses, Bunyaviruses ( e.g. hantavirus) and Filoviruses", 1248581.0, 13593851.0, "EMPERIE", "Existing and emerging pathogens", "Rapid anthropogenic, social and environmental changes have led to the emergence of many previously unrecognised infectious diseases.

For this purpose, project partners established a network capable of prediction, early detection, identification, modelling and surveillance of pathogens.\n\nRapid identification of pathogens gives public health authorities the needed knowledge and time to prepare and implement emergency measures. EMPERIE built a virus discovery pipeline using advanced technologies to rapidly detect and characterise novel viruses. The project resulted in a discovery of over 40 new viruses. EMPERIE scientists discovered the Schmallenberg virus and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as well as multiple novel viruses in mammals, insectivores and arthropods.\n\nDuring the course of the project, virus discovery and bioinformatics protocols underwent optimisation, ensuring its continued operations. The resulting world's most successful virus discovery network may be activated whenever a novel virus challenge emerges.\n\nResearch findings have been described in over 240 peer-reviewed publications. Project accomplishments include rapid research responses to H1N1, H7N9 and MERS-CoV. In addition, identification of genes involved in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV virulence lead to the development of novel vaccine candidates.\n\nEMPERIE developed novel computational methods, epidemiological models and software for analysing emerging outbreaks and mitigation strategies. These techniques were used by public health partners, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), to respond to the H1N1 pandemic and the ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak. The governments of China, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and the United States used approaches and tools developed by EMPERIE.\n\nIn addition, EMPERIE built close working relationships with international partners in Ghana, Indonesia, Nepal and Vietnam, providing training to clinical, support and laboratory staff.

We hypothesise that anti-citrullinated protein antibodies can be generated, in genetically susceptible individuals, as a consequence of P. Gingivalis-induced citrullination in the gingiva. In the context of genetic risk factors, during chronic exposure to danger signals, such as bacterial\nlipopolysacharides and DNA, tolerance to citrullinated proteins may be broken, with production of a pathogenic antibody response, which at a later time point cross-reacts with joint proteins and causes chronic RA. We will use a multidisciplinary approach (genetics, epidemiology, molecular immunology and animal models) to study susceptibility factors and immune responses in RA and PD, with an aim to identify novel etiological and pathogenic pathways, forming the basis for new therapies.", 430853.0, 6360101.0, "GUMS AND JOINTS", "Gum disease and rheumatoid arthritis", "Identification of the epidemiological, genetic and environmental triggers of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) will aid the design of therapeutic interventions.

Interestingly, the majority of patients present with antibodies against proteins that have undergone a type of post-translational modification known as citrullination. These antibodies are linked with a more adverse course of disease, underscoring their involvement in disease pathogenesis.\n\nIn addition, RA patients show a higher frequency of developing PD, an inflammatory condition of the surrounding tissue of the teeth, which in extreme cases can lead to bone destruction and tooth loss. A number of studies support a strong association between these two diseases.\n\nScientists on the EU-funded http://www.gumsandjoints.com/ (GUMS AND JOINTS) project investigated the hypothesis that the bacteria responsible for PD express higher levels of the enzyme that catalyses citrullination. Peptidyl-arginine deiminase (PAD) by Porphyromonas\u00a0gingivalis (PPAD) may therefore provide the mechanistic link between RA and PD.\n\nIn this context, researchers performed a multidisciplinary investigation on the immune responses and susceptibility factors in both diseases. They recruited patients and healthy subjects and found elevated antibodies to the virulence factor arginine gingipain in serum samples of PD patients.\n\nBiochemical evaluation of PPAD activity indicated a strong capacity to citrullinate any protein that contains an arginine amino acid, including proteins of the immune system. To ease the direct detection of citrullinated proteins in body fluids, researchers developed a novel methodology and are in the process of developing PPAD inhibitors.\n\nAn important observation was the presence of additional protein modifications in P.\u00a0gingivalis infection such as carbamylation. Carbamylated antibodies were shown to have a profound impact on immune system activation, potentially leading to chronic inflammation and autoimmunity.\n\nThe GUMS AND JOINTS study hopes to delineate the role of P.\u00a0gingivalis infection in triggering an autoimmune reaction against citrullinated proteins.

Based on the particularity of using a liquid fuel, this concept is derived from the American molten salt reactors (included the demonstrator MSRE) developed in the 1960s. The major drawbacks of these designs were (1) a short lifetime of the graphite blocks, (2) a reactor fuelled with 233U, not a natural fissile isotope, (3) a salt constituted of a high chemical toxic element: BeF2, and (4) a fuel reprocessing flux of 4000 liters per day required reaching a high breeding gain. However, this concept is retained by the Generation IV initiative, taking advantages of using a liquid fuel which allows more manageable on-line core control and reprocessing, fuel cycle flexibility (U or Th) and minimization of radiotoxic nuclear wastes. In MSFR, MSR concept has been revisited by removing graphite and BeF2. The neutron spectrum is fast and the reprocessing rate strongly reduced down to 40 liters per day to get a positive breeding gain. The reactor is started with 233U or with a Pu and minor actinides (MA) mixture from PWR spent fuel. The MA consumption with burn-up demonstrates the burner capability of MSFR. The objective of this project is to propose a design of MSFR in 2012 given the best system configuration issued from physical, chemical and material studies, for the reactor core, the reprocessing unit and the wastes conditioning. By this way, demonstration that MSFR can satisfy the goals of Gen IV, in terms of sustainability (Th breeder), non proliferation (integrated fuel cycle, multi-recycling of actinides), resources (close U/Th fuel cycle, no uranium enrichment), safety (no reactivity reserve, strongly negative feedback coefficient) and waste management (actinide burner) will be done", 66452.0, 1568120.0, "EVOL", "Evaluating molten salt reactor technology", "Molten salt fast reactors (MSFRs) have emerged as a long-term alternative to solid-fuelled fast neutron reactors.

Since the fuel salt is liquid, it can act both as fuel to produce heat and as coolant to remove and transport it to the power plant. The liquid fuel cannot melt down. The system operates at standard rather than very high pressures, and the fuel is less susceptible to neutron damage, meaning greater use of the fuel.\n\nWhile the original design was conceived in the 1960s, it faced some major drawbacks. The concept has been retained for Gen\u00a0IV fast-spectrum nuclear systems due to its numerous advantages, with a goal of modifying it to meet new specifications. Scientists initiated the EU-funded project 'Evaluation and viability of liquid fuel fast reactor system' (EVOL) to design the best possible MSFR given physical, chemical and materials studies to prove it satisfies Gen\u00a0IV goals.\n\nEVOL conducted extensive studies to optimise the MSFR design and system configuration using thermohydraulic and neutronic calculations. Unlike previous designs, the blanket salt flows in a circuit that is external to the salt container. This arrangement ensures that neutrons escaping from the reactor core will be captured by the surrounding blanket, thus achieving high neutron economy.\n\nRegarding the fissile materials fuelling the MSFR, two salt mixtures containing uranium-235 and plutonium-239 were proposed that meet the reactor's requirements.

State of the Art and beyond: The first generation of targeted therapies in chronic inflammatory disease used RA as prototype disease for clinical development. These therapies are now also used in other inflammatory disorders. Although treatments have been developed that are effective in a proportion of patients, they are aspecific, relatively toxic and do not mediate cure. Currently, it is unknown which molecular effects need to be induced and/or targeted to prevent induction or persistency of RA.

Consequently, there is a need for novel and better tolerated therapies.\nIn this proposal an approach to validate a new class of enzymes as targets for cancer therapy is presented. In the cell nucleus, DNA is bound to special proteins, called histones, which play key roles in gene regulation. Histones can be dynamically modified with special marker groups, which allows the control of gene expression without alteration of the DNA itself. Specifically, it is intended to inhibit histone demethylases, specialized enzymes which remove certain marker groups (methyl groups) from histones, which results in gene silencing or activation. Histone demethylases are known to be upregulated in certain cancers and are therefore promising candidates for pharmacological cancer therapy. Ideally, small molecule inhibitors will inhibit cancer growth and might even be able to restore the normal genetic program of a cell.\nDuring the study specific small molecule-enzyme pairs will be created, which allows the study of a single enzyme among very similar ones. This chemical genetics approach encompasses the mutation of the enzyme and the synthesis of specifically tailored small molecules.

The aim is to provide a rigorous mathematical framework for the study of different growth processes in biological systems and to model specific biological systems. The research is divided into interconnected themes with perspectives in pure mechanics, applied mathematics, and theoretical biology. At the foundational level, the development of a mathematical theory for biological growth is particularly difficult, as it must describe nonlinear biological materials evolving in time, and operating in large deformations. My goal is to study the foundations of the theory, which requires the generality of differential geometry, exact elasticity, and nonlinear thermodynamics. At the methodology level, I will develop mathematical tools to explore the consequences of growth processes in many systems, such as the dynamics of growth; the nonlinear stability analysis of growing systems with application to morphogenesis and pattern formation; and the study of reduced theories for rods and shells. The goal here is to gain insight into the fundamental coupling between growth, geometry, and stress in many biological systems. The driving force behind a theory of growth is the analysis and modelling of specific systems in collaboration with life scientists. Various applications in biology and physiology will be considered such bacterial and fungal systems, stems and leaves, solid tumours, arteries, brain morphology, and blood vessels. I have established such collaborations and I will expand their scope while at Oxford.

A generic agent-based model (ABM) was used to analyse the impact of servicizing and the proposed policies and potential for decoupling.\n\nResearch focused on three sectors: water, mobility and agri-food. Specific servicizing systems within each sector were chosen and three sector-specific ABMs designed. The systems are: household water management (grey-water recycling and rainwater harvesting services), car and bike sharing, and crop protection management solutions. Data collection has been completed through 9 case studies of these systems within the countries involved and provides input for the ABMs and evaluating the sensitivity of policies according to 6 different country settings.\n\nSPREE will ultimately produce \u201cServicizing Policy Packages\u201d for each of the three sectors.

Carbon dioxide is one such incompatible element, and pressure-induced variations in out-gassing rate from the mid-ocean ridge system to the climate system may provide the negative feedback that gives rise to glacial oscillations.

Data collected by the WHO suggest that brain diseases are responsible for 35% of Europe\u2019s total disease burden (1). In the treatment of neurological disease, the blood brain barrier (BBB) still represents an obstacle for the delivery of drugs to the brain and thus a major challenge for the development of therapeutic regimens. Understanding the molecular basis and functioning of the BBB in health and disease, including transport mechanisms across the BBB, therefore holds significant potential for future strategies to prevent and ameliorate neurological disease. Recent research indicates that some neurological disorders have a developmental etiologic component. The major goal of the NEUROBID project is thus to understand the molecular mechanisms and function of the BBB in health and disease both in the developing brain and the adult central nervous system. With an interdisciplinary consortium from the fields of developmental neurobiology and BBB research, NEUROBID aims to (i) understand the involvement of normal and disturbed BBB function in normal and abnormal brain development and (ii) to develop novel strategies for drug delivery to the brain. Unique transport mechanisms across the BBB will be used to target potential therapeutic macromolecular and cellular agents specifically to the brain barriers and transport them into the brain. The main target disorders of NEUROBID are non-inherited neurodevelopmental disorders arising from perinatal adverse exposure, such as cerebral palsy, and classic adult neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and stroke. In the long term, NEUROBID hopes to pave the way for new treatment strategies and thus reduce the economic and social burden of neurological disease. 1. Olesen J, et al.

The mechanisms that support cellular exchange between the brain, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (the BBB) are critical for protecting the brain from harmful substances. However, they also pose a serious obstacle to the delivery of drugs and the treatment of brain diseases.\n\nOTo address the therapeutic challenge posed by the BBB, scientists on the EU-funded 'Neuroscience on barriers in development' (http://www.neurobid.eu (NEUROBID)) set out to investigate in detail the mechanisms implicated in the barrier system. Their plan was to compare the function of a normal and an abnormal BBB, and identify key players involved in the mechanism. In the normal brain, researchers elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which large molecules (proteins) are transferred across the choroid plexus, and identified specific brain barrier cell surface recognition targets.\n\nThe function of the BBB is significantly challenged by adverse perinatal exposures such as inflammation, hypoxia and glucocorticoid treatment. Using animal models for these situations, scientists were able to assess the effect of disease on BBB function in the developing individual. They discovered that exposure to corticosteroids in the perinatal and neonatal periods significantly increases the risk for neurodegeneration.\n\nSimilar alterations in the morphology and function of the BBB are imposed by perinatal inflammation. In answer to this, the consortium investigated how neuroprotective drugs could restore or maintain BBB integrity. With respect to the transfer of molecules or drugs across the BBB, scientists explored various strategies, including the modification of lipid solubility, and the use of transporters or carriers.\n\nCollectively, the activities of the NEUROBID study promote a better understanding of the BBB and its function, particularly in the developing brain.

This project answers this question by embedding the systematic empirical analysis of policy effects into a comprehensive theoretical framework of the macro and meso-level forces driving international migration to and from wealthy countries. This is achieved by linking separately evolved migration theories focusing on either sending or receiving countries and integrating them with theories on the internal dynamics of migration processes. A systematic review and categorisation of receiving and sending country migration policies will provide an improved operationalisation of policy variables.

A 25\u00a0% premium subsidy and an information pack had no significant impact on insurance uptake. The reason appeared to be the low value of the insurance and low perceived quality of the care. Studies in China, however, showed that when coverage is extended or deepened, utilisation of care tends to increase.\n\nAnother strategy is to reduce out-of-pocket costs. HEFPA studies showed that waiving fees for the poor had a greater impact than providing tax-financed care. Furthermore, findings revealed that lost income imposes a greater economic burden than medical expenses.\n\nThese results have significant policy implications. Large-scale health coverage is unlikely to be achieved through voluntary insurance enrolment, and increasing affordability will not necessarily increase uptake.\n\nTo address these concerns, policymakers should consider streamlining the administration of voluntary health insurance and improving the design of insurance benefits and provider payments. This will raise incentives for the utilisation and delivery of care. Advancing the agenda for disability insurance would also help ensure income for the poor during times of sickness. These changes would help bring about health equity and financial protection across countries.", null, "http://www.ox.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/149863.jpg", "fp7_91950_999984350"], ["2JD", "Scalable Software Services for Life Science", "The Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford", "Life Science is developing into one of the largest e- Infrastructure users in Europe, in part due to the ever-growing amount of biological data.

To combat chronic pain, we need an improved understanding of the mechanisms underpinning pain. We know that pain is not an invariant mapping from the physical intensity of sensory stimulation to perception, but is subject to various modulating factors that reduce or enhance pain perception. Endogenous pain modulation involves systems that originate in cortical areas, which communicate \u2013 via subcortical and brainstem structures \u2013 with the spinal cord, where nociceptive processing is controlled. Previous research has focused on anti-nociceptive mechanisms, but it is becoming increasingly clear that pro-nociceptive mechanisms also play an important role in chronic pain.\n\nThis proposal will therefore be investigating the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie both directions of pain modulation, by using the models of placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies. A first objective is to investigate bidirectional brainstem control of spinal cord responses with dedicated fMRI tools. The second objective \u2013 which involves ultra high-field fMRI \u2013 is to characterize the subcortical-brainstem networks in detail that intervene between cortical and spinal processing.

The first phase of the project involved using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to pinpoint the location of responses to painful stimuli. Investigators found that pain responses are located in the back of the spinal cord. \n\nNext, investigators studied whether the spinal cord would respond to visual stimuli that are related to pain responses. They found that if a participant learned to relate pain to visual stimuli, the spinal cord responded. Interestingly, the more a participant expected pain, the weaker the response to the painful stimulus. On the flip side, the spinal cord responded to visual signals that predicted upcoming pain. \n\nThe pain response was also found to be dynamic. For example, if visual stimuli were no longer followed by pain, the spinal cord response decayed. These findings suggest that there is a top-down pathway from the brain to the spinal cord that modulates spinal cord neurons with the expectation of upcoming pain.\n\nIn the second phase of the project, researchers are conducting experiments using magnetoencephalography.

These are key processes that are often malfunctioning in cancer cells and in ageing oocytes. Defective cohesin function during meiosis may further contribute to human trisomy and age-related female infertility. Two developmental disorders, namely Cornelia de Lange and Roberts syndrome, are caused respectively by haplo-insufficiency of NIPBL (a cohesin loading factor), and homozygous loss of the acetyltransferase ESCO2 (a cohesin modifying enzyme).\nThis proposal aims to study functions and mechanisms of cohesin in higher eukaryotes using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. This organism has major advantages for the here proposed questions: high quality imaging of chromosomes during early embryonic divisions, the possibility of microinjecting chemically modified proteins or mRNAs into early embryos or salivary glands, the existence of Rad21TEV flies created in the host laboratory whose cohesin can be rapidly removed from chromosomes by expression of TEV protease, and the existence of huge polytene chromosomes on which expression of individual genes and cohesin association can be visualized cytologically. These advantages are essential in allowing me to address the following questions: Is the hinge heterodimerisation domain the entry gate for cohesin\u2019s loading onto chromatids? What is the mechanism and function of cohesin\u2019s dissociation during prophase?

This project, by combining two innovative interdisciplinary components, aims systematically to advance the state of contemporary music research, while contributing to social and media theory. It will be the first research programme to analyse comprehensively the range of interrelated transformations in music and musical experience wrought by digital technologies. The first element of the project is a comparative programme of ethnographic studies examining transformations in creative, performance and improvisation practices, the nature of music as a cultural object, new aesthetic forms, altered modes of musical consumption and circulation, and changing industry and institutional structures. Given the ease of transnational distribution of digitized musics, research will also follow certain genres as they circulate among diasporic groups. These and related issues will be studied in five countries, each intrinsically significant as well as yielding instructive comparisons between them: the UK, Cuba, Kenya, India and Turkey. The emphasis in each ethnography will be on analyzing the embedded nature of digital musical practices in local cultural, social, economic and political conditions. Second, on the basis of this programme, the project aims to advance contemporary music research by developing an interdisciplinary theory and methodology which progresses beyond the current state of the field. Music research has been divided between disciplines such as musicology and music analysis which address the musical object and centre on art musics, and sociological and anthropological approaches which privilege music\u2019s social, institutional and discursive forms and focus primarily on popular and vernacular musics. The present project bridges these divisions by expounding an innovative theory and methodology focused on music\u2019s mediation, one that integrates recent elements of social, anthropological and media theory.

One of the most complex aspects of ageing is sex-specific selection on ageing rates and, more generally, the dynamic link between ageing and sexual conflict. Although sexual conflict was recognized over 30 years ago, its role in adaptive evolution has only recently received theoretical and empirical attention. Sexual conflict is currently recognized as a key evolutionary process, and recent evidence suggests that it can drastically influence patterns of ageing by acting as both a catalyst of and a constraint to the evolution of sex-specific life histories. Considerations of sexual conflict are therefore fundamental to understand why males and females age at different rates, the costs of sex and, ultimately, the evolution of ageing. Unfortunately, ageing theory has largely neglected sexual conflict, while theory of sexual conflict has only begun to consider ageing. The integration of these topical areas of evolutionary biology is in its infancy and, as a consequence, comprehensive work investigating the relationship between sex-specific patterns of ageing and \u2013simultaneously- interlocus sexual conflict (IRSC) and intralocus sexual conflict (IASC; the two fundamental mechanisms of sexual conflict) has been extremely rare. Using a model insect species (Tribolium castaneum), I propose a strongly experimental approach aimed to address some of the fundamental evolutionary questions concerning ageing and sexual conflict: a) Does the intensity of interlocus conflict (IRSC) influence ageing rates and, does senescence foster IRSC?, b) Does intralocus conflict (IASC) constrain the evolution of sex-specific ageing rates?, and c) How do IRSC and IASC interact to influence ageing?

The study aimed to evaluate the potential for HSR to reduce air transportation, and how that might be achieved. The research consisted of two modes, a literature review and econometric analysis, which ran from June 2011 to May 2013.\n\nThe initial literature study examined the interaction between airlines and HSR, focusing on mode substitution. Little was known about how initiation of a new HSR service affects demand.

The study indicated that HSR and low-cost airlines compete for similar markets. Modelling revealed that reasonable HSR travel times means reduction of air services, though HSR frequency has little effect on air services. The effects of hubbing strategies by airlines suggested a benefit of increased HSR servicing of airports, though the interactions are difficult to predict. The greenhouse gas emissions saved through HSR are minor compared with the impact of long-haul flights with which the former does not compete.\n\nOverall, it would seem that HSR can replace short-haul flights.

These factors may render invalid the classical model in which successive mutations with large advantages arise and  spread through the tumour in selective sweeps. To incorporate these neglected features and to test how tumorigenesis depends on factors such as mutation rate, selection and size constraints, we shall set up a comprehensive model of tumour growth incorporating cell birth, death, division and mutation parameters. We shall examine specific aspects of cancer-as-evolution in mice. By marking mutant clones using fluorescent proteins, we can track them and see how they persist, spread and die. We shall also determine the mutation profiles and genetic diversity of mutant clones and whole tumours in mice and humans using next-generation sequencing. Specific experiments will determine: (i) the fate of new advantageous clones arising in an existing tumour; (ii) whether new disadvantageous clones can persist in tumours; (iii) whether apparently maladaptive traits for tumour growth, such as suppressing the growth of competitors, can be selected; (iv) why do housekeeper gene mutations cause cancer in specific sites; (v) can cancer cells have too much genomic instability; and (vi) whether all cancers develop owing to driver mutations with big effects, or are there \u201cmini-drivers\u201d of tumorigenesis?

In addition, a significant proportion of initial responders relapse after treatment is discontinued. There is hence a real and marked need to improve upon current approaches to AD treatment.\nOne possible avenue for improving response rates is through optimizing initial treatment selection. Specifically, it is possible that certain individuals might respond better to cognitive interventions while others might respond better to pharmacological treatment.  Recently it has been suggested that there may be two or more distinct biological pathways disrupted in anxiety. If this is the case, then specification of these pathways may be an important step in predicting which individuals are likely to respond to which treatment. Few studies have focused upon this issue and, in particular, upon identifying neural markers that might predict response to cognitive (as opposed to pharmacological) intervention.

We will generate a toolset of highly selective targeted SMART probes for at least 10 disease-relevant proteases. The selection of target proteases is based on their relevance in disease processes that cannot yet be monitored with non invasive technology.

In order to understand the correct meaning of these inscribed monuments it is necessary to extend my research to the bases of statues themselves and to the contexts in which they once stood. At the same time, I will have to interact the ways in wich word and image interact in the language of honorary statues during the Roman Imperial period.

Their studies revealed that global change impact on grassland stability was through changes in plant diversity, with a decrease in diversity leading to a decrease in stability regardless of which driver caused the loss of diversity, and through destabilization of diverse species\u2019 responses to environmental fluctuations. In a non-fertilised, species-rich environment, reduced biomass of some species may be compensated for by increased biomass of others, resulting in minimal total biomass change. Fertilising grassland, whether intentionally or by run-off, upsets this balance, resulting in greater biomass fluctuations over time and weakened stability of the entire grassland ecosystem.\n\nThe results from these studies may help to mitigate the impacts of human-driven changes in environmental biodiversity.

We propose that common factors exist that control both Ageing and Bone and so link increasing age with a generalised decrease in bone mass. The sirtuin family of longevity associated genes regulate lifespan in lower organisms. SIRT1 is the predominant mammalian sirtuin, is strongly linked to cell survival and proliferation and regulates factors common to both ageing and bone. Recently we have made the novel discovery that SIRT1 expression declines with age and mice deficient in the SIRT1 gene have decreased bone mass and strength, similar to that seen in ageing humans. This decreased bone volume was the result of an uncoupling of the equilibrium between osteoclastic resorption and osteoblastic bone formation, a fundamental mechanism in the onset of osteoporosis. Moreover, SIRT1 expression can be induced and age-related bone loss prevented by the use of a strict dietary regime, suggesting common mediators in bone homeostasis and energy metabolism.

These include an LHC upgrade, R&amp;D on TeV linear colliders and studies on neutrino facilities. These ambitious goals require the mobilisation of all European resources to face scientific and technological challenges well beyond the current state-of-the-art and the capabilities of any single laboratory or country. EuCARD will contribute to the formation of a European Research Area in accelerator science, effectively creating a distributed accelerator laboratory across Europe. It will address the new priorities by upgrading European accelerator infrastructures while continuing to strengthen the collaboration between its participants and developing synergies with industrial partners. R&amp;D will be conducted on high field superconducting magnets, superconducting RF cavities which are particularly relevant for FLASH, XFEL and SC proton linacs, two-beam acceleration, high efficiency collimation and new accelerator concepts. EuCARD will include networks to monitor the performance and risks of innovative solutions and to disseminate results. Trans-national access will be granted to users of beams and advanced test facilities. Strong joint research activities will support priority R&amp;D themes. As an essential complement to national and CERN programmes, the EuCARD proposal will strengthen the European Research Area by ensuring that European accelerator infrastructures further improve their performance and remain at the forefront of global research, serving a community of well over 10,000 physicists from all over the world.", 156172.0, 27614147.0, "EUCARD", "Collaborative research on accelerators", "An EU-funded project contributed to the formation of a European Research Area (ERA) to address common challenges in accelerator research and development.", "Large European research facilities such as those of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) are providing invaluable insights into particle and nuclear physics.

Also a new, highly promising, development is that of spin electronics in which the spin of the electron rather than merely the charge forms the basis of the device operation. This holds the prospect of allowing technology to develop beyond the limits of miniaturisation of standard electronics and may yield the solution of the increasing power requirements for conventional electronic devices.

AtheroRemo aims to identify novel inflammatory mechanisms in vascular remodelling by combining the exploration of human biobanks with animal models and established cellular models. This new knowledge will be used to develop new preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. AtheroRemo contains several unique strengths: 1) Outstanding expertise on immunity and inflammation. Our expertise facilitates the breakthroughs in the immuno-inflammatory targeted vascular treatments. 2) Finest European cohorts to search for molecular mechanisms behind atherosclerosis development allowing us to combine underlying genetics with lipidomic profiles in multiple cohorts in order to obtain risk factors and biomarker panel related to inflammatory remodelling. 3) Accelerated target validation with novel liposomal-targeted delivery of nucleic acid-based therapeutics in appropriate animal models. Four SME partners able to exploit the new knowledge support AtheroRemo research. Thus, we expect to translate a number of novel findings into potential clinical applications such as new diagnostic tools (biomarkers) and therapeutics.", 354701.0, 13036146.0, "ATHEROREMO", "Targeting atherosclerosis", "Understanding how atherosclerotic plaques form would certainly help in the development of new therapies against cardiovascular disease.

Emerging data challenges the current belief that atherosclerosis is a lipid storage disease, and incriminates inflammation in its pathophysiology. However, our understanding of the mechanisms that link inflammation with atherosclerosis development is limited.\n\nWith EU funding, the 'European Collaborative Project on inflamation and vascular wall remodelling in atherosclerosis' (http://www.atheroremo.org/ (ATHEROREMO)) project investigated the role of inflammatory remodelling in atherosclerosis development. The project combined clinical studies with genomics and lipidomics high-throughput analyses, and basic research, thereby hoping to unveil novel molecular targets that could be exploited in diagnostics and treatment.\n\nAlarmingly, researchers found a strong association between cardiovascular disease and dental infections as well as root canal treatment. Genomic analysis revealed that this was due to streptococcal bacteria.\n\nWith respect to the molecular mechanisms responsible for vascular wall remodelling, the consortium identified novel immune signalling events such as pattern recognition receptors and chemokines. They found that reduction of the chemokine levels prevented atherosclerosis, thereby indicating that preventing unwanted inflammation could serve as a therapeutic strategy. Alternative treatment strategies could entail the reversal of the gene expression changes in the arterial wall induced by atherosclerosis.\n\nFrom a diagnostics perspective, the ATHEROREMO study identified novel imaging and lipidomic biomarkers that have a true potential to change current clinical risk evaluation strategies for patients. In addition, the levels of circulating ceramides were found to outperform cholesterol measurement with respect to identifying people at risk of cardiovascular disease. These observations also led to the development of new diagnostic kits.\n\nOverall, the activities of the ATHEROREMO project greatly advance our understanding of the inflammatory events and mechanisms that lead to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.

Tool use, by modifying the representations of our bodily and perceptual spaces, allows for an understanding of the plasticity of the limits between self and non-self. Most studies conducted to date on this issue have investigated the mechanisms that allow extension of the body to include elements located in a distant space (e.g., rubber hand illusion). However, little attention has been given to the reverse phenomenon: How stimuli received on the body can be projected to a distant space. The research project proposes to use visual-to-tactile sensory substitution in order to investigate this phenomenon. In particular, it is hypothesized that the mechanisms allowing for distant perceived localization of stimuli received on the body surface involve the automaticity of perception and exteriorisation, which corresponds to the moment when tactile stimuli provided by a sensory substitution device are no longer felt on the skin, but are rather perceived as referring to objects located at a distance. In order to characterise these mechanisms, the research project proposes a first set of experiments to investigate the level of automaticity of perception after training with a visual-to-tactile sensory substitution device. The second set of experiments investigates the mechanisms of exteriorisation and, in particular, the laws of spatial exploration allowing for the perception of objects as located in front of the observer. Finally, the third part of the project investigates the cognitive functions and brain regions that mediate processing of distant perception with sensory substitution devices.

The second problem is a philosophical one: what is the nature of the a priori notion and how does it depend on the notion of epistemic revisability?

The technically driven schedule envisages construction beginning in 2012. Project approval and start of construction is thus a two-stage process. Starting in 2008, the ILC-HiGrade Consortium will address important elements in this 2-stage process with siting of the facility as one major ingredient. Currently there are site proposals in Japan, US and in Europe. Their benefits will be evaluated and the international framework in which the project will be realised will be developed.

It would consist of two linear accelerators facing each other and propelling electrons at their anti-particles, positrons, at close to the speed of light. Since electrons carry no internal structure the measurements can be performed with high accuracy. The ILC is expected to provide information about a wealth of unanswered questions in particle physics, from the nature of dark matter to the existence of hypothetical elementary particles.

Yet, protozoan predation could also decrease bacterial virulence if increased allocation to anti-predatory traits is traded off with pathogen virulence. Thus, different type of protozoa could select for different anti-predatory adaptations which have opposite consequences for the evolution of bacterial virulence. Selection by other enemies such as phages (parasitic viruses) or abiotic environment could also select for bacterial traits that have correlated effects on pathogen virulence.

Conceptually our proposal is to exploit the high reactivity of N-acyl iminium ions in cyclisation reactions within the asymmetric environment of an associated conjugate base of a chiral Br\u00f8nsted acid (HA*). For enantioselective N-acyl iminium ion cyclisations, a keto amide starting material with a suitable pi-nucleophile attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide is required.

Comparative genome analysis has showed that many (but not all) homeobox genes are widely conserved between evolutionarily divergent animal groups, while some non-coding regulators are also conserved but often over shorter time periods.

The Sequential Choice Model (SCM) was proposed to deal with this curious finding. Its main feature is that it predicts behaviour in choice situations using data from no-choice encounters with each alternative. Its premises are: (1) When an animal faces a single option, it doesn\u2019t take it immediately (the \u201clatency\u201d). Each alternative faced on its own elicits a specific probability density function of latencies. Latencies are not reaction times: they exceed RTs duration by an order of magnitude and have different properties; (2) Latencies to take single options are decreasing functions of the improvement in state-dependent fitness that the decision maker expects from that option relative to the context; (3) Expectations about each option depend on both the subject\u2019s state and the average properties of the environment during learning; (4) When more than one option is met simultaneously, each elicits a sample from its original distribution of latencies. The shortest sample is expressed as a choice. There is no comparative evaluation at choice time: each option elicits a candidate latency just as in sequential encounters. This cross-censorship between latency distributions means that latencies for each option are shorter when picked out of a choice than when picked in the absence of alternatives.

Although the prevalence of autoimmune disorders, including multiple sclerosis, accounts for 5\u00a0% of the population, there is no effective therapeutic approach currently available.\n\nScientists in the EU-funded 'Systems biology of T-cell activation in health and disease' (http://www.sybilla-t-cell.de (SYBILLA)) project decided to investigate the role of T cells in autoimmunity and how they can be manipulated using drugs. The main focus was on the molecular mechanisms that determine T cell activation under physiological conditions and in autoimmunity.\n\nPartners generated a number of animal models to monitor the molecular dynamics and signalling during T cell activation. These experiments led to the previously unknown discrimination between foreign antigen and self-peptides. They also helped scientists identify key regulatory proteins which could serve as pharmacological targets for autoimmunity. For example, a protein kinase C antagonist was tested in the clinic for inhibiting immune cell activation in autoimmune disorders.\n\nGenome-wide association studies revealed a number of SNPs associated with early human T cell lineage specification and disease pathogenesis. This finding indicated the existence of a previously unidentified genetic element to autoimmunity.\n\nResearchers unravelled the complex network of T cell activation to ultimately generate a data-driven mechanistic model in the form of computer software. The so called 'Virtual T cell' can predict the behaviour of the T cell network and especially the outcome of T cell activation under different conditions. The applicability of this model extends to the identification of biological biomarkers, intracellular drug targets and drug screening.\n\nTaken together, the SYBILLA study provided invaluable insight into the mechanisms underlying T cell activation in health and disease. The mathematical modelling approach is expected to further broaden research in immunology and speed up pharmaceutical drug discovery.", "http://www.sybilla-t-cell.de/", "http://www.ox.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/148140.jpg", "fp7_88091_999984350"], ["2JD", "Providing an Infrastructure for Research on Electoral Democracy in the European Union", "The Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford", "This three-year design study will assess the feasibility of providing an infrastructure for research into citizenship, political participation, and electoral democracy in the European Union (EU).

These abstractions facilitate generalisation of extant task and category information to novel domains. For example, an individual who can ride a bicycle, or speak Spanish, will learn more rapidly to ride a motorcycle, or speak Portuguese.

In the current proposal, we describe 4 experimental series in which humans learn to perform structured decision-making tasks, and then generalise this behaviour to input domains populated by previously unseen stimuli, categories, or tasks. Building on extant pilot work, we will use representational similarity analysis (RSA) of neuroimaging (fMRI or EEG) data to chart the emergence of neural representations encoding abstract structure in patterns of brain activity.

Recognition during motion presents a particularly challenge as the appearance of an object continuously changes; a particular issue for animals that use landmarks to navigate. One recognition mechanism is to learn a two-dimensional snapshot of an object from a set viewpoint. The object can later be recognized once the appearance of the object matches the stored snapshot. Some animals reduce the number of required snapshots by employing \u2018active vision\u2019, where they follow identical routes between landmarks.

Current imaging technologies capture only a fraction of visual information that the human eye can see. The colours and dynamic range are inadequate for most real-world scenes and not all depth cues required for natural 3D vision are captured. This limits the realism of the experience and has hampered the introduction of 3D technology. Advancement in imaging technologies makes it possible to circumvent these bottlenecks in visual systems. As a result, new visual signal-processing areas have emerged such as light fields, ultra-high definition, highframe rate and high dynamic range imaging. The novel combinations of those technologies can facilitate a hyper-realistic visual experience. This will without doubt be the future frontier for new imaging systems.

The key objectives of PERISCOPE are to 1. identify biomarkers of protection against Bp colonization and disease; 2. foster scientific innovation and rebuild the ecosystem and technical infrastructure needed in Europe to allow the future evaluation of novel pertussis vaccine candidates and 3. improve understanding of the pathogenesis of Bp infection and its potential impact on the recently observed changes in pertussis epidemiology. To reach these objectives, PERISCOPE brings together a selected group of internationally recognized public and EFPIA partners with strong expertise in clinical trials, immunology, molecular microbiology, human and animal challenge models and bioinformatics. We will initiate a series of (pre)clinical studies and develop harmonized human and animal challenge models, standardized assays and cutting-edge techniques to unravel the innate and adaptive responses to Bp. This will allow us to identify biomarkers of protection and durable immunity.

The epigenetic changes are the result of epigenetic tags (chemical tags) that can determine gene expression. There are two main types of epigenetic modifications: DNA methylation and histone modifications. Many diseases such as cancer, inflammation, neurological and cardiovascular diseases can be related to aberrant histone modification patterns. Since Histone modifications are mainly carried out by three types of proteins (writers, readers and erasers) there is great therapeutic interest in these proteins, since they may influence disease onset and progression.

Large-scale surveys in several countries have shown that people generally have a preference for greater equality. However, despite broadly shared egalitarian ideals, people often oppose policies aimed at reducing inequality and support policies that would have the opposite effect.

A key issue in such domains is that of coordination: how to design agents to minimise any potential negative aspects of their interactions, and to maximise any potential positive aspects. A key approach to coordination is that of normative systems. A normative system defines constraints on the behaviour of agents to coordinate their interactions. This research programme is at the intersection of normative systems design and evolutionary game theory (EGT). EGT studies how evolutionary forces can lead populations to game theoretic solutions, and has been useful in understanding, for example the distributions of populations of species in habitats. The hypotheses of this project are that (1) EGT can provide a useful mathematical framework to model and understand normative systems in MAS; and (2) EGT techniques can provide a powerful framework to engineer normative systems for MAS. Thus, norm synthesis will consist of an evolutionary process in which most successful norms will prosper, while unsuccessful norms will be naturally discarded. The tools used to understand such norms will be solution concepts from EGT - notably the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy.

Hence, they could be used to bound the 4-ball genus and the unknotting number, providing a tool for finding a counterexample to the smooth 4-dimensional Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, and to decide whether a given slice knot bounds a ribbon surface.

By harmonising user access, unifying data management, creating common ethical and legal services, and offering joint innovation support CORBEL will establish and support a new model for biological and medical research in Europe.

Furthermore, the precautionary principle fails to account for moral uncertainty \u2014even though many decisions depend more sensitively on ethical parameters (e.g. our obligations to future generations, discount rates, intrinsic value of nature) than on remaining scientific uncertainties.\n\nBuilding on recent advances in decision theory, computational modelling, and domain-specific risk assessment techniques, and using tools of analytic and moral philosophy, this project will: (1) develop methods that account for normative uncertainty by combining voting theory with ongoing work on moral uncertainty, identifying parameters that make the largest practical difference; (2) combine these with methods for dealing with sources of empirical ignorance (such as information hazards, anthropic shadow, model uncertainties) into a theoretically well-motivated framework that comprises normative and empirical uncertainty; (3) derive mid-level principles and procedures from this theoretical framework by working through three case studies (geoengineering, dual-use biotechnology, and automation and machine intelligence) offering better practical guidance on speculative but potentially catastrophic risks than does the precautionary principle.", 1762325.0, 1762325.0, "UnPrEDICT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ox.ac.uk", null, "h2020_198220_999984350"], ["2JD", "Perovskite Light Emitters", "The Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford", "Metal halide perovskites have recently astonished the research community and garnered a mass following to realize extremely high efficiency low cost photovoltaics.

SP1 achieves this by promoting the degradation TOC components by the cytosolic 26S proteasome. This is the first time the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) has been shown to directly regulate plastid development and function. By increasing or decreasing SP1 levels in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, multiple effects of SP1 were observed; e.g., inefficient de-etiolation leading to low survival rates and delayed leaf senescence in sp1 null mutants (Science 2012, 338:655-9). Also, sp1 mutants are significantly more sensitive to stress (unpublished). These data suggest that SP1 is important for the differentiation and interconversion of different plastid types, and all of the effects are highly correlated with plant growth and yield. Thus, discovery of SP1 strongly suggests potential applications in agriculture, such as delaying leaf senescence to produce a staygreen phenotype, or controlling amyloplast development during grain development, by modifying SP1 expression.

Since the complexity of realistic tasks makes manual policy construction hopeless, there is great demand for decision-theoretic planning methods that automatically discover good policies. Despite enormous progress, the grand challenge of efficiently discovering effective policies for complex tasks remains unmet.\nA fundamental obstacle is the cost of policy evaluation: estimating a policy's quality by averaging performance over multiple trials.

Nucleic acid-sensing (NAS) TLR ligands are an essential component of anti-tumour strategies to induce efficient tumour-specific adaptive immune responses. NAS TLRs can also detect nucleic acid released during tumour necrosis, thereby modulating the tumour microenvironment. Interestingly, NAS TLR signalling can induce cell death via apoptosis or induce pro-tumoral survival and proliferation of cancer cells.  These opposing effects of NAS TLR ligands may be due to the differential response of distinct tumour-associated cells to TLR ligands.

Because of its high theoretical capacity and excellent operation safety, silicon (Si) has attracted considerable attention as a promising anode to replace graphite.

This channel is not found in the ventricles and therefore provides an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of AF. In atrial myocytes isolated from patients in AF we have shown an increase in IKur, as well as a reduction in the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Inhibition of nNOS in mycoytes from patients in sinus rhythm recapitulated the AF phenotype. Kv1.5 is also modulated by mechanical stress, which has been shown to affect NO production in myocytes. We have shown that shear stress recruits Kv1.5 from an intracellular pool to the cell surface, leading to an increase in IKur. This proposal aims to investigate mechanism by which nNOS regulates IKur.

An efficient variation of this second strategy is to couple enantiomer differentiation with interconversion of enantiomers.

The main factor at the background is the fusion of West Pirkanmaa Consortium of Education (LPKKY) into Sastamala Municipal Education and Training Consortium (SASKY) as of 1.1.2014, and the parties\u2019 different approaches to organizing mobility.  Now, along with the fusion, a strong will to share the skills has emerged; to build up strong common practices and to give the students of SASKY more equal opportunities for internationalization than before.  This is part of the creation process of a new internationalization strategy just launched: high quality student mobility will be one of the corner stones of the new strategy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe implementation of ECVET is important when organizing high-quality mobility.  In the former LPKKY, ECVET has been implemented with the help of intermediary partners; the students give skills demonstrations abroad which the receiving entrepreneurs will assess, and the learning outcomes will be validated according to the entrepreneurs\u2019 assessment.  In the \u201cold\u201d SASKY, within Europea network, a high-quality model, based on co-operation between VET providers, has been developed.  The model sets a good objective for the co-operation between VET providers, but the model is a result of long-term co-operation within a single sector; it can\u2019t be adopted just like that \u2013 therefore the model of LPKKY has been agreed on with the partners as the minimum criterion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo help the implementation of ECVET, the tools of the Perfect Match project will be disseminated to the partners, and their exploitation will be encouraged in the project.  It is also essential to involve the vocational subjects teachers in the planning, setting of goals, monitoring and feedback gathering of placements.  To validate all the learning outcomes gained during the placements, we will round up working groups, consisting of language teachers, cultural subjects teachers, IT subjects teachers, entrepreneurship teachers and Finnish teachers; the task of these working groups will be to elaborate common rules for the validation of the non-professional learning outcomes.  The Education Managers will support their work and confirm the exploitation of the results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo launch student mobility, some mobilities are also needed for teachers.  They are needed to share the partner contacts, ensure the implementation of ECVET, the transfer of good practices, co-operation and the planning of new mobilities and new projects.  The input of teachers is also needed to make internationalization an integral part of the everyday life at the whole SASKY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis massive machinery is ignited for the sake of students.  So that they can do high-quality placements abroad.  So that SASKY would have practices effective enough, partners good enough and co-operation fluent enough for suitable placements to be found for the students.  In suitable placements, the students\u2019 tasks match their skills and their objectives, and thus the best learning outcomes possible will be gained \u2013 regarding both their hard and soft skills.

The purpose of this form of education is to promote knowledge along with professional courtesy for the future technological market. Also along with vocational education we must prepare mentally as well as physically all students in order to participate in the national final examination procedure. Those who will succeed will have the opportunity to continue their studies in Universities and Technological Institutions. The outcome is to have students with good amount of knowledge regarding their area of expertise along with theoretic background and of course professional attitude.\r\nThrough our daily education we have detected one problem that is not easy to be solved even for graduates from Technological institutions. The problem for the modern professional technical personnel is to be able to collaborate with scientific personnel for the execution of research project. The difficulty is located because professional technical personnel spend most of their time working in daily small projects. On the other hand scientific personnel are working on big project with characteristics such as scope planning, integration, risk management, contingency plans and of course much more deliverables at the end of the project. Eventually there is part where scientific and technical personnel must join forces for the execution of the project and of course every upcoming project. There lies the problem. There seems to be a great gap in understanding these two groups between them.\r\nThe solution for this problem lies on basic vocational educational. We have the ability to stimulate the minds of the students. This stimulation combines technological approach along with the needs of the scientific personnel. Of course is not enough to train students only in theoretic form but also train them through workshops where there will be able to witness the requirements of such form of work. This educational pattern must be used also in vocational teaching personnel.\r\nThe training of vocational teachers will contribute in further knowledge strengthening that are already acquired where in combination with teaching experience we will be able to create a flexible team of teachers that are in full compliance with modern teaching procedures.\r\nTo cover that need we have created this program with title:\r\nElectromechanical Technology Systems for Particle Accelerators and Detectors.\r\nThe targets of the program are the following:\r\n1. Training of vocational teachers with new technological framework inside school environment.\r\n2. Mobility and training of teachers in scientific environment and practical training with short duration for better perception of the scientific matter with technological approach.\r\n3. Training of vocational teachers on the field of their technological subject through scientific and research framework.\r\nThe participants cover fields such as electrical, mechanical and IT engineering on their workplace and as such we have designed this  mobility program.\r\nIn this team the main target are vocational teachers. Their task is to attend in a small 7 days seminar cycle over one complete technological system that combines all the above sectors (meaning electrical, mechanical and IT) along with scientific approach. \r\nThe expected deliverable of the program is the significant increase of knowledge and expertise regarding the profile of the vocational teachers.", "http://www.ox.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-EL01-KA102-000695_1"], ["2JD", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "THE CHANCELLOR, MASTERS AND SCHOLARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD", 855622.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.ox.ac.uk", "THE CHANCELLOR, MASTERS AND SCHOLARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000062_coordinator"], ["1JQ", "Creativitate, Responsabilitate, Educatie la Dunarea(C.R.E.D)", "The Lake School of English Oxford Limited", 26660.0, "TITLE: Creativity, Responsibility, Education at Dunarea (C.R.E.D)\r\nAIM: Updating our high school educational strategies and synchronising our school policy with the European education system, focusing more than ever before on knowledge, motivation, innovation, in order to attract students\u2018 interest for study and having as a consequence better results and improved professional competence in accordance with the Lifelong Learning principles.  \r\nSCHOOL NEEDS: a) The need to develop managerial abilities regarding project development - as to provide a better school integration on the European context \u2013 will be achieved through training sessions for the managerial team who will try to get involved in international projects and partnerships. b) The need to improve the teaching quality and the teacher-student cooperation will be attained through innovative methods training courses for teachers who will, consequently create optional curricula in Romanian and English, creating modern resources for other Romanian and European schools. c) The need to attract students in e-learning and mobile-learning activities, bringing their contribution to the creation of a shared pedagogical database/platform, will be accomplished through teachers\u2019 participating in digital competencies training sessions in order to ensure superior cognitive lifelong learning.\r\nObjectives: 1) Developing project and managerial competences for 2 managers (CA, CEAC), in order to elaborate projects and partnerships, through Erasmus+ mobility projects, during the project development. 2) Improving professional competences for 5 teachers regarding innovative methods and particularised educational approach, during and after the project development. 3) Achieving IT abilities and new technology usage skills for 5 teachers/non-pedagogical staff, in order to create and use the CRED e-Learning platform (pedagogical database), during and after the project development.\r\nPROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS: 2 managers will participate in project management and organisational courses, in order to develop planning, coordinating, diagnosing, controlling, managing and evaluation skills; 5 teachers/non-pedagogical staff from different curricular domains will participate to courses aimed at improving IT skills in order to use the innovative digital techniques of mobile-learning; 5 teachers from different curricular domains will learn to diversify their methods, alternating classical with modern approaches in order to dynamically modernise teaching-learning activities and cooperate better with students.\r\nACTIVITIES: 2 types of activities will be performed regarding project management and project mobilities.

Through their intercultural competences, educators can contribute largely to the development of a tolerant and co-operative behaviour in a society based on diversity and mutual understanding.\r\nA work placement abroad aims at helping students to develop key competences they will need in their professional qualification. Concretely, they gain insight into different concepts and strategies of education in other countries and develop intercultural competences and qualifications required in working with children and young people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. These competences are particularly important with regard to the work of institutions which support the integration of families with a migration background into the German educational system. Moreover, discussions with foreign colleagues tend to lead to an international exchange of ideas on education that can be an enrichment to both sides.\r\nThe practical placement abroad takes part in the second year of studies, so that students dispose of some fundamental knowledge regarding theories of education and how these are put into practice. Furthermore they have completed a six-week work placement in a childcare institution in Germany during their first year, thus gaining practical experience and enlarging their competences.

The use of new technologies and the improvement of our students\u2019 knowledge of the English language are two of our greatest academic concerns. In order to achieve our goals we have done a thorough analysis of our strengths and weaknesses, and we have determined that we need to gain knowledge and experience on how to implement English in early education, improve the use of ICT in both the learning process and outside the classroom, and the promotion of entrepreneurial ideas among our students.Firstly, our first and second graders will be introduced to English as their second language. Therefore, we need to acquire the competencies and innovative methodological approaches that our teachers need to improve their skills at this stage of education. The Danish educational system is renowned of being one of the best in Europe and English as a second language is introduced very early at schools.  Two teachers from our school will observe their methodology whereas two other participants will learn about the methodology used for the teaching of the English language as a mother tongue in the UK. Both activities will provide us with an example of good practices and how to teach literacy, communication, reading and listening comprehension on a different level.  Furthermore, another teacher will participate in a structured course to gain theoretical knowledge of modern pedagogical approaches and efficient didactic aids, whereas a second one will gain knowledge on how to effectively use creativity in different aspects of teaching.Secondly, modern technologies, which are close to our students as they have been exposed to them since childhood, come as a challenge for most of our teachers.  Therefore, we believe it is imperative to educate our teachers regarding the use of modern technology in the classroom.  The online classrooms that our teachers and students use are a great start but they are still very far from their full potential. Modern communication and the Internet technology provides people with a great deal of information nowadays as well as it enhances the internationalization of the school. One teacher from our school will obtain formation on how to use the ICT in the classroom, whereas another one will get acquainted with the use of computer tools and applications that enable communication with other members of a learning process. It needs to be pointed out that our teachers commute daily among three or four locations so it is imperative that one participant improves the competences in the field of management, organization, mediation and conflict resolution.Finally, we need to promote entrepreneurship to develop creativity, initiative, perseverance, cooperative work, responsibility and all the qualities required for the inclusion of our students in their future world of work. We intend to promote entrepreneurship and experiential learning.  Our goal is to provide a stimulating learning environment for the development of creative thinking in young people, so that they can develop into bold and successful individuals. The teacher who will mentor these workshops will be trained in a structured course entitled \u201cIntroduction of entrepreneurship in schools\u201d in order to gain global training on entrepreneurship, and will also observe a Danish school where the innovative approaches to problem solving are applied by using LEGOS.We are aware of the importance of the selection of participants with a dynamic, communicative and responsible profile to achieve our goals successfully. The Project committee will ensure our results\u2019 impact before, during and after the whole process, and   will monitor who, how and when to disseminate the results of the project, both locally and internationally, as the core of our impact and dissemination strategy. Such committee will also carry out the evaluation of the project results after each training activity through monthly reports, by the presentation and discussion of introducing new methods and by the interviews with students and teachers on the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of the new methodologies every six months.To conclude, we firmly believe that the sustainability of the new methodologies after the project is finished will finally ensure the successful improvements that we all expect on the fields described above.

She will gain confidence in speaking, listening, reading and writing. She will also develop a greater awareness of grammar structure and vocabulary, authentic and appropriate language, formal and informal language, so she can communicate more fluently and effectively in English. The school unit has made preregistration for all the participants and has signed a letter of intent with a second educational institution in Italy for two more training programs. At the first training program in Italy, five teachers are willing to be trained in new teaching methods in Italy that combine the new technologies and are oriented more in Student centered learning methods. The aim is to change and adapt the teaching to the peculiarities, abilities and needs of students in order to attract their interest and participate more actively in the educational process. Furthermore, participants teachers will gain experience and more confidence to develop e-twinning and mobility programs. Initially, participants will prepare for their participation in training via videoconferencing with the partner institution and organize the details of the visit in the host country. Participants will learn more about managing an effective and up to date classroom. Through interactive and engaging activities they will share classroom strategies, learn how to establish classroom rules, provide clear instructions, monitor, develop rapport, incorporate pair and group work, and gain tips for encouraging students to reflect on their own classroom behaviour. Upon completion of training, participant teachers will design Sample teachings which will be attended by the teachers who didn't participate in training. In addition, there will be dissemination of the results to teachers who don't belong to school unit through cooperation with the Pedagogical Director of the school unit, the specialty consultants, the collaborating agencies. Already there has been an agreement with the school counselor of Home Economics and the 2th Regional Training Center of Athens for the dissemination of results to schools and areas of their responsibility. At the second training program in Italy, the participant is the CEO of the school unity who will attend a course about school management. The principal of school unity will have the opportunity to learn 'by doing' through a range of activities and experiences aimed toward promoting higher student self-esteem, increased student involvement and greater cohesion among teachers, students and their families. Also, he will understand, identify and combat early school-leaving, negative school-family relations and the early signs of teacher burn-out. By the end of the course, he will have acquired greater knowledge about how creativity, improved communication and enhanced relational skills can be effective allies in discouraging school-leaving and favoring a more meaningful school experience. In the long term, the school aims to develop communication and exchange good practices with organizations from other countries in order to enhance teaching and make it attractive for the entire educational community.

Our primary objective is to achieve an inclusive school with equal opportunities for all our students. Our students with special educational needs need to be provided with innovative and enterprising methodological updates. After a thorough analysis of our strengths and weaknesses, we have determined that the use of traditional methodologies can generate unmotivated students. Such students end up becoming part of the rates of school failure in Primary Education and High School early drop-out.  Our objective is, therefore, the use of modern and innovative methodologies around creativity and entrepreneurship, and the creation of a website for the effective dissemination of our learnings and results.Firstly, we need to promote entrepreneurship to develop creativity, initiative, perseverance, cooperative work, responsibility and all the qualities required for the inclusion of our students in the world of work in the 21st century. We are convinced that entrepreneurship is the bridge that we need to bring society and school together, and it is for this reason that, apart from acquiring global training on entrepreneurship, we intend to implement the use of LEGOS following the Danish model in our classrooms and do a publicity campaign to promote the work and ideas of local ecological associations. Likewise, after getting training in the use of creativity within the British educational system, we intend to influence the intellectual, emotional and relational development of our students. Finally, we consider it necessary to obtain formation on how to create a website and strategies to successfully disseminate our learnings at local and international levels.To carry out our objectives successfully, we are aware of the importance of the selection of participants with a dynamic, communicative and responsible profile to disseminate methodologies and planned activities inside and outside our team. The school has determined that we need six international mobilities to achieve our goals. In order to guarantee that we develop these objectives, discussion, monitoring, evaluation, and economic committees have been created, which will ensure, each in its area of responsibility, the successful reach of agreements and commitments by all the parties.The committees will ensure our results\u2019 impact before, during and after the project is implemented.  The goal is to anticipate and assess at any time the effect of our activities and their results not only in the participants, but in our institution and the rest of partner organizations, both locally and internationally. The committees are also responsible to monitor and control who, how and when to disseminate the results of our project, both locally and internationally, providing a model of dissemination strategy as well as the tools that will be used for that purpose. As a prime example, we have made a drawing contest with students and families from the school, in which we could gather ideas from drawings with the Erasmus+ logo, the acronym KA1 and our students\u2019 ideal school. We take this as a first example of the use of entrepreneurship and active use of creativity. The results, as well as the characteristics of the outline of this project, have been published in our website. We intend to achieve wider and deeper knowledge from other educational systems so we don\u2019t stop there. At the international level, we are also going to publish our expectations and results on the eTwinning website.As a conclusion, we aim to ensure the sustainability of the new methodologies during and after the process. The evaluation of the achievements and the impact as described on the above paragraphs will be made public. Our goal is to set new educational models and continue spreading our experiences at national and international level through media and effective web dissemination. It will help us promote our ideas for future cooperation with our European partners and they would also substantially contribute to the internationalization of our school.", "http://www.englishinoxford.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA101-023695_2"], ["1JQ", "ABORDARI  INOVATOARE  ALE  ACTIVITATII  INSTITUTIONALE", "The Lake School of English Oxford Limited", 21893.0, "The managerial report of Zinca Golescu National College presented at the end of the school year 2014-2015,tackled 2 important needs regarding the teachers\u2019personal and professional development.

Throughout this project, 9 teachers including members of the managing board and teaching staff who are by far interested in their lifelong learning and proficient teamwork are going to attend 4 different courses: 1 dealing with communicative skills development and teamwork cooperation, 3 focusing on CLIL methodology and 1 job shadowing activity. The general purpose of our project is to enhance the communicative-cooperative competences and CLIL methodological approaches to 25% students and teachers. The courses/job shadow have been chosen on the grounds that their main objectives overlap our school\u2019s needs of quality development and internationalization. These training courses aim to:- improve the team effectiveness - model behavior, attitudes and skills in the workplace- provide training and practice for effective communication and performancepose is to offer high standard education in line with the latest European demand- participate in stimulating classroom discussions on key leadership topics- help participants to learn how to inspire your team as a powerful tool for focusing on the future goals, but also important for the current issues- a remarkable improvement of the CLIL methodology of English bilingual classes- a deeper insight into the practices, polices and educational systems in Europe- boost English communicative competence of the participants-  provide cooperating and learning in an international context-  exchange professional knowledge and practices in a multi\u2010cultural context- internationalisation  of our high school activity by means of participating in training activities abroad and developing strategic partnerships in Erasmus plus programmeIn order to carry out all the project-related activities,we decided to form a project team that deals with each and every aspect from planning, designing, implementing, disseminating to evaluation.Each team member will be responsible for a certain field and the coordinator will guide, monitor and evaluate. The participants in the training sessions will also be part of the implementation team. It is also necessary to mention that the assessment team for participants selection will function for two weeks from the beginning of the project lifespan.We expect to achieve two kinds of project results: the intellectual ones, such as enhanced teamwork management, cooperation and communication skills, positive group work attitudes, acquiring new approaches of teaching CLIL or job shadowing activities, improved English communicative competence, new possibilities of starting a transnational partnership as well as the tangible ones, represented by: reports, power points, newsletters,workshops,website,eTwinning discussion groups, courses, DVD, brochure.

The \u201cHerigoyen-Schule\u201d \u2013 being a bilingual primary school and focusing on improvement of media abilities \u2013 is in a unique situation, it will also work on the following areas of development \u201cteaching foreign languages and learning them\u201d and \u201cnew technologies, digital competences\u201d.\r\n\r\nProject objectives:\r\nThe improvement of linguistic and professional expertise of the teachers teaching the bilingual English classes is a crucial aim at \u201cHerigoyen-Schule\u201d. The contact with other European teachers and their exchange of professional views plus getting to know other cultural environments will widen the teachers\u00b4 horizons and improve the quality of their lessons. With this Erasmus project teachers will be enabled to teach their pupils how to attain knowledge in a modern way and how to learn to be critical while using modern technologies and media.\r\nMaking use of the knowledge of other European countries the following objectives shall be achieved in the shared area of development:\r\n\u2022 strengthening of the school administration\u00b4s process management,\r\n\u2022 optimization of existing curricula regarding individual support and social learning,\r\n\u2022 multiplication of the acquired knowledge on the level of supervisory school authority as well as the transfer of knowledge and new skills to local schools.\r\n\r\nProfile of participants:\r\nThe participants possess above-average qualifications and a comprehensive knowledge of their fields. They will disseminate the competences resulting from the project in their respective development areas and share them by means of school internal teacher training.\r\n\r\nDescription of activities:\r\nThe choice of courses was made due to the individual needs and knowledge of the participants and differs in length and level. The language courses are offered by certified language schools situated in English-speaking countries employing highly qualified staff. The job-shadowing will be a useful addition.\r\n\r\nThe course in new media follows contemporary teaching and learning trends. It takes into account the fast development in the area of multimedia and provides a future-oriented European platform for a profitable exchange of views.\r\nThe well structured and moderated  exchange of views during the stay in Sweden and South Tyrol includes a visit to several educational institutions and allows the participants to observe and learn how inclusive and social learning is carried out in other European schools and educational institutions.\r\n\r\nApproaches for the implementation of the project:\r\nThe participants\u00b4 tasks will be defined in the groups responsible for the areas of development. Newly acquired experiences and knowledge  will be gathered in these groups, documented and finally passed to the control group in charge. The supervisory school authority will coordinate the entire project in close cooperation with the control group.\r\n\r\nIntended results and long-term benefits:\r\nTo learn about other educational systems and cultural environments will widen the teacher\u00b4s points of view especially regarding the described areas of development. Acquired knowledge will be used in their daily lessons und will effectively improve the quality of their teaching. Organisational structures will be reassessed and optimized. The final report will be collectively written and will be accessible for all schools in the area.

Since 2003 we have been offering to our students the opportunity to specialise in international pedagogics including the possibility to do a work placement abroad.Our International Pedagogics Profile is meant to enlarge the students\u2019 intercultural competences as well as their language skills and to help them develop a deeper understanding of diverse cultures and mentalities. Through their intercultural competences, educators can contribute largely to the development of a tolerant and co-operative behaviour in a society based on diversity and mutual understanding.A work placement abroad aims at helping students to develop key competences they will need in their professional qualification. Concretely, they gain insight into different concepts and strategies of education in other countries and develop intercultural competences and qualifications required in working with children and young people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. These competences are particularly important with regard to the work of institutions which support the integration of families with a migration background into the German educational system. Moreover, discussions with foreign colleagues tend to lead to an international exchange of ideas on education that can be an enrichment to both sides.The practical placement abroad takes part in the second year of studies, so that students dispose of some fundamental knowledge regarding theories of education and how these are put into practice. Furthermore they have completed a six-week work placement in a childcare institution in Germany during their first year, thus gaining practical experience and enlarging their competences. These professional competences should be enhanced and deepened during their placement abroad.The duration of the placement is six weeks. During the first two weeks, interns make contact and get acquainted with their new environment. They also gain some basic insight into the institution\u2019s concept of work and begin to surmount language barriers. In the following four weeks these impressions are deepened, learning processes are initiated, contacts to children, parents and colleagues strengthened and language skills improved.The possible fields of work for certified educators include the following:early education, daycare and residential institutions for children 5 \u2013 10 years old, youth and family work, working with people with disabilities and special needs.The placements abroad have been chosen according to these objectives.Activity 2:We are a vocational college (Fachschule) training future educators.

According to the minutes of the team \u00b4\u00b4Hessennetzwerk Erasmus +\u00b4\u00b4, which met on 30 November in 2015, the purpose is to initiate a cooperation and to exchange different ideas regarding concepts and strategies of education. Both institutions consider international and intercultural cooperation to be a major aim of their work and support exchange programs as well as cultural learning. Thus they try to implement in parts integration and regional, national and international labour market mobility /flexibility. Both institutions have a similar training content but there are also differences that lead to an international exchange of ideas on education that can be an enrichment to both sides. They are both confronted with the challenge of dealing with international surveys and quality standards which have as such a strong impact on teaching concepts. In order to ensure the quality in apprenticeships the training is meant to enlarge the teachers\u2019 intercultural competences and to help them develop a deeper understanding of diverse cultures and mentalities.

The length of the placements is 4-12 weeks, the target countries including DE, ES, HU, UK, NL and IE. The objective re students is to improve their professional, linguistic, entrepreneurial, communication, co-operation and cultural skills.  We also wish to support their independence and self-confidence by encouraging them to assume as much responsibility as possible concerning the arrangements of their placements,yet we ensure sufficient support and good preparation for each participant.The participants of a short group exchange to Hungary constitute a special group. The participants, 10 catering and hairdresser students, are gathered from the three different schools of Sasky offering these lines. The objective is to give an opportunity  to participate for students who normally would not participate without the support of a group or an accompanying teacher, due to social or economical problems or learning difficulties. The objective of Sasky is also to share internationalisation skills and partnerships, for instance M\u00e4ntt\u00e4 Regional Vocational Education Centre has co-operated with this school for years, and now we wish to spread the co-operation to the two other schools.  We would like to send 3 accompanying teachers with the group, each staying 6 days. Sasky has very limited experience of placements of disadvantaged students, and the partner even less, but we are hoping to start off the co-operation on the right foot.  For the partner it is also important that one of the teachers is already known to them.The purpose of the other teacher mobilities is quality assurance, making the use of ECVET a standard and starting mobility on new fields: even though the co-operation goes way back with most partners, the expansion of Sasky forces us to seek new fields of co-operation with them.At the same time, we wish to improve the internationalisation skills of the teachers by peer learning (of course, observing the world of work in another country also gives the teachers themselves new ideas and motivation for their work). The teacher mobilities are realised in well-planned groups including teachers from different schools, both vocational subjects teachers and international coordinators. The international coordinators ensure that all the relevant matters regarding co-operation and ECVET are dealt with; the vocational subjects teachers are responsible for making the partner understand the content requirements and evaluation of the placement All participants will present the results of their visit both at the internationalisation team of Sasky and at the staff meeting of their own school. This modus operandi has been piloted in All 4 One project with positive results. A new idea is to invite a Norwegian entrepreneur to Ikaalinen College of Crafts and Design with the objective of teaching us something and learning something herself.All these mobilities will support the objectives of Sasky\u2019s internationalisation strategy, the most important ones are:- equal opportunities re internationalisation for students and teachers. The reciprocity brought by the activities is equally important here, therefore the co-operation between schools is highly recommendable. Linguistic preparation also enriches the language selection at Sasky.- the quality of mobility, especially making the use of ECVET a standard and involving the vocational subjects teachers more and more in the organisation of the placements. Shared good practices are equally important; they are constantly perfected at the internationalisation team- the increased involvement of the teachers also realises another objective: Sasky being a genuinely international organisation, internationalisation being the responsibility of the whole staff- increasing the outgoing student mobility numbers to 115 by the end of the year 2016, of which 75 should be at least 4 weeks placements, and the number of incoming students to 50Mobility also supports the development of an international study path at Sasky and the better recognition of all the skills gained during placements.  For Sasky, it is still important to complete the merger: All for One and One for All is the motto of Sasky\u2019s international activities.  That means that we work together for shared objectives and also achieve a much more.  Internationalisation is one of the areas where the advantages of a having a big organisation are clear.In the future Sasky seeks to increase its mobility numbers slightly while taking care of the quality.

Agreements are reached and letters of intent are signed with the host organizations or polytechnics.\r\n2. Students and teachers are informed of the terms and requirements for the placement.\r\n3. A committee selects the students who are taking part in the project.\r\n4. These students start receiving extra language lessons on the target language. These lessons will be reinforced by a two weeks language and cultural training in the country of destination.\r\n5. We send the host organization information about the students profile; the modules they have studied and the task they are expected to carry out in the company together with the students European CV and a letter of intent. The host organization will receive this information at least two months before the actual work placement takes place.\r\n6. Based on this information, the host company will find a suitable workpacement for the students and will put them into contact with the tutor in the company. They will also help the students find accommodation.\r\n7. The coordinator, the student and host organization will sing a contract assuming responsibility for the project.\r\n8. The coordinator will inform and provide the tutor in the company with the necessary tools for the monitoring and evaluation of the training.\r\n9. We will be informed by the tutor and by the students him/herself every 15 days.\r\n10. The project will be assessed continuously by all the parts involved in the project before, during and at the end of the project. We will also assess the impact of the project on the employability of the students.\r\n11. The placement is a compulsory module in the student\u2019s curricula (the 350 hours practical training in company\u2019s module) and it will be recognized accordingly. The students will also be certified by the host company and both the coordinator and the host company will sign the Europass certificate.\r\n12. The mobilities will take place Turing the third term of the school year, which are the set dates for Internships at work placements.\r\n13. The project aims for students to do professional internships abroad. Our school is in contact with other schools and companies in Germany, Sweden, Latvia and Finland, where our students will spend periods of 4 to 8 weeks working in companies. At the same time, they will attend English classes to reinforce their acquired knowledge during their stay in the foreign country.\r\n14.

Also, the City wanted to manage  a similar project.\r\n\r\nThe overall objective of this project is to promote the meeting of Otherness and the opening to the world of participants through a process of co-construction and cooperation. Thus, by offering a cooperative work space based on the values of respect, equality and mutual enrichment, we want to promote inter-cultural encounters and the deconstruction of prejudices. The aim is to encourage participants to take a look at the world and thereby fight against racism and xenophobia and to defend the values of peace, help and mutual understanding.\r\n\r\n 11 countries are concerned in all by this exchange, but only 8 are eligible for the KA1/Exchange of youths: France, Germany, Lithuania, Israel, Tunisia, Austria and Armenia. \r\nThe three other countries are China, Burkina Faso and Japan.
