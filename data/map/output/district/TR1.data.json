A. fumigatus is a ubiquitous mould whose spores are airborne and thus frequently inhaled. Humans with impaired immunity, e.g. those with haematological malignancies or bone marrow transplant recipients, are at a dramatically increased risk of severe, invasive A. fumigatus infection known as invasive aspergillosis (IA). IA is a rare disease in Europe but causes tremendous costs to the public health sector. Currently definitive diagnosis of IA is only obtained at autopsy or relies on invasive biopsy, an extremely unpleasant procedure which is not always applicable in suffering patients. Thus, a convenient, fast and specific diagnosis of IA is not available forcing clinicians to administer antifungal drugs on spec if a standard antibiotic treatment failed to reduce fever in risk patients. It would be of high financial benefit for clinics and has the potential to increase the survival rates of immuno-compromised patients, if a definitive diagnosis of IA could be obtained early and its response to treatment be monitored. This would allow applying the correct therapy at a dose and duration exactly tailored to patient needs. Equally important is the development of new treatment options which can replace existing systemic antifungal drugs with their known severe side effects. The approach of the consortium is to develop new disease specific tracers based on monoclonal antibodies along with the combined molecular imaging technologies PET/MR and PET/CT. Newly developed tracers shall then be functionalised by a combined labelling with radio-isotopes allowing diagnostic PET imaging but also immuno-radiotherapy, thus representing truly anti-infectious theranostics. This would provide a framework for new tools in the management not only of this rare but life-threatening mycosis but principally also for other infectious hazards.", 730961.0, 6484522.0, "MATHIAS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_109473_951335358"], ["3AY", "RES Generation-From Infrastructure to Sustainable Energy and Reduction of CO2 Emissions", "Cornwall Council", "The overall objective of RESGen project is to create realistic grounds and practical tools for developing regional energy self sufficiency, and potential innovative regional research-driven clusters across the EU. This objective will be achieved through a Workplan consisting of six WP&apos;s, being WP1 project management and coordination.

Implementation of emerging technologies in the energy sector requires the involvement of key players such as municipalities and governmental authorities.\n\nWith EU funding, the http://www.obotnia.fi/resgen/ (RESGEN) (RES generation-From infrastructure to sustainable energy and reduction of CO2 emissions) project promoted regional energy self-sufficiency by coordinating the innovative work of regional research clusters across the EU. The main goal was to evaluate and compare regional capacity and capabilities of generating sustainable energy to draw up four different roadmaps and a joint action plan (JAP).\n\nThe approach followed by the RESGEN consortium to boost sustainable energy entailed the development of comprehensive regional strategies. These integrated all of the main regional stakeholders, industries, regional authorities, and research and development bodies into regional development programmes.\n\nRESGEN contributed to new thinking in the regions involved. The benchmarking leading to the roadmaps provided a useful tool for the regions and helped to initiate dialogue within different European organisations. Based on the work carried out in the project, Ostrobothnia was able to contribute to the European debate and lead active discussions within a smart specialisation platform. This platform was established by the European Commission to provide professional advice to regions on their innovation strategies.\n\nA number of JAPs helped strengthen cooperation amongst the partners and enabled them to identify different topics for future collaboration. The JAP themes covered smart grids, regional sustainable energy management, wind energy, energy efficiency, green public procurement and marine energy.\n\nAchieving energy self-sufficiency will be a long-lasting process that should positively impact society. By preparing regions for sustainable energy management, RESGEN contributed to EU goals of reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
