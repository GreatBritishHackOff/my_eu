This makes high\r\ndemands on our students in both areas of expertise.\r\n\r\nWe at our school are firmly convinced that in the export oriented, global setting our local companies operate in, English skills among\r\nstudents must be improved and fostered as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThis is only partly true for technical vocational colleges in Austria, as the number of weekly English lessons is lower than in advanced\r\ngeneral secondary schools. This is one reason why we offer internships abroad to our students.\r\n\r\nThese internships do not just add to the above aim. In addition to the general linguistic development of the participants, they offer\r\nthe students enormous leaps forward in terms of technical language and cultural understanding.\r\n\r\nWhat is more, they open up new job possibilities for the students and provide them with new perspectives on their future career.\r\nFor this reason, our school is highly interested in continuing our sucessful cooperation with our partner companies and even\r\nexpanding it by finding new partners.\r\n\r\nThis year, eight students will do such an internship in the UK, all of them having just finished the fourth year of their five-yeartraining\r\nat our college. All of them are shining stars in terms of both their technical and social skills.\r\n\r\nIn order to foster the good relationship with the branch companies abroad, it is desirable for representatives of the school to make a\r\nvisit in person. In this way we can show our appreciation and interest and, if necessary, discuss on site any problems or discrepancies\r\nthat may arise.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the ideal accommodation for our students is in an English-speaking environment, preferably in a family situation. Here,\r\ntoo, a visit in person from representatives of the school can have a significant relevance.\r\n\r\nThe project is planned, carried out and reviewed in close cooperation with our partner companies, all of which have been reliable\r\nand precious partners for years now.", "http://www.liebherr.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA102-034747_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SR4"}
