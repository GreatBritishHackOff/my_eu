Experts in EHR architectures, clinical data structures, terminologies and ontology will combine, tailor and pilot their best-of-breed resources in response to the needs articulated by clinicians and public health physicians.These exemplars will be cross-referenced with other domains and stakeholder perspectives via Clinical and Industrial Advisory Boards and interactions with other projects in Topic 5.3. The project will generalise and formalise the methods and best practices in how to combine and adapt informatics resources to support semantic interoperability, and how these can be developed and supported at scale. Health authorities, clinical professionals, ministries, vendors, purchasers, insurers are involved to ensure the project approach and results are realistically adoptable and viable, building on the SemanticHEALTH and CALLIOPE roadmaps.A business model to justify strategic investments, including the opportunity costs for key stakeholders such as SDOs, industry, will be defined. This, and links with epSOS II and the eHealth Governance Initiative, will inform the shape of the Virtual Organisation that this Network will establish to sustain semantic interoperability developments and their adoption.The consortium comprises more than 40 internationally recognised experts, including from USA and Canada, ensuring a global impact.", 70661.0, 2614971.0, "SemanticHealthNet", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_101477_969057549"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5JF", "ON & FOR PRODUCTON: A European Project ON and FOR Artists\u2019 Moving Image", "LUX", 56044.0, "ON & FOR PRODUCTION is an initiative dedicated to artists\u2019 moving image, which is at once discursive (ON Production) and practical (FOR Production). This imbrication of knowledge-circulation and its implementation, testifies to the learning-in-doing principle that underpins O&F\u2019s activity in response to the equally performative nature of moving image production. Indeed, the methodologies that have been set up by artists and organisations over the last years in Europe are not pattern-based but rather redefined according to each project\u2019s needs. This redefinition has allowed for the consolidation of a genuine and innovative production field that O&F intends to disclose and drive forward. Another structuring principle in O&F is that of collaboration. O&F facilitates the dialogue between different European moving image art traditions and methodologies to have a supporting effect at two levels: the artworks themselves and the field as a whole. As yet another form of collaboration, the cross-fertilisation of resources, methods and publics between art and cinema is of special interest for O&F.Articulated in three activity clusters taking place in London, Brussels and Madrid, the programme combines professional and public events to examine and share production and distribution concerns as well as moving image practice. Along with a Symposium, a Seminar and Screening programmes, O&F develops innovative activities such as the Work Sessions and the Young Artists\u2019 Workshop. The former is an adaptation of cinema industry markets to an art context in which artists share projects in development to get conceptual and strategic feedback and to find co-producers. The latter is an occasion for emerging artists to get one-on-one meetings with a wide range of experts.", "http://www.lux.org.uk", null, "creative_559262-CREA-1-2015-1-BE-CULT-COOP1_1"], ["3BB", "Peirene Press, 2015", "PEIRENE PRESS LTD", 14880.0, "Translation into English, publication and promotion of three short novels originally written in Finnish, Norwegian and French.
