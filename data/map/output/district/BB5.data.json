Care has been taken to ensure this project is complimentary to others being developed within the P4 call - jointly with Lancaster University we are able to say \u2013 \u201cWe are aware of other projects applying to this call and will engage with them as they move through outline and full application to delivery, with a desire to ensure smooth cross referral. Preliminary discussions suggest complementarity with the Lancaster University project ProToCoL\u201d. The activities will be delivered between 1/7/17 and 30/6/20, with the program designed to achieve outputs supporting enterprises within the first 6 month period, and ensuring a broad spread of outputs are achieved early in the funding program, enabling confidence in the deliverability of the scheme.The project will support 500 general SMEs (plus 10 new SMEs) to audit their energy efficiency needs/implement action plans to reduce energy consumption/stimulate new renewable energy production. It will work with 100 low carbon technology developer SMEs (plus 20 new SMEs) to support their low carbon products into market, stimulating advanced manufacturing diversification into low carbon production. Resulting in 5000 tonnes per annum reduction of greenhouse gas production, 15 new to firm products and 5 new to market products being produced. With regards to costs this project appears to be delivering very good value for money with all the unit costs falling well below the unit cost target from the Operational Programme.", "ERDF", 1154200.0, 1990000.0, "erdf_england_394"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BB5"}
