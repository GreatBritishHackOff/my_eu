The latter offers further differentiation according to the main subjects studied \u2013 Pedagogy, Economics or Sport. It is a well-established school within the local community, which has an international streak: the importance that Foreign Languages are given, as well as the professional profile of the Humanities Course, give our students multicultural and multi-linguistic skills. Over the last few years, the teaching of non-linguistic subjects in a foreign language, CLIL, has been introduced in the Language Course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe DOC project proposed by our school has international and multicultural objectives and aims at making these more effective by:\r\n\r\n- reinforcing the teacher\u2019s knowledge of foreign languages (primarily those involved in the CLIL skills), through training and contact with teachers from other countries;\r\n\r\n- reinforcing the teaching staff\u2019s skills through an exchange of views regarding curricular activities and methodology in schools from other countries;\r\n\r\n- reinforcing the international and multi-linguistic culture of the school throughout the various phases of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14 teachers will be involved in the DOC project , of which 10 will be Italian and 4 foreign,  divided as follows:\r\n\r\n- 6 Italian teachers working on a summer training programme; the teachers chosen  (those working on the CLIL area started in the school will have priority) will spend 15 days abroad and go on a full-immersion training course (3 teachers will go to an English-speaking area and 3 to  a French-speaking area) based on the teachers\u2019 personal needs (level of language and subject taught). They will select appropriately planned teaching experiences in collaboration with the training centres. \r\n\r\n- - 4 teachers carrying out a one-week subject exchange with corresponding teachers from other countries (2 in GB and 2 in France); the teachers chosen will teach their subject in the hosting school in English/French. This experience will allow them to  be fully immersed in a parallel school environment to observe its features and qualities.  Being in touch with foreign colleagues and students and analysing teaching contents and methods will mean great opportunities for their working skills\r\n\r\n- 4 foreign teachers (2 French and 2 Scottish will work on a parallel subject exchange with teachers from our school. They will be welcomed to our school where they will hold classes in their own language and take part in school life offering the opportunity to debate and to have an exchange of views with all the members of the teachers\u2019 staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Italian staff directly involved in the mobility action will be selected after a careful analysis of the requisites needed to stand as a candidate.\r\n\r\nA specific characteristic of the DOC project is the forming of a work team of 4 members appointed and supervised by the Headmaster, in charge of organizing every single stage of the project itself.\r\n\r\nHe/She  will have the responsibility of encouraging all teachers willing to become involved in  the initiative, so that there are potential positive effects on the whole school staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effects of the DOC project can be foreseen on two different levels\r\n\r\n- an immediate impact on the school staff directly involved in the initiative (school staff and teachers in charge of the mobility action); by gaining experience from the planned activities they will be able to reinforce both their linguistic and teaching skills;\r\n\r\n- a  wider benefit offered to all school members (teachers and school staff , students and stakeholders) who will have the opportunity to achieve a higher level of professional competence and cultural growth.", "http://www.lockerbieacademy.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-IT02-KA101-001819_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DG11"}
