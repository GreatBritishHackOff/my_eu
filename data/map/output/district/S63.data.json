Original predictions over the longevity of constructed wetlands were approximately 50 -100 years (Conley et al 1991).  However, it has become disappointingly apparent that these systems are clogging and have on average a lifetime of less than 10 years (Griffin et al 2008). Currently when a wetland becomes clogged, the whole site has to be refurbished and the reeds regrown, which takes several years and has significant economic consequences for the operators.\n\nOur project ARBI aims to develop and trial an Autonomous Reed Bed Installation containing a magnetic resonance probe, can be deployed in several locations within a wetland to give measurements at different depths.  By measuring the relaxation times of MR, sufficient information can be obtained to determine the clog state of the gravel bed of a wetland. This would enable the operators to isolate those areas of the bed where the problem resides and make a partial intervention, without the need to remove and re-plant the whole reed bed. When the system is  developed, we will have potential for application in other water treatment systems based on subsurface flows like: slow rate sand filters, and river bank filtration.\n\nThe project will have major benefits for those organisations who would like to install reedbeds but  have resisted doing because of concerns over performance and maintenance costs.  These will increase the potential size of the market for reedbed installers and benefit the SMEs in the consortium who currently are operating in a constrained market which has not achieved its true potential.", 143357.0, 1203108.0, "ARBI", "Improving reed bed water treatment", "A green technology that uses reed beds to treat wastewater is receiving a major boost thanks to an EU initiative extending the system's working life.", "There are over 12\u00a0000 constructed wetlands across Europe, which are used to further treat wastewater that has already been passed through water treatment plants. The wetlands usually comprise a gravel bed planted with reeds through which the wastewater passes and is purified by biofilms of microorganisms living on the gravel's surface.\n\nOriginal predictions for the working life of constructed wetlands were 50-100 years. However, because the gravel becomes clogged, this figure has been drastically revised to an average lifetime of less than 10 years. Furthermore, refurbishing the system is both time consuming and expensive, and disrupts the water treatment process.\n\nThe EU-funded project http://www.arbi-eu.com/ (ARBI) (Autonomous reed bed installations) is developing a system containing magnetic resonance sensors, which give prior warning of clogging. The probes can provide measurements of the clog state of the gravel bed at different depths, enabling the problem to be isolated and speedily dealt with. This means that the entire reed bed does not need to be removed and replanted.\n\nARBI will be a modular system that offers a step change in constructed wetland technology, supplying an off-the-shelf solution. This can be easily tailored to customers' needs with regard to treatment volume and contaminant level by simply using multiple modules.\n\nThe system monitors clogging and helps maintain optimal conditions with minimal need for human intervention. Once it is successfully developed, it could be applied to other water treatment systems based on subsurface flows. These include slow-rate sand filters and river bank filtration.\n\nARBI will benefit those organisations that wish to install reed beds for water treatment, but were discouraged by concerns over cost and performance. It will therefore enable environmentally friendly constructed wetland treatments to be used far more widely than previously thought possible.", null, "http://www.lightmain.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-07/159212.jpg", "fp7_109925_951897085"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7EW", "EUC Syd rejser ud", "B&E Together Ltd", 72323.0, "The participants in the project is trainees, apprentices and staff from EUC Syd. \r\nThe aims of the project is to prepare the young trainees and apprentices for the common EU labour market and for some of the participants the mobility could give them the opportunity to take parts of their education abroard in the Danish PIU program. \r\nThe mobilities should give all the participants an international experience and also challenge them both professionally and personally. \r\nWorking with mobilities is a growing part of the international strategy at EUC Syd and we have worked with some of our partners for quite some time and new partners are always coming onboard during the project period. \r\nWe pland to send the participants our on mobilities on their own or in pairs and in a few occations in smaller groups.

It has propitiated the present project that will.meet the demands of educational VET Schools, enhancing better relationships among them  and national and European companies.\r\n\r\nThe project is addressed to 72 VET students and former students: second-year students of middle level vocational training of Tourism and Gastronomy, Computer Science and Administration or recent graduated (who graduated the last year), like mid-level technician of the mentioned professional sectors. \r\nThe project foresees 8 mobility flows: 4 to Italy, 1 to France, 1 to Poland and 2 to United Kingdom. \r\n\r\nEach VET school will select 3 former students and 9 students. The project foresees that 4 mobility flows will be carried out to Italy as the profile of the Italian partners as well as the different geographical areas they are located, will provide the students with the chance to be trained in very diverse companies of the same sectors.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of the ODEE project is to promote student\u2019s development of skills and competences through internships in companies in order to integrate the vocational competences they have already acquired and to efficiently enter the single European labour market. Therefore, students need, from one hand, to develop specific and technical skills in their professional sector, and from another hand, they also need to acquire and improve other key competencies, like cultural, linguistic, entrepreneurship, personal initiative, team, as well as to acquire knowledge about new different work environments. All these competences will enhance student\u2019s access to the EU labour market, both as self-employee and/or hired worker.\r\n\r\nThe main ACTIVITIES that partners of the project will carry out are:\r\n- PREPARATION of the motilities: selection of the participants, initial evaluation of their competences, pre-departure training of participants, logistics and agreements\u2019 tasks definition, coordination, etc.\r\n- IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOBILITY. Implementing the internship programs in the companies. The mobility also includes cultural activities.\r\n- EVALUATION OF THE PARTICIPANTS. The competences that will be acquired during the stay abroad will be evaluated according to the ECVET system and will be previously set, during the initial evaluation. All the internship activities will be planned to achieve these competences and will be customized.\r\n- MONITORING. The development of the internships will be monitored by all the tools and processes, previously agreed by the project.\r\n- EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT. \r\n- DISSEMINATION. The dissemination activities will be carried out in all project\u2019s phases. A final conference for the dissemination of the project\u2019s results will be organized. Besides the impact on the participants, the project will benefit all partners, fostering the European cooperation and relationships between companies and educational centres.\r\n\r\nThe DISSEMINATION activities and the mobility itself will generate an IMPACT at local, regional and national level. \r\nThe impact on the partnership\u2019s VET schools will be:\r\n- Improving qualifications and competitiveness of youngsters, enabling them to adapt to the digital era\u2019s demands and to a global knowledge-based economy, enhancing , at the same time, the increase of the youth employment and a sustainable growth.\r\n- Consolidating and increasing contacts with European entities to modernise education, to share good practices and to develop new projects in the field of European cooperation\r\n- Improving the quality of the training, delivered in the school, and adapted to linguistic, social and cultural diversity.

This may initially sound easy. However, there is much to be in place for pupils, parents, teaching staff and school administration before such work practices can be referred to as successful.  Partner organizations have to prepare to receive a Norwegian student. They must assess tasks in their own companies and match them to learning objectives our students bring with their curriculum. Students prepares for the learning objectives for their own program, and finding out which type of exercises are expected to perform during their period abroad. Teachers facilitate and help students in order for them to be able to learn the most, and thereby help them to match the learning objectives and defining achievement.\r\n\r\nPrior to traveling, students attend preparatory meetings. The focus is society and culture. Through the these meetings we prepare students on what to expect and what it means to be a \u201cworld Citizen\u201d. We also try to give them an insight to the fact that the world increasingly becomes smaller.\r\n\r\nThe school hopes to observe that internationalization makes a difference in school choice among youth. There is a need to recruit for vocational subjects, and particularly some subjects have been more affected than others have. The mobilities in itself is an activity to encourage recruitment to our program areas, and not least to motivate students to complete their vocational education. \r\nThe upcoming period of mobilities holds new partners in France and in Italy. We carefully  follow the development for the programmes of  resturant and food processing (France) and Design and Textile (Italy). We are eager to see how our cooperation will develop, and not least to see the experiences and learning outcomes the pupils will have.\r\n\r\nDocumentation of learning outcomes is important and is an ongoing development in all departments. Using ECVET documents will become easier for more teachers as this is a focus in the field. The work is time-consuming and it is expected development in the coming years.\r\n\r\nThe school's European development plan \"PROUD\" says:\r\n\"Students thrive through feeling secure, trusting each other and caring for each other \u2013 through internationalisation, confidence is tested, both for the individual student and for the staff members who travels along: new destinations, new collaborators and colleagues and new companies. Through training trust through new collaborators, testing the ability to care for each other and for new friends, students and teachers alike strengthen their ability to thrive, and feel more confident that they can thrive in unfamiliar situations. Consequently, the students become more aware of their own ability to master situations which they are sure to meet in their working life\"\r\n\r\nTo uphold the secure environment for learning our school always send accompanying persons to all destinations. Our students are aged 17 to 19 when they leave, and they need the secure framwork we can offer. \r\n\r\nBorgund Vidareg\u00e5ande School is focused on quality.
