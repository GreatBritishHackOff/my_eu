This project will build upon this success and ensure that a large number of our staff members will gain a deeper understanding of how to effectively teach and support EAL students and their families.  They will acquire this understanding during an intensive week of immersion in Spanish, during which they will also gain a deeper understand of what it means for our school to be a European school and for the UK to be a member of the EU.  Whilst in Spain, participating staff will learn about the culture and history of the host country giving them a deeper knowledge of another EU country.  Further to this, we intend to strengthen European dimension of our citizenship curriculum so students and staff have a sound understanding of the context in which the Brexit debate has taken place.\r\n\r\nWe aim to improve the Spanish speaking abilities of participants, and provide them with an valuable learning experience, which they will apply to their professional practice when working with EAL students.  Alongside improvements in the achievement of EAL students, the citizenship curriculum regarding understanding of the workings of the EU and what it means to be a citizen of an EU country will be enhanced.  The quality of learning in citizenship lessons regarding the EU will also be outstanding, because participating staff members will be able to relate their experience of the project and the insights they have gained to students in lessons.\r\n\r\nThis project is essential for staff in the school to gain a real insight into the experiences of many of our students who arrive in the UK speaking no English, and dislocated from their wider families and communities.  They have to quickly adapt to their new surroundings and deal with the complexities of life in a school in a different culture.  By giving our staff an taste of an equivalent experience which they could not have in the UK, we expect, as a school community, that our expertise in developing EAL students and our citizenship curriculum will be greatly enhances.  We expect that this will have a long term benefit to the school, because the staff-competencies, curriculum, and teacher confidence in dealing with speakers of other languages will become embedded in the systems and practices of the school community of Saint Gabriel's.", "http://www.saintgabrielscollege.org", "Saint Gabriel's College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035787_coordinator"], ["7JP", "Liderzy w organizacji wielokulturowej", "IRMO Indoamerican Refugee and Migrant Organization", 12550.0, "Job shadowing is a valuable, practical experience that enables a person to learn about a job by physically observing and participating in another person at work.
