Its global human and economic burden is tremendous and increasing annually. Yet today only a few pharmaceutical companies retain active antibacterial drug discovery programmes. While the elaboration of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action is scientifically complex, the chief challenge is diminishing incentives. Pre-market regulatory requirements and increased control on post-market access, use, and pricing of new antibiotics are strong deterrents to drug development. Meanwhile, healthcare payers are not currently prepared to reimburse antibiotics at prices that would support the cost of development.\n\nApplied to antibiotics, a simple sales-based economic model contradicts the public health mandate to reduce their consumption in order to preserve their efficacy. Alternative models that can create incentives for the discovery of novel antibiotics and yet reconcile these incentives with responsible antibiotic use are long overdue.\n\nThe multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder DRIVE-AB consortium composed of 16 public and 8 private partners from 12 countries will produce new models in a stepwise yet interconnected process.  To achieve this objective, the DRIVE-AB consortium has put together a strong team that comprises both currently active researchers on the antibiotics problem and new researchers who can bring a fresh perspective as well as experience from other industries, economic specialties, and business cultures. The academic team has been enriched by EFPIA members and stakeholders from various backgrounds. With this diverse, yet closely tied team, DRIVE-AB will deliver fresh, sustainable solutions to this complex problem.\n\nFirst, we will develop an evidence-based, consensus definition for \u201cresponsible antibiotic use,\u201d which, with its standardised quality and quantity indicators, will provide the framework for all later steps. Next, data from surveillance systems, antibiotic prescription databases, and published literature will inform estimations of the present burden of antibiotic resistance from both clinical and economic perspectives across varying socioeconomic backdrops. Simulation models informed by these data as well as data from past and ongoing epidemics will estimate future public health needs and impact related to AMR, again in diverse socioeconomic settings. Together these constructs will allow for valuation models that will estimate the true value of existing and new antibiotics from the perspectives of patients, physicians, payers, and society as a whole. These, in turn, will inform the creation of alternative economic strategies and reward models that will promote and sustain the development of new antibiotics while simultaneously bolstering appropriate use of existing antibiotics. The most promising schemes will be presented to policymakers and other stakeholders with attendant implementation and risk-management strategies.\n\nThis ambitious project will not succeed if it is developed and championed merely by one sector of society, be it academia, \u201cbig pharma,\u201d or public health. The robustness and applicability of the proposed alternative models will only be proportional to their level of input from all involved players. All work from beginning to end will be performed in close collaboration with the consortium\u2019s stakeholder partners, which run the gamut from patients and clinical societies to small- and medium-sized enterprises, large pharmaceutical companies, healthcare payers, public health officials, and government officials. The DRIVE-AB consortium will dedicate considerable resources to this collaboration and to the final dissemination of information to policymakers and the wider public.\n\nOverall, we are confident that the work of the DRIVE-AB consortium will have an immense impact.

Achieving such social smartfeeds requires facing the grand challenge of providing recommendations that are simultaneously real-time, large-scale, socially informed, interactive and context aware.<br/>CrowdRec addresses this challenge by pioneering a breed of algorithms that combine crowdsourcing and recommendation algorithms to achieve a new generation of social smartfeeds for access and exchange of digital media in social networks. The key insight of CrowdRec is that, in order to achieve the dense, high-quality, timely information required for a truly useful social smartfeed, it is necessary to go beyond passive information collection and also beyond users' immediate social circles. Instead, the necessary information can be actively acquired by using crowdsourcing to solicit input and feedback from the wider community. CrowdRec algorithms create a symbiosis between users and content: they establish reciprocal relationships that both satisfy users' digital media needs and connect media with users able and willing to contribute the information necessary to improve access and exchange for the overall community.<br/>The project pursues three scientific and technical objectives: 'Stream Recommendation': exploiting the ability of recommender system's to process usage patterns to create social smartfeeds useful in large-scale social networks; 'Crowd Engagement': designing algorithms that engage users to generate information needed for smartfeeds; 'Deployment and Validation': creating a both a reference implementation to support research and a real-world social networks for large-scale user trials.<br/>CrowdRec achieves its ambitious goals by bringing academic, industry and SME partners with longstanding expertise in social and context-aware recommendation together with two large social networks with the high volume of media data flowing in live user communities (one > 14 million members and one > 20 thousand members) necessary for 'in vivo' development and evaluation of CrowdRec technology.", 37964.0, 3378197.0, "CrowdRec", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110635_951393752"], ["4TE", "Treatment of high organic load, high temperature and high salinity industrial waste water containing recalcitrant contaminants", "International Primary Aluminium Institute Lbg", "PROMETHEUS aims to treat high organic load high temperature (85\u00b0C), and high salinity industrial waste waters containing recalcitrant contaminants originating from injection/extrusion and post-washing processes in aluminium and rubber parts production industries.

Activities were organised around four themes in a cross-border context: resource management and livelihood sustainability, environmental and climate change, migration and identity, and the role of small and medium cities.\n\nThe networks focused on issues of development, especially in mountainous and lake land areas. All participating institutions have lengthy experience in research and higher education in the region; they were committed to joining forces to promote research, furthering understanding of the challenges of cohesion and proving the potential positive results through cooperation.\n\nThe Creating project partners offered a new way of considering existing challenges and difficulties, and worked to create, develop and strengthen a social sciences and humanities research network. Activities also served to promote the aims of the Seventh Framework Programme in eastern Africa and helped identify priority areas for subsequent research that will benefit both world regions.", null, "http://www.biea.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2011-07/46004.jpg", "fp7_89502_995999978"], ["4LE", "Redefining the transatlantic relationship and its role in shaping global governance", "Royal Institute of International Affairs", "In an era of global flux, emerging powers and growing interconnectedness, transatlantic relations appear to have lost their bearings. As the international system fragments into different constellations of state and non-state powers across different policy domains, the US and the EU can no longer claim exclusive leadership in global governance. Not only the ability, but also the willingness of the US and the EU to exercise leadership together can no longer be taken for granted. Political, economic, and social elites on both shores of the Atlantic express different views on whether the US and the EU should be bound together, freelance, or seek alternative partnerships in a confusing multipolar world. Traditional paradigms to understand the transatlantic relationship are thus wanting. A new approach is needed to pinpoint the direction transatlantic relations are taking.\nTRANSWORLD provides such an approach. By combining an inter-disciplinary analysis of transatlantic relations, including desk research, in-depth interviews, an elite survey and a sophisticated Delphi exercise to elaborate solid policy proposals, TRANSWORLD would: a) ascertain, differentiating among four policy domains (economic, security, environment, and human rights/democracy), whether transatlantic relations are drifting apart, adapting along an ad hoc cooperation-based pattern, or evolving into a different but resilient special partnership; b) assess the role of a re-defined transatlantic relationship in the global governance architecture; c) provide tested policy recommendations on how the US and the EU could best cooperate to enhance the viability, effectiveness, and accountability of governance structures.

The consortium began by carrying out a study of transatlantic relations across the economic, security, environmental politics, and human rights and democracy policy domains.\n\nProject partners outlined three potential future scenarios for transatlantic relations. The first sees the US and the EU heading towards reciprocal estrangement (structural drift scenario); the second building selective forms of cooperation (functional relationship scenario); the third renewing their longstanding bond (enduring partnership scenario).\n\nTectonic shifts in the world\u2019s economic  map create new governance challenges. In this mutated context, the EU-US economic relationship displays strong elements of a functional relationship, although efforts at negotiating a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership might impart a new direction to the relationship and help the EU and the United States break the stalemate with rising economic powers on how to manage global imbalances.\n\nThe United States and the EU have tried to adjust their policies to the changing international security landscape. However, the EU\u2019s capacity to act as a security provider is constrained by the intergovernmental nature of EU foreign policy as well as its limited hard power assets. Unlike the EU, the United States does not appear to have a lasting commitment to bolstering multilateral institutions, although it remains the ultimate guarantor of the international liberal order. Transatlantic security relations overall still fit an enduring partnership scenario, but they are also more vulnerable to fragmentation than they were in the past.\n\nThe combined action by of the EU and the United States is crucial to global environmental protection. The EU has made a concerted effort in this regard, while the United States has been unable to forge a coherent response involving local, state and federal authorities, which has partially undermined its ability to lead the way in environmental protection and fight against climate change. Transatlantic relations in this field have oscillated between an enduring partnership and a very loose form of functional relationship.\n\nThe EU and the United States have been key actors in the human rights and democracy policy domain as well. Results have been mixed, however, not least because the EU and the United States have had very little coordination in this policy field (which partly explain why they have failed to convince non-Western countries that their intentions are well-meaning and not part of hidden political motives). Their relationship here appears to be an embryonic form functional cooperation at best.\n\nTRANSWORLD continues its work with the view to elaborating policy recommendations on how the  EU and the United States can maximise their cooperation.", "http://www.transworld-fp7.eu/", "http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/149849.jpg", "fp7_101865_998282194"], ["5AG", "Facilitating the Bi-Regional EU-ASEAN Science and Technology Dialog", "The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge", "SEA-EU-NET will increase the quality, quantity, profile and impact of the bi-regional S&amp;T cooperation between SEA countries of ASEAN and MS and AS of EU.

Three years.\r\n\"You know what you learn\" as you see fit immediately everything you learn in the theory to practice.\r\nAs a result, be:\r\n- Labor market opportunities much larger and especially the long-term employability in the labor market\r\n- Personal qualities better developed\r\n- Important languages \u200b\u200b(multi-lingua results: foreign language learning and improving language skills)\r\nWe have created a number of possibilities, in practice, viz .:\r\n-intensive Personal coaching and guidance with room for creativity and autonomy\r\nInternationalisations has become the basis of \r\nTo achieve this we propose to give the following opportunities : Create more international  internship for students;  More mobility \r\n& more small scale and custom-made programmes; More intensive personal coaching and guidance with a view to having more creativity and independence for the participants.\r\nWith this project we want to make the participants aware of personal responsibility and the positive contribution they can make in  today\u2019s  society.\r\nWe believe that citizenship competencies are important in vocational education. Every student is not just an \" catering participant \" but an \"catering participant  and committed citizen in the present and future society\".\r\nTo achieve the objectives , the duration of the mobility is  customized to their personal abilities and the level of study. The deliberate choice of partners will certainly make a positive contribution to the quality of the project.\r\nWe have a large number of partners with whom we work. Depending on the level and abilities of each participant, we find the most appropriate country and type of accredited training company for each. Therefore the number of partners exceeds the number of participants that we send each year .\r\nMoreover, participants can enroll at any time during the year in any training programme at Europrof, therefore, a broad -based partner contact is of great importance.\r\n-The content of the project is aimed basically at 11 students  at the initial vocational training in the context of Hotel and Catering , Hospitality, Pastry and Culinary arts. Participants will do a part of their training program, training internship in a European accredited hosting partner. The intention is that participants go for an internship duration of between  5 and 6 months. They will gain their practical experience in accordance with the practical skills required in these accredited training companies.\r\nTwo applications which will have a big impact:\r\n1 -The fact that Europrof gives participants the opportunity to do an international internship , during their first year of study  , in a   \"real-life \" situation, ensures  the development of their enthusiasm and interest and passion for their future work and employment ( if at 16 or 17 years of age they have this opportunity and experience, one can surmise the tremendous help and encouragement it will mean for them!!)  Our experience is that their passion and enthusiasm increases as if they were already 19 and 20 years of age.!!!.... The future will change for them . Their ambition will grow and their performance will be enhanced. \r\n2 - The fact that we give the students immediately  in first year, the opportunity to follow internships in 4 star* and 5 star * companies. We teach them right from the start to set the bar very high and then ... naturally passion and motivation will grow rapidly! The nice thing is that if they are looking for their  internship of the 2nd year, they are not satisfied with \u201clower\u201d places .... This is the beginning of a passionate future! they learn from the beginning  at the highest level ! This improves entry and employability in the labour market .\r\nInternationalization applied in this way you can presume it represents a real modernization of VET ! !\r\n\r\nSTAFF :\r\nA total of 4 participants (practical trainers , teachers , etc. ) .\r\n- invite someone from an EU country to master / guest lectures as part of the hotel industry sector.\r\n- internships  in approved / accredited training companies in the EU countries .\r\n- in collaboration with a number of Hotel and Catering Companies in the EU countries designing and developing educational modules that will be given in the new Europrof Qualification programme .", "http://www.roccofortehotels.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA116-034978_4"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["5AG", "THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON FOR IMPROVING NATURAL KNOWLEDGE ROYAL CHARTER*", 568.0, "Support expenditure for research and innovation programmes in the 'Direct research' policy area (10.01.05)", "fts_2016_60079", 2016], ["5AG", "THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON FOR IMPROVING NATURAL KNOWLEDGE ROYAL CHARTER*", 316.0, "Support expenditure for research and innovation programmes in the 'Direct research' policy area (10.01.05)", "fts_2016_64335", 2016], ["5AN", "ANGLO AMERICAN PLC", 332116.0, "Appropriations accruing from contributions from (non-European Economic Area) third parties to research and technological development (2014 to 2020) (02.04.50.01)", "fts_2017_4693", 2017], ["5AN", "ANGLO AMERICAN PLC", 60401.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (02.04.03.01)", "fts_2017_21963", 2017], ["5AH", "BRITISH SCHOOL AT ATHENS", 143619.0, "Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie actions \u2014 generating, developing and transferring new skills, knowledge and innovation (15.03.01.01)", "fts_2017_43139", 2017], ["5AG", "THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON FOR IMPROVING NATURAL KNOWLEDGE ROYAL CHARTER*", 240.0, "Support expenditure for research and innovation programmes in the \u2018Direct research\u2019 policy area (10.01.05)", "fts_2017_64192", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "SW1Y"}
