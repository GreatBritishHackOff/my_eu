Although very promising, nanomedicine may add new dimensions to many ethical, social and economic issues. It is of primary importance to understand its possible impacts and provide for stakeholders a well-organised forum. The Round Table will bring together representatives from the nanomedical sciences and technologies involved, industry, patient groups, regulatory bodies, health insurance and policy making, and experts on the ethical, regulatory, social, economic and public engagement and communication and issues. The goal will be to: - collect the most relevant information to be discussed of: - actual achievements and, separately, promises of nanomedical innovation - recommendations issued by the European Commission, Member States and exercises carried out by various national and international bodies - present these in a \u201cuser-friendly\u201d format appropriate for each of the main stakeholder groups with questions to be discussed - carry out a consensual debate concluding with agreed recommendations between various positions The Round Table will have important impacts by: - establishing a clear set of recommendations to support decision making at the European level - identifying priority areas for research and development and for societal actions - significantly enhancing the flow of knowledge reciprocally between each of the key stakeholder groups along the chain from research to patient - helping to reduce fragmentation in nanomedical research across Europe - contributing to mobilising additional public and private investment in nanomedical R&amp;D in Europe - and overall thereby stimulating innovation in nanobiotechnologies for medical use", 31176.0, 699088.0, "NANOMED ROUND TABLE", "Is nano-medicine good for you?", "Dialogue with patients and stakeholders prepares the ground for reliable two-way communication on the benefits and risks of nano-medicine.", "Nano-medicine is a fascinating field that promises medical treatment based on nanotechnology. It involves very tiny particles used in medically-related materials, medications and biosensors, as well as molecular nanotechnology. However, this technology is not without its unknowns and risks. This is why a safe, responsible approach is needed to develop nano-medical research in Europe.\n\nTo address this challenge a project called the Nanomed round table brought together expert stakeholders from across Europe to probe different topics in nano-medicine. The discussions revealed that patients are open to nano-medicine and want to know more about it from reliable sources. The European Commission, national governments, and trade and research associations all have a role to play in ensuring dialogue with patients.\n\nEthical and societal aspects were also discussed at the round table, outlining the need to inform all stakeholders on the philosophical and social aspects of nano-medicine and its purpose. These stakeholders included nano-medical researchers, physicians, patients, and policy-makers.\n\nThe round table identified the need for reliable data to predict the economic impact of nano-medicine on healthcare costs and benefits, as well as on market growth. This enables the European Medicines Agency to take strategic decisions early on. It also allows national governments to manage finances more efficiently.\n\nIn addition, the project concluded that a proactive regulatory system is required for better coordination and harmonisation of regulatory procedures. This would involve dialogue with users and stakeholders at early stages of research and developing, and account for the economic cost implications of regulation. The project has outlined who is best fit to play this role.\n\nLastly, the round table has identified 45 different types of products based on nano-medicine that are already on the market. The policy recommendations emerging from this exercise can serve as a timely and substantial response to the need for genuine engagement and involvement of all the key stakeholders (public and private) in the nano-medical field.\n\nNow that nano-medicine has become a reality, the results of this project will prepare the groundwork for optimised, collective decision making at the European level.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2011-01/46272.jpg", "fp7_88912_998511017"], ["0DZ", "Small Efficient Gas Engine", "Oaktec", "The proposal involves the development of a productionised version of the Pulse-R multigas engine.

The 8 day immersion course in Salignac, near Sarlat-la-Caneda, France with LFEE Europe offers training which would enable us to work more effectively towards our aims for the teaching of French. The course will provide us with materials and ideas suitable for teaching French at primary level and develop expertise in the teaching of this subject. It will enable the course participant to improve competence and performance in French which can then be developed throughout school through training and support; as well as providing ICT resources to use in the classroom and links using the internet. A cross curricular approach is favoured on the course and as well as working towards improving expertise in the teaching of Modern languages to children of Primary School age, the course aims to develop cultural awareness and understanding of contempory France to the participant and then in turn to other school staff and pupils. \r\nThrough this project the school aims to :\r\n-Send one participant on the immersion course in Salignac to develop her spoken language and the teaching of the language, including through cross curricular links as well as in language lessons. \r\n-Use the training from the course and the resources provided to feed into our school action plan for the improvement of Modern language teaching through Key Stage 2.\r\n-Provide training through INSET for all teaching staff  and Teaching Assistants (including at Key Stage 1) in approaches to the dvelopment of the language.\r\n-Develop our own more creative whole school Scheme of Work  for Modern Languages to include immersion weeks and assemblies as well as weekly lessons. \r\n-Develop internet links with other course participants following the course and use this as a platform for mutual support and advice. \r\n-Share knowledge with local schools through our cluster groups and through the 'Aspire' group of schools as one of our targeted open evenings.\r\nWe intend to send one participant who is a Key Stage 2 teacher and our Modern languages subject leader. She is enthusiastic about teaching and learning French and developing the capabilities of other staff in school through INSET and individual support. We would hope that the impact of the course would be that all staff would become more confident in the teaching of French through cross curricular work as well as in designated French lessons on  an 'ad hoc' basis in order to embed French language and culture into our creative curriculum. The impact of the project will be measured against the objectives on our school action plan and this will be monitored by the subject leader, head, management team and governors through discussion, observation and a wide range of evidence. \r\nThe longer term benefits will be that it will be possible to perform staff training 'in house' so that all staff have access to the same training and can share ideas and ask for advice from the subject leader and also through contacts with practitioners in other schools. \r\nAs part of our contributions to local cluster groups and the local 'Aspire' project where schools share expertise and good practice we would look towards sharing some of the ideas we have tried successfully with other teachers in the local area.", null, "Slyne-with-Hest St Luke's CE Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002261_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["0DZ", "OAKTEC*PAUL ANDREWS WILLIAM MEESONANGELA ANDREWS", 43613.0, "Making the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system (08.02.03.03)", "fts_2017_58109", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "LA2"}
