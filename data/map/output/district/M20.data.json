The FP6 Eurocan\\Plus project analysed the barriers underlying the increasing fragmentation of cancer research and stressed the need to improve collaboration between basic/preclinical and comprehensive cancer centres (CCCs), institutions in which care and prevention is integrated with research and education. Furthermore, it proposed the creation of a platform of interlinked cancer centres with shared infrastructures and collaborative projects to facilitate rapid advances in knowledge, and their translation into better cancer care.\n\nIn response to these challenges and in line with the call, EurocanPlatform will work towards the goal of decreasing cancer mortality by dealing with three main areas of strategic research: prevention, early detection and improved treatments. It will build the necessary resources and know-how for the entire research continuum: basic research, early and late translational research, clinical research, epidemiological research, implementation in care and population based outcome research. There will be a strong focus on discovery-driven translational cancer research in five selected tumours: breast, head-neck, lung, malignant melanoma and pancreatic cancer. Joint structures and programmes for early detection will contribute to optimal treatment, and novel prevention research programmes will integrate prevention activities in clinical cancer centres as well as public prevention. Collaborations will also include molecular pathway-driven clinical research supported by joint structures for omics, biobanking and biomarker validation to support clinical trials aimed at enhancing patient benefits by individualised treatments.\n\nEurocanPlatform is unique in its nature and represents a commitment from cancer centres to join forces and resources in order to fight cancer.", 85883.0, 12655504.0, "EUROCANPLATFORM", "Structuring the European translational research in cancer", "Cancer is one of the major health issues affecting our society and its incidence is predicted to increase globally as the population ages.

To make matters worse, the number of patients having cancer will escalate from 28 to 82 million in this period. However, European countries have resources and expertise that can be exploited for improving the translational cancer research.\n\nFunded by the EU, the project 'A European platform for translational cancer research' (http://eurocanplatform.eu/ (EurocanPlatform)) is a unique collaboration between 28 European cancer institutions and organisations. The programme targets the whole cancer research continuum (early and late translational cancer research) in an effort to improve cancer patient outcomes and reduce mortality. To realise project objectives, the platform focuses on three key research areas: prevention, early detection and better treatment.\n\nThe project is working on establishing a robust and sustainable infrastructure for translational cancer research \u2014 i.e. sharing resources, technologies and competences. The project has hosted two workshops on roadblocks and remedies for the use of cancer registries in translational research. The platform created a library of video materials and its education programme discussed methods for sharing educational resources among centres. These actions should ensure that quantity and quality of training is equal for all.\n\nThe consortium runs several projects in breast and lung cancer (LC). Expression data from normal breasts, benign breast lesions, ductal carcinoma in situ and breast cancer have been collected from different partners and analyses is ongoing. The ovarian cancer project completed kinome sequencing of 148 high-grade cancer DNAs and 44 matched normal DNAs. Preclincal researchers used genetics to identify potential targets to treat LC with selective c-Raf inhibitors showing promise against certain LC types with worst prognosis. Progress has been made in the development of a suitable intervention model for small-cell LC. Also, the programme has developed novel computational approaches for detecting and characterising cancer-associated genomic structural rearrangements in DNA and RNA sequencing data.\n\nEurocanPlatform represents a serious effort to strengthen the highly fragmented cancer field and eliminate weak points in translational research and the innovation cycle.", "http://www.eurocanplatform.eu/", "http://www.christie.nhs.uk", "/docs/results/images/2013-02/58647.jpg", "fp7_97701_994296076"], ["4BX", "Advanced Teaching and TRaining for Adoptive Cell Therapy", "The Christie Nhs Foundation Trust", "Considerable resources are devoted to fighting cancer throughout Europe, yet these efforts are not producing the results that health practitioners and citizens might expect. This is partly due to the fragmentation and duplication of research efforts within Member states and the lack of co-ordination at European level. However it can also be attributed to the need to retain and most importantly develop researchers within the EU who have the research skills required to make a real contribution to cancer treatment. The need for quality researchers is particularly acute within the emerging interdisciplinary field of Adoptive Cell Therapy. This promising advance in cancer treatment is based on the exploitation of tumour immunology and genetic technology and built on the specific ideas and techniques originally proposed by the European and Israeli scientists who are members of the ATTRACT network. To facilitate further development within the field of adoptive cell therapy, it is crucial that a co-ordinated and intersectoral approach (combining both the research community and industry) is taken, an approach that broadens the portfolio of skills currently retained within the EU research community. Through the integration Europe\u2019s undisputed leaders in the field of adoptive cell therapy established in the 2005 FP6 ATTACK project, the ATTRACT network aims to foster the development of a pool of ESR\u2019s and ER\u2019s by equipping them with the multidisciplinary and complementary skills needed to not only initiate further advances in the field but to become future leaders within the field of adoptive cell therapy for cancer treatment.

The EU has ~17.8 million people living with a prior diagnosis of cancer of whom ~7 million received radiotherapy. In the long-term, potentially 20% of those suffering with mild to severe side-effects (~1.4 million) might benefit from alleviation of symptoms, with resulting reductions in the cost of care in the EU.\nREQUITE aims to develop validated clinical models and incorporate biomarkers to identify before treatment cancer patients at risk of side-effects and use the models to design interventional trials aimed at reducing side-effects and improving QoL in cancer survivors who underwent radiotherapy.\nREQUITE will:\n1. carry out a multi-centre, longitudinal, observational study to collect standardised data and samples in breast, prostate and lung cancer patients;\n2. validate biomarkers with published evidence of predictive value;\n3. replicate published clinical models and incorporate replicated biomarkers to create validated predictive algorithms;\n4. use the prospectively validated models and biomarkers to design interventional trial protocols aiming to reduce side-effects and improve QoL in high-risk patients.\nREQUITE builds on collaborations with a proven history of data sharing, enlarged to a consortium with expertise in patient recruitment, knowledge management, biomarker testing and predictive model development.

However, the use of engineered T cells is a challenging and complex field with further development and more proof-of-principle trials needed. This proposal builds upon previous EU funded pre-clinical projects and comprises a multidisciplinary and translational research group with wide-ranging relevant expertise. Building on encouraging clinical results targeting NY-ESO-1 in melanoma and the availability of clinical grade vector, the consortium proposes to rapidly initiate two landmark studies in this field: the first to examine the activity of engineered T cells in oesophago-gastric cancer as an example of a hard to treat common epithelial cancer;  the second to undertake a randomised phase II study to determine whether an optimised cell production system developed by the partners improves the current clinical response rates in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with NY-ESO-1 targeted T-cells. Success in these trials will enable the consortia and others to carryout larger trials and potentially approval of this type of therapy as a treatment for multiple cancer types. The inclusion of a major industrial partner focused on cell therapy technology and two SMEs focus on the delivery of cell therapy will facilitate future development of this area following these trials; indeed the project also includes plans to further automate and streamline cell processing to facilitate this development.

Optimizing local control by introducing novel radiation techniques resulting in redistribution of the radiation dose, creating inhomogeneous dose distribution towards the most active part of the tumour instead of conventional homogenous doses. This redistribution can be performed without increase of toxicity. As recently reported radiation accidents in the US demonstrate, QA is of outmost importance for safe radiation delivery in complex treatments. To assure accurate delivery over time, we will monitor both the patient\u2019s geometry as well as the delivered dose using image guided adaptive plan modifications and 3D in-vivo dosimetric verification.\n2. Maximizing the benefit of combined modality treatment\nBoth cisplatin and Cetuximab in combination with radiotherapy have shown to improve local control and survival but both drugs have severe side effects. As these drugs are not active in all patients, there is a large need to select patients which are sensitive to either drug.

It is using image-guided and three-dimensional (3D) technology to distribute precise doses and ensure safe radiation delivery. Another major project objective is to re-evaluate the use of toxic medicines that are given in conjunction with radiation therapy, identifying at an early stage those patients who respond well to specific pharmaceutical interventions and those that do not.\n\nTo achieve its aims ARTFORCE has brought together a powerful team of radiation oncologists, dosimetrists, radiographers, physicists and nuclear medicine specialists. It is now conducting clinical trials and selecting ideal patients, i.e. those who are sensitive to standard drug treatments given in combination with radiotherapy. In this context, the project has begun conducting two separate tests, a lung trial and a head and neck trial, with early results looking very promising indeed.\n\nFurthermore, these clinical trials are supported by fundamental research in molecular biology and radiation physics. To illustrate these two fields, changes in genes and proteins predicting treatment outcome in individual patients will be investigated; while in the radiation physics area, modern imaging techniques are explored to identify the precise tumour extension and its characteristics.\n\nBased on the concept of higher yet more targeted radiation doses, the expected results are nothing short of significantly better survival rates and fewer side effects.\n\nLastly, the project has articulated more rigorous quality assurance procedures and methods to prevent radiation therapy accidents and enhance the treatment's accuracy.
