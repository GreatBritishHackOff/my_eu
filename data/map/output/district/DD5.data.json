The earlier the ability to be mobile is developed by a student, the more fruitful it will be. Thus the policy of our institution is crucial in providing that taste for mobility. In order to offer them a springboard for their professional integration we must give them, right from high school,  a European scope and provide them with additional assets thanks to these placements abroad. \r\n\r\nThere are 18 participants committed to this project and are all engaged into a professional career. From BTEC National courses, sales, commerce and fashion, they will be soon part of the workforce, both in France and in Europe.\r\n\r\nTo set up this project, we would work as a team throughout the school year. Moreover, this year the Erasmus staff mobility for training of 3 teachers makes it possible to better take into account the needs linked to this mobility. The different steps to complete the project are scheduled from September to June.\r\n- Meeting of the teaching and management staff in order to ratify the selection criteria of the project. \r\n- Meeting with the different players (parents, students, teaching and management teams) to present the terms of the stay. \r\n- Preparatory work of students under the supervision of the teachers.\r\n- First contacts with our partners in order to define placements in accordance with the training goals of the participants. \r\n- Logistics are then provided to offer a stay in the best conditions ever.\r\n- The fact that the teachers are staying with the students for a while as well as the bonds that unite both parts take part in dealing with the participants \u2018needsas close as possible.\r\n\r\nTo meet the aims of the specific training in vocational courses, we need to focus on several lines\r\n- Educationalline:this training period in a company from one country of the European Union will allow them to get a \"European section\" distinction in conformity with the objectives of the diploma.\r\n- Professionalline:this European distinction will help our students for an easier integration into the labour market. Indeed, companies are increasingly looking for employees benefiting an experience abroad and able to respond to professional mobility. \r\n- Cultural and human line: the mere fact of accepting to leave, to integrate both on professional and relational levels, is the evidence of an open mind and open spirit. This is essential for young people aimed at living and working in Europe. The immersion in a foreign and different country together with sharing activities and exchanges in their daily lives will provide them with personalenrichment and awareness of their European citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe training mobility is one of the essential means for young people to develop their knowledge and professional, linguistic, cultural skills. It also develops a sense of European identity and, besides, increases their professional adaptability to the current economic world.", "http://campbell.hendry@tesco.net", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036967_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DD5"}
