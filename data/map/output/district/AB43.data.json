The European SMEs in this sector are under increased pressure to increase efficiency due to rising crude oil prices. In addition, there is the EU legislation on Total Allowable Catch or minimum landing sizes and the threat to close areas to fishing and aquaculture  in order to recover stock, due to environmental effects of inefficient fishing which could have socio-economic effects on our community. Our need as representatives of the SME industry is to increase efficiency and safety in fishing and aquaculture as well as reduce the environmental effects. We recognise the need for a technology that will enable fishers to preserve the quality and freshness of fish, reduce trawling times and avoid problems caused by overfull trawls. Trawls are the most commercially used fishing method. It is very large and expensive with typical cost up to \u20ac135,000. A fishing vessel dragging the conical shaped net through water consumes a large amount of energy and with fuel being the most expensive expenditure, fisheries are fast becoming unprofitable.   The proposed project will develop a stress monitoring system that will increase: efficiency in fishing, safety and life of fishing gear and mooring ropes.", 461389.0, 2239169.0, "SMARTCATCH", "Tech innovation in the fishing industry", "The EU is catching up with a newly designed system of nets with sensors designed to notify of their overloading or damage. If there is a break in the net, the operator will be notified immediately, preventing loss and damage.", "The EU is the second largest importer of fish in the world. Plagued by increased costs, inefficiencies in stock management, overfishing, lack of innovation and increased competition, the Europe lingers in the background of this business sector. \n\nAn exciting innovation, the http://smartcatch.pera.com (SMARTCATCH) project,  funded by the EU has revolutionised fishing gear for trawl nets. A non-contact stress sensing system for mooring rope applications and potentially fishing is good news in storms and dangerous currents. \n\nPrevention of loss or damage to farmed fish stocks has economic implications. The fewer fish to sell equals lost revenue to the fish farmer and more imported fish. This new system will reduce the loss of escapees and minimise the negative environmental impact on the genetic diversity and local marine environment.\n\n\nThe researchers used techniques to join the Nitinol wire to form a continuous loop. They also used other methods, the most common being various welding techniques, soldering, mechanical connections and adhesives. For a marine envrironment signal detector, SMARTCATCH identified electromagnetic induction technology design parameters.\n\nThis new technology will also enable fish farmers to preserve the active fishing gear on boats. Trawling is the most commercially used fishing method. These large and expensive nets range from \u20ac1 350 to \u20ac40 000 per net for a boat up to 20m. The Smartcatch system could potentially increase the efficiency of fishing fleets with the developed alternative techniques for integration of the Nitinol wire into rope systems. Extensive research was done to test corrosion, jointing techniques and electrical performance. \n\nThe initial focus solved problems with the more manageable smaller ropes of aquaculture installations and mooring rope applications.  Solutions here can be scaled up to the trawler net ropes and other applications.\n\nSMARTCATCH technology promises to upgrade quality and freshness of the catch and reduce trawling times. Reducing stress and load on fishing gear will cut costs of fuel and increase the lifetime of fishing equipment. The safety record in the industry also stands to improve as a result.", "http://smartcatch.pera.com/", "http://www.swfpa.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/146637.jpg", "fp7_107622_998573388"], ["9BP", "Paradigm for Novel Dynamic Oceanic Resource Assessments", "Scottish Pelagic Fishermen's Association Limited", "The Blue Growth of European fisheries is at risk due to over-exploitation, unforeseen changes in stock productivity, loss of markets for capture fisheries due to aquaculture, future trade agreements opening European markets to external fleets, and fluctuations in the price of oil and other business costs. All of these risks need to be considered when providing advice needed to sustainably maximize profits for the diverse array of fisheries operating in European waters and to help safeguard the benefits this sector provides to the social coherence of local, coastal communities.\nPANDORA aims to:\n1. Create more realistic assessments and projections of changes in fisheries resources (30 stocks) by utilizing new biological knowledge (spatial patterns, environmental drivers, food-web interactions and density-dependence) including, for the first time, proprietary data sampled by pelagic fishers. \n2. Advice on how to secure long-term sustainability of EU fish stocks (maximum sustainable/\u201dpretty good\u201d and economic yields) and elucidate tradeoffs between profitability and number of jobs in their (mixed demersal, mixed pelagic and single species) fisheries fleets. Provide recommendations on how to stabilize the long-term profitability of European fisheries.\n3. Develop a public, internet-based resource tool box (PANDORAs Box of Tools), including assessment modelling and stock projections code, economic models, and region- and species-specific decision support tools; increase ownership and contribution opportunities of the industry to the fish stock assessment process through involvement in data sampling and training in data collection, processing and ecosystem-based fisheries management.\nThe project will create new knowledge (via industry-led collection, laboratory and field work, and theoretical simulations), new collaborative networks (industry, scientists and advisory bodies) and new mechanisms (training courses and management tools) to ensure relevance, utility and impact.", 73073.0, 4875577.0, "PANDORA", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_214744_950989941"]]}}, "outwardCode": "AB43"}
