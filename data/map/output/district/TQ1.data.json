So I'm going to carry out the project with lower and upper formers in the English and Italian lessons and the students (only upper formers) in my English and Italian moduls. ( as mentioned before we have the Modulare Oberstufe (a modul system) at our school). \r\n\r\nI really hope that I will get the chance to attend those two language courses in Torquay and Taormina in the summer 2017. It would be  perfect timing, because next school year I'm also going to teach three English \"speaking moduls\" and one Italian \"speaking modul\" (one is named \"speaking is fun\") and for those moduls the experience I would get from those courses in Torquay and Taormina would be awesome as the main focus of the moduls is actually on speaking and that in a fun way. \r\n\r\nWhat I would also like to do in my project is teach English using the teaching methods acquired in England and teach Italian using the methods acquired in Italy and compare the results of the teaching methods. Which teaching method is better? Are the methods acquired in Italy better for teaching Italian? Are the ones acquired in England adequate for teaching English in Austria? Is a combination of them , using the best aspects of each teaching method the best choice/solution ? Is there anything that needs to be/could be improved ? Those are the questions I'm going to ask myself and I will try to answer them as precisely as possible throughout my project.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, attending those two language courses will also help me personally  as a teacher, because I would like to improve my language skills in both foreign languages and my own teaching style and methods, including the best aspects of the teaching methods and styles of both countries. This, as a result, will be advantageous ,especially for the students, because what they get is better, more motivating teaching and fun lessons, but they will  also learn a lot at the same time ( but the fun way ) .\r\n\r\nMoreover, I would also like to include circle models in my teaching, i.e.  students get a worksheet including many different activities and so every learner type can try out new activities. In addition, working together with different partners can also increase the pupils\u2019 own learning process.Pupils have to be creative and do different types of activities and games alone, in pairs or even together in  small groups. Therefore,  we are not talking about normal and boring lessons, but about creative and very motivating lessons, because they are fun and pupils enjoy them, but also learn a lot. In my opinion, they even learn more that way.  Last but not least, it can also have a lot of benefits for a future job, because it helps  develop and increase skills, such as creativity, problem solving and team work. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I would also like to find a school class in England that would be willing to write emails with my class. This way my students could practise their English in a fun way and learn a lot at the same time. Writing to people their age is much more interesting and fun and, therefore, further motivates them to continue studying. If possible it would be great to include an exchange (one week or ten days) so that we could also meet and visit the English students and their country. This way the students could perfect their English skills and learn more about the country, the people and their customs and traditions. Personally, I think that the students will be really motivated, interested and enthusiastic about studying English. Teaching and learning the fun and creative way is the most important teaching method, because it is the only thing that really motivates students and turns the subject English into a passion ! I've already done that with one of my Italian classes and an Italian partner school and they enjoyed it a lot and benefited a lot from it. It would be amazing, though, to find a partner school in Sicily for my students and one in Torquay. \r\n\r\nActivities and methods: individual work, pair work, group work, vocabulary and grammar games (memory, duo, puzzles, board games,\u2026) , songs, role plays, acting out dialogues, reading, listening, speaking tasks, writing tasks,\u2026", "http://www.tisenglish.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA101-034703_2"], ["4BD", "Fr\u00fchkindliche Bildung in Europa", "The Training Partnership Ltd", 72464.0, "The project \u201eEarly childhood education in Europe\u201c is a joint application of 16 kindergartens from Leipzig.

Its objectives are fixed against the background of a previously relatively low mobility of young people in the dual training system which currently stands at about 4 percent. Additionally, conventional measures of mobility for apprentices are usually carried out in groups and are too inflexible for interested individuals or do not match due to their technical, spatial or temporal orientation. However, this project provides promotion of individual practical trainings abroad, irrespective of time, country of destination and the occupation requiring formal training. But the project determines clearly the funding period which in each case is scheduled to last three weeks. This schedule is based on the experience that this period usually already allows young people to a positive experience mobility with sustainable effect and that on the other hand longer periods of absence of the apprentices is in most cases hardly accepted among their training companies. Moreover, the realisation of practical trainings abroad shall now also be possible for those youngster, who just finished their apprenticeship.

professional courses that will conduct integrated internships, lasting for three months, divided into two academic years (17/18 e 18/19);\r\n2) 20 newly graduated students of the school years 16/17 and 17/18 will take on internships lasting for 6 months;\r\n3) 10 staff elements (teachers of technical areas, pedagogical coordinators, SOEP coordinators) that will perform \"job shadowing\" and technical visits to education and vocational training centers, with the duration of one week. \r\nThe proposed mobility have the following objectives:\r\na) Implementing school links with companies in countries of the EU in a technologically more advanced context;\r\nb) Give students and recent graduates the opportunity to work abroad, being this one of the reasons for the demand of the school;\r\nc) Increase cooperation between companies / institutions, social partners and other entities that provide learning processes across Europe;\r\nd) Facilitate and promote the flow of innovative practices in the fields of vocational education and training between the participant / beneficiary countries;\r\ne) Promote transparency and recognition of qualifications and competences in order to approximate the potential of qualifications between European countries in terms of standardization;\r\nf) Encourage the culture of learning foreign languages, for the need of communicating in formal and informal contexts;\r\ng) Maximize integration opportunities in the European labor market of young people in early career;\r\nh) Provide school HR their inclusion in educational and vocational training institutions where they can observe best practices, exchange experiences with other professionals from European countries debating issues related to the use of technological resources, enhancing strategies and motivation of students and the fight to absenteeism and dropout;\r\ni) Improve given practical training and increase the quality of vocational education, through contact with other practices and teaching methodologies and meeting other education and European vocational training systems;\r\nj) Enhance the European dimension of vocational education and strengthen competitiveness in the European labor market.\r\nIn the scope of these mobility actions, participants will be placed, monitored and supervised by the partners in the training areas involved according to their area of studies.\r\n The training contents are defined, planned and scheduled by the director of the vocational course the participant attends, in the case of students and recent graduates, and the CEPT in the case of staff.\r\nThe planning of the development of the participant's activities, supervised by the tutor and accompanied by the partner, aims to serve as a guide, since it lists the technical learning that the participant received during training in school and that is capable of developing, or will easily adapt to.\r\nFollowing these guidelines, this project includes the preparation and support activities to the implementation of mobility, as well as monitoring and evaluation activities, monitoring and dissemination of results.\r\nAs for the expected impact, these experiences developed in other EU countries, preferably provided with greater innovative capacity and know-how, compared to the ones they have access to in our country, have the advantage of preparing the young Portuguese for bolder professional challenges.\r\nTechnical quality and high productivity require effectiveness, which is fruit of discipline, punctuality, attendance, good human relationship and understanding, leading to good professional performance which can ensure a promising future career.\r\nImpacts in the long-term in the educational community, resulting from dissemination of the project, and in economic operators in the region coming from the professional experience gained abroad are expected.", "http://www.ttpl-uk.com", null,
