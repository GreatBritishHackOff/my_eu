The main strategic objective of EU-CIRCLE is to move towards infrastructure network(s) that is resilient to today\u2019s natural hazards and prepared for the future changing climate. Furthermore, modern infrastructures are inherently interconnected and interdependent systems ; thus extreme events are liable to lead to \u2018cascade failures\u2019. \n\n\nEU-CIRCLE\u2019s scope is to derive an innovative framework for supporting the interconnected European Infrastructure\u2019s resilience to climate pressures, supported by an end-to-end modelling environment where new analyses can be added anywhere along the analysis workflow and multiple scientific disciplines can work together to understand interdependencies, validate results, and present findings in a unified manner providing an efficient \u201cBest of Breeds\u201d solution of integrating into a holistic resilience model existing modelling tools and data in a standardised fashion. \n\nIt, will be open & accessible to all interested parties in the infrastructure resilience business and having a confirmed interest in creating customized and innovative solutions. It will be complemented with a webbased  portal.The design principles, offering transparency and greater flexibility, will allow potential users to introduce fully tailored solutions and infrastructure data, by defining and implementing customised impact assessment models, and use climate / weather data on demand.", 71269.0, 5992388.0, "EU-CIRCLE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_196896_937252025"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TQ1"}
