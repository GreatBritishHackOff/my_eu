Created in 2006, and delivered in partnership with Watford Football Club, the NHC Sports Academy provides the opportunity for talented athletes to develop their skills in a professional football environment whilst also achieving vocational qualifications. Previous students have progressed to pursue roles in coaching, teaching, sports development and even as professional athletes.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this project is to further enhance and improve the vocational training and development of students at the NHC Sports Academy. By maintaining and strengthening the existing partnership links with Sportilia in Italy, the project will also aim to provide greater exit and progression opportunities for students upon completion of the Academy programme. The project will have 3 overarching strategic objectives: \r\n\r\n1) Facilitating the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into both the NHC Sports Academy programme and students.\r\n\r\n2) Exposing the students to the European opportunities in both sport and other careers so these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.\r\n\r\n3) Embedding Lifelong Learning Principles into the training and development programme and working cultures in order to equip students with the aptitude and skills to pursue employment, either within sport or outside of it, throughout their career.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nThere are currently 956 Sports Academy students at the college across 7 main sports (men\u2019s football, women\u2019s football, men\u2019s rugby, netball, tennis, basketball and athletics). Approximately 75% are male, 25% are female and 15% are from Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) groups.
