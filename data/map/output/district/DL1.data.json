There are over 600,000 refrigerated vehicles and containers in Europe and each one wastes thousands of Euros of energy each year due to poor insulation. Likewise, payback on renewable energy systems is compromised by poor thermal storage, reducing their popularity. In short, our members are wasting energy and hence losing money through a lack of optimal insulation. Currently, our options are limited to expensive, high performance materials such as aerogels and vacuum insulation panels, or low-cost but poorly-performing foams. We need a new insulation material that can fill this performance gap, offering high thermal resistance but at a cost close to insulating foams. The HIP project will develop an innovative new class of polymer insulation materials based on high internal phase emulsion templating (HIPE). HIPE materials have been used in other applications but never before for high-performance insulation. HIPE materials allow close control over porosity, pore size distribution and mechanical properties. Because of this, we can precisely engineer the thermal properties of the material within a low-cost manufacturing process. Our objective is to achieve a thermal conductivity of \u22640.015W/m.K at a cost of less than \u20ac500 per cubic metre. Compared to conventional PU foam insulation, the savings will be considerable: Based on our predicted uptake in the refrigerated transport and solar thermal markets alone, the reduced CO2 emission will be over 200,000 tonnes by 2020 and our members will save in excess of \u20ac50 million in energy costs.", 695154.0, 2183624.0, "HIP", "Keeping cool on the cheap", "A brand new class of polymer insulation material called HIP offers high thermal resistance useful for refrigerated transport, heating and cooling installations. Combined with low production costs, this new material improves efficiency of products, installations and processes.", "Over 40\u00a0% of the EU's energy consumption is used for heating/cooling in buildings, hot water, for industrial process heat and heat in the service sector. In Europe, 12\u00a0% of vehicles used to transport goods (e.g. ice cream) are insulated. \n\nThis EU-funded project, http://www.fp7-hip.eu (HIP) , produced a  new class of polymer insulating materialmaterial. The low-cost, highly insulating polymer material is based on high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) templating. \n\nFollowing a review of techniques and formulations of polyHIPEsone formula produced the perfect material for maximum cost savings. The HIP material will last 25 years, has a thermal conductivity of 0.015\u00a0W/mK and costs less than EUR\u00a0500 per cubic metre.\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises benefit from using refrigerated vehicles by reducing fuel consumption without sacrificing payload. The fuel cost savings are typically EUR\u00a04\u00a0000 per vehicle. Because of this new highly insulating polymer material the cost savings are enormous on the 37000 refrigerated containers in the EU.\n\nThe material, complies with the EU Parliament Directive of 2013. Examples of compliance include: using minimal materials, efficiencies created in pumps and solar thermal systems, and reduced emissions thanks to the HIP material's design. \n\nThis product has potential for worldwide use as an effective insulation solution with expected savings of over EUR 50 million just in the EU.", null, "http://www.tica-acad.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/145859.jpg", "fp7_96236_991763600"], ["4QB", "Portable Real Time Detection of Airborne Asbestos Fibres for Tradespersons", "Thermal Insulation Contractors Association", "Asbestos-related diseases are the leading cause of occupational death in Europe. 500,000 European workers, mostly within the construction, demolition and remediation industries, are expected to die by 2030. Despite a ban on asbestos use, our members\u2019 workers are continually exposed to this potent, invisible carcinogen from legacy products such as insulation, water tanks, ceiling panels, floor tiles and textured wall coverings. We feel that this level of risk is completely unacceptable for our members and must be addressed. Currently, asbestos is detected by a slow process of air sampling, with samples sent off to a lab and results being returned days later. Not only is this too late to take action, but tests are only performed if asbestos is suspected to be present. There is currently no way to detect asbestos in real-time. The ALERT project will change this. A decade ago, researchers discovered a way to detect asbestos fibres through a light-scattering technique. This work stalled due to technical and cost barriers; barriers we now believe we can overcome. We have assembled a world-leading consortium to extend this early research and develop a low-cost portable detector that can be worn by the worker to continuously monitor their work environment. By developing the ALERT system, we will provide 30 million European workers with a means of detecting asbestos the moment it is disturbed, allowing them to protect themselves and avoid becoming one of the 100,000 people worldwide killed each year by exposure to asbestos.", 270756.0, 1891061.0, "ALERT", "New asbestos sensor could save lives", "A group of EU companies and research institutions have built a wearable asbestos sensor for plumbers, builders and technicians exposed to this dangerous chemical.", "Asbestos-related diseases are responsible for an estimated 100\u00a0000 deaths per year in Europe alone.

The sensor is based on a decade-old method of detecting asbestos fibres by how they scatter light.\n\nResearchers built and tested a prototype detector that can easily be worn by workers. End-user testing provided feedback on ergonomics and ease-of-use.\n\nThe prototype was tested successfully in industrial, commercial, retail and domestic environments. ALERT reported a success rate of 99\u00a0% in identifying airborne asbestos fibres.\n\nThe ALERT\u00ae sensor will now be developed into a commercially available device.
