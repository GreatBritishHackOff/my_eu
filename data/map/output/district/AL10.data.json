Consequently, there is an urgent need to find ways to help the growing population of older people to live independent lives and preserve well being into old age. To address this pressing issue, PMinMCI will conduct the first systematic and innovative investigation of prospective memory in older adults at risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Prospective memory refers to remembering to do things in future (e.g., remembering to take medication or pay bills on time). Although it is a vitally important skill for one to function independently in everyday life, it has received so far little attention. The project will focus on: 1) identifying the prospective memory deficits that could serve as an early marker of cognitive decline and a predictor of dementia, 2) recognizing everyday memory problems of individuals in the transitional state between normal ageing and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and 3) proposing early psychological intervention aimed at reducing their anxiety and worry about memory. The expected results will allow practitioners to recognize opportunities for early intervention and help older adults in at-risk population maintain well being and independence in their everyday life as long as possible. The aims and expected outcomes of PMinMC perfectly fit the current and forthcoming research and innovation policy of the European Union.

The benefits are large, however, as compilers need only capture concurrency in a virtual way rather than capturing, mapping and scheduling it. This separates the concerns of programming and concurrency engineering and opens the door for successful parallelising compilers. Mapping and scheduling is performed dynamically by implementations of the concurrency control instructions in the processors ISA. Another advantage of this approach is its binary compatibility. This means backward compatibility over a base ISA and forward compatibility as compiled code is executable on an arbitrary numbers of processors. Ths compatibility also enables dynamic resource mapping to binary programs from a pool of processors. Particular benefits can be expected for data-parallel and functional programming languages as they expose concurrency in a way that can easily be captured by a compiler.

Such an understanding can provide profound insights into our humanity, leading to fundamentally new computing technologies, and transforming the diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders. Modern ICT brings this prospect within reach. The HBP Flagship Initiative (HBP) thus proposes a unique strategy that uses ICT to integrate neuroscience data from around the world, to develop a unified multi-level understanding of the brain and diseases, and ultimately to emulate its computational capabilities. The goal is to catalyze a global collaborative effort. During the HBP\u2019s first Specific Grant Agreement (SGA1), the HBP Core Project will outline the basis for building and operating a tightly integrated Research Infrastructure, providing HBP researchers and the scientific Community with unique resources and capabilities. Partnering Projects will enable independent research groups to expand the capabilities of the HBP Platforms, in order to use them to address otherwise intractable problems in neuroscience, computing and medicine in the future. In addition, collaborations with other national, European and international initiatives will create synergies, maximizing returns on research investment.

The proposed research will identify the fundamental components of rituals worldwide and chart their effects on patterns of group alignment and action. Doing so will have a lasting impact on basic understandings of the nature, causes, and consequences of ritual dynamics as well as open up exciting new avenues of inquiry that bridge the humanities and social sciences. \n\nIt is proposed that within numerous cultures and group types, collective rituals come in two main forms with distinct consequences: 1) affectively-intense, rarely-enacted rituals bond group members tightly and motivate extreme self-sacrifice; 2) frequently repeated rituals create allegiance to broad collectives and motivate ingroup bias. Using this model as a starting point, the proposed research programme will seek to achieve three tightly linked objectives. Objective 1 will examine psychological mechanisms underlying rituals\u2019 effects on group cohesion and behaviour in ten nations. Objective 2 will focus on the ritual dynamics of special populations exposed to group-related violence (e.g., war veterans, ex-convicts, war-torn communities). Objective 3 will examine the functions of ritual and cohesion in cultural group selection. Using new techniques, we will quantitatively code and analyse qualitative data on ritual and cohesion in large historical databases from hundreds of groups over the past 12,000 years.

Core fragmentation, pressure from the expanding ionised gas, magnetic fields and mass loss through stellar winds, all work against the effects of gravity, thereby restricting the final stellar mass. Advances in theoretical models, aided by numerical simulations (e.g. adaptive mesh refinement), have proposed elegant solutions; for example, the interaction between radiation and the dense circumstellar gas is subject to radiation-Rayleigh-Taylor instability, creating low opacity chimneys to vent out the radiation pressure. Likewise, heated cores and disks are stable against Jeans fragmentation. The exact manifestation of these issues and their solutions vary significantly between theories, and the physical structures found around embedded, still accreting massive stars provides a strong discriminator between models. Therefore, this research project aims to better understand the physical conditions of the gas and dust structures within the 500-5000 AU regions of infant high-mass stars by using adaptive-optics-assisted polarimetric observations in the infrared (essential to probe through the high extinction of high-mass cores).

In our approach, the physical constraints imposed by objects in the environment and the manipulandum itself are not regarded as obstacles, but rather as opportunities to guide functional hand pre-shaping, adaptive grasping, and affordance-guided manipulation of objects. The exploitation of these opportunities, which we refer to as environmental constraints (EC), enables robust grasping and manipulation in dynamic, open, and highly variable environments.\n\nThe key ingredient for the exploitation of EC is softness of hands, i.e. their embodied ability to comply and adapt to features of the environment. The traditional paradigm for robotic manipulation is in complete disarray in front of this shift of focus: state-of-the-art grasp planners are targeted towards rigid hands and objects, and attempt to find algorithmic solutions to inherently complex, often ill-posed problems.

However, in order to safely and meaningfully cooperate with humans, robots must be able to interact in ways that humans find intuitive and understandable. Addressing this challenge, we propose a novel approach for understanding and modelling social behaviour and implementing social coupling in robots. Our approach presents a radical departure from the classical view of social cognition as mind-reading, mentalising or maintaining internal rep-resentations of other agents. This project is based on the view that even complex modes of social interaction are grounded in basic sensorimotor interaction patterns.
