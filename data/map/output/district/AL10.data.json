To address this pressing issue, PMinMCI will conduct the first systematic and innovative investigation of prospective memory in older adults at risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Prospective memory refers to remembering to do things in future (e.g., remembering to take medication or pay bills on time). Although it is a vitally important skill for one to function independently in everyday life, it has received so far little attention. The project will focus on: 1) identifying the prospective memory deficits that could serve as an early marker of cognitive decline and a predictor of dementia, 2) recognizing everyday memory problems of individuals in the transitional state between normal ageing and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and 3) proposing early psychological intervention aimed at reducing their anxiety and worry about memory. The expected results will allow practitioners to recognize opportunities for early intervention and help older adults in at-risk population maintain well being and independence in their everyday life as long as possible.

The benefits are large, however, as compilers need only capture concurrency in a virtual way rather than capturing, mapping and scheduling it. This separates the concerns of programming and concurrency engineering and opens the door for successful parallelising compilers. Mapping and scheduling is performed dynamically by implementations of the concurrency control instructions in the processors ISA. Another advantage of this approach is its binary compatibility. This means backward compatibility over a base ISA and forward compatibility as compiled code is executable on an arbitrary numbers of processors.

The goal is to catalyze a global collaborative effort. During the HBP\u2019s first Specific Grant Agreement (SGA1), the HBP Core Project will outline the basis for building and operating a tightly integrated Research Infrastructure, providing HBP researchers and the scientific Community with unique resources and capabilities. Partnering Projects will enable independent research groups to expand the capabilities of the HBP Platforms, in order to use them to address otherwise intractable problems in neuroscience, computing and medicine in the future.

Core fragmentation, pressure from the expanding ionised gas, magnetic fields and mass loss through stellar winds, all work against the effects of gravity, thereby restricting the final stellar mass. Advances in theoretical models, aided by numerical simulations (e.g. adaptive mesh refinement), have proposed elegant solutions; for example, the interaction between radiation and the dense circumstellar gas is subject to radiation-Rayleigh-Taylor instability, creating low opacity chimneys to vent out the radiation pressure. Likewise, heated cores and disks are stable against Jeans fragmentation. The exact manifestation of these issues and their solutions vary significantly between theories, and the physical structures found around embedded, still accreting massive stars provides a strong discriminator between models. Therefore, this research project aims to better understand the physical conditions of the gas and dust structures within the 500-5000 AU regions of infant high-mass stars by using adaptive-optics-assisted polarimetric observations in the infrared (essential to probe through the high extinction of high-mass cores).

Add to this the phenomenon of widespread Italic \"genericism\" that, pushing students towards a choice of extensive and generic studies, is actually the main reason of demotivation towards studies and school drop-out.\r\n\r\nThese elements move in contrast with the needs of the labor market for technical-professional and in particular in tourism and hotel sector.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the demand for labor, in conjunction with the technological development and competitiveness of the market, requires increasingly specific skills and the same employers recognize that the preparation of the staff coming out of the training course is not always adequate.\r\n\r\nTo complete the picture, it is estimated that in the near future, at the conclusion of the current economic crisis, the demand for labor will greatly increase, with particular reference to its technical and professional fields\r\n\r\nIn this context the institutes IFOM, Varalli, Bertarelli and Besta have found the common need to compensate the mismatch between training offer and the needs of enterprises, reducing the mismatch between demand and supply of labor, reduce early school leaving and improving integration between schools and business.\r\n \r\nThe realization of this general objective goes through the achievement of the following specific objectives:\r\n\r\n- For students, to strengthen their professional skills, transversal and personal, enhancing their career prospects and their motivation, creating a sense of entrepreneurship, emancipation, European and intercultural awareness;\r\n\r\n- For the staff involved, to improve their professional and linguistic skills, to understand the practices related to the world of education and its links with the world of work, to understand the social, linguistic and cultural differences, to increase the ability to address the needs of the most disadvantaged and to strengthen the capacity to sustain their motivation to work;\r\n\r\n- For the organizations involved, to learn to operate internationally, to understand how to provide the most stimulating educational activities, to create a modern and dynamic working environment, to develop activities good for the whole civil society.\r\n \r\nFor this reason, the project \"Learning in hospitality Europe by undergoing a traineeship VET\" promotes the development of internships abroad for students of the consortium schools.\r\n\r\n The project includes two activities:\r\n1) Mobility of 92 students and 16 escorts for an internship abroad lasting one month;\r\n2) Mobility of 20 neo-graduates for an internship abroad lasting 10 weeks\r\nThe activities will take place from 01.06.2017 until 31.01.2019 and includes the selection and preparation of students, the organization of the mobilities, activities abroad, evaluations, dissemination and follow-up activities.\r\nThe consortium plans to include in mobility 8 students with special needs, in detail students with DSA or

market;\r\n- Improving their social skills;\r\n- The acquisition of transversal skills (self-esteem, responsibility, ability to take tasks, ...) will also bring benefits to emancipation and

greater efficiency in learning of the students;\r\n- Sharing a common experience with the students will produce a greater understanding of their difficulties and more effective communication between teachers and students;\r\n- A better understanding of the labor market in Europe will offer more precise knowledge in supporting the education of students.\r\n\r\nSchools:\r\n- Increased ability to

A profound theoretical and practical education and training in the field of tourismas well as a  competent language skills in English and Italian forms a comprehensive educational framework for this goal. \r\n\r\nPart of this work-oriented education are obligatory practical trainings of 12 weeks.  \r\nIn the past two years the interest of the students and graduates of the HLW Lienz in doing a practical training abroad has risen enormously. In order to facilitate all the work regarding practical trainings abroad for all people involved (students, parents, teachers, partner enterprises) two teachers got in charge of co-ordinating the entire Erasmus+ programme for the school and founded the  Verein der HLW / HF Lienz zur F\u00f6rderung von Auslandspraktika in the school year of 2015/16.\r\nWith this additional offer of training places abroad as well as the entire co-ordination of the Erasmus+ programme organised at the school, the internationalisation and the quality management of the two schools could be intensified and the positive reputation of the schools as a contact point for international work experience was established.  Due to the positive  feedback regarding the Erasmus+ programme by students and their parents as well as teachers of secondary schools we can also assume that the option of doing a practical training abroad has already become one of the main reasons why these students choose our schools their next educational step. \r\n\r\nAdditionally to the strong co-operation with the partner enterprises, based on mutual visits and a regular communication and contact throughout the whole year, the Erasmus + programme was promoted at the school and in the whole area with a vast amount of information about it. This included informational meetings as well as a buddy project with former trainees, information evenings for parents and students, permanent information boards introducing the Erasmus+ programme as well as all the parntner enterprises at the school, articles and blogs about the project on the homepage of the school, presentations about it at the parents' day and all secondary schools of East Tyrol etc..  Through this advertising of the programme as well as the personal networking of the trainees regarding this project other schools have already been inspired to consider practical trainings abroad for their students and the news about Erasmus+ programmes is spreading.\r\n\r\nCurrently 33 students are involved in this project. All of them have already signed their placement contracts as well as Learning Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding with the partner enterprises in England and Italy. All the training places have been chosen by the students themselves. They all got a positive reply for a practical training after their application including Europass CVs, motivation letters and personal job interviews. As all partner enterprises only have had positive experiences with trainees from our two schools, this co-operation has turned out to be a win-win situation for both: our schools profit from this additional international offer and the training places can rely on polite, helpful, dedicated and competent trainees for the most hectic period of work.\r\n  \r\nBesides an improvement in practical knowhow, intercultural knowledge and linguistic competences, which all lead to better resuls in the final exams as well as the A-levels, a practical training abroad is especially important for the positive development of all personal and social skills, especially an enhanced self-esteem of the trainees. This huge step in their personal development obviously also has a great impact on their further career at the school and in their later life.  Their career prospects do not only increase because of this international work experience but also due to their - often newly gained - openness, flexibiltiy and professional appearance which they get during an international internship. A large number of students who have done a practical training abroad plan a longer placement abroad after their final exams and they are much more confident and sure about their future plans when they start applying for jobs in international companies.

The different mobilities will concern 12 European countries, over a period of 2 years. Tool sharing is already carried out via the collaborative platform open to all the members of the consortium. It has improved over the different group projects and from this year, it offers new tools such as a form with the names of companies ready to answer the requests of new schools (either in the same domain or in additional domains) or a European citizenship questionnaire taken before and after the mobility. The mobilities are envisaged in 41 domains, from the restaurant industry to the art embroidery including the stone trades or the maintenance of industrial equipments.\r\nWhatever their course, the students of the technology and vocational schools often form a weakened public, not very prone to move, which is particularly the case in Lorraine (as the figures show). Thanks to the European mobility, they will develop their professional skills in a different setting as well as their language skills. They will also acquire autonomy, self-confidence, capacity for adaptation to constraints and new working methods \u2013 some qualities that will make their insertion in the working world easier, be it in France, in one of the 3 border countries or elsewhere.

The analysis realized starting from these activities of discussion and sensitization highlighted the need of implementing transnational mobility activities for the strengthening and updating of professional competences, both of recent graduates and staff, in the sectors identified in the project. In fact, they are sectors extremely relevant for the national economy (tourism, fashion, commerce), constantly increasing (ICT, electronics/electrotechnics, mechanical engineering/mechatronics, marketing), and in which the request of specific competences has grown (social field, mechanical engineering/mechatronics,  environment and territory). \r\nBesides the technical-professional competences related to the identified sectors, the project contributes to enhance the European identity and to improve intercultural, linguistic and digital skills, allowing the development of a set of personal and transversal abilities, essential in the current occupational scenario. \r\nThe realization of the project \"E.A.S.Y.

In the spring of 2016 the three organizations took part in creating a joint internationalization strategy for the vocational education and training organized by the City of Vaasa. The aim is to provide the growing Vaasa region with a competent labour force that will thrive in the international, multicultural and multilingual working life and society. The objective of the project Professional Skills through Mobilities@vamia.fi is to implement the priorities of Vamia\u2019s internationalization strategy.\r\nAll international mobilities are based on the ECVET system. The methods for identifying and recognizing skills achieved abroad will be further developed for all students. The students\u2019 personal digital portfolio  will be further developed, and the students and staff will be more deeply familiarized with the utilization of it. In addition to this, all the practices regarding adult education students will be developed in order to create a high-quality process for international mobilities.\r\nThe project will enable all staff members and students to participate in international mobilities.The project will pilot and in the future intends to expand the mobilities of newly-graduated students.  The project will enable shorter mobilities for students with special needs.  Multilingualism will be promoted by developing Vamia\u2019s English-language export mechanical fitter education and training (starting in autumn 2017) as well as developing CLIL in all vocational education and training programs.\r\nIn the project new partnerships will be created. New partners will be given the opportunity to job shadow or do on-the-job learning in Vaasa. This will allow the staff and students of Vamia to get internationalized at home, make new contacts and together develop the quality of student mobilities.\r\nDuring this project we strive to further develop genuine and high-quality partnerships and networking while supporting Vamia\u2019s strategy and benefiting all stakeholders as well as contributing to quality assurance and safety of student mobilities. The aim is continuous improvement of the quality of international activities and mobilities by applying and developing LEAN tools such as continuous development boards, and by simplifying and standardizing practices. This applies to preparatory courses for students, on-the-job learning and assessment, the administration of international activities and the uniformity of practices across Vamia.  This also includes continuous training of the staff on the areas of responsibility and the phases of the international guidance plan as well as the continuous development of the students\u2019 use of the personal digital portfolio.\r\nThe aim is also to provide everyone with the opportunity to go abroad regardless of their study program, age, sex, and language or cultural background. The aim of the project is also to develop and increase the mobilities of adult students. Short mobilities for special needs students with an accompanying teacher (2 weeks in Glasgow), and a system for financially supporting students from poor socioeconomic backgrounds will be developed. A framework and a transparent application process will be developed for this.\r\nIn the project one of the objectives is to develop the competence of the management and staff through job shadowing. Vamia\u2019s management group of 15 persons (principal, vice principals, heads of department, development manager, financial director, manager of international affairs, and the people in charge of LEAN development) aim to do job shadowing in a vocational school in Tilburg, Holland, and learn about their LEAN and Oppiscrum system. The school has been developing their management system according to LEAN principles while Vamia has been using LEAN in teaching and learning environments. The two schools will learn from each other through mutual exchanges. Furthermore, we aim to send three teachers from the department of business and administration to Kunskapsk\u00e4llan in Sweden, where they can deepen their knowledge of e-commerce. Kunskapsk\u00e4llan is situated close to Bor\u00e5s, which is a center for e-commerce in Sweden. Vamia, together with local companies, will start export mechanical fitter education in English. Four members of the staff will be going to Elgoibar, Spain, to get acquainted with their English-speaking programs for fitters. The aim is to create job shadowing and cooperation between the two schools as well as to together create and share teaching material and develop cooperation with companies.
