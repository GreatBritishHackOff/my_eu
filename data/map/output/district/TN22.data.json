Because of the high water content of this material, energy can only effectively be gained through biochemical conversion. The approach best suited to this is anaerobic digestion where yields of 400-450 m3 methane per kg ODM can be achieved. The research explores the ways in which this energy potential can be realised through effective collection, pre-processing and optimisation of the fuel conversion technology, and considers how integration of these aspects with improving conversion efficiencies can maximise the net energy gains. It expands our rapidly-developing fundamental knowledge of syntrophic anaerobic microbial interactions, and applies this to the manipulation of reactor conditions in order to achieve stable operating conditions at high loading rates and volumetric efficiencies. It considers methods of upgrading the gaseous fuel product to extend the range of end user applications and the scales at which this technology can be exploited. It takes into account issues of biosecurity when using this material, and quantifies the environmental benefits associated with nutrient recycling which contribute significantly to indirect energy gains. The research combines techniques of waste audit, feasibility study, laboratory scientific investigation, technical-scale trials, plant monitoring, process modelling, life cycle assessment and energy footprinting in order to deliver recommendations for the valorisation with maximum benefit of this energy source as a second-generation biofuel.", 182553.0, 3942798.0, "VALORGAS", "Food waste to biogas", "Food waste from homes and restaurants makes up a large fraction of municipal waste.

The project was able to overcome many challenges related to collection, handling, pre-treatment, and the anaerobic digestion (AD) of food waste.\n\nResearchers set out to evaluate the efficiency and yield of food waste collection scheme. They also determined the energy and carbon footprint of the conversion process. Finally, they wanted to better understand how AD works.\n\nThe work began with data collection of food waste in selected regions in Europe. A small project was also conducted in India. The aim was to gain information about the properties of food waste and to identify any regional differences. The team then conducted a survey on food waste collections and carried out case studies on appropriates scales for AD in public and private communities. \n\nThe project resulted in an increase in biogas production. This product may be used in combined heat and power plants and as a fuel for vehicles. Throughout the project, the team considered biosecurity issues and quantified the environmental benefits of nutrient recycling.\n\nThis research has the potential to help the EU meet its long-term energy goals. By overcoming many problems associated with the AD technology, the team has opened the doors to more widespread use. In India, the work resulted in 22 recommendations for the development of small-scale biogas upgrading for the bottling industry. \n\nThe data characterising food also has tremendous value. The information can help with planning for waste-processing facilities.

It became possible to stimulate or inhibit individual action potentials at will, without further chemical modification. The capabilities have been demonstrated in a number of recent high profile journals detailing optical-neural control from cell culture to primate models. The light-gated cation channels were discovered and first applied by European researchers. The photonics and optoelectronics sectors, which can provide new stimulation technologies to this field, are additionally, European strengths. Nevertheless, in recent years, the dominant research output in this area has shifted to well-funded US laboratories.This proposal therefore aims to create a consortium to develop an array of ultra bright electronically controlled microLEDs which will provide a truly revolutionary tool for the neuroscience and neurotechnology community. The consortium consists of experts in the field who converge the many disciplines (optics, sophisticated LED fabrication, CMOS flip chip design and bonding, biophysics, molecular biology, neurophysiology) to bear on the complex, and crucial to neuroscience, problem of studying dendritic physiology and neural network dynamics. Advances in the techniques of this field will absolutely be required to further our understanding of brain function. The system we propose to develop will be powerful, sophisticated and at the same time, lead to a commercial spin-out that will provide them at relatively low cost.

FastPass brings together key players of the entire ABC value chain - system and component producers, research institutions, governmental authorities and end-users.\nThe development of a harmonized ABC gate will be accomplished with continuous end-user involvement. The entire innovation process, from components development to the final design of the user interface, will continuously be evaluated by the two end user groups, travellers and border guards.\nBorder control is a major challenge for security and mobility within the EU. Travellers request a minimum delay and a speedy border crossing, while Border Guards must fulfil their obligation to secure the EUs borders against illegal immigration and other threats. Fastpass will serve both demands at the same time to keep security at the highest level while increasing the speed and the comfort for all legitimate travellers at all border control points.\nThe FastPass ABC process will be designed to address both requirements with equal emphasis. One aspect of a speedy border crossing by legitimate travellers is a harmonised user interface. This will allow frequent travellers from Europe and third country states to pass through an ABC with minimum delay, using the full potential of ID documents. Improved traveller identification technologies, such as new biometric modules will increase the security of the ABC process and minimise spoofing.\nA demonstration and evaluation at all types of border (air, land and sea) will be implemented in at least three different member states.

Such ground deformations are usually associated with liquefaction, i.e., a decrease in strength caused by the increase in pore water pressures in saturated cohesionless materials during earthquake ground motion. Much earthquake damage caused by liquefaction-induced excessive displacements can be mitigated by soil improvement methods, thus limiting the associated economic and social problems. Unfortunately, large scale application of the more common soil improvement methods is often avoided because of excessive costs of deep methods and incomplete understanding of potential benefits of other methods. This leads to potentially catastrophic consequences from earthquakes. For this reason preloading is particularly attractive, because, as it is applied from the surface, it can overcome the restriction of prohibitive costs. The goal of this research is to develop a cost-effective method, based on preloading, to reduce seismic liquefaction susceptibility and the associated risk to buildings that may cause many fatalities. Verify and study the method by a field study and develop procedures to estimate improvement and risk mitigation for new sites. Towards this goal the following major tasks will be performed: 1. Study and verify the method by a field preload test 2. Study of the effect of preloading on the cyclic soil strength by elaborate laboratory testing 3. Collect and analyze in-situ test results before and after the field application of preloading 4.
