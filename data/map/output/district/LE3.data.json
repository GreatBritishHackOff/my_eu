The work produced a set of cultural guidelines, which help decision makers and other stakeholders consider the social and legal implications of demining. Other legal and quasi-legal issues were documented regarding in-field demonstrations. The study also assessed the ethical and legal implications of using genetically modified organisms for biodetection of explosives.\n\nProject tools have been integrated and a user interface developed, yielding a toolbox concept.

Agriculture and environment are both priorities for Europe\u2019s GMES initiative.\n\nSatellite images with a high temporal frequency (daily) but low spatial resolution (>250m) are frequently used for agricultural monitoring. However, since the early 2000, new high frequency, high resolution (<30m) wide swath sensors have become available.\n\nThe ISAC proposal intends to explore improvements of current Agricultural Services based upon such high frequency, high resolution data. It intends to expand the capabilities of LMCS and ERCS for what concerns the agro-environment.\n\nISAC proposes to develop and test feasibility of 3 services:\n1.

Recently, the EU has been considering a possible integration of risk management in the Common Agricultural Policy. However, in countries like Africa, resilience after disasters is slow with the lack of adequate knowledge of cropping systems, affecting the livelihood of vulnerable populations. \n\nDespite the differences between countries, there is an overall need for reliable information. Crop monitoring relies mostly on the use of satellite images with high temporal frequency (daily), but low spatial resolution (>250 m). The 'Information service on agricultural change' (http://www.gmes-isac.info/ (ISAC)) project proposed the use of high frequency and high resolution (<30 m) data from the Disaster Monitoring Constellation and Landsat-TM. \n\nDuring the ISAC project, three services were developed. The first provides vegetation indices and biophysical parameters, such as the leaf area index and fractional vegetation cover with high spatial details. The high resolution biophysical parameters are used in a second service dedicated to assessing drought phenomena and related crop damage. The third service is focused on detecting short- and long-term changes in agricultural production.\n\nPrototypes of the new services were demonstrated in Belgium, Ethiopia and Spain, representing areas with moderate to extremely high drought risk. Field campaigns were also organised in each of the test sites to thoroughly validate products. The three test sites were chosen to demonstrate the potential usage of the new services. More importantly, ISAC services were reviewed by potential end-users for future ingestion in the Copernicus services. \n\nIt is expected that the ISAC services will form the basis for setting-up paying downstream services together with end-users and in particular, with the insurers. Better information can be used for payments and guiding field visits.
