Three European regions will be participating in this effort: the UK (the Midlands and Plymouth), the Brussels area and Wallonia, and the Weser-Ems region in NorthWest Germany. Each of these regions will deploy a new hydrogen refuelling site to close the gaps in a continuous \u2018hydrogen highways\u2019 that leads from Scotland via the Midlands to London, connecting to Brussels and on to Cologne and Hamburg/Scandinavia/Berlin via Bremen.\nThe vehicles employed are low-cost, high fuel-efficiency, hybridised, light-weight passenger cars specifically designed for city and regional transport. These vehicles provide a complementary pathway to commercialisation to the large Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of hydrogen fuel cell options, by allowing near-term rollout on a commercial basis to a wide range of users \u2013 in parallel with the planned rollouts for large OEM vehicles from 2015. Their deployment regions will gain the infrastructure, public exposure and technological understanding to act as seed locations for future large scale OEM vehicle rollout.\nIn view of the lower vehicle costs, this project will deploy an unprecedented number of road vehicles for a demonstration project, with three OEM\u2019s contributing 20, 10 and 20 vehicles respectively to the project. These will be put in the hands of users in a variety of real-life operating environments. An extensive data monitoring exercise will run throughout the demonstration phase, allowing the reliability of the vehicles tested by different users to be evaluated and leading to recommendations for the improvement of future, fully commercial vehicle designs.\nThe three European regions will deploy several hydrogen refuelling stations, adding a total of 3 new stations to existing supply sites, contributing to some of the first regional hydrogen refuelling clusters in Europe. Each region will as a consequence either own a high-standard filling station with = high capacity (200 kg/day) and high performance (70 MPa) refuelling technology (Wallonia, Weser-Ems), or build on existing smaller stations of lower capacity and pressure (UK, Midlands and Plymouth).\nThe project will be a near-commercial stepping stone and will include a reach-out activity timed to coincide with OEM\u2019s commercialisation plans in the post-2015 period, to attract further vehicles to the newly developed infrastructures - by offering cost effective and readily available focal points for additional hydrogen fleets developing around these regions.

The proposed solution is anaerobic digestion of OMW, followed by reclamation of hydrogen gas for use in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC).\n\nProject members first studied the composition of OMW streams, and chose promising pre-treatment techniques for anaerobic digestion. Inoculum from a vineyard waste anaerobic digester was chosen because it showed the best methane production, and pig manure was selected as a co-substrate.\n\nResearchers tested commercial catalysts for biogas clean-up, and optimised the process for improved hydrogen production by studying different catalysts for the reforming process. The various components for the PEMFC have been tested and optimised.\n\nFinally, researchers constructed and tested a prototype system at an olive mill in Spain. Using this prototype, BIOGAS2PEM-FC completed a techno-economic and environmental analysis of the overall system, in preparation for a commercial offering.\n\nThe final system will provide on-site waste management and power generation for thousands of olive mills across Europe.", null, "http://www.marchesbiogas.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/161035.jpg", "fp7_105799_956016384"], ["1EG", "Sustainable value creation in manufacturing networks", "Riversimple Llp", "The increasing demands for sustainability have created new challenges and emerging opportunities for society and for business.

In line with Europe's Vision2020, the EU-funded project 'Sustainable value creation in manufacturing networks' (http://www.sustainvalue.eu (SUSTAINVALUE)) sought to overcome this challenge.\n\nLooking at manufacturing as a complex network of development-oriented dynamics, the project examined novel approaches to manage sustainability impacts, from production and sourcing to distribution and logistics.\n\nResearchers designed a three-tier governance model and sustainable business architecture. The model is seen as a method that combines the needs and responsibilities of stakeholders belonging to a business ecosystem, as well as business models and the interests of manufacturing network companies. The architecture reinforces companies when building their organisation, sustainable products, services and procedures.\n\nThe team articulated viable business strategies for sustainable manufacturing networks via a sustainable business modelling process and toolset. They help companies analyse and design sustainable business models for changes at company and network levels.\n\nThey also developed a methodology for sustainable solutions that supports companies' sustainable development practices and identifies trouble spots in their processes. Methodological tools help determine the sustainability effects of products, services or product service systems on society, the environment and the economy. They also choose the most economically viable and sustainable solution.\n\nAdditional project activities included key performance indicators and implementation guidelines, as well as support compliance verification processes for ongoing improvement.\n\nSUSTAINVALUE's main outcomes could help revolutionise production design and make industry much more sustainable. This could lead to a more competitive manufacturing sector, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, creating more customer loyalty, increased environmental awareness for citizens and job opportunities spurred by innovation.", null, "http://www.riversimple.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/149446.jpg", "fp7_98467_975286404"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SY8"}
