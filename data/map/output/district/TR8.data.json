Moreover the training masters and the teachers in charge of the mobility project in each school write the work experiences \u2018purposes in order for each student to discover the business, its way of working, the work progresses and the responsibilities assigned.\r\n\r\nThe MFR are associative schools which have contracts with the government and the Breton council. They suggest an alternative way of learning (students are part time at school and part time in a business) and they work for the youth social and professional integration. So a stay in a European country should allow young students to adapt themselves to their future jobs. Getting a new experience with different professional tasks (according to the chosen country) and discovering foreign cultural aspects are a guarantee to be more confident and open-minded. It should also allow a higher creativity to grow up in our European and citizen society.\r\n\r\nThe European mobility is accessible to all vocational or technical A level students and should allow them to: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Practice a foreign language and to improve it\r\n\u2022 Gain new Professional skills\r\n\u2022 Meet new people and discover their culture, their way of life  and their traditions\r\n\u2022 Push themselves\u2019 limits and to take responsibilities\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the students could, after their studies become involved and proud European citizens able to create their future jobs and to increase the European competitiveness.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA116-035440_29"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["4AA", "Food for Change", "Cornwall Food Foundation", "The Food for Change project will build four locality-based Food for Change partnerships in Redruth, Truro, St Austell and Newquay.
