Staff will also visit the Specialist Language Centre in Rouen. As a result of this our staff will have accessed high quality French teaching to use back at Plantation. The confidence of staff throughout Plantation will therefore improve. \r\nThose teachers who visit France, teach in their schools and attend the language learning in the Specialist Language Centre (Rouen) will disseminate what they have learned to up-skill all teachers through staff meetings, training and workshops sharing teaching resources, ideologies and styles.\r\nThrough teaching and learning in our French partner school,  staff at Plantation will develop their awareness of different teaching styles and pedagogies. Our Headteacher will be taking part in at least one visit to France and he will be able to observe and learn about different assessment procedures and school policies. Everything gained will be passed onto all staff at Plantation to ensure maximum impact.\r\nStaff who personally visit France will get the opportunity to experience different cultures and traditions and these will be disseminated to all staff. These traditions and cultures will be taught to all children through high-quality foreign language lessons from highly confident staff at Plantation.\r\nIn the wake of Brexit, at Plantation we want to maintain and encourage positive links with the rest of Europe and countries further afield. This will help children at Plantation become well rounded individuals who have respect for all cultures and traditions. The project will help children at Plantation see that there is a world outside of Knowsley, outside of Liverpool and outside of the UK. It will also help develop their knowledge and understanding of global issues and how this impacts their lives.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, Plantation's International Language Development Scheme will not be possible without gaining Erasmus+ funding. Gaining the funding will have a hugely positive impact on Plantation and will shape the future our children.", "http://www.plantationprimary.com", "Plantation Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035725_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["9UH", "RBS", "ALDERHEY CHILDRENS HOSPITAL AT THE HALEWOOD CENTRE"]]}}, "outwardCode": "L26"}
