The project will last 24 months and includes 28 participants.\r\n\r\nProject Special skills 2017 emphasizes the promotion of general education of the deaf and hard of hearing, children with speech and language difficulties and children with autism. Similar schools can only be found beyond our borders, because there is a lack of such schools in Slovenia.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we have three different groups of participants, first group of participants will observe at workplace - job shadowing, other target group consists of  teachers, assistants, and they will try a new challenge - how to teach autistic kids at a partner school, a third group of participants will attend seminars and last group will learn about support centre acitvities. For each area of development, we found a partner with which we will develop  our priority fields. Our areas are: new knowledge in the field of assistants for autism in elementary school, new methods and forms of work with children with autism, new knowledge in the field of speech methods in primary school and kindergarten, knowledge of the school sign language interpreters, new knowledge in the field of residential units for primary school children and knowledge about support center strategies with deaf children. In special school with a kindergarten in the UK we will gain experience in the field of autism, on seminar which is taylor made for our group.  Two teachers will also have the opportunity to teach autistic children. By visiting the schools in Slovakia and Czech Republic we will focus on speech therapy and pedagogy and in Great Britain we will focus on the innovative aspects of supporting children who are deaf - especially in early years. In Azores we will visit inclusive school with deaf. We plan job shadowing for 2 deaf participants with interpreter. Seminar in Italy will be  mailny prepared for to school interpreters and teachers of deaf. \r\nWe plan to carefully manage the project in all its phases, with an emphasis on the preparation of all participants, the dissemination which starst on the first day of the project and lasts after the end of our project. Dissemination starts in our own organization, and will be expanded through time in the Slovenian schools, and with a help of a broad network even to other European organizations, especially to our partners organizations in other KA1 and KA2 projects.  A wide range of interested stakeholders will be reached with our articles, and the results will be published at the national and European platforms: EACEA, School Education Gateway, Geneva (Special Needs),  Moodle, blog and website of Special Skills project. All participants will be active in eTwinning, for which we will also educate them within this project. We  are going to evaluate all phases of the project, because our goal is the continuous improvement of our work in Erasmus +, all our activities will be monitored with a help of  the electronic evaluation forms.\r\nThe project, which addresses the objectives of the program and objectives of the Europa 2020 will also maintain its sustainability through a seminar  Erasmus+ in schools and kindergartens. A range of materials  will also be accessible on Moodle to all people interested.\r\n\r\nThe project Special Skills 2017 is extremely valuable for Ljubljana School for the Deaf  because it allows our teachers professional networking in Europe and with constant work in Erasmus+ also contributes to development of special field pedagogy in Europe.", "http://www.bromley.gov.uk/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SI01-KA101-035362_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BR6"}
