She wants to attend the Erasmus course in France to further develop her French language and improve her teaching of French in her classroom through understanding different pedagogies.  Donna would also like to improve her understanding of French culture and current affairs and how best to teach this in a relevant context.  As 1+2 is a major priority on our Cluster Improvement Plan and will feature heavily in future School Improvement Plans, we feel that this experience will support our development for several reasons. Firstly, due to previously teaching German as the MLPS at the school staff are less familiar with the French Language.  Donna will plan and lead workshops for the whole staff, parents and cluster colleagues to share any strategies and resources gained on the course. A bank of resources is planned to be developed alongside colleagues at Insch school should all applicants be successful which will be made available to staff that did not attend through the Local Authority Development Officer as well as Glow pages. She will also make links with practitioners in Europe, which will, in turn, develop our Global Citizenship. By attending this course, Donna is hoping to further develop her skills in speaking and reading the French language and increase her cultural knowledge of France. Her hope is that this will make her teaching of the language more relevant and she can share this knowledge and skills with the rest of the staff in our school.  She also hopes that by engaging in a more relevant context this will lead to more enthusiastic teachers as well as more enthusiastic learners.", "http://www.gartly.aberdeenshire.sch.uk", "Gartly School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036112_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "AB54"}
