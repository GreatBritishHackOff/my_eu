We aim to recover 50% of the energy wasted at the profile cooling stage (for re-use in the energy intensive heat-ageing process), and simultaneously reduce scrap produced at the profile cooling stage by 25%. This would mean a saving of 1.9 million kWh of energy per line, and an increase in revenue of around \u20ac 1.3 million per line, almost trebling profit (through scrap turned into saleable product & reduction in energy used). The benefit to the environment is also substantial, with a reduction of 474Te of CO2 emissions per line", 179958.0, 1383581.0, "ECOQUENCH", "Efficient cooling of extruded Aluminium", "Extruded aluminium (Al) accounts for more than half of all Al products in Europe. Enhancing the energy efficiency of processing should have major impact on industry competitiveness and global climate change.", "Extrusion of Al alloys is accomplished by forcing a hot billet of Al through a shaped die and quenching or cooling it as it emerges to produce a long piece. The extruded Al can be used as is, cut in smaller pieces or used as feedstock for other processes.\n\nScientists are developing a controlled quenching and heat-extraction system for high-grade heat recovery at the profile cooling stage. This will be reused in the energy-intensive heat-ageing process with EU funding of the project http://www.ecoquench.eu/ (ECOQUENCH) . The technology is expected to recover 50 % of energy wasted during spray quenching and to reduce scrap produced at this stage by 25 %.\n\nDuring the first project phase, researchers established the optimal cooling rates for various extruded Al profiles. They investigated a number of oils to be used in the spray quenching process. The selection of candidates was complicated by a number of factors, including the high temperatures to be withstood. This meant that substances with low flash points (temperatures at which they can be ignited in air) such as mineral oil were unsuitable. The team finally determined that synthetic esters were the best candidates and selected one with high flash point, high self-ignition temperature, inertness and safety. \n\nScientists also conducted thermodynamic analyses of spray quenching and developed a test rig to evaluate both the nozzle design and the spray quenching thermodynamics. The entire spray system has now been designed, including air cooling, oil spraying, recirculation and removal of oil from the piece. Investigations of energy recovery during the spray quenching process have begun and will continue during the next project phase. \n\nECOQUENCH plans to deliver an energy-efficient and cost-effective technology for cooling extruded Al that will drastically reduce emissions and material waste. The end result will be an enhancement in the competitive position of EU industry and a decrease in the impact of its activities on the global environment.", null, "http://www.heattransfersystems.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813111903.jpg", "fp7_100967_964146439"], ["0QW", "Open Collaboration in Policy Modelling", "Scott John Moss Linda Mary Moss", "OCOPOMO addresses two levels of scientific and technological advancements:1)\\tSocio-political: to formulate, model, evaluate and monitor social and economic policies of governments, which are supported by2)\\tScientific and technological innovations: drawing together lessons and practical techniques from complexity science, agent based social simulation, foresight scenario analysis and advanced ICT for e-participation.OCOPOMO develops an integrated IT platform for efficient policy development by integrating formal policy modelling, scenario generation, and open collaboration supporting engagement of wide stakeholder groups in social and economic policy areas of two pilots.

Currently, there exists no cure for any ND, and most of the available drugs fail to tackle ND pathogenesis. Preclinical studies point to the therapeutic potential of neurotrophins, which have been shown to control a number of aspects of survival, development and function of neurons. However, the poor pharmacokinetic properties of neurotrophins render their use as drugs prohibitive.\nThe key idea behind this project is to address this limitation by developing novel small molecule, neurotrophin mimetics with favourable profiles of stability, tissue penetration and targeted biological actions. We are motivated by seminal (patented) results of beneficiaries NHRF and FORTH, who recently demonstrated promising effects of small neurotrophin mimetics in neuroprotection and neurogenesis. EuroNeurotrophin will be the first European consortium to study small molecule neurotrophin mimetics in depth, use them as molecular probes to interrogate neurotrophins, and emphasise their clinical translation.\nThis approach requires highly skilled researchers that have a deep understanding of neurotrophins, comprehend all steps of drug discovery and development for ND, and possess the necessary skills to translate results into novel therapies.\nThe network has been designed to address the need for the development of new ND treatments through the collaborative training of 14 early-stage researchers. It builds on previous successful collaborations enriched with key specialists, and consists of 12 leading European research groups and 6 private companies of complementary expertise covering all steps of drug discovery and development.

This COST Action will play a vital role in both networking and training elements of ClickGene, and in combination with transferable skills training, intersectorial and cross-disciplinary secondment, and industry targeted workshops, the education of biomaterials chemists with expertise in click-chemistry and cutting edge application areas of gene therapy, nanotechnology and biological diagnostics will be achieved. \n\nThe training provided will match the skills required by next-generation research leaders in biopharmaceutical, nanotechnology, biodiagnostic and other industries.
