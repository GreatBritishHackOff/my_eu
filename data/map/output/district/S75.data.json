Equipment Limited", "Innovative processes with streamlining and improved control will be conducted in FIBRALSPEC, through Unit for Continuous PAN-based Carbon Fiber Pilot Production. Testing of laminates and prepregs production based the new developed carbon fibres followed by manufacturing of laminates/coupons and high-performance filament wound tubes are also foreseen (equipment for delivering precise volumes the matrix (resin) in high and low-capacity to impregnate the fibres and bundles will be developed). The project also efforts on functionalization will be mainly focused on cost reduction, mechanical and chemical property improvement. Novel CF precursors will be developed (silicon carbide, textile-grade PAN, polyolefins, and lignin); in parallel, the suitability of a new environmentally friendly pitch will be assessed, obtained from anthracene oil, for the preparation of isotropic carbon fibres. The project\u2019s carbon fiber conversion technology will pyrolysis process to convert PAN precursor fiber into PAN-based carbon fiber and activated carbon fiber. Innovative surface treatment will improve the step of treatment of the carbon fiber surface being indispensable for productions in series. As for recycling and used of recycled CFs, new techniques will be used to provide commercially-relevant products that are manufactured from waste carbon fibres. Mathematical modeling will be conducted so as to determine properties of CFs and composites, together with cost modeling; life cycle assessment will assist in possible commercial risks that will be continuously estimated during the project and quantify/assess the environmental impact of the materials that will be used. Industrial partnership will ensure the impact of the research efforts, convincingly proving scalability towards industrial needs of two high demanding applications, namely medium technology \u2013 large scale (Rapid Deployment Secure Emergency Shelter (RDSES)) and high technology \u2013 small scale (supercapacitor).", 285007.0, 6537624.0, "FIBRALSPEC", null, null, null, null, "http://www.pu-technology.co.uk", null, "fp7_110861_950872280"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["2EP", "RFF", "BARNSLEY HOSPITAL"], ["2PS", "RFR", "BARNSLEY HOSPITALS"], ["2EP", "RHQ", "BARNSLEY DISTRICT GENERAL HOSPITAL"], ["2EP", "RP5", "BARNSLEY DISTRICT GENERAL HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "S75"}
