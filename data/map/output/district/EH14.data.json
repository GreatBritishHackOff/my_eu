This can only be achieved though critical dialogue with industry on potential future developments, current and future strengths and weaknesses, and the support required to ensure a forward thinking sustainable industry. The KNow-ME consortium argues that maritime training and education requires a life-cycle approach, where demand-oriented transnational e-courses and supporting material are developed in line with industry expectations and modern lifestyles. Enhanced education and training for the industry\u2019s professions must cater for a multicultural working environment, gender neutrality and maximum accessibility independent from time and space.  A modern image, career management and e-training and education will be promoted by establishing an e-portal that integrates with other \u2018e-maritime initiative\u2019 developments.

Small (< 5 mm) pieces of plastic (termed microplastics) have been reported in some coastal areas of Europe, but few areas have been evaluated and the extent of this environmental issue is unknown. Microplastics are ingested by organisms and the prominent concerns of this exposure include physical disruption of tissue surfaces, negative effects on digestive system processes, absorption across epithelial membranes and accumulation in internal tissues, trophic transfer in the food web and increasing the bioavailability of toxic substances (co-contaminants) that may be associated with microplastics. The goal of this project, MARMICROTOX, is to assess abundance and type of microplastics in wild mussels collected from sites on the coast of Scotland, as well as to conduct laboratory studies to investigate 1) accumulation, absorption, and negative effects of microplastics in mussels, 2) trophic transfer of microplastics and pathophysiology in fish and 3) effects of microplastics on co-contaminant bioavailability.

These included 21 marine expeditions to offshore storage and seepage sites for studies and data collection. During these cruises the researchers used and advanced a suite of cutting edge monitoring technology.\n\nScientists did not detect any CO2 anomalies at Sleipner in waters above the storage site. However, formation waters are released through a 3 km long fracture 25 km north to the Sleipner platform while both natural gas and formation water are seeping through abandoned wells located in the area. The observed geological features pose a number of important questions that are currently addressed by ECO2: Are there any high permeability pathways for gas and fluid flow through the overburden? Are seepage rates amplified by the ongoing storage operation? May CO2 stored sub-seabed ultimately leak through the overburden via seismic pipe and chimney structures, fractures and abandoned wells?\n\nTo find answers, CO2 release  at three natural seep sites was studied and deliberate CO2 release experiments were conducted in the vicinity of the Sleipner storage complex. CO2 emission rates and bottom-water pH values showed high variability. Natural seep sites and shore-based mesocosm experiments showed that birth and development processes of sensitive organisms such as echinoderms are negatively affected by increased CO2.\n\nThe environmental risks of CCS and its financial, legal and political implications have been elucidated and field data stored in a project database.

Transformation optics (TO) is a new paradigm for the science of light, which is enabled by recent developments in our fabrication capabilities with respect to metamaterial-based devices. TO is based on the invariance of Maxwell\u2019s equations with respect to coordinate transformations, provided that the basic optical parameters of materials, dielectric permittivity \u03b5(r) and magnetic permeability \u00b5(r), are also transformed appropriately. This makes possible molding and controlling light on all scales, from macroscopic sizes down to the deeply sub-wavelength scale.

This is reflected in the fact that the 2010 Nobel Prize in physics was related to this two-dimensional (2D) material.\n\nThis enthusiasm is well deserved given that this novel material is harder than diamonds and a hundred times tougher than steel, not to mention an excellent semiconductor. It has applications in numerous fields, including nanoelectronics, composite materials, molecular sensors, artificial muscle actuators, plastic polymers and many more.\n\n'Graphene based thermoplastic masterbatches for conventional and additive manufacturing processes' (NANOMASTER) is an EU-funded project working to develop innovative polymers that slash the amount of plastic required to make a component by half. This will significantly reduce weight and improve environmental sustainability. Financed by the EU's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), the project is also striving to enhance electrical and thermal functionality.\n\nNANOMASTER has identified suitable polymers and desired grades of graphene and expanded graphite. The project has also developed various techniques to produce 100\u00a0gramme batches of graphene and various grades of expanded graphite for starting material during direct graphene production on multikilo lots. These samples have been combined and the resulting compound materials have had their mechanical and electrical properties tested. The results are now being used to optimise the graphene and graphite grades.\n\nOnce NANOMASTER has successfully managed to scale up its production techniques, its groundbreaking work will help to pave the way for a wave of potential applications. These include materials that are lighter, tougher and stronger than conventional plastics, while using significantly less raw inputs.

With higher efficiencies more kWh can be produced from the same amount of silicon, which is the dominating cost factor at present. Fundamental loss mechanisms limit the maximum achievable efficiency: around 20% of the incident power is lost, because photons with energies below the band-gap are transmitted. Upconversion of two low energy photons into one usable photon reduces these losses. In this project we will realize upconversion with the help of nanostructures and nanotechnoloy-based materials and show a significant improvement in solar cell efficiency. The combination of upconverting Er-based phosphors with PbSe/PbS core shell quantum dots increases the spectral range of light that is upconverted. The quantum dots will be incorporated into a fluorescent concentrator to achieve concentration within the upconverting device. Both the increased photon flux due to a wider spectral collection and the additional geometric concentration will increase upconversion efficiency because of its nonlinear characteristic. Optical nanostructures shall serve as selectively reflective structures that avoid unwanted parasitic absorption. The development of very efficient quantum dots and suitable host materials, the optimization of the upconverter and the fabrication of photonic structures are main objectives. Additionally, solar cells and system designs will be optimized, to make the best use of upconverted photons.

However, the inherent semiconductor promise of scalability has yet to be realized for these quantum systems.\n\nSEQUioA takes a highly inventive approach to quantum scalability. It will allow new fundamental investigations into quantum coherence in the solid state and the further development of quantum technologies. SEQUioA will build and exploit a novel architecture to deterministically create a non-local coherent interaction, or entanglement, between multiple remotely located semiconductor quantum dots. The architecture achieves independent optical and electrical control of each quantum dot on the same semiconductor chip. Two distinct types of non-local interactions will be investigated. The first, based on projective measurements of indistinguishable photons, probes and exploits the ideal atom-like behaviour of quantum dots. The second coupling mechanism, mesoscopic in nature, is based on a long-range magnetic interaction between confined spins in spatially remote dots.", 1218782.0, 1218782.0, "SEQUOIA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.hw.ac.uk", null, "fp7_105064_999853400"], ["4AP", "Engineered Nanoparticles: Review of Health and Environmental Safety", "Institute of Occupational Medicine", "The overall aim of the ENRHES project is to perform a comprehensive scientific review of the health and environmental safety of fullerenes, CNTs, metal and metal oxide nanomaterials.

For example, if the medium refractive index is not moving but is made to oscillate at high, e.g. optical frequencies, then a parametric interaction occurs with an incident light beam amplified transformed into a new pair of light beams. If closed within cavity mirrors, amplification by the oscillating medium is enhanced and even vacuum photons are be excited in correlated pairs in a process analogous to the dynamical Casimir effect. We will also consider the opposite regime in which the refractive index profile does not oscillate but is made to move forwards close to, or even faster than the speed of light.

Technological advances to reduce packaging costs are therefore of crucial importance to maintain the competitive edge of EU packaging and assembly companies.\n\nMicroelectronics packaging often makes use of thermosetting polymer materials such as encapsulants, underfills or electrically conductive adhesives. Initially, thermosetting polymers are liquid or paste-like and are hardened through a curing process. An alternative approach to conventional heating methods is the use of microwave energy that results in substantially shorter curing times.\n\nIn the EU-funded project 'Frequency agile microwave bonding system' (http://www.famobs.eu/ (FAMOBS)), researchers developed a novel tool that uses pulsed microwave radiation and selects a few cavity frequencies to improve the bonding quality. Possible applications include curing underfill materials, bonding components to a printed circuit board or even reworking defective components.\n\nThis tool is an open-cavity bonding system that allows point selective heating. As such, it can be integrated into a precision placement machine to allow processing single components in a whole printed circuit board. Furthermore, the open design enables simultaneous placement, alignment and curing. Reel-to-reel processing is another application of this technology.\n\nCompared to a convection oven, the material is heated from the inside, which results in shorter curing times. It is thus possible to cure certain materials 10 times faster.

Park4SUMP will work on traffic and travel avoidance; it will support less car dependent lifestyles and put into practise innovations in planning and location policy.  It will also optimise the use of existing infrastructure. Furthermore the modal shift towards more efficient modes like  walking, cycling and public transport will be encouraged. Convincing arguments to incorporate parking management can be given : it has low costs, it pays for itself, it delivers money, it is easy to implement and to modify and it can be done in incremental steps. The main expected impact will be cities with strongly improved parking policies that are creatively used to improve the quality of life and business in cities and develop the cities in a more sustainable way.

A central purpose of the foundation is the promotion of education, information, sensitivity and orientation towards the rights of animals embedded in an ecological world view. In this context the protection of animals has to be understood as having a social, emotional , cultural and ethical value as well as presenting challenges in respect of economic  issues and the health of consumers. This idea has been promoted by ERNA\u2019s different activities including legislative means, radio features, the promotion of research, pilot projects in continuous education and the development of teaching materials and books for students. In 2011 the first workshop and seminar for the teaching of teachers and other teaching staff concerning animal protection in class had been organized, together with a work group of the local authorities for school education in Berlin, Senatsverwaltung f\u00fcr Bildung, Jugend und Wissenschaft. As a consequence of this the project \u201cTIKA\u201d had been started together with the Chamber of Veterinaries in Berlin. TIKA is dedicated for the teaching of teachers in Berlin Schools concerning animal protection and correct care of house animals. For some years EGS has been active in a working group at European level preparing programmatic European activities like the first Conference on Animal Education, which took place in Brussels in 2010. EGS initiated a pilot project at European level called Walk-The- Dog, with a teacher work book and teaching material for pupils that has been  distributed all over Germany and to some other European countries.  A large number of schools throughout Europe are working with the teaching material that has been translated into English and Greek. The EGS board of directors decided in 2013 to participate in the ERASMUs+ KA 1 program in order to strengthen intercultural training and quality in professional education to bring about holistic competence and improved animal welfare in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlready in 2010 EGS started  the preparation of european projects in professional education because it is a matter of fact that there is a big need for ecological education especially in professions that deal with veterinary and agricultural tasks. EGS started with a pilot study and decided to focus on the professional education of veterinary nurses in Europe. The aim is to improve and to stress animal rights and ensure correct treatment of animals in professional education. In the framework of KA 1, individual Mobilities, ERASMUS+, EGS initiated a cooperation of all relevant institutions in Berlin that deal with dual education of vet nurses in Berlin on a regional level, called \u201cBerlin Consortium Vet Nurse Europe\u201d. This cooperation is built between EGS, Chamber of Veterinaries in Berlin and the professional school called OSZ Gesundheitstechnik, educating 3  classes of Vet Nurses every year (approx. 80 vet learners). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe protection of animals is one central aim of Erna-Graff- Foundation, an NGO that has been founded  30 years ago. The basis idea of \"Vet Nurse Europe\" is to focus and strenghten the protection of animals in the world of professional education in veterinary professions. Following to this the promotion of an holistic  professional competence  is essential as an integral part of social learning last not least in the client contact with animals and their owners. Prevention, self- organization and the development of an holistic competence in the framework of ecological thoughts should be strenghtened and considered in veterinary professions much more in the near  future. All this can be promoted in cooperation with european partners for individual mobilities, esp. of vet learners. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAims oft he project:The project will  improve the professional competence of participants. It will enable and promote individual mobility of vet learners in order to make them profit of learning chances to stay in a foreign country. Furthermore professional education should be improved in regard of ECVET. The systems of professional education should be more transparent and comparable. This is essential for the aims of Kopenhagen.  There is something basically new that gives an innovative approach to this project.  The promotion of ERASMUS+ mobilities will enable a  cooperation between dual  institutions in Germany and university/ colleges in Great Britain in the field of vet nurse education. In plus the main parts of  the cooperation will take place  in working places and veterinary hospitals i.e. that the german vet learners will have the chance to get to know details oft he work situation in the partner countries.

The program is designed as a training and research endeavour that has as its core objective to promote activities of an educational, research and artistic nature, which exploit all domains of fiction film creation and production in an original manner. Course durationTwo years (120 ECTS credits).Brief descriptionKEM is promoted by Universidade Lus\u00f3fona de Humanidades e Tecnologias, School of Arts, Communication and Information Technologies (Portugal), Edinburgh Napier University, School of Arts and Creative Industries (United Kingdom) and Tallinn University, Baltic Film and Media School (Estonia). The course departs from the core areas of fiction film creativity and focuses on building skills for new career pathways and new opportunities to study the art and techniques of fiction filmmaking. The proposed curriculum and educational goals clearly balance the different technological aspects of filmmaking with the comprehension of the possibilities film offers as an art form. KEM\u2019s main academic topic is film and moving image media. The programme particularly focuses on fiction film, either short or feature formats. The programme also deals with the broader competences of film literacy, namely the ability to critically understand the medium and its forms of expression and manipulate the associated language and technical features. Related academic topics are arts education and creativity. KEM\u2019s curriculum integrates theoretical and practical oriented subjects, mostly based on a training trough projects in development methodology, amidst a mix of analytical, critical and experimental didactic approaches that will provide students with an in-depth knowledge of fiction film development while allowing them to explore their creativity and specialise in those aspects of fiction films that correspond to their personal preferences, artistic ambitions, and needed professional skills. KEM focuses on a pentagon shaped educational model covering five core skills: writing, directing, producing, technical execution (cinematography, editing, and sound) and creative programming, a transversal competence that includes parts of all others, and points to the need to integrate film literacy as a nuclear aspect of film education.KEM proposed structure follows the workflow of an actual film production and is aligned with the needs of todays\u2019 professionals and organizations scattered along the film production and distribution value chain. Career prospectsKEM envisions educating creative professionals who fully comprehend all dimensions of film creation and possess the specialized skills necessary for a successful career in the highly competitive international market.An international experienceKEM students benefit both from geographical mobility by having the opportunity to circulate between the three countries involved in the program with international students in a highly collaborative environment. Students form collaborative teams and work towards a funded graduation project. Their final thesis films are expected to perform at first-tier international film festivals. Teaching on the programme is supplemented by a comprehensive course of professional practice preparation, involving industry professionals from all over Europe.DiplomaKEM will grant from the beginning a multiple degree and a attached diploma supplement based on the already existing and locally accredited master courses (second cycle degrees) in the area of fiction film offered by each one of the schools in the consortium, and will from its second edition onwards award a joint master degree with full accreditation and an associated diploma supplement.Websitehttp://www.kinoeyes.eu/", null, null, "erasmus_553676-EPP-1-2014-1-PT-EPPKA1-JMD-MOB_1"], ["5JR", "ONE WEEK IMMERSION LANGUAGE COURSE", "Nether Currie Primary School", 1573.0, "Context of project: \r\n\u2022 One week immersion language course.\r\n\r\nObjectives of project:\r\n\u2022 Teacher training in language and methodology to embed the target language into School.\r\n\u2022 Help School follow new national curriculum.\r\n\u2022 Find partners abroad.\r\n\u2022 Get pupils to use ICT to communicate with other schools in UK and abroad.\r\n\u2022 There is a need for training my school staff, upskill the teacher\u2019s competences in languages, culture and methodology of the teaching and learning of a foreign language at primary level.

The festival is an inpiration to students and teachers alike. From Angoul\u00eame the students travel to Great Britain where they visit their partner school, the University of Cumbria. The  aim of the visit is to get an insight into the structure of the Drawing department, the Games Design department and  Illustration and Graphic Design. Students have the possibility to apply for the third and final year of a BA at the University after finishing their diploma courses. The aim of the visit is also to maintain a relationship between these schools. Visits will also be made to few other universities in England: Cambridge School of Art, Kingston University, The London College of Communication and the Glasgow School of Art. \r\nFourteen students and 2 teachers from the Textile Department will visit Europe. The aim of the trip is to expose the students to a varied view of textile production, research, study possibilities and various musuems. To be able to get a complete picture, the students travel to three countries starting with Holland known for its very avant-garde designs and high-tech production. From there the students travel to Antwerp in Belgium where the focus is on fashion and clothes design. Finally the students travel to Great Britain where museums and textile producers are visited as well as the department\u2018s partner school, the Heriot-Watt University, The School of Textiles and Design. \r\nThe main goals of these study trips is to expose the students and their teachers to European educational and vocational possibilities. The trips open up new horizons for the participants. They learn  about new educational possibilities and what they can apply for after they finish their diploma courses, discover new vocational routes and ways to set up small companies.The student gains contextual awareness through visits to cultural institutions and not least, interact with other students in Europe through visits to different schools.Another important part of the study trips is the connection that students and teachers make with other professionals working within their chosen areas of study.The project is in step with the aims of the Icelandic governments\u2018s aims to promote the possibility for those who haven\u2018t finished their studies (about 33% of people in work)  of further study and realizing their dreams of bettering their position in the work force.\r\nThe project is also instrumental in revitalising and encouraging teachers to broaden their own horizons in teaching and as professionals in their different fields.\r\n\r\nThe three study trips will address the need to expand all students views and experiences by introducing them to the European education and employment system of further education and possible routes of study. It is expected that the trip will broaden their views on their potential options for work or further studies in their chosen fields as well as inspire them in their studies after their return to Iceland to finish their diploma courses.The three mobilities will take place during the spring term 2017 and are fully evaluated into the participating students\u00b4 education in RSVA to the amount of 5-6 ETCS.

An important aim is to provide internationalization possibilities evenly to students and experts from possibly many vocational fields from Omnia\u2019s wide international co-operation network. The length of student mobility periods varies from two to twelve weeks and expert mobilities from one to two weeks.  Accompanying person mobilities will be applied for a two-week-group-mobility periods to France. The aim during this college mobility period would be to plan and implement a wooden product under supervision of French and Finnish teachers. In addition to this another group-mobility-period will be applied for a ten-student group for the cooking and baking field students. Two support person mobilites would be applied even to this period. These group-mobility-periods would be done for two different co-operation colleges in France. Omnia has a clear aim to combine internalization strategy to curriculums, develop the studies of internationalization pathway and implement the internationalization strategy. Home college internationalisation will be improved  by developing activities with tutor students for intenational activities. This work will be a strategical aim in Omnia\u2019s international development work in 2016. In connection with it we have started a workgroup working with representants from Omnia\u2019s different vocational divisions, persons from international office and pedagogical heads and some persons from other national vocational sister colleges.( Hyria and Vaasa Vocational College). One aim would be to create a time-bound part of study entity concerning key competencies of lifelong learning, which would be achieved during international mobility periods. International project work, including international mobility periods, will be handled both in the applying phase and during the actual working period of a project, in Omnia\u2019s pedagogical development team. There are representants from Omnia\u2019s different divisions in this group. The members of pedagogical development team are working as contact persons between the students and personnel of their own vocational field and management of Omnia and between project services and international team. With this interaction we try to ensure common interests and lines in different project, development and mobility activities. Good practices will be described in Omnia\u2019s pedagogical program and will be presented in the pedagogical group\u2019s meetings. In Omnia\u2019s result card the aims of student and expert mobilities will be described and these aims would be followed and controlled regularly in Omnia\u2019s management group and on the level of administration.

Often, the decision whether or not to offer, or fully engage in modern languages in environments such as ours, appears to relate to adult expectations of the children's capabilities and to staffing resources and confidence rather than to the ability of the children to benefit.  However, our teachers believe learning other languages, by revisiting the basics of language, gives the children the opportunity to revisit concepts which, particularly with our children, may have been missed or poorly understood and, rather than interfering with language development, stimulates its development and an impact can be detected right across the curriculum. The opportunity to practice basic skills in another language makes them seem more adult and sophisticated and, therefore, more acceptable to our children, who may otherwise resent being made to work on what is often seen as infant material; one of the reasons our staff are so passionate about developing their own skills in this area.  Most of our local mainstream schools are already well underway in their exciting journey in implementing effective language programmes in schools.  At Harmeny, we feel that we have a great need to develop our knowledge and skills so that we too can embark on our exciting journey in taking forward the promotion and implementation of Spanish fully in August 2017 in line with our School Improvement Plan.\r\n\r\nHaving met regularly, we have identified that the participants mentioned in this application all have very different experiences/levels of Spanish.  We are all in agreement that by visiting Spain and being fully immersed in a Spanish programme of study and by experiencing the culture first-hand that this would be the most invaluable and memorable way of inspiring our learners back in the classroom.  Furthermore, we believe that we will all be able to share our experiences with the rest of our colleagues at Harmeny in order, not only to motivate them, but also to instill a real enthusiasm for learning Spanish across all areas of the organisation.\r\n\r\nBruner advocates that the most effective way to learn is through active discovery and, as we all support Bruner's theory, we believe that this immersion programme not only embraces the key principles of Curriculum for Excellence, therefore, being given this opportunity as lifelong learners ourselves giving us the opportunity to fully embrace the 1+2 approach in line with Government policy, but will also serve to ensure that the Spanish learning programme we will create and deliver will reflect the seven principles of curriculum design.  Moreover, when teachers themselves receive positive, relevant and meaningful learning experiences, the motivation and knowledge gained from this, greatly helps create engaging experiences and opportunities for our learners.\r\n\r\nThis course encompasses learning Spanish with native speakers, developing a greater cultural awareness and discovering new ways of teaching languages through a variety of media.  It offers invaluable training in the teaching of foreign languages to young learners through observing and participating in modelled activities.  A real incentive of attending this course is the facility to network with other professionals from across Scotland and Spain with whom we can share resources and good practice.  We were also delighted to discover that on completion of this project we will receive a pen-drive containing many tried and tested resources and activities. By having a bank of resources, which can be adapted to suit the interests and needs of all our learners at all levels, this enables teachers to plan exciting lessons to engage all our children in language learning.

This is in part due to change of staff and accompanying skills sets as well as a big focus on raising attainment in literacy and maths and numeracy across the City of Edinburgh Council.  As a staff team we agreed that going forward we really needed to engage more with a creative approach to learning and teaching and that Modern Languages should be a key part of this.  We decided that the aim of our project would be to develop global citizenship for all learners with the key foci of engaging with Modern Languages and Learning for Sustainability.

This will require building new infrastructure to accommodate nearly the equivalent of the current population of the EU in a matter of a few decades. Cities in the 21st century will account for nearly 90% of global population growth, 80% of wealth creation, and 60% of total energy consumption. It is a global imperative to develop systems that improve the livability of cities while dramatically reducing resource consumption. This proposed EMJMD  focus on understanding the complexities of cities and communities through the use of four of the most important factors in the sustainability of a city such as are the energy, transport, buildings and ICT. This unique combination is expected to bring solutions for high-density cities with the design of these systems being resilient, scalable, and reconfigurable. Today, academic research and industrial applications in the area of Smart Cities and communities seek to optimize existing city infrastructure, networks, and urban behavior through the deployment and utilization of different approaches. Cities and communities that employ optimization techniques have reported improvements in energy efficiency, water use, public safety, road congestion, and many other areas. However, optimization has its limits. Research and investments in new urban systems are fundamentally critical because optimization will have little effect for rapidly urbanizing cities which experience around the clock congestion.

The partner network of Omnia has enlarged by adding Austria and Latvia and new project countries during the last project period. Now our intention is to include even Portugal and Lithuania in this KA1-project. This because we at Omnia, also according to our international strategy, want to offer opportunity for international experiences (mainly in the form of on-the-job learning periods abroad) for possibly many students and from all Omnia vocational fields. In Lithuania we would have two new co-operation fields: logistics and property maintenance and that's why this new partner and country interests us. In Portugal the fields would be hotel, restaurant and travelling and in those fields we have had lack of placements and partners in relation to our applicants from those fields. From the security field Omnia has not either yet had any international activities, because we have now educated this field only for one year at Omnia, but we would find out if any of our existing partners also educates  this field and our objective is to start international co-operation also in this field during this new project period. \r\n\r\nFrom the last projects countries Slovakia will be excluded, because students have not applied there and co-operation was not implemented with the country last year either. Omnia's biggest partners are vocational institutes in Europe, but also a few Chambers of Crafts in Germany are included in this project and they also act as our reciprocal partners, which means that Omnia does not only send students to Germany via them but also receives students from them to practice in Finland in many different fields.\r\n\r\nOmnia has plenty of direct company co-operation in Europe, but because most of co-operation companies abroad act without pic-codes, they are not included in this application. Our intention is to include them later as receiving organizations when implementing the project. \r\n\r\nOmnia's one strategical objective is to offer internationalization opportunities for the whole staff, not only for teachers. That's why Omnia offers possibility to apply expert grants also for administrative personnel, guidance counselors, college nurses, curators, Omnia youth workshop personnel and staff of college canteen personnel. One project objective would also be to use a few of expert grants to reinforce co-operation between Omnia and local Finnish companies, who regularly receive foreign students via Omnia to practice at them. Reinforcing would happen by offering the key persons of those companies an opportunity to make an international mobility period of one week by themselves. \r\n\r\nInternationalization is already built in Omnia Curriculum in the form of one new learning unit called: To be a professional internationally.\r\nStudents can carry out this learning unit by doing an on-the-job training period abroad but also by doing their practicing period at some international company in Finland in case the company language is English.\r\n\r\nMost of the applied grants are single grants, which we coordinate one by one but also try to form pairs or small groups of students to each target country. In this application we apply many group mobilities: for instance a 10 student group in the field of AV-communication to Germany for 12 days, 5 students from social- and health care to Ireland for a month, 5 -student -group in the field of joinery to Estonia for 2 weeks (because our partner has a better CNC-machine than Omnia) and 8 student group from the fields of electricity, plumbing, joinery and house building to the Netherlands for three weeks. We apply grants for accompanying persons to travel with groups, because students in these fields are young and would not dare travel without a safe adult.\r\n\r\nInternational project work, including international mobility periods, will be handled both in the applying phase and during the actual working period of each project, in Omnia's pedagogical development team.

The members of pedagogical development team are working as contact persons between the students and personnel of their own vocational field and management of Omnia and between National project services and International team. With this interaction we try to ensure common interests and lines in different project, development and mobility activities. Good practices will be described in Omnia's pedagogical program and presented in the pedagogical group's meetings. In Omnia's result card numbers of student and expert mobilities will be described and these numbers would be followed and controlled regularly in Omnia's management group and on the level of administration. \r\n\r\nThe number of applied grants is based on numbers of mobilities carried out during the school year 2016 -2017 and on the plans done for next project year.", "http://www.theplacementfactory.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA116-034404_2"], ["1DJ", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "EDINBURGH NAPIER UNIVERSITY", 352527.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.napier.ac.uk", "EDINBURGH NAPIER UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-046758_coordinator"], ["4AS", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "HERIOT-WATT UNIVERSITY", 623391.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.hw.ac.uk", "HERIOT-WATT UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-046924_coordinator"], ["4AS", "Starfsumhverfi og n\u00e1m \u00ed Evr\u00f3pu", "HERIOT-WATT UNIVERSITY", 146372.0, "The Reykjavik School of Visual Arts (RSVA) has made a Memorandum of Understanding with the Einar Granum Kunstfagskole in Oslo for teachers\u00b4 exchange over a two year period. This is the first time RSVA applies for gueast teachers from abroad to come and teach at the school. \r\nNine teachers go on staff training. One teacher goes to Wagner & Apel Porzellan in Germany. Seven teachers are taking students from the diploma departments to two weeks long mobilities. Head of the Illustration Department will visit Cambridge School of Art for a job shadowing. \r\nThree students gratuating in spring from the Textile Department are doing traineeship in companies (Erasmus PRO). Their goal is to experience further specialization in the area of textile design/art, printing, pattern making, dyeing and the running of companies. With this work experience the students will get a greater understanding of various specializations, an understanding of professional practices and the experience of working abroad. They will gain new knowledge which they will bring back and strengthen their job opportunities and will be able to share their experiences with others. Head of the Textile Department will go on an advance planning visit to one of the host partner. \r\nShort term mobility of VET learners are four. Students in their second semester in the diploma program and teachers will visit their partner institutions, schools, companies and exhibitions.\r\nThe Fine Art Department travels to Holland. Stichting 57 Poort, the partner institution, provides studios for practising artists in Amsterdam who work in various fields of art: graphic arts, painting and scultpture. The students will be able to interact and in some cases assist these artists and by doing so will learn about different art techniques and practices.\r\nThe Illustration Department visits it\u00b4s partner institution, the University of Cumbria. The  aim of the visit is to get an insight into the education structure of Fine Art, Games Design, Illustration and Graphic Design. Students have the possibility to apply for the final year of a BA at the University after finishing their diploma courses. The aim of the visit is also to maintain a relationship between these schools. Visits will also be made to few other universities in England as well as museums and exhibitions. \r\nThe Ceramics Department visits it\u00b4s partner institution, UCA Farnham. Other schools, various ceramics manufacturing companies, workshops and research institutions as well as museums will be visited. One of the aims of this project is to give students the opportunity to learn more about materials, production processes and possibilities, educational routes and cultural emphasis in the study of ceramics. \r\nThe Textile Department\u00b4s aim is to expose the students to a varied view of textile production, research, study possibilities and various musuems. To be able to get a complete picture, the students travel to two countries UK and Holland. Holland is known for its very avant-garde designs and high-tech production. In UK, museums and textile producers are visited as well as the department\u2018s partner school, the Heriot-Watt University, The School of Textiles and Design.\r\nThe teachers who are participating will prepare the students culturally and professionally for the trip. The experiences and project work accumulated during the trip will be used to further enhance the students\u2018 education when they return as well as being a basis for an exhibition for the whole school. The trip is planned as part of the students\u2018 curriculum and will award each student 5-6 ECTS credits.\r\nRSVA ecourages all its teachers and students to increase their knowledge and experience by doing work experience, staff training and by visiting other institutions as guest teachers. It is of great importance that they are given the opportunity to be aware of what is happening within their disciplines in Europe, to strengthen their connections with others in Europe and to grow and be inspired within their work and studies. Teachers and students can apply every year in December for the possibility to take part in a mobility activity. The quality of the applications is carefully scrutinized and successful applicants chosen. During the project all successful applicants keep journals which are a combination of text and visuals: illustrations, photographs and even films. On their return a detailed report is submitted  in which the project is described and what was learned discussed. That  knowledge and experience is then further shared with the school. So as not to be isolated in such a small community and small country, it is vitally important for continual interaction not only within the school but also with students and teachers in other countries. It is important that the participants in these projects impart their experiences and the knowledge they gain not only with their colleagues but also outside the school in the form of lectures and conferences.", "http://www.hw.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IS01-KA116-038729_1"], ["7EP", "2015-1-FI01-KA109-009212", "The Placement Factory", 96041.0, "In the new strategy (2018-2022) of SAMIedu Vocational College emphasis is laid on international relations and especially on the skills of the staff and students to work in international environment. This strategy goal will be achieved with own resources of the College and supported by Erasmus+ Mobility project, international project of European Comission as well as by education export project financed by ESR.\r\nErasmus+ mobility periods are regarded as a practical tool for internationalizing the college, working against racism and improving the language skills and life coping skills. These are especially important in our small town, Savonlinna, where there are not many possibilities to meet foreigners and practice language skills in natural situations in winter. In summers the town is an international tourist attraction. Hopefully some of the students stay in this region to improve the international knowledge of the companies. However, most of the students end up in bigger cities, where the international relations are part of everyday life and international know-how is a requirement for employment.\r\nIn SAMIedu we constantly work for equality. In addition to the principle to divide the mobility grants among all fields of vocational education evenly we want to offer exchange periods to students, who haven\u2019t had any previous possibility to travel. Students who get income support are also supported with a 350\u20ac grant of our college. Also students studying in preparatory education are sent with their teacher to a familiarization period abroad. In this project we intend to send more male students by laing more emphasis on marketing and using efficiently the new network partnerships, which have been gained through our previous logistics, forestry, metal and vehicle technology projects. Several foreign student groups of these fields will work in the workshops of SAMIedu college in the school year 2018-2019. We\u2019ll also send students studying competence-based vocational qualifications to exchange periods, e.g. datanomes, masseurs and restaurant cooks. These students are mainy adults with families, that\u2019s why we offer them also short exchange periods of 32 days.\r\n\r\nFurther we are starting co-operation with the apprentices of Savonlinna Works Company. They can get acquainted with the tasks of an assembler in the factories of the partnership network in Europe for 2 months. This co-operation has been planned on the need of the company.\r\nIn this project a large variety of digital equipment is used. Students will report their experiences in the blog www.moprosamiedu.blogsport.fi and they will be mentored in WhatsApp by teachers. In this project we\u2019ll further put effort into developing the coaching and the students will collect video material for marketing of exchange periods and our college. From this material we\u2019ll make augmented reality using Thinglink and 360' cameras. OLS language tests and courses are partly carried out as contact coaching.\r\nWe\u2019re going to use more effectively the coaching material made in previous projects like the language and culture coaching of European Pathway Project.

Part of the internalization strategy objectives are also carried out in Erasmus + KA2- development projects, in which Omnia is developing for instance new pedagogigal practises and high-quality education for immigrant students.\r\nDuring the present project period Omnia's partner network has expanded with a few target areas: Lithuania, Croatia, Portugal, Malta and Mallorca. Our aim is to start reciprocal student mobility co-operation with our new Lithuanian partner in the field of property maintenance, because Omnia has educated this field already for years, but there has not been international co-operationin this field in the past years at all in Omnia. We also aim to send some students in the next project period to Portugal, because during this project period only staff members have visited from Omnia there. We send mostly students from the fields of business and administration, audiovisual communication and technical fields to Malta and Mallorca.\r\n\r\nIn the becoming project period Omnia's co-operation partners' network would be expanded with ten new partners, which are located partially both in new target countries and partially in excisting partner countries. Omnia is for instance starting co-operation in metal field with a new German partner college, security field co-operation with a new Danish college and  going on IT-field co-operation with a new Irish language school after this spring's piloting mobilities there. We also sent first students to Malta and Mallorca via our new partner institutions this year and are looking forward to hear students' experiences in these new areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are exclunding Hungary from our present partner countries in this project, because in two years no student or staff member has applied there. Omnia's biggest partners will continue co-operating with Omnia: they are European multi-field co-operation colleges, with whom we make reciprocal co-operation. Omnian has most of its partner organisations and colleges in Germany. In this application there are ten German institutes. Co-operation with them is well-working and flexible and Omnia's students and experts  consider the country interesting. That is the reason for a big number of applied grants to Germany in this application. We apply also grants for two ten-student-groups to Germany and this fact adds also the number of applied mobilities to Germany.\r\n\r\nOmnia is also co-operating to some scale directly with smaller European companies. Some vocational fields (social and health care) have most of their partners without PIC. We will add these partners during the project period in the Mobility Tool-platform. \r\n\r\nIn this application Omnia applies also 8 grants for long;  5-6 months mobilites for audiovisual communication, tourism, hotel and restaurant field and business and administration fields students. Omnia took part in piloting long mobilities in a project called European Pathway, a Gateway to work and got very good experiences of them. There were no difficulties of recruiting students for these mobilities and we believe that also in future there would be suitable applicants for them.", "http://www.theplacementfactory.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FI01-KA116-046821_26"], ["7EP", "2016-1-FI01-KA109-022865", "The Placement Factory", 80567.0, "In the strategy of Kainuu Vocational College internationalization is regarded as an important part of the development work in the college.  The student mobility has the key role in the international actions of the college. Student mobilities are target-oriented and they are based on curricula. The aim for the staff is that that staff members are able to work in multi-cultural and international environment and they actively develop international affairs in their own career and teaching.   \r\nThe main objective of this project is to offer students and teachers possibilities to have an on the job learning, working or studying periods abroad.  Also through this project we want to improve the quality of the mobility process. Other aims are:\r\n- to activate language skills of the participants\r\n- to improve the knowledge of  culture and working life in foreign countries\r\n- to improve social skills and group working skills in multi-cultural environment\r\n- to improve professional skills and make them more versatile \r\n\r\nThe participants are 62 students and ten teachers or representatives of working life. They represent all sectors and units of the school.  The participation in the project is open for all students in youth and adult education. All participants have enough professional skills and courage to participate.  Also all teachers are able to apply to participate in mobilities. \r\nThe mobilities will be implemented according to instructions of the school. The coordinator is responsible for administration tasks. The supervising teacher will contact the receiving partner and they agree on all practical matters during the mobility. The participants will acquire European Health Insurance Card. The school has insurances for participants.  The learning outcomes will be assessed, validated and recognized.

A second general feature is that the teachers' mobilities are getting shorter, e.g. due to the fact that students are no longer as a whole group in on-the-job-learning in companies - this used to be a good moment for the teacher to go on mobility.  Now teaching staff has fuller schedules, and difficulties to find a good moment to go. Both these trends have been taken into account in the lenght of applied mobilities.\r\n\r\nKeuda's international strategy focuses, when it comes to mobility of students and staff, on re-inforcing co-operation with school partners. This focus has been identified especially to allow pedagogical and personal development of staff members. It means in practise that staff members spend some time in the schools observing and participating, take students to the companies and workplaces, observe and guide them, work themselves alongside students, learn about possibilities to obtain learning outcomes in the country and company in question, and get to know the curricula of the partner school, as well as teaching methods and pedagogical thinking behind. All this will first of all improve the staff member's know-how on possibilities and impact of international mobility, it improves them acting as an marketing agent inside Keuda to atract new students to mobility, and of course it will also enhance new thinking to their own teaching and co-operation with working life.\r\n\r\nAnother target for Keuda is to develop skills demonstrations abroad. In some of the sectors this already takes place, however, Keuda needs to make internal benchmarking to collect existing practices and know-how of our staff members, and to build on that.\r\n\r\nThird aim is to keep working on developing international activities also for the key working life partners. In other words, to develop an internal service model for planning, offering and carrying out of \"Working life - Keuda's staff -teams\" mobility periods. The win-win -ideology is to give our key workinglife partner's the change to participate in a wellplanned, thematic, targeted 2-3-day-visit to a country/region/sector/partner they have interest in, and to team them with Keuda's staff member to allow the working life co-operation to develop, and shared ideas for development fo flow during the visit.\r\n\r\nFourth aim is to continue to develop Keuda's practices in organizing mobility. Keuda and VET in Finland are constantly changing, as the big VET reform is changing the ways of providing training in Finland. There is a never-ending need to improve internal information flow, internal tools and marketing, in order to grow in and with international activities.", "http://www.theplacementfactory.co.uk", null,
