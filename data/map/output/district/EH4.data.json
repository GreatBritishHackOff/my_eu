Wind energy is the cheapest and technologically most straightforward way to generate the majority of this energy. As a result for this the amount of wind energy installed in the EU is predicted to increase from its current level of 56,000 MW to 300,000 MW by 2030, equating to the installation of over 80,000 wind turbines. Due to the very large radar cross section of the turbines and the motion of the rotating blades, these turbines have a detrimental effect on civilian radar navigations systems and there is growing concern about the potential problems which wind turbines may have on passenger safety. Due to space limitations, wind turbines are increasingly being located in areas close to the main shipping lanes and aviation flight paths and wind farm planning applications are increasingly being rejected. As a result of the radar interference issues, wind energy companies are desperately looking for a solution. Although both electronic radar solutions and the use of Radar Absorbing Materials (RAMs) coated onto the turbines have been considered, no cost-effective solution has as yet been produced. Current RAMs are far too expensive and their performance is not sufficient for wind turbine applications. The proposed \u2018OSGRAM\u2019 project will develop an innovative continuous process for the production of intrinsically conductive polymers (ICPs) whose radar absorbing properties can be accurately tailored. The ICPs will be used to produce a multilayer RAM that can achieve radar attenuation of 20dB  in the S- and X-bands and which can be applied to wind turbine towers, nacelles and blades with a weight of <4kg/sq.m and a cost of 125(Euros)/sq.m.

The key to achieving related goals was in the development of a continuous polymerisation process (continuous oscillating baffled reactor (COBR) technology) never before achieved with polyaniline. Enhanced control of polymerisation enabled scientists to tailor its properties for radar absorption at frequencies used by air traffic control and marine navigation. Preliminary tests demonstrate promising microwave absorption and attenuation in the frequency bands of interest. The innovative RAMs can be utilised in the tower, nacelle (housing the gearbox, generator, drive train, etc.) and the blades themselves.\n\nOSGRAM technology is poised to help wind farm stakeholders gain approval for their installation applications, increasingly near main shipping lanes and flight paths due to space limitations.

Our mission is to ensure that every student achieves their potential through the pursuit of academic excellence and the nurturing of their gifts and talents. As our school was founded by the Ursulines, we aim at creating a caring Catholic community which allows everyone to develop and share Christian values that are especially important in our changing modern world. Our school motto Belief, education and quality represents this universal approach. As less nuns of our school-based nunnery play an active part in school life, it\u2019s on our teachers to focus on a valued-based education.

It is home to specialist academies in music, dance and football, where pupils are awarded places on talent, not ability to pay. Nearly a third of pupils come from privileged backgrounds, while 50 percent of first to fourth year pupils live in what are considered some of Scotland's most socially deprived zones. The school is committed to the development of an international mind set. We encourage young people to view Europe as a multi-cultural, multi-lingual community and prepare them to take part in the economic and social development of Europe, helping them to become aware of the resulting opportunities and challenges. A crucial element of this is encouraging interest in and improving competence in European languages. The Scottish Government has introduced a key national priority to raise attainment in literacy and improve employability skills through learning two foreign languages. In order to strengthen provision to our pupils, we aim to address training needs such as developing staff competences, improving foreign language skills, and increasing knowledge of social, linguistic and cultural matters by accessing quality professional development through structured training abroad, specifically language immersion courses. \r\n\r\nWe are applying for funding to send nine staff to structured training courses in France, Spain, Germany and Italy to attend courses designed to improve confidence and competence in the target language, improve knowledge and understanding of the culture and develop teaching techniques.

Individuals will participate in full-immersion, modern language training courses in France, Spain, Germany and Italy during our school holidays. This will be a long term project running from September 2017 through to the end of August 2019, with most staff attending courses during Easter, Summer and Autumn 2018 and Easter and Summer 2019. Intended destinations are Dusseldorf, Germany; Palma de Mallorca, Spain; Milan, Rome, Bergamo or Salerno, Italy.The main expected impact on participants is that they will experience high quality professional development which will improve their confidence and competence in the target language, as well as an improvement in their transversal skills such as openness to and curiosity about new challenges, problem-solving and decision-making skills, confidence, and tolerance towards other personal values and behaviours. We are anticipating, as research has demonstrated, that there will be a similarly positive effect on pupils. For instance, a 2012 EU study on the impact of partnerships between schools in different countries found that pupils - particularly at secondary level - significantly improved their skills, including cultural and social skills, IT and foreign languages.  (http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-1352_en.htm). From our own 2015 Erasmus experience, we can say with confidence that there is a positive impact on the whole school as staff form new working relationships with colleagues from other departments and across the hierarchy of the school structure. In addition pre-application training has brought together groups of staff from schools throughout Edinburgh, along with local authority advisers and representatives of the British Council: thereby contributing to new lines of communication among the wider school and local government network.\r\n\r\nBroughton High School shares the Erasmus+ programme objectives to work towards equity, prosperity and social inclusion.

Tolerance and a willingness to learn about other cultures have been at the heart of Scottish education for centuries. By embracing the Scottish tradition and developing through a curriculum for excellence, and extending our European dimension, we support our pupils to develop as truly global citizens.

The \u201cGroupe Pilotage Qualit\u00e9\u201d is in charge of developing the project, of insuring the follow-up, the management and the evaluation of the project. The latter also has to check the financial balance and controls that the various actors meet their commitments. The sending organizations will respect the terms of the mobility program of the consortium. They are in charge of the evaluation of the participants. All French and Europeans partners have an experience in placements since most of them have already used Mobility programs. So, each people know one\u2019s mission and it will done seriously. \r\n\r\nThe young people will be more efficient on the job market, they will enrich their professional, cultural and linguistic skills, they will see Europe differently, they will improve their skills in ICT, they will be more autonomous.
