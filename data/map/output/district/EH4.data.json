Wind energy is the cheapest and technologically most straightforward way to generate the majority of this energy. As a result for this the amount of wind energy installed in the EU is predicted to increase from its current level of 56,000 MW to 300,000 MW by 2030, equating to the installation of over 80,000 wind turbines. Due to the very large radar cross section of the turbines and the motion of the rotating blades, these turbines have a detrimental effect on civilian radar navigations systems and there is growing concern about the potential problems which wind turbines may have on passenger safety. Due to space limitations, wind turbines are increasingly being located in areas close to the main shipping lanes and aviation flight paths and wind farm planning applications are increasingly being rejected. As a result of the radar interference issues, wind energy companies are desperately looking for a solution. Although both electronic radar solutions and the use of Radar Absorbing Materials (RAMs) coated onto the turbines have been considered, no cost-effective solution has as yet been produced. Current RAMs are far too expensive and their performance is not sufficient for wind turbine applications. The proposed \u2018OSGRAM\u2019 project will develop an innovative continuous process for the production of intrinsically conductive polymers (ICPs) whose radar absorbing properties can be accurately tailored. The ICPs will be used to produce a multilayer RAM that can achieve radar attenuation of 20dB  in the S- and X-bands and which can be applied to wind turbine towers, nacelles and blades with a weight of <4kg/sq.m and a cost of 125(Euros)/sq.m.  This will allow our SME consortium to develop world-leading RAMs, giving us global market leadership and leading to sales in excess of 80 million Euros 5 years after the project ends and increase profits across the consortium.", 279392.0, 1059925.0, "OSGRAM", "Decreasing wind turbine interference with traffic control radars", "Wind turbines have come under scrutiny lately for their interference with civilian radar, thus impeding their installation.

Wind turbine installations are increasingly contributing to energy supply in the EU. However, the large size of the turbine blades and their rotational motion has a detrimental effect on civilian radar, raising concerns about the safety of aircraft and marine navigation in the neighbourhoods of onshore and offshore wind farms.\n\nThe EU-funded project http://www.osgram.eu (OSGRAM) developed a novel radar-absorbing material (RAM) that is more cost effective and better performing than current RAMs. To achieve this, scientists exploited an intrinsically conductive polymer (ICP), polyaniline. The key to achieving related goals was in the development of a continuous polymerisation process (continuous oscillating baffled reactor (COBR) technology) never before achieved with polyaniline. Enhanced control of polymerisation enabled scientists to tailor its properties for radar absorption at frequencies used by air traffic control and marine navigation. Preliminary tests demonstrate promising microwave absorption and attenuation in the frequency bands of interest. The innovative RAMs can be utilised in the tower, nacelle (housing the gearbox, generator, drive train, etc.) and the blades themselves.\n\nOSGRAM technology is poised to help wind farm stakeholders gain approval for their installation applications, increasingly near main shipping lanes and flight paths due to space limitations.

Re-framing environmental resource use has led to the emergence of the concepts of ecosystem services (ES) and natural capital (NC). This discourse indicates not only a change in our understanding of planetary functions at the ecosystem scale, but also a fundamental shift in how we perceive the relationship between people and the ecosystems on which they depend. OPERAs (OPERATIONAL POTENTIAL OF ECOSYSTEMS RESEARCH APPLICATIONS) aims to improve understanding of how ES/NC contribute to human well-being in different social-ecological systems in inland and coastal zones, in rural and urban areas, related to different ecosystems including forests and fresh water resources. The OPERAs research will establish whether, how and under what conditions the ES/NC concepts can move beyond the academic domain towards practical implementation in support of sustainable ecosystem management. OPERAs will use a meta-analysis (systematic review) of existing ES/NC practice to identify knowledge gaps and requirements for new policy options and instruments. New insights, and improved or novel tools and instruments, will be tested in practice in exemplar case studies in a range of socio-ecological systems across locales, sectors, scales and time.

The first exhibition organised in collaboration will be dedicated to the self-portrait. Not only is the self-portrait a very attractive type of picture, revealing a lot of information about the artist, his self-esteem, and his historical and social environment. Showing oneself is nowadays more up-to-date than ever: The \"selfie\", made possible through the massive use of smartphones worlwide, has become one of the greatest phenomenas of the digital age. During the 15th century, the epoch making ideas of humanism created the conditions for venturing to draw or paint oneself,  producing a new consciousness of ones own value and importance. This phenomenon is to the core a very European one and required a certain freedom of the individual to be able to question his identity.  After all, it was this new individual identity which over the centuries paved the way for enlightment and human rights. Selfies however seem to be the contrary:  Produced as acts of self-assurance, they vanish in global clouds, resesemble each other, and almost seem to deny individuality, dissolving the individual in the mass. \"I am here. European Faces\" is the title of an exhibition combining ca. 100 self-portraits (paintings and works on paper) from the distinguished collections of three old-established European museums and shown successively in Karlsruhe, Lyon and Edinburgh. From the 16th century onwards, it will represent the development of artistic self assurance in Europe, ending with a newly developed machine for selfies of the visitors, digitally composed of innumerable self-portraits of previous guests and projected alternating inside the exhibition.

In order to widen their chances to be exploited/released  outside of their territory of production, the EoF distribution system combines classical distribution functioning and innovative models/circuits based on direct cooperation with distributors, cinemas and VoD platforms.

It gathers 132 partners from which 56% are European and 44% non-European, including 52 festivals, 66 distributors, 5 sales agents and 10 VoD platforms.Within the framework of partnerships with festivals and cinemas, EoF titles are proposed under specific EoF sections, under special EoF programmes or seasons dedicated to European films. Peripheral events are also organized in addition to screenings with a promotional and educational purpose such as meetings with talents (masterclasses, Q&As, workshops). In order to guarantee a commercial exploitation to EoF films, some of them are simultaneously available on VoD platforms partners when they are screened as part of EoF theatrical/festival events. To optimize EoF titles' promotion and accessibility, EoF focuses on digital technology by making them available on platforms partners, by organizing online events (free sneak previews, day-and-date releases...) and by communicating thanks to digital tools about the films/directors, about EoF events/partnerships and about the titles' availability in theatres/online. As mentioned above, these activities have the common objective to promote European films on a global scale in order to reach a wide audience. This promotional mission also involves innovative communication/marketing campaigns and actions based on event driven strategies and an extensive use of digital tools/media. Proposing EoF titles online thus widens the accessibility of the films while multiplying the chances to attract, make grow or maintain the interest of young audiences in European first feature films.Furthermore, EoF dedicates an important part of its activity to the career of EoF titles in festivals.
