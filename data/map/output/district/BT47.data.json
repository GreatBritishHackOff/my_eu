Despite Europe\u2019s global market share, the pressures experienced by the SME European media advertising sector are considerable, particularly for those marketing paper billboards using toxic ink and glue waste. These pressures, including international competition, industry consolidation and increasing incorporation of costly digital signage technologies into the advertising industry, are important factors impacting SMEs, given their limited access to investment capital. Consortium SMEs have therefore identified a clear need for an outdoor media technology that can replace paper billboards, is affordable, as equally market-effective as digital advertising and that can generate consumer appeal. However, consortium members lack investment capital and expertise to guide them in the development of such a technology, constituting this a significant threat to their competitiveness within the industry. To meet such competition, the proposed ECOBOARD solution will create a pixel-based advertising board capable of displaying static images in near real-time with relatively low initial and operational costs. ECOBOARD will use existing innovative technology combined with creativity and precision engineering to produce a new eco-friendly advertising tool that does not harm the environment. The commercial objective of this ECOBOARD is the development of a state of the art advertising outdoor media tool which provides an affordable alternative to paper billboards, and that can increase the competitive advantage of consortium SMEs in light of increasing sector dominance by large enterprises, thereby opening up new markets both within Europe and worldwide.", 158482.0, 1157783.0, "ECOBOARD", "Reducing billboard advertising waste", "Giant posters and billboards are a major advertising tool globally mainly operated by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A new technology offers economic and environmental advantages.", "In Europe alone there are between 2 and 8\u00a0million billboards displayed at any given time and this number is constantly growing. Every 2 weeks, over 6\u00a0million square metres of poster paper are thrown out. The paper is not recycled, the ink is not eco-friendly, and the glue used is toxic. Due to this, billboard advertising has a disastrous effect on the environment, and this issue needs to be addressed.\n\nThe EU-funded http://ecoboard.mfkk.hu/u/prjindex.php (ECOBOARD) project has produced a cost-effective and environmentally friendly real-time outdoor media tool. It is able to produce the same visual effect as a paper-based billboard, but without the use of polluting paper, ink and glue. Furthermore, the proposed system can boost the competitiveness of the advertising industry for SMEs by reducing the time and the cost of advert implementation as there is no need to print.\n\nThe first steps in the research involved evaluating and selecting rolling-foil materials to display colours, then designing and integrating these into 8*8\u00a0mm pixels. These were then arranged in modules \u2014 for example, 30*30\u00a0pixels \u2014 that could be combined to produce a pixellated, paperless billboard. Each module contains a movable motor to switch pixel foil colours individually.\n\nThe final step was the integration of all the components, including the housing. For a half-metre\u2013square billboard, some 100\u00a0000 individual components were needed. As part of the dissemination activities, a portable mini-board called ECODRIVE was developed to demonstrate the technology. The project also demonstrated computer control of the pixels via an Iinternet connection.\n\nECOBOARD SME partners are investigating the exploitation potential of this new technology, including production, marketing and distribution. When implemented, it will contribute substantially to reducing the pollution and landfill arising from billboard advertising.", "http://www.eco-board.eu", "http://www.maydown.com", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58285.jpg", "fp7_94522_998269002"], ["2AB", "Advancing understanding of Atlantic Salmon at Sea: Merging Genetics and Ecology to resolve Stock-specific Migration and Distribution patterns", "Loughs Agency (Fcilc)", "Over the past two decades, an increasing proportion of North Atlantic salmon are dying at sea during their oceanic feeding migration. The specific reasons for the decline in this important species are as yet unknown, however, climate change is likely to be an important factor. In some rivers in the southern part of the salmons range, wild salmon now face extinction. This is in spite of unprecedented management measures to halt this decline. Arguably the greatest challenge in salmon conservation is to gain insight into the spatial and ecological use of the marine environment by different regional and river stocks, which are known to show variation in marine growth, condition, and survival. Salmon populations may migrate to different marine zones, whose environmental conditions may vary. To date it has been impossible to sample and identify the origin of sufficient numbers of wild salmon at sea to enable this vital question to be addressed. SALSEA-Merge will provide the basis for advancing our understanding of oceanic-scale, ecological and ecosystem processes. Such knowledge is fundamental to the future sustainable management of this key marine species. Through a partnership of 9 European nations the programme will deliver innovation in the areas of: genetic stock identification techniques, new genetic marker development, fine scale estimates of growth on a weekly and monthly basis, the use of novel high seas pelagic trawling technology and individual stock linked estimates of food and feeding patterns. In addition, the use of the three-dimensional Regional Ocean Modelling System, merging hydrography, oceanographic, genetic and ecological data, will deliver novel stock specific migration and distribution models. This widely supported project, provides the basis for a comprehensive investigation into the problems facing salmon at sea. It will also act as an important model for understanding the factors affecting survival of many other important marine species.", null, 4833604.0, "SALSEA-MERGE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.loughs-agency.org", null, "fp7_87925_998794451"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT47"}
