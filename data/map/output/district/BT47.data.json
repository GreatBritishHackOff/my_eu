Despite Europe\u2019s global market share, the pressures experienced by the SME European media advertising sector are considerable, particularly for those marketing paper billboards using toxic ink and glue waste. These pressures, including international competition, industry consolidation and increasing incorporation of costly digital signage technologies into the advertising industry, are important factors impacting SMEs, given their limited access to investment capital. Consortium SMEs have therefore identified a clear need for an outdoor media technology that can replace paper billboards, is affordable, as equally market-effective as digital advertising and that can generate consumer appeal. However, consortium members lack investment capital and expertise to guide them in the development of such a technology, constituting this a significant threat to their competitiveness within the industry. To meet such competition, the proposed ECOBOARD solution will create a pixel-based advertising board capable of displaying static images in near real-time with relatively low initial and operational costs. ECOBOARD will use existing innovative technology combined with creativity and precision engineering to produce a new eco-friendly advertising tool that does not harm the environment. The commercial objective of this ECOBOARD is the development of a state of the art advertising outdoor media tool which provides an affordable alternative to paper billboards, and that can increase the competitive advantage of consortium SMEs in light of increasing sector dominance by large enterprises, thereby opening up new markets both within Europe and worldwide.", 158482.0, 1157783.0, "ECOBOARD", "Reducing billboard advertising waste", "Giant posters and billboards are a major advertising tool globally mainly operated by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A new technology offers economic and environmental advantages.", "In Europe alone there are between 2 and 8\u00a0million billboards displayed at any given time and this number is constantly growing. Every 2 weeks, over 6\u00a0million square metres of poster paper are thrown out. The paper is not recycled, the ink is not eco-friendly, and the glue used is toxic. Due to this, billboard advertising has a disastrous effect on the environment, and this issue needs to be addressed.\n\nThe EU-funded http://ecoboard.mfkk.hu/u/prjindex.php (ECOBOARD) project has produced a cost-effective and environmentally friendly real-time outdoor media tool. It is able to produce the same visual effect as a paper-based billboard, but without the use of polluting paper, ink and glue. Furthermore, the proposed system can boost the competitiveness of the advertising industry for SMEs by reducing the time and the cost of advert implementation as there is no need to print.\n\nThe first steps in the research involved evaluating and selecting rolling-foil materials to display colours, then designing and integrating these into 8*8\u00a0mm pixels. These were then arranged in modules \u2014 for example, 30*30\u00a0pixels \u2014 that could be combined to produce a pixellated, paperless billboard. Each module contains a movable motor to switch pixel foil colours individually.\n\nThe final step was the integration of all the components, including the housing. For a half-metre\u2013square billboard, some 100\u00a0000 individual components were needed. As part of the dissemination activities, a portable mini-board called ECODRIVE was developed to demonstrate the technology. The project also demonstrated computer control of the pixels via an Iinternet connection.\n\nECOBOARD SME partners are investigating the exploitation potential of this new technology, including production, marketing and distribution.

The specific reasons for the decline in this important species are as yet unknown, however, climate change is likely to be an important factor. In some rivers in the southern part of the salmons range, wild salmon now face extinction. This is in spite of unprecedented management measures to halt this decline. Arguably the greatest challenge in salmon conservation is to gain insight into the spatial and ecological use of the marine environment by different regional and river stocks, which are known to show variation in marine growth, condition, and survival. Salmon populations may migrate to different marine zones, whose environmental conditions may vary. To date it has been impossible to sample and identify the origin of sufficient numbers of wild salmon at sea to enable this vital question to be addressed. SALSEA-Merge will provide the basis for advancing our understanding of oceanic-scale, ecological and ecosystem processes. Such knowledge is fundamental to the future sustainable management of this key marine species. Through a partnership of 9 European nations the programme will deliver innovation in the areas of: genetic stock identification techniques, new genetic marker development, fine scale estimates of growth on a weekly and monthly basis, the use of novel high seas pelagic trawling technology and individual stock linked estimates of food and feeding patterns. In addition, the use of the three-dimensional Regional Ocean Modelling System, merging hydrography, oceanographic, genetic and ecological data, will deliver novel stock specific migration and distribution models.

Add to this the phenomenon of widespread Italic \"genericism\" that, pushing students towards a choice of extensive and generic studies, is actually the main reason of demotivation towards studies and school drop-out.\r\n\r\nThese elements move in contrast with the needs of the labor market for technical-professional and in particular in tourism and hotel sector.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the demand for labor, in conjunction with the technological development and competitiveness of the market, requires increasingly specific skills and the same employers recognize that the preparation of the staff coming out of the training course is not always adequate.\r\n\r\nTo complete the picture, it is estimated that in the near future, at the conclusion of the current economic crisis, the demand for labor will greatly increase, with particular reference to its technical and professional fields\r\n\r\nIn this context the institutes IFOM, Varalli, Bertarelli and Besta have found the common need to compensate the mismatch between training offer and the needs of enterprises, reducing the mismatch between demand and supply of labor, reduce early school leaving and improving integration between schools and business.\r\n \r\nThe realization of this general objective goes through the achievement of the following specific objectives:\r\n\r\n- For students, to strengthen their professional skills, transversal and personal, enhancing their career prospects and their motivation, creating a sense of entrepreneurship, emancipation, European and intercultural awareness;\r\n\r\n- For the staff involved, to improve their professional and linguistic skills, to understand the practices related to the world of education and its links with the world of work, to understand the social, linguistic and cultural differences, to increase the ability to address the needs of the most disadvantaged and to strengthen the capacity to sustain their motivation to work;\r\n\r\n- For the organizations involved, to learn to operate internationally, to understand how to provide the most stimulating educational activities, to create a modern and dynamic working environment, to develop activities good for the whole civil society.\r\n \r\nFor this reason, the project \"Learning in hospitality Europe by undergoing a traineeship VET\" promotes the development of internships abroad for students of the consortium schools.\r\n\r\n The project includes two activities:\r\n1) Mobility of 92 students and 16 escorts for an internship abroad lasting one month;\r\n2) Mobility of 20 neo-graduates for an internship abroad lasting 10 weeks\r\nThe activities will take place from 01.06.2017 until 31.01.2019 and includes the selection and preparation of students, the organization of the mobilities, activities abroad, evaluations, dissemination and follow-up activities.\r\nThe consortium plans to include in mobility 8 students with special needs, in detail students with DSA or BES.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the proposed actions will be wide and will involve multiple levels of recipients in direct and indirect manner:\r\n\r\nstudents:\r\n- Competitiveness on the labor market;\r\n- Improving their social skills;\r\n- The acquisition of transversal skills (self-esteem, responsibility, ability to take tasks, ...) will also bring benefits to emancipation and

greater efficiency in learning of the students;\r\n- Sharing a common experience with the students will produce a greater understanding of their difficulties and more effective communication between teachers and students;\r\n- A better understanding of the labor market in Europe will offer more precise knowledge in supporting the education of students.\r\n\r\nSchools:\r\n- Increased ability to manage projects;\r\n- Increased understanding of the training gaps of students who are entering the world of work;\r\n- Development of ECVET as tools for the recognition and validation of students' Learning Outcomes;\r\n- Increased understanding of the tourist business processes in Europe;\r\n- Increased ability to intervene on motivation and orientation of students, particularly those with fewer opportunities;\r\n- Increased competitiveness of vocational schools, compared to other training institutions, crediting the institutions involved at the local level;\r\n- Refinement of the offer of training based on the skills and specific needs of the students, thanks to new contacts with foreign companies;\r\n- Training of students in line with market requirements;\r\n- Increased

To approach this topic we will start with exploring the meaning of the words conflict, youth movement, peace etc. and at the same time we will follow like an itinerary from social movements for democracy and justice, movements against discrimination and racism and we will explore present developments in the different European regions regions, movements born during the economical crisis in Europe and other important actors around the world and especially Europe. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, we understand integration a political dimension on youth work not only about awareness of Rights and Duties, but also a matter of Participation, Responsibility and Sense of Belonging of young people in various level from Local, National, European and Global societies.

The awareness of these is not always easy to understand by young people nowadays. Therefore, in order to tackle the issue we wish to make the following objectives:\r\n\u2022 Give to participants the tools and competences to understand what civil society is and what is its role in our own societies; \r\n\u2022 Familiarize the participants with concepts and approaches of non violent actions i.e. how to use it best and adapt it to local contexts and realities in order to promote peace building;\r\n\u2022 Equip the participants with skills to act in order to fulfill their goals;  \r\n\u2022 Empower the young people to act wisely in conflicts on individual as well as societal levels;\r\n\u2022 Review and enhance participants\u2019 competences (knowledge, skills, attitudes) in working as  multipliers, and activists on peace building using non formal education tools;\r\n\u2022 Enable participants to develop activities and campaigns for multipliers in conflict transformation and non-violent actions, at international, national or local level.\r\n\r\nThe project will include 30 youth workers/leaders from 13 programme countries for 8 days (including travel days) in Austria. Methodology of the training will be based in non formal education and its holistic approach. Participants will improve their competencies through non formal methods like brainstorming, group works, simulation, role play, open group discussion, open space for reflection and other methods that trainers will adapt based in the needs of participants. \r\n\r\nParticipants will gain new tools and ways to use non-violent communication and how to use that when integrating their youth groups and individuals into political dimension on their communities. A set of techniques, theory, mentoring support and examples will be available for the participants and showed how they can adapt and recreate that back in their own communities taking in account their own realities and needs. Participants will also have the opportunities to be more aware and to point out those issues when they will be back home and be able to decode the messages from the media and other populist campaigns.\r\n\r\nThis training is is designed to have a high level dissemination.
