Together with EFPIA partners our aims will be to set policy & guidance and deliver robust information technology tools to address the potential for the reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through mobile applications and the recognition of drug safety signals from user comments in social media and the internet. The policies, guidance and tools delivered through WEB-RADR will be underpinned by extensive academic research and user testing to ensure the project meets the needs of all stakeholders, including patients.\n\nBackground\nReporting by healthcare professionals and patients by means of mobile devices and social media platforms to National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and marketing authorisation holders with subsequent transmission to EudraVigilance is a new, unexplored concept. The amount of information generated through social media requires a structured, scientific approach for monitoring, reporting, analysing and evaluation of ADRs. Whilst there are numerous benefits of the use of social media, the impact on healthcare professionals and patients and their behaviour towards the use of medicines needs to be further analysed. WEB-RADR will address these areas.\n\nLeadership\nWEB-RADR will be managed by the MHRA\u2019s project management team that are also leading the EC Joint Action (Strengthening Collaborations for Operating Pharmacovigilance in Europe, SCOPE). This will enable the alignment and consistency of the two projects. The MHRA has extensive experience in managing successful pharmacovigilance and IT projects (E2B compliant web-forms for ADR reporting; integration with EudraVigilance; drug and medical dictionary mapping; integration with NHS electronic health records) as well as being a leading regulatory agency, helping to shape the current legislative framework.\nEstablishing clear policies and guidance for stakeholders in the use of these technologies, in line with legislative requirements, is of paramount importance to regulators and industry. The EMA will provide leadership in this area, supported by colleagues from MHRA, HALMED & LAREB. As the central regulatory agency for medicines policy in the EU it is natural for the EMA lead in this area as the outputs of WEB-RADR will have a direct bearing on future operations affecting EudraVigilance, Good Vigilance Practice (GVP) guidance, signal detection and risk communication. Expertise from a national perspective together with EFPIA input will also be essential.\n\nTechnical Platform\nThe development of technical platforms for both the reporting of ADRs via a mobile application and recognising drug safety issues from social media will be led by Epidemico who already offer a number of products through an ongoing partnership with the FDA. Working with SRDC and EFPIA sponsors, WEB-RADR will produce an online dashboard and data feed of data identifying ADRs from social media in multiple languages. A mobile app for direct reporting of ADRs to national authorities in E2B(R2) Individual Case Safety Report compatible format will be developed. To achieve this we propose to expand the prototype MedWatcher Social platform to include social media monitoring in the EU and the MedWatcher App for reporting ADRs.\n\nAnalysis\nLed by UMC and working with SRDC, WEB-RADR will ensure the technical platform for gathering drug safety data from social media delivers meaningful and useable data in the EU pharmacovigilance setting. It is essential that data collected use standardised drug, product and medical terms. Mapping of the terms to ensure compatibility with EudraVigilance and NCA databases will be carried out so that terms in the Article 57 database and MedDRA are the basis for analysis. It is essential to detect and manage duplicate reports. A major effort in WEB-RADR will be the advancement of new methodologies to meet this challenge.

There is a growing concern that the loss of therapeutic options will present us with a post-antibiotic era where present and future medical advances are negated.  Resistant bacteria dramatically reduce the possibilities of treating infections effectively, and drastically increase the risk of complications with a fatal outcome.  Antimicrobial resistance, however, is an unavoidable consequence of antibiotic use and therefore new, effective antibacterials will always be needed and once developed should be used carefully, avoiding the overuse which can drive resistance.  Despite the recognized need for new antimicrobials for clinical use, the reality is that only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to market in the last 30 years and many drug developers have left the field.  This urgency is especially true when considering resistant Gram-negative infections where carbapenem-resistance is rising and use of drugs of last resort, such as colistin, is increasing. The New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs (ND4BB) initiative is a series of programmes designed to directly address some of the scientific challenges associated with antibacterial drug discovery and development.  The ND4BB ENABLE consortium will meet the challenges ahead by creating and optimising a portfolio of new antibiotics ranging from Hits through Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe overarching goals of the ENABLE consortium are to: 1) create a drug discovery platform with the expertise and resource base to prosecute multiple antibacterial programmes in parallel; and 2) increase the overall pipeline in the antibacterial area by applying this platform to optimise a variety of antibacterial programmes.

Their aim is to examine causative risk factors for bacterial transmission and colonisation followed by effective methods to prevent or treat such contamination in poultry.\n\nSignificant milestones have been achieved by the CAMCON consortium. Several study farms with broiler chickens were set up across Europe and over 100 flocks of chickens were tested. Unfortunately, more than 50\u00a0% tested positive for Campylobacter contamination and no farm was consistently Campylobacter-free.\n\nMultilocus sequence typing (MLST) of Campylobacter jejuni in Norway, Poland and Spain is currently ongoing to assess the spread of bacterial sub-types on a geographic basis. An interesting finding is the similarity in Campylobacter MLST types found in flies and broilers. This suggests that controlling the entry of flies into broiler houses through fly screens is one means of controlling bacterial transmission. Study outcomes led to the realisation of a pilot study at two farms to assess the efficacy of fly screens. Results will be shared in the near future.\n\nProject partners also tested the effectiveness of pre-harvest interventions in preventing Campylobacter contamination using techniques such as phage therapy and vaccination. Except for in ovo vaccination of embryonated chicken eggs, no promising interventions have been found but further testing is ongoing.\n\nFor monitoring broiler flocks and detecting contamination, techniques such as air sampling, particle-size profiling and boot sock sampling were employed by CAMCON partners. A comparison of techniques revealed that air sampling is the most cost-effective method for Campylobacter detection using filters coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).\n\nCAMCON has also provided guidance on producing Campylobacter-free chickens through illustrated biosecurity folders, slide presentations and posters, as well as the design of an essential biosecurity check list. Work is ongoing to prepare suitable web-based educational programmes.\n\nSuccessful reduction in the incidence of human infections from chicken contamination with Campylobacter could also be applied to free-range birds and other animals in the future.

Hybridization is hypothesized to increase the functional diversity of adaptive radiations, potentially yielding ecological speciation. Yet, direct evidence for this is lacking. We propose to apply a large-scale, quantitative approach using experimental evolution with yeast to test this fundamental theory of quantitative genetics. Yeast is a powerful system because it permits the simulation of eukaryotic evolutionary processes while allowing easy access to information on geno- and phenotype.\nFirst, we will generate artificial radiations from hybrid and non-hybrid ancestors and expose them to diversifying selection using high-throughput phenotypic microarrays, simulating a heterogeneous fitness landscape. We will then compare the functional diversity obtained in radiations with and without hybrid background. Second, we will test if phenotypic novelty (transgressive segregation) observed in hybrids increases with genetic and phenotypic distance between their parents. Third, to test if there are stereotypical genetic changes accompanying divergence during adaptive radiation we will resequence parallel and divergent selected strains of yeast.\nBesides theoretical aspects, these data may reveal applications for commercial exploitation of phenotypic novelty in yeast.

The HYBRAD project has presented direct experimental evidence from yeast (Saccharomyces) crosses for the ecological divergence of transgressive hybrids.\n\nThe research team crossed phenotypically and genetically different yeast strains and compared the resulting hybrids with their parents in harsh environments. These new situations mimicked various increasingly stressful pollution events. The transgressive hybrids could outcompete against their parents in a wide range of environments and were up to three times as fit, in the evolutionary sense.\n\nHYBRAD also tested the survival mechanism known as 'evolutionary rescue' by looking at interspecific hybridisation where more distant relatives of yeast interbreed. Hybridisation increased the probability of evolutionary rescue compared to both parental lineages and intraspecific crosses. This is attributed to the fact that hybridisation boosts the genetic variance and phenotypic novelty available to natural selection.\n\nLooking at even more distinct parents and the results of crosses, HYBRAD selected the hybrids from 10 increasingly stressful environments. Sampling genotypes and using a project-modified restriction site associated DNA (RAD)-tag protocol, they have promising preliminary results.

Genome variability has been recognised as a reason for the differences in drug response (pharmacogenomics). \n\nThe Marie Curie Initial Training Network (ITN) funded the http://www.fightingdrugfailure.net (FIGHTINGDRUGFAILURE) initiative to train young investigators and clinicians in pharmacogenomics. The training involved international collaborations in order to establish, evaluate and retrieve relevant genetic information from patients and relate it to clinical outcomes of drug therapy. This was achieved through sharing patient materials, performing pooled analyses, and transferring knowledge and skills across laboratories.\n\nThe project studied healthy women and the prediction of their risk to develop breast cancer as a consequence of using long-term hormonal treatment for the relief of menopausal symptoms. It involved personalised assessment for the risk of recurrence in patients who received the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen for the control of their disease. It also focusedon patients who received cytotoxic agents for the neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer caused by BRCA1 mutation. \n\nRresearchers found that the HSD17B1_G gene allele protected women from developing breast cancer when they had used hormone replacement therapy for more than 10 years. In the case of tamoxifen treatment, they identified polymorphisms of the CYP2D6 enzyme (responsible for the formation of the active metabolite) as a clinical outcome predictor. Moreover, tumour-associated microRNAs miR-126 and miR-10a were identified as independent predictors for tumour recurrence.  In the case of neoadjuvant treatment with cytotoxic agents, the underlying BRCA1 mutation was predictive of a favourable response.\n\nThe researcher also addressed aspects of safer pharmacotherapy for frequently used drugs.  They included anticonvulsants, antiretroviral and chemotherapeutic compounds as well as glucocorticoids, all of which are known to cause severe side-effects. In addition, specific hepatic factors and cholesterol-associated pathologies were analysed to identify more potential drug targets. Systems biology techniquess revealed entire pathways for potential improvements to drug treatment.\n\nOverall, FIGHTINGDRUGFAILURE proved that genetic polymorphisms have great potential as biomarkers to improve individualised treatment strategies.

It can take a 'fingerprint' of a substance and compare it with an online database to immediately identify it.\n\nAlready, the team has outlined the procedure and design, including gas load evaluation of the required vacuum system and sensor performance metrics.

The EU-funded project 'Validation of numerical engineering simulations: Standardisation actions' (http://www.engineeringvalidation.org/ (VANESSA)) sought to build on those outcomes by establishing a validation methodology within a standards framework. Equally important, the team set goals for encouraging uptake throughout European industrial and scientific communities. After all, a standard is not 'standard' if it is not widely used.\n\nTwo international round robin exercises were conducted to evaluate suitability of the chosen reference materials and protocols as tools for engineering standardisation via inter-laboratory comparisons. One addressed the reference materials for the calibration of optical systems for strain field measurement. The second investigated the validation protocol for the computational solid mechanics models.\n\nVANESSA conducted a series of public dialogues open to any interested stakeholders from anywhere in the world through a European Committee for Standardization (CEN) Workshop. Supported by the results of the inter-lab studies, the CEN workshop led to a CEN Workshop Agreement (CWA) on the validation of computational solid mechanics models (CEN CWA16799).\n\nA CWA is not a standard and is not accompanied by national obligations to comply, so the issue of garnering industrial and scientific support is an important one. To address it, VANESSA organised a series of events to exchange information and opinions. The team also created a variety of technical and educational promotional materials that are available on the project website with links to social media sites, including YouTube.\n\nThanks to the very high level of confidence afforded by validated simulation results, the EU is likely to gain a larger market sector while reducing costs associated with materials and energy usage.

They can be harmful, as their ability to mobilise makes them highly mutagenic and a threat to host genome integrity. Hence, organisms have evolved several TE repression mechanisms, especially in the germline, where new mutations can be transmitted to progeny. TEs challenge these silencing strategies by invading new genomes through horizontal transfer, but hosts appear to rapidly adapt to these new TEs. The classic example is the invasion of the Drosophila melanogaster genome by the P-element: TE repression in this system evolved so quickly that the P-element and its repressors (recently discovered to be due to a small RNA pathway) appeared almost simultaneously. The selective pressure may have been intense: crosses between D. melanogaster males containing P-elements and females devoid of it lead to frequent F1 sterility and other aberrant traits.

Since 2007, an estimated 6 million bats in North-America have died of the infection, which causes bats to prematurely consume the fat reserves deposited for winter hibernation. The infected bats arouse from hibernation more frequently; probably due to epidermal damage caused by Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), a psychrophilic fungus. Pd originates from Europe, however, European bats appear to be tolerant to the infection. Tolerance has also been recently observed in remnant populations in the U.S, where these WNS-survivors have co-existed with the fungus since 2006. The mechanisms leading to adaptation or tolerance remain unknown. Here we aim to investigate genetic factors that may contribute to Pd-tolerance in the most frequently infected genus of bats, Myotis. By using DNA-samples from two Myotis species from North America (Myotis lucifugus) and Europe (Myotis brandtii), we should observe selection in gene orthologs between European bats and bats in WNS-survivor populations.

This is one of the main recommendations of the updated European Strategy for Particle Physics, adopted by the CERN Council in May 2013.\nThe EuroCirCol conceptual design study is a direct response to this recommendation, initiating a study for a 100 TeV energy-frontier circular collider through a collaboration of institutes and universities worldwide.\n\nA new research infrastructure of such scale depends on the feasibility of key technologies pushed beyond current state of the art. Innovative designs for accelerator magnets to achieve high-quality fields up to 16 T and for a cryogenic beam vacuum system to cope with unprecedented synchrotron light power are required. The effects of colliding two 50 TeV beams must be mastered to meet the physics research requirements. Advanced energy efficiency, reliability and cost effectiveness are key factors to build and operate such an accelerator within realistic time scale and cost.\n\nThis proposal is part of the Future Circular Collider study under European leadership, federating resources worldwide to assess the merits of different post-LHC accelerator scenarios. It forms the core of a globally coordinated strategy of converging activities, involving participants from the ERA and beyond. Organisations joining this study from Japan and the USA are expected to take part in a global implementation project and a suitable governance model will be drawn-up accordingly.\n\nThe main outcome of EuroCirCol will be laying the foundation of subsequent infrastructure development actions that will strengthen the ERA as a focal point of global research cooperation and as a leader in frontier knowledge and technologies over the next decades.", 160329.0, 3331713.0, "EuroCirCol", null, null, null, null, "http://www.liverpool.ac.uk", null, "h2020_194962_999980567"], ["7ZX", "Breeding for Resilient, Efficient and Sustainable Organic Vegetable production", "The University of Liverpool", "The project deals with the urgent need to provide climate-resilient cultivars addressed to organic vegetable production systems.

Gusts cause rapid changes in the flow about the structures which leads to rigid and flexible unsteady responses. Knowledge of aircraft/gust interactions is therefore vital for loads estimation during aircraft design as it impacts on control systems and often defines the maximum loads that these structures will experience in service.  At present industry typically uses the linear doublet lattice method with static loads corrections from expensive wind tunnel data. The wind tunnel data is created using the final aerodynamic surface in the predicted cruise shape. This means that gust loads come relatively late when the design options have been narrowed. Increased competition and environmental concerns are likely to lead to the adoption of more flexible materials and the consideration of novel configurations, in which case the linear assumptions of the current gust loads process will become unacceptable.  To introduce non-linearity into the gust loads process without significantly increasing the cost and time, this project has three main objectives: to carry out investigations using CFD so that the non-linearities in gust interactions are understood; to create a gust loads process that does not require wind tunnel data and hence reduces the need for wind tunnel testing; to develop updated reduced order models for gust prediction that account for non-linearity at an acceptable cost. These investigations will reduce the need for expensive wind tunnel testing and hence lead to time and cost savings at the design stage therefore ensuring that the European aerospace and defence industry remain competitive in the future.
