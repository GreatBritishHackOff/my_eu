It will develop assessment methods and a Decision Support Framework (DSF) for management of marine resources and thereby enhance the capacity to provide integrated assessment, advice and decision support for an EAFM. Enabling comparisons between relevant 'what-if' scenarios and their likely consequences, DSF will support the implementation of the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). The project SMEs, together with RTD institutions and stakeholders, will develop and demonstrate the use of innovative decision support tools through training actions, role-play and workshops. Indicators of Good Environmental Status (GES) will be developed along with models for ecosystem-based management. The models will take multi-species approaches into account and be developed and compared through seven datasets of six European regional seas. The models will draw on historical data sets and data from new analytical methods. Model performance will be compared and evaluated using a simulated ecosystem as an operating model. Learning from the experience of previous and on-going research, MareFrame integrates stakeholders at its core using a co-creation approach that combines analytical and participatory processes to provide knowledge that can be applied to policy-making, improving management plans and implementation of EAFM. The project dissemination will use innovative ways to ensure effective usage of project outcomes. The work packages and the allocation of roles have been designed to ensure effective collaboration through the project\u2019s lifetime. MareFrame liaises with other national and international research projects and is of high relevance to the future management of living marine resources in Europe in a changing environment, taking a holistic view incorporating socio-economic and legislative issues.'", 25225.0, 6233260.0, "MareFrame", null, null, null, null, "http://www.nsrac.org", null, "fp7_111485_998384529"], ["5GB", "Bridging the gap between science and stakeholders: Phase I \u2013 Common Ground", "North Sea Regional Advisory Council", "Together, the stakeholder and scientist participants in GAP1 will initiate cooperative research by making plans to combine knowledge in future participatory research. They will engage through a series of European and regional workshops.   GAP1 represents phase 1 of a three-phase programme that aims to explore the complementary nature of alternative knowledge and investigate how to combine it in ways that will enhance understanding and management of natural resources.  Tied to knowledge, GAP1 is an evidence-based approach that uses participation as the vehicle to improving understanding on fisheries research and management issues of common concern to stakeholders, scientists and policy makers. This is a pre-requisite for fostering the mutual respect essential for successful future collaboration.   Through initiation of cooperative research and helping build the capacity of stakeholders to engage in participatory research, GAP1 contributes towards the wider aspiration of the Science in Society programme.

The EU-funded project 'Bridging the gap between science and stakeholders: phase I common ground' (GAP1) explored different avenues to better understand fisheries research and their management.\n\nWhile fisheries stakeholders would like to ensure the sector's sustainability, they are sometimes at odds with policymakers and scientists who are perceived as distant to realities on the ground. GAP1 has brought the stakeholders together with scientists to improve understanding and management of fisheries through unified, collaborative analysis.\n\nThe drive saw 15 partnerships from 11 countries in Europe among parties where science exchange and stakeholder research led to joint research. GAP1 produced 12 case study research proposals to outline priorities. Themes discussed included ecology, marine spatial planning, discarding, management measures, sustainability and decision making, with a strong overall management component.\n\nGAP1 helped bring science and society closer in this respect. It enhanced public engagement in researchers, focusing on sustainable collaboration and dialogue among actors in the field of fisheries. It also outlined the challenges that hinder progress and exploit stakeholder engagement in a way that impacts European policies.\n\nThe outcomes of this initiative have been used for creating a strategy for future research based on a participatory planning process for GAP2. The latter aims to integrate stakeholder and scientific knowledge in powerful ways that could positively influence policy. In the meantime, the outputs of GAP1 have been released on the project's website and are already cementing ties between science and industry.

To do this, they establish integrated living laboratories clustering local measures according to four major aspects of sustainable urban mobility:\n1. Governance: to increase port-city collaborative planning and participation, leading to enhanced forms of SUMPs. 2. People: to foster less car-dependent mobility styles, leading to modal shift in favour of collective and more active transport. 3. Transport system: to strengthen the efficiency of road traffic management to/from the port and through the city, and foster the use of clean vehicles. 4.
