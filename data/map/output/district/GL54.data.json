There is an urgent need and huge opportunity to address the efficient use of agricultural wastes, co-products and by-products (AWCB) towards delivering sustainable value chains in the farming and processing sectors. As such, AgroCycle will convert low value agricultural waste into highly valuable products, achieving a 10% increase in waste recycling and valorisation by 2020. This will be achieved by developing a detailed and holistic understanding of the waste streams and piloting a key number of waste utilisation/valorisation pathways. It will bring technologies and systems from ~TRL4 to ~TRL7 within the 3 years of the project. A post-project commercialisation plan will bring commercially promising technologies/systems to TRL8 and TRL9, ensuring AgroCycle will have an enduring impact by achieving sustainable use of AWCB both inside and outside the agricultural sector, leading to the realisation of a Circular Economy. \n\nAgroCycle addresses wastes from several agricultural sectors: wine, olive oil, horticulture, fruit, grassland, swine, dairy and poultry.

The development of high-quality pedagogical and educational programmes for working with children of different age is a permanent goal of the people employed in preschool institutions. One of good ways to achieve it is co-operation and sharing of experience, knowledge and skills among the employees in the educational institutions throughout Europe. International partnership is key for developing high-quality curricula for the pedagogical and educational institutions in future.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the main aim of the Project is as follows: to support professional development of the employees through long-term programmes of international partnership and through the creation of the international contact network; to get familiar with contemporary educational programmes and learning strategies for different  age groups; to improve foreign language skills of children and educators, as well as to improve professional skills in ICT technologies.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet the set goals, we have planned a number of mobilities in which an educator, an English teacher and four pre-school teachers took part. Mobilities included job shadowing activities, courses, visits to kindergartens and schools, and participation in joint projects. The Pre-school Institution from Slovenia is specialised in information and communications technology and uses the CLIL methodology in teaching English language, whereas the Educational Centre from Greece is specialised in Reggio Emilia Approach and outdoor learning. The courses in Great Britain will offer us an adequate theoretical foundation and an insight into practical activities. The stay in these three partner centres and getting familiar with their work will contribute to meeting our needs and to achieving our goals.\r\n\r\nThe project would result in the improved professional competences of the project participants and their application of contemporary educational approaches and learning strategies (Reggio Emilia Approach, outdoor learning, integration of educational contents into a project-oriented education, etc.); new Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) methodology; and digital competences.

This is the first of many projects aimed at increasing competences in the teaching staff at our school.

Our claim is also that more competent and confident teachers showing great enthusiasm in their subject will counteract school drop-outs.

The aim of the school is to develop vocational education and training in selected subjects being taught in English. Our school takes interest in providing students with a quality education with qualified teaching staff, which is intended to be accomplished  through the participation of teachers in mobility abroad.\r\nThe main objective of the project is to improve the quality of teaching vocational subjects focusing on art and design through training in the English language, to enable teaching staff with both  professional and language experience abroad, simultaneously  adapting to new social and working environment and afterwards to  increase the role of the school in the European Union zone. Private Secondary School of Art in \u017dilina wants to maintain its unique position in the \u017dilina region and to ensure the proficiency of the teaching  by employing  qualified teachers  with sufficient skills, competencies and experience that will ensure the sustainability of secondary vocational education focusing on visual art and design. Promotion, media coverage and dissemination of project results are part of the specific project objectives and main activities.\r\nFive members of teaching staff will participate in mobility project  through participation in structured courses which will enable them to teach comprehensive/theoretical  and vocational subjects as well  in English language. The selection of training courses has been made in effective and logical way to set up the training instruction in  vocational subjects focused on art in English language.\r\nThe course \"Language and Methodology Refresher\" (July 2017) for one participant is aimed at improving the language skills of teachers of English in secondary schools, exploring various aspects of language teaching and methodology of teaching foreign languages. The course \"One Week Course for Teachers of Art and Design\" (October 2017) is designed for two teachers of practical training in the areas of art, design and art history. Course \"Collegiality across CLIL\" (October 2017) focused on the use of CLIL methodology in the educational process and  is designed for a single teacher who will  teach theoretical vocational subjects bilingually. Course \"One Week Course for Primary and Secondary Headteachers (February 2018) provides insight into education at primary and secondary schools in the UK and it  is designed for one teacher.\r\nIndividual project activities are planned in a logical structure and chronologically according to date of completion of particular courses, starting with the selection of individual course participants in conformity with pre set criteria. The intercultural preparation will be provided to participants by a project coordinator in co-operation with the representative of Cambridge Study residing in \u017dilina. The organizational preparation will be managed by project  coordinator  in collaboration with partner organizations  in timely manner prior to the implementation of mobility. \r\nThe participation in mobility gives teachers the opportunity to use new methods, forms and means in the educational process of secondary vocational education of art subjects. Mobility project will interconnect the cooperation between teachers in general-education subjects and vocational subjects  with art orientation. Teaching staff and management of the  school will have an opportunity to participate in vocational teaching in English after the implementation of the  mobility outcomes into school documentation in the school year 2018/2019. Comparing of the educational system in Slovakia and the UK will be a challenge for other teachers how to bring  new methods, imagination and creativity into the teaching process. For teachers in general-education subjects and foreign languages the mobility shapes the way how to become more effective by using new methods, techniques in the English language and also a way of motivating students for experiential learning. For teachers of vocational art subjects the project is a way of learning how to teach vocational subjects in English. For school management the mobility project will be an opportunity for exchanging experience and developing relationships with headmasters of schools and educational institutions from other parts of Europe, as well as the opportunity to practise communication skills and get a different view on solving different problems in schools.\r\nMobility project will have an impact not only on the course participants, but also on all teaching staff and students of the school. Given the fact that in \u017dilina region there are many foreign based companies and institutions searching employees with foreign language, communication and art skills the school will offer graduates well prepared for the labour market needs.

The acquired abilities will be used in school to motivate pupils, especially those at risk of dropping out. New skills will help to motivate and involve students more effectively. The project will be offered to an institution already involved with European projects, which are a part of its plan of the educational offering. The project is aimed at promoting a wider European dimension in order to improve on the members of staff's language, pedagogical and methodological competences and to better cope with the growing needs of immigrant children and of students with special educational needs. \r\nThe staff participating in the project, selected from both primary and lower secondary school levels, will have the opportunity to improve their language competences, share and compare their pedagogical approaches, try out new different technological tools, and re-think about their beliefs in a multi-cultural environment.  We have chosen to attend courses at ISP because the school has years of experience in organizing training courses for teachers and has a good reputation for delivering quality services. Many teachers of our Comprensivo have already attended courses offered by ISP with great satisfaction and fallow up of what has been learned about the department colleagues. We have analyzed the wide variety of development courses, not only for teachers of English and CLIL, but also for teachers of other disciplines, including science, music, art and theater. Each chosen course seem to be designed to meet the training needs of our teacher. Those we identified meet the specific needs expressed by the teachers of our Institute and the needs revealed by our students. The teachers will take part in structured learning activities in training courses at centres in the UK, specifically aiming at improving their language, pedagogical, methodological or subject-matter competence and their cultural awareness. This new acquired competences will be used to perform the daily tasks, as well as to promote innovative activities once back home (eg. CLIL modules or the use of new technologies for their students, especially for those with special needs). They will cope with the challenge of using a foreign language for learning, teaching and for everyday routines, thus applying their old skills to new and wider contexts. They will be expected to help, plan, deliver, and evaluate their training activities by means of formal and informal tools, and use the eTwinning platform to get in touch and remain in contact with partners and fellow participants from different schools and countries. Participation in the courses allows to build both professional and personal relationships that last over time, with the exchange of materials among teachers, students and schools, as well as the planning of multilateral projects of common interest. Exchange and cooperation between foreign colleagues and students is a guarantee of quality in education, especially from a European prospective. It also permits the aimed and finalized use of TIC. The school has several members of staff  currently involved in Erasmus+KA2, and Twinning and Clil activities, motivating and enriching projects for all concerned that concretely contribute towards the establishment of an identity as European citizens. It stimulates social cohesion and active participation as members of society.\r\nExpected results and longer-term benefits include increased awareness of students' needs, higher motivation of both teachers and students, better use of materials already present in the institution, more informed decisions about teaching and learning to complement the school educational plan. A multiplying effect is also envisaged insofar as the involved staff would share their new competences in informal ways at school and during more formal training events open to staff of other schools, local communities and associations operating within the municipality, as well as start and participate in transnational eTwinning projects. \r\nAll the materials will be upload on the school website and disseminate as we have decided in our plan.

The decision to send them abroad for training comes from the needs the school has as it would like to introduce ICT tools in the classroom, that is, implement the project Innovative Pedagogy 1:1. The headmaster, teachers, School Student Community and Parents Council have expressed their wish to modernize teaching, to integrate the use of tablets and smartphones in the classroom and encourage students and teachers to be innovative and creative at work. We want teachers to acquire new competencies and skills to work with students and engage students to use ICT tools independently and thus enable them to understand social, language and cultural diversity in Europe. We want to encourage students to take initiative, to acquire skills to work with ICT and improve their communication. We wish students to become confident and look for educational and professional opportunities in the European Union. \r\nThe participants of the training will be actively involved in seminars and structured educational visits, talk to teachers and pedagogical workers, learn new forms and methods of teaching and compare them with the traditional school practice in Slovenia. The programmes of all seminars include presentations and lectures on cultures and traditions of host countries. New acquired knowledge will be disseminated among their colleagues at school and in the local community. Training will be beneficial for the teaching and other staff at school as they will gain new insights into education despite not participating in seminars. Different means will be used to disseminate the results of training: the school website, Facebook, print media (educational and local magazines and newspapers), Open Days, study meetings organized by the National Institute of Education, SIRIKT etc.\r\nTraining and seminars will have a positive effect on our students. New contemporary teaching methods will make traditional ways of teaching more interesting, especially modern foreign languages and science subjects. Students will learn by using ICT tools and learn to take initiative, develop digital competencies, communication skills in foreign languages. Introducing ICT tools in teaching makes students be more motivated to study, which in turn means it would reduce the number of drop-out students and also increase the interest of potential students to enter our school. ICT tools make it possible for the children with special needs and immigrant children to be easily integrated in the new school environment and encourage them to improve their persistence to complete their education.\r\nWe want to send our teachers and pedagogical workers for training abroad to improve their teaching practice and enable them to follow the needs of students with special needs and offer immigrant students lessons in Slovene language as soon as possible. For this reason, our school needs to cooperate with schools abroad and exchange experience with teachers from foreign countries and organizations. In this way the school would find it easier to plan formal and informal education, boost team spirit and cooperation among the school workers and the local community, improve planning of international projects and strengthen cooperation with foreign partners. If we get involved in international projects, we will become active members of the European teachers' network.\r\nThe outcome of training is seen in the improvement of the school development plan. It is believed that a model of sustainable structures and school innovations will be created (an improved and increased communication in foreign languages, the use of tablets in most classrooms, a rise in international cooperation). Regarding the school enrolment for 2017/2018 one class of students will be taught following the principles of the Innovative Pedagogy 1:1 method and teachers will be encouraged to teach in this class.\r\nLong-term effects will be visible at the level of work with talented students, students with special needs and immigrants. It will be easier to follow them and they will be monitored more frequently. A special importance will be given to the results of the school leaving exams and enrolment in our school.

Teachers must have the opportunity to try new practices, acquire new roles and create a culture of enquire-based learning. The development of teachers also means offering opportunities to critically reflect on its practices and building  new  content knowledge  and pedagogy.\r\nResearch has shown that good teaching practices can do more to break down the indifference of students  than extraordinary efforts to motivate them directly. Many students react positively to a very well organized and developed lessons  by a motivated teacher who has a genuine interest in the students and in what they learn.

It concludes with a certificate of proficiency graded according to the Common European Framework of Reference and will be offered in this form in future. In addition, it serves as a basis for the planning and execution of projects with an alternative concept: two-week placements in cooperation with tried and new partners with the objective of exchanging views and experience of professional practice through company visits and discussion with all of those involved in vocational training. Furthermore, relevant topics can be included flexibly, e.g. current developments in the EU.\r\n\r\nOur contact to Lyc\u00e9e Pierre de Coubertin, Calais, will be reactivated. Rather than the previous three-week twinning with the emphasis on work placement, the future emphasis will be on small groups interacting and discussing. For trainees and teaching staff alike this should enable an international exchange of outlooks \u2013 not necessarily in English alone. Sitting in on lessons, company visits as well as extramural activities provide for enhanced intercultural competence and the opportunity for didactic reflection and development.\r\n\r\nThe relationship with Omnia, in Espoo, Finland, should develop along similar lines, whereby English will be paramount. By bringing together compatible professional sectors, greater emphasis will be placed on topics specifically related to the sector in question.\r\n\r\nOur new partnership with LSE in Liverpool provides two further offers meeting our aspirations: for our apprentices language development is the primary objective flanked by company visits with groups formed more on the basis of the level of fluency rather than their training focus. As our English department expands and is strengthened through the Vocational College English Qualification at the Oldenburg Further Education Centre, Liverpool runs a particularly apposite intensive course culminating in the Cambridge Teaching Knowledge Test (TKT). Participants not only consolidate specific vocabulary, but also through teaching their main subject to the Liverpool study group explore, expand and develop didactic approaches. A parallel course offered by the established International Study Programme gives us even greater flexibility to enable our staff to acquire further qualifications.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have offered our apprentices the professional KMK English Language certificate at Level B2. The successful initiation of the Europakaufmann qualification in cooperation with five other internationally engaged Bremen vocational colleges has attracted 47 participants in 2017. Along with concentration on the theme of International Commerce, the English KMK Certificate Level B1, qualification in a further foreign language at minimum Level A1 and the ECDL, a three-week work placement abroad with intercultural interaction is also required. For this we have the partners Liverpool and ECBM with their great experience. The europass will be issued for this.\r\n\r\nSending staff to support participants has definitely enhanced the success and quality of our Mobility projects to date and further strengthened the Internationalisation awareness of accompanying staff. Our expanding concept for Mobility involves intensifying the participation of staff in project activities. They will have the added opportunity for comparing international approaches to vocational training and an exchange on didactics with their opposite numbers in vocational institutions. The ensuing reflection and multiplication of their experiences in various locations will promote the internationalisation of our college.", "http://International-Study-Programmes.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA116-004068_6"]]}}, "outwardCode": "GL54"}
