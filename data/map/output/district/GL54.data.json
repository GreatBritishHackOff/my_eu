There is an urgent need and huge opportunity to address the efficient use of agricultural wastes, co-products and by-products (AWCB) towards delivering sustainable value chains in the farming and processing sectors. As such, AgroCycle will convert low value agricultural waste into highly valuable products, achieving a 10% increase in waste recycling and valorisation by 2020. This will be achieved by developing a detailed and holistic understanding of the waste streams and piloting a key number of waste utilisation/valorisation pathways. It will bring technologies and systems from ~TRL4 to ~TRL7 within the 3 years of the project. A post-project commercialisation plan will bring commercially promising technologies/systems to TRL8 and TRL9, ensuring AgroCycle will have an enduring impact by achieving sustainable use of AWCB both inside and outside the agricultural sector, leading to the realisation of a Circular Economy. \n\nAgroCycle addresses wastes from several agricultural sectors: wine, olive oil, horticulture, fruit, grassland, swine, dairy and poultry.

In order to cope with this situation and to develop new teaching plans, our staff is looking for new ideas. We are nine English teachers, but five among them are career changers.  Because of this special situation the English staff sees the need for a further qualification of their members concerning the individual speaking skills, the motivation of the students and the methods of teaching English as a foreign language. As described above, we have developed a new concept for the bilingual education at our school and now we are interested in new input. There are no longer bilingual classes, but two extra lessons in English for all our students in form 5. In form 6 talented students can choose a bilingual preparation course which offers them a more thorough insight into what bilingual education means. They only then decide for a more intensive bilingual education in the following years. In recent years this has led to more and more students with a migration background choosing the bilingual branch. Nevertheless this bilingual preparation course in grade 6 remains a challenge for our English staff as we have to prepare several topics of different subjects in English, e.g. Biology, Art, Geography or History.\r\nAim of the project:\r\nThe aim of our project is to improve the individual language and speaking skills of the participants, to heighten the motivation of the colleagues, especially concerning new teaching methods, to prepare the English staff for the bilingual course and to start an exchange with other teachers about dealing with heterogenity of students. The teaching and learning of English as a foreign language is the main aspect, but we also seek a greater cultural awareness and appreciation of attitudes and cultures of other European countries and a greater knowledge of the British (or other European) Educational System.\r\nNumber and profile of the participants:\r\nThe English department of our school has chosen three participants who are responsible for different aspects of teaching English as a foreign language.  \r\nMrs Gladczak coordinates the bilingual section of our school and teaches Geography bilingually. Mrs Harder teaches History as a bilingual subject and works for the training on the jobs and the students' participation (head of \u201eSV\u201c). Mrs Korneffel is representative of the English department and coordinates all cultural aspects and workshops at our school. We expect that all participants can successfully invest their individual interests and strengths in the teachers' course.\r\nPlanned activity:\r\nThe aforementioned teachers will take part in the 'Two week course for European teachers of English at secondary level, focus on Scotland, UK' in Dunfermline, Scotland, from Sunday 20 July to Friday 01 August 2014 organised by International Studies Programmes, UK.\r\nOrganisation of the project:\r\nThe English department studied the different institutions offering teachers' courses in the UK by PAD on their website and we chose International Studies Programmes because of their more than 30 years of experience in organising teacher development courses for European Ministries of Education. It is an experienced provider of European Union funded programmes in the UK. ISP organises the course, the housing, presents material and information and documents the participation.\r\nThe English department of our school is involved in the preparation and evaluation of the teachers' course. \r\nResults and effects:\r\nAs shown in the projects' aims we hope to get results on different levels, especially concerning the motivation of students and an improved handling of the heterogenity of our students. We are very much interested in improving the special situation of our English department with more than half of the staff being career changers. It is also planned to improve the curricula and to upgrade the basic school objectives with the help of the new educational methods. We will be linked with the regional secondary schools, our partner school in France, the local companies as partners of our school and the cultural department to exchange our experiences with them. \r\nLongterm effects:\r\nWith respect to the school's development we see the possibility of improving the quality as a longterm effect. The expected skills of our students with regard to their future jobs or society in general are increasing continuously. These demands are a challenge for our school, especially for the bilingual education. Students with good language skills have to be supported even more so that they can make good use of their extra skills to succeed in the world of work. Because of the opening and expansion of Europe it is not only important with respect to economic aspects, but also to cultural ones to improve our students' foreign language skills.

It is composed by a Technical school in technology branch and a Lyceum in applied sciences. The Technical school is then divided into four study courses: Chemistry and biotechnology, Electronics and electrical engineering, Computer science and telecommunications, Mechanics and mechatronics. The IIS, in its whole, is attended by about 1000 students belonging to the middle class. The hinterland of the school is rather poor, and many parents are unemployed. The low income doesn\u2019t allow students to travel abroad, giving them poor skills in the English language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROJECT\r\n\r\nThe project comes from the desire, that we have, to bring our students to Europe and to improve their English skills. This goal can be achieved by giving, to teachers, competences and methodologies about the CLIL joined to skills within the framework of Erasmus+ actions. Since knowledge makes collaboration easier, the project aims to provide administrative and accounting knowledge around Erasmus+ framework to the administrative staff of the school. This action will improve its collaboration with teachers that undertake one of the Erasmus+ actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nTo achieve the goals it is necessary to raise awareness and then train the teaching and administrative personnel. We will set up a group of 10 teachers, two for each of the four branches  of the Technical school and two teachers belonging to Lyceum. Each pair will consist of teachers that steadily teach technical subjects at school. Alternatively, the pair could be formed by a teacher of technical subjects and one that teaches scientific or humanistic subjects.

An assessment module will be set by the teachers\u2019 committee in collaboration with the National Training Agency. The materials, documents and worksheets produced during the course will be shared by both teachers and students on the school website area dedicated to international relations. During the school year following the training course the teachers will have to include in their annual learning plan a section focused on the skills acquired and at the end of the school year they will have to report the results achieved.

I would like to include individualized learning sessions every other week. \r\n\r\nThe term resource-based learning implies that the pupils work on their own, choosing appropriate material offered to them. Moreover, and especially for that very reason, they are responsible for their learning process themselves. The teachers do not have their typical role (including \u201cnormal\u201d teaching and giving instructions), but they should observe the pupils and try to support them individually. Therefore, resource-based learning is also a good method to include the good and the weaker students and to encourage and support them individually, so that all of them can benefit from it. \r\n\r\nAs the students get a worksheet including many different activities, every learner type can try out new activities. In addition, working together with different partners can also increase the pupils\u2019 own learning process.\r\nPupils have to be creative and do different types of activities and games, alone, in pairs or even together in  small groups. Therefore,  we are not talking about normal and boring lessons, but about creative and very motivating lessons, which are fun and pupils enjoy  but also learn a lot. In my opinion, they learn more that way.  Last but not least, it can also have a lot of advantages for a future job, because it helps to develop and increase abilities such as creativity, problem solving and team work. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would also like to find a school class in England that would be willing to write emails with my class. This way my students could practice their English in a fun way and learn a lot at the same time. Writing to people their age is much more interesting and fun and, therefore, further motivates them to continue studying. If possible it would be great to include an exchange (one week or ten days) so that we could also meet and visit the English students and their country. This way the students could perfect their English skills and learn more about the country, the people and their customs and traditions. Personally, I think that the students will be really motivated, interested and enthusiastic about learning English. Teaching and learning the fun and creative way is the most important and best  teaching method, because it is the only thing that really motivates students and turns the subject English into a passion ! \r\n\r\nActivities and methods: individual work, pair work, group work, vocabulary and grammar games (memory, duo, puzzles, board games,\u2026) , songs, role plays, acting out dialogues, reading, listening, speaking tasks, writing tasks,\u2026\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve prepared an outline of a creative teaching session on Christmas ( that I would like to to during my project; one of the many I would like to do) to show you what I am talking about.It is much easier if you see it and not only read about it.

We try to follow current trends in teaching English as a foreign language. \r\nFrom 2006 to 2008 we took part in Comenius project: the multilateral partnership of the schools. In 2008 we joined project of experimental research \" Effectiveness of CLIL Methodology in Primary Schools\". From 2012 to 2014 we realized the project called \" To better understanding with the use of modern technologies\". \r\nThe main objectives of the project are:\r\n1. To increase the professional competences of teaching staff and school managers , especially language teachers and bilingual teachers  or teachers using CLIL, increase their self-confidence and motivation\r\n2.To  improve the implementation of the school curriculum, increase the quality of education and language competencies achieved by graduates( the level of English language leaving exam in  bilingual programme   has been  increased by law to  C1 and the second foreign language to  B2 of the Common European Framework of Reference), to  reinforce the use of CLIL\r\n3.To  promote multicultural awareness of teachers and students, to prepare students to study abroad,  to provide assistance in adapting to students coming from abroad, get contacts to schools abroad and prepare new partnerships\r\n4. To acquire new knowledge in working with students with special needs, especially in the field of foreign language teaching\r\n5. To become more familiar with management procedures in other EU countries, reflect school management  in comparison with other countries, to improve the school reputation and competitiveness.\r\nThe project participants are school managers of (2), one from the grammar school and one from the  elementary school. These employees are responsible for the implementation of the school curriculum, quality of teaching, management and control of the learning process and professional development of teaching staff. Other participants are teachers of English in the  primary classes (2) teachers of English at the  secondary level (3), a teacher of German at the secondary level (1), a teacher of German at grammar school (1),  teachers of English in a bilingual programme (4), teachers of English in the 4-year programme with an economic focus (1). Another group consists of teachers of general subjects in English or with the use of CLIL (6).\r\nThe planned training activities should bring improvement of language and methodological skills of the participants, to improve their knowledge of the culture of English-speaking countries and the use of ICT.\r\nIn the preparation phase  a detailed schedule of tasks with the names of the people responsible will be prepared. Each participant will draw up a personal plan that will include the expectations, method of preparation, detailed timetable of travel, dissemination and evaluation plan and the Language Europass. Web space for storing  generated teaching materials will be prepared and  preparatory language course for participants who need to improve their language competence before taking a course will be organized.\r\nIn the main phase of the project participants will complete the planned educational activities, prepare outputs and realize the proposed dissemination activities.\r\nThe main expected  outputs of the project are  acquired competences,  school management improvement plan, plan of internal training for teachers, teaching materials, higher effectivity of foreign languages teaching, new partnerships with the schools abroad. The main dissemination activities are workshops, seminars, open classes, Language Day, Open Day. These activities are designed for staff and students of the school, their parents as well as the general public.\r\nIn the final phase  fulfillment of planned activities and benefits of the project will be evaluated. For this purppose we will use questionnaires, lesson observations,  checking the outputs and dissemination activities.

We believe that forming a positive attitude of our students towards the English language leads not only to their better results but also to broadening their horizons. \r\n      Vision of our school is to acknowledge its good regional reputation as well as to \"open its gates\" towards European opportunities. We plan to fulfil this vision by improving the language competency of our students and by creating partnerships with schools in other European countries.  We expect to provide our students with basic proficiency in English to enable them to travel, study or work abroad. The CLIL method is to be one of the tools for creating effective opportunities to use the foreign language skills. \r\n      The goal of our project is to enrich the knowledge and experience of our teachers via completing a variety of courses offered by the mobility programme and thus enrich the students, the fellow teachers, the curriculum and our community. \r\nThe chief purpose remains in forming a positive attitude of our students towards the English language. We need to support the motivation (both of teachers and students) to study English, to initiate new creative teaching methods, to learn more about CLIL and British culture.  Moreover, we intend to focus on our students with special needs because they seem to struggle with the foreign language the most. \r\n We chose 7 out of 20 teachers involved in teaching English using the following criteria: high motivation, choice of the course suitable for the diversity of the project, personal and professional competency.  The selected participants have to show their enthusiasm to learn and share with others and they have to prove their determination to cooperate. The special teacher is included to the team to help with teaching students with special educational needs.\r\nTo promote creativity in our classrooms we selected a participant who will learn how to use drama, music, storytelling and role-play in teaching.\r\nTo refresh the methodology we chose two participants (one for young and one for secondary learners) who will improve their confidence and competence in English and update their skills in the class management and practical teaching techniques. \r\nTo teach cross-cultural awareness in the classroom we've got a participant who will explore different aspects of modern British life and culture.\r\nOne of our participants  is to develop her language skills and one is to learn more about the CLIL methodology. The special teacher is to gain practical classroom skills and materials for teaching English to students with special needs. \r\n      The main purpose of attending the above mentioned courses is sharing the experience. We plan to organize various workshops for students, teachers and parents, and demonstration lessons, such as \"The Days of European Culture\" and \"The English Day\" (a day of lessons taught only in English) etc. We also hope to establish an international partnership with an English speaking European school, which may result in exchanging students or making penfriends. \r\n    Benefits of the project will be monitored by questionnaires, interviews and observations.  One questionnaire will focus on the students' attitude towards the English language. It will be demonstrated twice - once before and the second time after a year of applying the new methods and approaches. The findings will be compared. Another tool of monitoring the project will be the teachers' (participants') portfolio.\r\n    The outcome will focus not only on the attitude of students toward the English language but also on their knowledge of European culture. We hope to reach a higher proficiency of teaching English, to meet the European standards.

Perhaps part of the problem is the lack of understanding of what really motivates students. According to sociological studies, the current school environment has a poor setting for the professional work and it often seems to work against the teachers' best efforts to grow professionally and improve student learning.\r\nTeachers' attitude is crucial to the success of in-depth curricular innovation.\r\nA \"radical rethinking\" of professional development encouraging teachers' growth has to be done. Teachers must have the opportunities to try out new practices by taking new roles and creating a culture of inquiry.

Most students react positively to a well-organized lesson taught by an enthusiastic and motivated teacher who has an authentic interest in students and what they are learning. This in order to generate an atmosphere that is open and positive. It is increasingly evident that the educational methods we have been using for the past 70 years are no longer sufficient.

At the same time, the intermediary institution, the families and the host companies come into play. Updated information are given on either side through the more suitable channel according to the interlocutors. So that our students will be well prepared and the host companies and families well selected and informed. The required official documents of each partner are produced as well as the files necessary for the students.\r\nDuring the internship, the former tasks having carefully been performed, the students become the main actors while remaining under the care of the local companies and host families.

that in a contemporary modern society tradition is not enough and what we need to do is to keep pace with new trends in teaching languages and bring out innovative ideas and modern technologies so that learning foreign languages becomes not only more interesting but also develops other skills and competences of our students. Our target is to provide current and up-to-date forms of learning for adult learners by means of IKT and creativity. We have realised that if we want our learners to have a chance on the labour market the knowledge they gain needs to be up-to-date, modern and long-lasting. On the other hand, we will appreciate and our students, as well if they can gain it in a playful and natural way so that they will not notice that they  actually study hard. This is one of the main reasons why our lecturers would like to take  the opportunity to participate in the courses in which they could improve  their skills connected with IT technologies and creativity. We hope that consequently they would increase the PC literacy of mainly adult learners who have not had the opportunity to work and use a whiteboard or  a digital textbook so far. The second course  focuses on the use of creativity and different techniques and methods which might be seemingly unusable for classroom purposes but might work as a useful tool to motivate our students and thus involve them indirectly in the learning process. We have chosen two lecturers who will take part in the project. One of them is an experienced language teacher and who has already taken part in the course of contemporary English. Now she would like to improve her skills in using IT technology because currently she teaches only a small percentage of  students using digital book and a whiteboard but in the future she would like to make use of her knowledge gained in Great Britain to teach not only most  adult courses using IT but also to create her own teaching materials. The second lecturer has some experience with using various creative techniques in teaching English which she gained mostly while studying at the Art School. She had the chance to use these skills when we organised the English summer camp. However, she feels that she needs to improve her skills connected with methodology and pedagogy and at the same time to gain more creative ideas and learn new techniques so that she could use them in adult courses for students who want to experience a new creative but at the same time innovative way of teaching, as well since a part of the second course also deals with the use of computers in language teaching. As far as both lecturers are concerned, we expect improvement of their IT skills, pedagogical creativity,  multicultural awareness and motivation. As a result, we assume that they will make use of the gained knowledge associated with creativity, new innovative ideas, IT technology which will attract more satisfied students who are aware of the fact that it is essential not to only  speak several foreign languages but also be able to use the latest IT technology.\r\nThe expected impact of the project will be seen on several levels \u2013 increase of reputation and making the language school up-to-date, improvement and full use of IKT technology at the moment available at the language school, improvement and confident use of modern technologies by lecturers and employees of the language school, smooth and attractive implementation of creative elements in foreign language teaching. Above all, we expect the improvement of computer literacy of our adult learners and increase of their motivation to use modern information technologies.\r\nIn long term, our language school will get an opportunity to become one of the modern language schools which offer their adult learners the wide range of language courses focused on new trends in andragogy.", "http://www.International-Study-Programmes.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-SK01-KA104-008806_1"], ["4EB", "Kori\u0161tenje tehnologije u podu\u010davanju engleskog jezika", "International Study Programmes", 6970.0, "In spite of abundant experience in the field of teaching foreign languages to adult learners, especially English, Adult Education Centre \"Maksima\" is aware of the necessity to include modern technology into the teaching process and the challenges it presents in particular to teachers with more than 20 years of experience in traditional teaching.\r\nAccording to the identified needs for development and improvement and our wish to achieve European educational standards, we believe that a course for our teachers organized by International Study Programmes (ISP) in the UK will enable our institution's advancement as well as that of all our teachers in the field of using modern technology in teaching English. We would then apply this to teaching other foreign languages in \"Maksima\".\r\nThis project will focus on 4 main goals:\r\n1. Introducing fresh ideas, new knowledge and skills as well as motivating teaching materials for teaching English to adults based on modern technology;\r\n2. Perfecting language skills of English teachers with many years of experience;\r\n3. Exchanging ideas and experiences and developing links with teachers from other European countries;\r\n4. Implementing newly acquired knowledge and skills and sharing good practice.\r\nWe have chosen 3 female teachers for the mobility project in Great Britain. They all have 20 or more years of experience in teaching English as a foreign language using traditional methods. All 3 are at the same time teachers of one more European language (French, German and Italian). They are ideal candidates for the mobility because not only do they require insight into the newest in foreign language education, examples they learn for teaching English will be easily adapted to programmes of other languages they teach.\r\nAfter preparation in \u201cMaksima\u201d and participating in local educational events covering the use of technology in the teaching process, our teachers will leave for a two week course in Southampton (UK) where they will attend lectures and participate in workshops organised by ISP and conducted by top British experts with years of experience in the field of English language teacher training. The program consists of advanced language practice which will be of great use for our teachers. Experiencing British society will be made available through the course activities, educational visits and events, but most of all through staying with local host families where our teachers will be immersed in life in England.\r\nThe teacher training course will consist of lectures, workshops and educational-study visits.\r\nOur wish is to perfect and modernize the teaching process in \"Maksima\" for the benefit of our teachers and students. This would make learning English more interesting, enhance motivation as well as increase learning tempo. That way our students will be better prepared for student exchange and moreover for the competitive European employment market. The new ideas and experience our teachers will acquire is adaptable not only to teaching other foreign languages but also to language education specific for young learners, from kindergarten children up, offered in schools specializing in foreign language teaching.\r\nBy spreading our experience and good practice we will bring new ideas to all interested colleagues at home and abroad. They can learn from us how to participate in mobility programmes, they will have access to all the information and ideas our teachers got and workshops to transfer the newly acquired skills.\r\nWe will stay in direct contact with ISP's teacher trainers and participants from other European countries and hope to develop new international relations between our institution and others through bilateral agreements.", "http://International-Study-Programmes.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-HR01-KA104-012961_1"], ["4EB", "\u00d5pir\u00e4nne koolit\u00f6\u00f6tajate professionaalse arengu toetamiseks", "International Study Programmes", 17226.0, "According to current mobility project, 12 teachers from P\u00e4rnu Koidula G\u00fcmnasium will participate in job-shadowing or attend to further training course at partner organization. 4 teacher will job-shadow the colleagues in Icelandic or German partnerschool. 8 teachers will attend to further training course, which is focusing of the individual training need of the teacher.The aims of the project are:I Enable to the employees the further training opportunities; support professional development of the employees; improve the foreign language skills; support transfer of the innovative teaching methods and usage in practice; raise the attractiveness of the studies.II Encourage the usage of modern ICT tools and modern technologies in order to raise the attractiveness of the studies.III Encourage the international co-operation; finding the new co-operation partners; ensure sustainable international co-operation.IV Improvement of management tools, processes and study arrangements.The aims of the project are set according to the development plan and priorities of P\u00e4rnu Koidula G\u00fcmnaasium and the development trends in secondary education.

The use of new technologies and the improvement of our students\u2019 knowledge of the English language are two of our greatest academic concerns. In order to achieve our goals we have done a thorough analysis of our strengths and weaknesses, and we have determined that we need to gain knowledge and experience on how to implement English in early education, improve the use of ICT in both the learning process and outside the classroom, and the promotion of entrepreneurial ideas among our students.Firstly, our first and second graders will be introduced to English as their second language. Therefore, we need to acquire the competencies and innovative methodological approaches that our teachers need to improve their skills at this stage of education. The Danish educational system is renowned of being one of the best in Europe and English as a second language is introduced very early at schools.  Two teachers from our school will observe their methodology whereas two other participants will learn about the methodology used for the teaching of the English language as a mother tongue in the UK. Both activities will provide us with an example of good practices and how to teach literacy, communication, reading and listening comprehension on a different level.  Furthermore, another teacher will participate in a structured course to gain theoretical knowledge of modern pedagogical approaches and efficient didactic aids, whereas a second one will gain knowledge on how to effectively use creativity in different aspects of teaching.Secondly, modern technologies, which are close to our students as they have been exposed to them since childhood, come as a challenge for most of our teachers.  Therefore, we believe it is imperative to educate our teachers regarding the use of modern technology in the classroom.  The online classrooms that our teachers and students use are a great start but they are still very far from their full potential. Modern communication and the Internet technology provides people with a great deal of information nowadays as well as it enhances the internationalization of the school. One teacher from our school will obtain formation on how to use the ICT in the classroom, whereas another one will get acquainted with the use of computer tools and applications that enable communication with other members of a learning process. It needs to be pointed out that our teachers commute daily among three or four locations so it is imperative that one participant improves the competences in the field of management, organization, mediation and conflict resolution.Finally, we need to promote entrepreneurship to develop creativity, initiative, perseverance, cooperative work, responsibility and all the qualities required for the inclusion of our students in their future world of work. We intend to promote entrepreneurship and experiential learning.  Our goal is to provide a stimulating learning environment for the development of creative thinking in young people, so that they can develop into bold and successful individuals. The teacher who will mentor these workshops will be trained in a structured course entitled \u201cIntroduction of entrepreneurship in schools\u201d in order to gain global training on entrepreneurship, and will also observe a Danish school where the innovative approaches to problem solving are applied by using LEGOS.We are aware of the importance of the selection of participants with a dynamic, communicative and responsible profile to achieve our goals successfully. The Project committee will ensure our results\u2019 impact before, during and after the whole process, and   will monitor who, how and when to disseminate the results of the project, both locally and internationally, as the core of our impact and dissemination strategy. Such committee will also carry out the evaluation of the project results after each training activity through monthly reports, by the presentation and discussion of introducing new methods and by the interviews with students and teachers on the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of the new methodologies every six months.To conclude, we firmly believe that the sustainability of the new methodologies after the project is finished will finally ensure the successful improvements that we all expect on the fields described above.

Except providing business education in Slovak language, from the school year 2015/2016 the school opened a new field of study - business academy - bilingual study (Slovak-English). That is why it is necessary to get enough applicants for this study program. Our school would like to provide the students high-class education with qualified teachers. This is not possible without taking part in this project. Except providing the legal minimum, that means teaching at least three vocational subjects in English, our teachers are ready and willing to teach also other vocational and general subjects in English language.Aims of the project: The main aim of this project is to ensure the quality of bilingual education at school. Our school wants to become a prestigious school within the \u017dilina region and keep its proficiency by having qualified teachers with enough skills, competences, new ideas and experiences to ensure the  success of this field of study. Promotion, publicity and dissemination of the project achievements belong to the essential targets.Participants\u00b4profiles and their number: 11 teachers of both general and vocational subjects will take part in various courses enabling them to teach such subjects expertly. The selection of the courses has been done effectively and logigaly so as to set up the education in bilingual section with the greatest effort. The course \"Teaching business English\" is important mainly because of ensuring the way how to teach business English; the course \"Collegiality across Clil\" is necessary especially besause it is crucial to set up the cooperation among the English teachers and the teachers of theroretical and practical vocational subjects; the course \"CLIL is necessary because we have to cover the education of other general subjects in English language; the cources \"Teachers of English in vocational schools and Teachers in vocational schools\" are important for teaching English for vocational purposes and finally the course \"School development and quality evaluation \" give the principalship the ability to participate actively on the project. Methodology: particular activities of the project are planned in a logical order, chronologically, in accordance with the realisation of the courses; beginning with the selection of the participants upon pre-set criteria. Intercultural preparation will be ensured by the coordinator with the cooperation with an English lecturer. Organisational preparation will be managed by the coordinator with thecooperation with the partners. Monitoring of the project is its crucial part.Activities: Taking part in mobilities would give the teachers a great opportunity to use new  technologies for teaching English, make use of the software program Moodle, blended learning, create presentations, adopt business phrases, plan their lessons effectively, analyse and classify individual tasks, bring new study materials, exchange their experiences with other teachers. The project will help to set up the cooperation between the teachers of vocational subjects and general subjects in the bilingual section. The teachers as well as the principalship will have the opportunity to participate and observe relevant teaching lessons. The comparison between the Slovak and English educational systems could be  a great challenge for all the teachers to bring new methods, imagination and creativity into the teaching process. For the the teachers of English language it is a way how to become effective English teachers with using new methods, techniques, presentations, new words and phrases and how to motivate students by using various interesting activities. For the teachers of  vocational subjects it is a way how  to learn to teach English for the vocational purposes. For the principalship this project could be an opportuninty to exchange experiences and develop relations with directors from other European countries, practice their communication skills, get a different view how to solve various problematic situations at school. Results, impact and advantages: Undoubtably this project will have an impact not only on the participants themselves but it will have an impact on  all employees and students of the school. Taking into consideration that in the \u017dilina region there are a lot of foreign companies and institutions seeking for employess with language, communication and business skills, thanks to the project the school will have graduates ready for the labour market. The rate of unemployment will be lower. The implementation of this project will ensure our school success not only in the present days but especially in the future.

In the past, a huge part of these pupils didn't participate in the bilingual education. That's why we reformed our bilingual concept in 2007. Instead of classes we now have bilingual courses. As a consequence, there are fewer pupils who drop out, more boys and higher amount of children with migration background. We are now at a point of our development where we have reached a consolidation of the concept so that we can now go on working at it. For us that means broadening the range of subjects taught bilingually for example in the domains of science and art as well as involving new colleagues. In addition to this we have the aim to make it easier for refugee children to take part in bilingual courses at our school so that they are not isolated in their course of \"German as a foreign language\", but integrated in regular classes.The English department of our school consists of only 7 members, only 3 among them having studied to become a teacher of English. At the moment there are only three teachers responsible for providing the bilingual courses in Geography and History. Objectives of our project:In the focus there are teaching and intensifying the use of English as a foreign language and increasing the language competences of the participants as well as their motivation. In addition to this we are interested in material for the bilingual lessons and for the planning of teaching units and new teaching methods. All in all we aim at strenghtening and improving the bilingual education at our school.Number and profile of participants:Our team for improving the bilingual education at our school chose the following participants: Mrs Gladczak coordinated the bilingual education at Realschule Str\u00fcnkede, teaches Geography bilingually and is the head of the English department. Moreover she organises the regional network of English departments at secondary schools and trains probationary and experienced teachers. Mrs Korneffel is the deputy head of the English department at Realschule Str\u00fcnkede, head of the Art department and coordinated all cultural aspects and workshops at our school. She's also responsible for the drama group, the contact with the cooperation partner RuhrTriennale and assigns the \"Kompetenznachweis Kultur\", an educational pass of the Ministry of Education and Culture. Mr G\u00e4tz represents the natural sciences and is the head of department of Chemistry/Physics. He also works for the teachers' union. We expect that all participants can successfully invest their individual interests and strengths in the teachers' course.Description of the activities:The aforementioned teachers take part in the two week course 'C.L.I.L. - Content and language integrated learning - Methodology and language for teachers who teach their subject bilingually in English at secondary level' in Cheltenham from 7th August to 20th August 2016. Methodology to be used in carrying out the project:After having taken part in a course offered by International Study Programmes (ISP) in 2014 we are convinced that the above mentioned course will meet our expectations. ISP has more than 30 years of experience in organising teacher development courses for European Ministries of Education. It is an experienced provider of European Union founded programmes in the UK.

The project TIICEE aims at renovating the pedagogy in our school because we have to admit that too many pupils aren't interested in learning any more and we, teachers, find really difficult to motivate them. We need to teach differently and they need to learn differently too. We have listed our priorities: first we think that it is vital to widen their intercultural approach so that they can fit in tomorrow's world at best. Through E-Twinning or other exchange projects they should become aware of the necessity to understand another language and work with citizens from the European Union. Then we think that the pupils must use the ITC tools intelligently and properly. Finally we need to develop the \"working together\", the autonomy, the creativity and the choice-making process in all the teenagers so that they can find a good job. A group of 6 teachers and a member of staff have volunteered to attend training sessions about various topics all through Europe. The structured courses with school visits (\"job shadowing\") are meant to observe and understand new and innovating teaching practices in countries such as Iceland, Finland or Ireland. Other training sessions are more specialized and concern the science teacher, the sports teacher, drama techniques  and ITC tools. Finally a training session about the European citizenship and multiculturality is also planned. The teachers  will implement these new teaching techniques but also take part in new European partnerships and projects.

This will facilitate teachers\u2019 access to ways of refreshing their teaching methodologies, skills and competences involving the new technologies to be integrated in the normal teaching practice.The objectives of the project are: -to support the professional development of the teaching staff with regard to methodology, educational techniques and strategies; -to generate linguistic acquisitions (especially of the new developments in foreign languages) and communication skills for the language teachers; -to raise awareness of countries and cultures among the project participants, by professionally connecting with others at a European level, for having an active social role and refining our sense of European identity and citizenship; -to consolidate fair high standards of and positive appreciation for our schooling institution in the community so that it may efficiently respond to all learners\u2019 needs, through attractive programmes and activities; -to ensure greater acknowledgement of our teaching competences freshly developed at the training courses abroad.Six teachers (2 English teachers, 2 French teachers and 2 of Humanistics) will benefit from the teacher development activities in this project; their selection was based on the conclusion of the SWOT analysis that most deficiencies concern the Humanities department. Some participants have never accessed European funds for professional development, others accessed such grants a rather long time ago. Thus a new training course will help them to improve or gain teaching skills, methods and techniques with a generalised impact on education, facilitate integration of the new technologies in classwork, increase abilities to present and produce new learning materials, and to motivate youth in the discovery of cultures and civilizations (especially of English and French expression) and of the latest theories and practices from their specialisations.The main activities of the project are: participation in the courses (workshops, debates, discussions, field trips, teamwork), dissemination, (self)evaluation and practical translation of the fresh knowledge and strategies into the class environment and beyond. These will exert a favourable long-term impact on our institution due to more professionals enabled to create an educational offer of good quality, really useful extra-curricular activities for the students, better partnership with their parents and the community. Another point worth considering is the prestige factor for the school and how relevant such projects are in the external assessment of the institution and of each member of the teaching staff, on account of their enriched teaching methodologies and the know-how of integrating sensibly the new technologies for each particular discipline. What is more, the student beneficiaries will implicitly be able to develop thinking skills, creativity, problem-solving skills. Thus the students\u2019 keener interest in applying the new information and building personal autonomy for the mature life stage will lead to their social and professional integration, including the disadvantaged categories and minorities, and also to a sustained lifelong learning.", "http://International-Study-Programmes.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-RO01-KA101-023237_4"], ["4EB", "Abriendo las puertas a Europa: El IES Al-Q\u00e1zeres en el mapa", "International Study Programmes", 16699.0, "\u201cOpening the Doors to Europe: Al-Q\u00e1zeres High School on the Map\u201d is a project framed in Key Action 101, within the Erasmus+ framework programme.

Therefore, this project aims at a double objective:On the one hand, \u201cOpening the Doors to Europe\u201d responds to a necessity the school has found in order to increase the presence of the European Dimension of Education within our lessons. One of the aims for the European Strategy 2020 is the training for the European conscience. Thus, one of our top priorities is to provide education able to generate competent European civilians.On the other hand, \u201cAl-Q\u00e1zeres High School on the Map\u201d is in relation with what has been established above because, if Europe is part of our educational reality, we shouldn\u2019t forget we are members of Europe; so the door opening should promote fluctuations between both directions. Therefore, through the improvement on the quality of our projects, we\u2019ll be able to situate ourselves onto the European map in order to offer Europe what Europe offers to us.This project is open to our entire educational community, although only 11 teachers (one of them from the Counselling Department and another one of them belonging to the Administration Team) and 1 member of our non-teaching staff. Each mobility formative activity implies a determined professional profile and a series of settlements each candidate should compromise to fulfill.Our mobility activities proposed are framed within the training and the observation of good educational practices, done through partners whose quality has been demonstrated through their participation in other European initiatives. These activities will take place during 24 months.Among the results and the foreseen impact on the participants, the school and its area of influence, the following can be mentioned:-Improvement on the competence to manage quality projects, whether European or not, on the side of the school staff.-Improvement on our dissemination and sustainability plans, whether for European projects or not, on the side of the school staff.-Creation of a \u201cEuropean teamwork\u201d competent enough to deliver quality European Educational Projects.-Improvement on the methodological competences on the side of the school staff, which will impact on the qualifications rise on the students\u2019 side.-Decrease in the early school dropout rate, which will imply better training opportunities and more possibilities to access quality jobs.-Possibility to be located onto the European map, increasing links among both public and private institutions, catering for a direct communication between equals.-For the Educational Administration, the possibility to count with a group of competent teachers able to train other teachers from adjacent schools, improving the communication links between schools framed within the same socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds; teachers who can deliver quality presentations.For all which has been established before, this project will allow Al-Q\u00e1zeres High School to develop their first two phases of our European Development Plan, so that we can establish one or more Strategic Partnership framed within KA-2 with quality and sustainable projects.", "http://International-Study-Programmes.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA101-023372_4"], ["4EB", "Kreativn\u00ed p\u0159\u00edstupy k v\u00fduce ciz\u00edho jazyka", "International Study Programmes", 10069.0, "SOS a SOU, Hradec Kralove, Vocelova 1338, is an educational institution, which provides education in automobile mending, transport and construction.

Moreover, in some VET subjects, we are teaching currently in English.  Nowadays we have to employ English teachers to teach with the responsible subject teacher due the fact that this teacher has not the competences in English.2. Number and profile of participantsWe propose 16 participants,  distinguishing the following profiles:a) Teachers who want to improve their language skills in Englishb) Teachers of non-linguistic subjects who want to start or deepen in CLIL methodologyc) Teachers who want to improve the skills of managing a school3. Description of activities:We propose 3 types of activities: a) Linguistic and cultural training:  improvement of language skillsb) Training in CLIL methodology: improving the methodological tools that are available to teach non-language subjects in Englishc) Job shadowing: visit a school for observation of management tasks4.

A survey which was conducted among the teachers, parents of our students and parents of our prospective students revealed that there is a large interest in the change of teaching quality and the prospect of being open to the world. We have asked our respondents to indicate specific goals for a good modern school. After analysis of the questionnaires and taking into account our teachers\u2019 opinions, we made a diagnosis of our possibilities and stated that changes are needed.Our response is the project entitled \u201dSchool of success \u2013 a creative and innovative teacher\u201d, where we described methods for modernising and a positive change in the quality of our work.The project is related to:- implementation of our school\u2019s European Development Plan,- extensive cooperation with institutions from whole Europe,- improving results of teaching and education.In order to achieve this aim dependably prepared teachers are needed. The conducted survey revealed poor command of English among 90% of our teachers and insufficient ICT skills. We are aware that they are essential in advanced process of teaching. These are the reasons why we want to offer courses for 19 teachers in our project.OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT ARE:- to provide language skills for our teachers in order to enable them to participate in European programmes for training and educating the youth. Good command of English will enable them to participate in implementation of eTwinning projects, mobilities to other countries as parts of \u201dErasmus+\u201d strategic partnerships projects and international exchanges,- to prepare our teachers to teach their school subjects in a bilingual class which we intend to introduce,- to use ICT and effective methods while teaching school subjects in class,- to use the opportunities given by interactive whiteboards, e-learning platform and eTwinning projects in the process of teaching,- to support didactics by using tablets and iPads during lessons,- to show the teachers that learning can be efficient and attractive,- to overcome cultural barriers and fear.DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES; PROFILES AND NUMBER OF TEACHERS:- methodical and language course to prepare for teaching in a CLIL class \u2013 6 teachers (3 scientific subjects teachers, 3 humanities teachers) who will use Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) in their work.

Our primary objective is to achieve an inclusive school with equal opportunities for all our students. Our students with special educational needs need to be provided with innovative and enterprising methodological updates. After a thorough analysis of our strengths and weaknesses, we have determined that the use of traditional methodologies can generate unmotivated students. Such students end up becoming part of the rates of school failure in Primary Education and High School early drop-out.  Our objective is, therefore, the use of modern and innovative methodologies around creativity and entrepreneurship, and the creation of a website for the effective dissemination of our learnings and results.Firstly, we need to promote entrepreneurship to develop creativity, initiative, perseverance, cooperative work, responsibility and all the qualities required for the inclusion of our students in the world of work in the 21st century. We are convinced that entrepreneurship is the bridge that we need to bring society and school together, and it is for this reason that, apart from acquiring global training on entrepreneurship, we intend to implement the use of LEGOS following the Danish model in our classrooms and do a publicity campaign to promote the work and ideas of local ecological associations. Likewise, after getting training in the use of creativity within the British educational system, we intend to influence the intellectual, emotional and relational development of our students. Finally, we consider it necessary to obtain formation on how to create a website and strategies to successfully disseminate our learnings at local and international levels.To carry out our objectives successfully, we are aware of the importance of the selection of participants with a dynamic, communicative and responsible profile to disseminate methodologies and planned activities inside and outside our team. The school has determined that we need six international mobilities to achieve our goals. In order to guarantee that we develop these objectives, discussion, monitoring, evaluation, and economic committees have been created, which will ensure, each in its area of responsibility, the successful reach of agreements and commitments by all the parties.The committees will ensure our results\u2019 impact before, during and after the project is implemented.  The goal is to anticipate and assess at any time the effect of our activities and their results not only in the participants, but in our institution and the rest of partner organizations, both locally and internationally. The committees are also responsible to monitor and control who, how and when to disseminate the results of our project, both locally and internationally, providing a model of dissemination strategy as well as the tools that will be used for that purpose. As a prime example, we have made a drawing contest with students and families from the school, in which we could gather ideas from drawings with the Erasmus+ logo, the acronym KA1 and our students\u2019 ideal school. We take this as a first example of the use of entrepreneurship and active use of creativity. The results, as well as the characteristics of the outline of this project, have been published in our website. We intend to achieve wider and deeper knowledge from other educational systems so we don\u2019t stop there. At the international level, we are also going to publish our expectations and results on the eTwinning website.As a conclusion, we aim to ensure the sustainability of the new methodologies during and after the process. The evaluation of the achievements and the impact as described on the above paragraphs will be made public. Our goal is to set new educational models and continue spreading our experiences at national and international level through media and effective web dissemination.

There has been selected a teacher of languages who gives classes in the stages of Primary and Secondary in most of the courses and to the boss of the department of Sciences who supervises and coordinates the subjects of Sciences in all the stages (in English or German).The selection of the partners has been based, on the one hand in the experience and recognition that they offer in the field of the bilingual education and in the integration of the learning language and contents (\" International Study Programmes \"), and on the other hand,  in the consolidation of relation-ship with one of the partners (\" Deutsch Franz\u00f6siche Gymnasium - Lyc\u00e9e Franco-Allemand \"), which we have worked and collaborated years ago in different projects that improve and promote the intercultural relations of our pupils.The activities proposed for the improvement of our bilingual system are an experience of \" job shadowing \" in a French German center successfully in his bilingual system and bicultural. The formation consists of going to different classes of several subjects where contents integrated with languages are taught. Finishing this activity ,a document of  \"good practices in bilingualism \" will be elaborate ; our partner will evaluate it, and then, it will be announced to the personnel of the center and it will be the contents of a workshop of training to teachers of the schools and of other centers nearby our locality.Our college integrates the learning language with the contents of the subjects of sciences, therefore we look for an improvement of this methodology with a formation in integrated learning of languages and contents related to the subjects of Sciences (CLIL) in a center with great experience in this methodology.The activities of formation will serve as reference to the personnel of the center to improve the quality of the language teaching methodology and valuing an extension of the bilingual system for the stage of Secondary. The materials and resources elaborated after the activities, will be a model for the professorship of the center and of other centers of the locality, reaching, at least, most of teachers of primary and secondary of the center (approximately 50 teachers) and to an approximate number of 500 pupils.For the development of the school, it is an improvement of the quality and of the methodology in the education and learning of foreign languages.", "http://International-Study-Programmes.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA101-023765_2"], ["4EB", "Internacjonalizacja i poniesienie jako\u015bci kszta\u0142cenia w naszej plac\u00f3wce", "International Study Programmes", 12218.0, "The educational project \"Internationalisation and improvement of quality of education in our institution\" described in this application form to be realised within Key Action 1 of Erasmus + aims at fulfilling the needs of Zesp\u00f3l Szkolno-Przedszkolny in \u0141ysa G\u00f3ra resulting from the School European Development Plan and the needs related to professional development of schoolteachers due to proper selection of courses abroad. It is the most complex and influential activity that we have undertaken so far, not only in terms of its substantive content but also in terms of the number of participants involved.  It has been planned that 4 out of 14 our schoolteachers will take part in the project. They are expected to participate in 12 training activities abroad in such European countries as Ireland, the Czech Republic, Greece, Scotland, Spain and Malta, which undoubtedly will contribute to multicultural and multinational experience and to development of related competences. Three out of all planned educational mobilities are language courses related to improving communication skills in the English language. The remaining courses are more specialized and deal with such topics as formative assessment, CLIL methodology, gamification, e-learning and methods and techniques connected with individualisation and optimization of the process of teaching also in case of pupils with special educational needs. All the training activities abroad will be conducted in English. Some of them incorporate the elements of so-called job-shadowing. As a result of this aspect the participants will have the opportunity to observe the examples of good educational practices. Among the teachers chosen as participants in the project through the fair, open and based on clear regulations process of recruitment are the teacher of English, the teacher of Polish and Art and the teacher of early primary education, as well as the librarian responsible also for the school common room.    The project has been planned and prepared with the use of elements of the Logical Framework Methodology, which is the tool recommended by the European Commission. It has been aimed at ensuring financial effectiveness and smooth implementation of project-related assumptions resulting in obtaining long-lasting results. All activities to be undertaken are coordinated and closely related to one another. The general plan of logistic and practical support for the participants has been outlined involving cultural and linguistic support before each mobility, as well as the plan of project management involving preparatory stage, implementation of new solutions in our school, evaluation activities on individual and institutional level and large-scale dissemination activities.  We are convinced that the realisation of this project will be linked with measurable benefits not only for the participants of mobilites but also for ZSP in \u0141ysa G\u00f3ra including pupils and individuals from other organisations.

The integration of international and intercultural dimension into the aims, function and offer of our institution is also expected. It will contribute to the increase in its competitiveness within the D\u0119bno borough. Moreover, we expect that the project will help to improve educational results of our students, at the same time preparing teachers and, indirectly, students for undertaking activities in multicultural and multilingual environment.    Among potential long-term benefits in the aftermath of the project realisation, the positive and inspiring influence on the future plan of strategic development of our institution needs to be mentioned. It will be enriched with innovative solutions and pedagogical experiments and it will aim at achieving European priorities and strategy \"Europe 2020.\" From the global perspective we will contribute to positive influence on the whole system of national educational policy due to realization of horizontal policies of the European Union as result of the fact that we will become the part of the elite group of Polish schools benefiting from financial support of the European Union.

Currently, it holds 650 students whose families are economically damaged due to the high unemployment rate, the closure of small and medium enterprises decicated to the manufacture of shoes and toys which traditionally have provided job offers here and in the province. Our school has 27 teaching units which accomplish an educational offer for Secondary Compulsory Education, A Levels , Higher Vocational Training Education  (International Trade and Esthetic), Medium Vocational Training Education (Trade and Hairdressing)and also Lower Vocational Training in Trade, Esthetic and Hairdressing. From the very beginning, the senior administrative team has worked hard to establish contact to different companies (in our region and some European countries such as the UK or France) so that students could do an internship with them. Besides, our school has been assigned to improvement programs offered by the educational administration at different levels. The main aim is to provide an education of quality, prevent school dropouts, and help our students in order to enter in the labour market. In this school year 2015-16, there are 63 teachers, most of them young and dynamic, with a permanent position who have accepted pleasingly these challenges. In this way, we consider relevant the development of a Plurilingual Program in English based on the CLIL methodology. To achieve that, in the school year 2012-13 we started a training program course for teachers as well as on-line training courses in English offered by \u2018Conseller\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte\u2019 of the Valencian Community and Official School of Languages. Both of them have helped some teachers to obtain a B2 Certificate in English as well as a knowlegde of CLIL methodology.

Furthermore, in order to modernise and internationalize education, the school has recently developed a European Development Plan. According to it, by this form, we ask for six actions of the KA 101: three actions to widen our knowledge of how to implement a CLIL methodology and improve our written and oral skills in English in both the linguistic and the scientific area; two actions for the English department to update their knowledge about method strategies and materials to help the other departments to take part in the Plurilingual program.

We also think that our staff should learn more modern teaching approaches available for use in schools today in order to provide successful learning experiences beyond the traditional \u2018chalk and talk\u2019 way of teaching. The school of the 21st Century should provide environments and experiences which allow students to build up their knowledge in interaction with peers and teachers of different backgrounds and different geographical locations.  Global networking and new technologies can also facilitate learning appropriate to a fast changing world. We find that the international courses, which bring together people from different countries and different types of organizations, is a great opportunity for exchange of good, innovative teaching methods and tools, which is a great and valuable addition for our organization as a whole, not just for the members of the staff, who will go to the mobility, because they will transfer their newly gained knowledge to other members of our staff.

Many of our partners have expressed desire and interest to choose our organization for their future mobility exchanges and therefore we would like to start training and education our staff members in the key competences, necessary for developing host activities in the EU context.The training programmes and structured courses we chose will:-  help our staff to improve their skills and competencies in key areas such as communication in English in European contexts, cognitive and critical thinking strategies, collaborative strategies, planning and evaluation- help our staff to gain and use new, innovative methods and approaches, especially designed according to different age and interest groups they address at their work; - contribute to the quality of our staff\u2019s teaching and to the development of staff - help our administration, teaching and training staff to develop professional competencies and to organise and co-ordinate cross-curricular activities by using an inquiry-based learning process in a local community.These activities should make it possible to experience a number of key aspects which should meet the training needs of teachers and staff in our institution and will contribute to the development of staff\u2019s knowledge, skills and attitudes as decision-makers in the design, management and implementation of quality curriculum-making and international projects and help our organization towards developing ai international curriculum which would enable us to become a host organization for teachers and students from all over Europe.We will choose 6 participants who are members of our administrative and teaching staff and who are in any way involved in international projects. Participants in the chosen training programmes are expected to develop their language skills in English by engaging in cooperative group work, by carrying out interviews to local people, by participating in seminars and hands-on workshops, by trying out new methods in practice, in the field, on computers and various workshops.   Sessions will promote interaction among participants in the whole programme and every effort will be made to provide a collaborative learning environment. An interactive communicative approach is applied, which provides participants with experiential learning. Participants develop their fluency through discussion about current affairs and topics of general interest.We want to do this project because we wish to send the members of our staff to international and highly qualitative courses and programmes for the professional development of their competences, incorporating a European dimension of education in all its activities and promoting the exchange of ideas and best teaching practices as fundamental pillars of its methodological approach.Our plan is to become not only a sending but also a host organization for international exchanges and trainings.

Key Action 1: Mobility - for schools and preschool institutions which lasts 12 months, in the period November 1st, 2017 to October 10th, 2018.\r\n\r\nThe project submitter is the \"Ma\u0161tolend\" Preschool Institution from Novi Sad. The development of high-quality pedagogical and educational programmes for working with children of different age is a permanent goal of the people employed in preschool institutions. One of good ways to achieve it is co-operation and sharing of experience, knowledge and skills among the employees in the educational institutions throughout Europe. International partnership is key for developing high-quality curricula for the pedagogical and educational institutions in future.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the main aim of the Project is as follows: to support professional development of the employees through long-term programmes of international partnership and through the creation of the international contact network; to get familiar with contemporary educational programmes and learning strategies for different  age groups; to improve foreign language skills of children and educators, as well as to improve professional skills in ICT technologies.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet the set goals, we have planned a number of mobilities in which an educator, an English teacher and four pre-school teachers took part. Mobilities included job shadowing activities, courses, visits to kindergartens and schools, and participation in joint projects. The Pre-school Institution from Slovenia is specialised in information and communications technology and uses the CLIL methodology in teaching English language, whereas the Educational Centre from Greece is specialised in Reggio Emilia Approach and outdoor learning. The courses in Great Britain will offer us an adequate theoretical foundation and an insight into practical activities. The stay in these three partner centres and getting familiar with their work will contribute to meeting our needs and to achieving our goals.\r\n\r\nThe project would result in the improved professional competences of the project participants and their application of contemporary educational approaches and learning strategies (Reggio Emilia Approach, outdoor learning, integration of educational contents into a project-oriented education, etc.); new Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) methodology; and digital competences. Long-term effects of the project would be further networking of professionals throughout Europe, experience sharing, co-operation on joint projects, and development of a high-quality preschool curriculum inspired by having gained some insight into contemporary European practice.", "http://International-Study-Programmes.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-RS01-KA101-000071_2"], ["4EB", "Engelskl\u00e6rere fra Arktis til Storbritannia I", "International Study Programmes", 9551.0, "This project is a two week language course/tuition in the UK with five participating teachers from Raa Upper Secondary School in Northern  Norway.

This is the first of many projects aimed at increasing competences in the teaching staff at our school. The following years we will apply for Erasmus+ grants within the subjects of natural sciences, foreign languages (German and Spanish), and vocational programmes Health and Social Care and Restaurant and Food Processing to ensure teaching staff here a similar possibility to increase knowledge, competence and skills.\r\n\r\nThe tuition is quality assured by a longtime professional institution with decades og experience in supplying specific training and courses for language teachers. \"International Study Programmes\" in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe background for the application is the expressed wish from national and regional authorities that teaching staff should perpetually develop their skills and competences. Our claim is also that more competent and confident teachers showing great enthusiasm in their subject will counteract school drop-outs. Furthermore will this most likely increase the student's chances to master the basic skills in a somewhat difficult area, the English language.\r\n\r\nOn a local level at our school the motivation for participating in an Erasmus+ project with teacher mobilities is also coloured by the fact that our shcool needs to be as attractive and appealing as possible to get as many students as possible to apply here.

The course will enable teachers to explore different aspects of modern life and culture in Britain; it will help to explore different ways to teach intercultural awareness as it also includes visits with commentary in major places in Cambridge.\r\nThe last course an upper primary teacher from our school would like to take part is in German language, as it is planned for a German teacher. The course \u201cMethods & Language\u201d takes place in Regensburg and informs about the current teaching trends, develops the skills for communication-oriented teaching.

The aim of the school is to develop vocational education and training in selected subjects being taught in English. Our school takes interest in providing students with a quality education with qualified teaching staff, which is intended to be accomplished  through the participation of teachers in mobility abroad.\r\nThe main objective of the project is to improve the quality of teaching vocational subjects focusing on art and design through training in the English language, to enable teaching staff with both  professional and language experience abroad, simultaneously  adapting to new social and working environment and afterwards to  increase the role of the school in the European Union zone. Private Secondary School of Art in \u017dilina wants to maintain its unique position in the \u017dilina region and to ensure the proficiency of the teaching  by employing  qualified teachers  with sufficient skills, competencies and experience that will ensure the sustainability of secondary vocational education focusing on visual art and design. Promotion, media coverage and dissemination of project results are part of the specific project objectives and main activities.\r\nFive members of teaching staff will participate in mobility project  through participation in structured courses which will enable them to teach comprehensive/theoretical  and vocational subjects as well  in English language. The selection of training courses has been made in effective and logical way to set up the training instruction in  vocational subjects focused on art in English language.\r\nThe course \"Language and Methodology Refresher\" (July 2017) for one participant is aimed at improving the language skills of teachers of English in secondary schools, exploring various aspects of language teaching and methodology of teaching foreign languages. The course \"One Week Course for Teachers of Art and Design\" (October 2017) is designed for two teachers of practical training in the areas of art, design and art history. Course \"Collegiality across CLIL\" (October 2017) focused on the use of CLIL methodology in the educational process and  is designed for a single teacher who will  teach theoretical vocational subjects bilingually. Course \"One Week Course for Primary and Secondary Headteachers (February 2018) provides insight into education at primary and secondary schools in the UK and it  is designed for one teacher.\r\nIndividual project activities are planned in a logical structure and chronologically according to date of completion of particular courses, starting with the selection of individual course participants in conformity with pre set criteria. The intercultural preparation will be provided to participants by a project coordinator in co-operation with the representative of Cambridge Study residing in \u017dilina. The organizational preparation will be managed by project  coordinator  in collaboration with partner organizations  in timely manner prior to the implementation of mobility. \r\nThe participation in mobility gives teachers the opportunity to use new methods, forms and means in the educational process of secondary vocational education of art subjects. Mobility project will interconnect the cooperation between teachers in general-education subjects and vocational subjects  with art orientation. Teaching staff and management of the  school will have an opportunity to participate in vocational teaching in English after the implementation of the  mobility outcomes into school documentation in the school year 2018/2019. Comparing of the educational system in Slovakia and the UK will be a challenge for other teachers how to bring  new methods, imagination and creativity into the teaching process. For teachers in general-education subjects and foreign languages the mobility shapes the way how to become more effective by using new methods, techniques in the English language and also a way of motivating students for experiential learning. For teachers of vocational art subjects the project is a way of learning how to teach vocational subjects in English. For school management the mobility project will be an opportunity for exchanging experience and developing relationships with headmasters of schools and educational institutions from other parts of Europe, as well as the opportunity to practise communication skills and get a different view on solving different problems in schools.\r\nMobility project will have an impact not only on the course participants, but also on all teaching staff and students of the school. Given the fact that in \u017dilina region there are many foreign based companies and institutions searching employees with foreign language, communication and art skills the school will offer graduates well prepared for the labour market needs.

The acquired abilities will be used in school to motivate pupils, especially those at risk of dropping out. New skills will help to motivate and involve students more effectively. The project will be offered to an institution already involved with European projects, which are a part of its plan of the educational offering. The project is aimed at promoting a wider European dimension in order to improve on the members of staff's language, pedagogical and methodological competences and to better cope with the growing needs of immigrant children and of students with special educational needs. \r\nThe staff participating in the project, selected from both primary and lower secondary school levels, will have the opportunity to improve their language competences, share and compare their pedagogical approaches, try out new different technological tools, and re-think about their beliefs in a multi-cultural environment.  We have chosen to attend courses at ISP because the school has years of experience in organizing training courses for teachers and has a good reputation for delivering quality services. Many teachers of our Comprensivo have already attended courses offered by ISP with great satisfaction and fallow up of what has been learned about the department colleagues. We have analyzed the wide variety of development courses, not only for teachers of English and CLIL, but also for teachers of other disciplines, including science, music, art and theater. Each chosen course seem to be designed to meet the training needs of our teacher. Those we identified meet the specific needs expressed by the teachers of our Institute and the needs revealed by our students. The teachers will take part in structured learning activities in training courses at centres in the UK, specifically aiming at improving their language, pedagogical, methodological or subject-matter competence and their cultural awareness. This new acquired competences will be used to perform the daily tasks, as well as to promote innovative activities once back home (eg. CLIL modules or the use of new technologies for their students, especially for those with special needs). They will cope with the challenge of using a foreign language for learning, teaching and for everyday routines, thus applying their old skills to new and wider contexts. They will be expected to help, plan, deliver, and evaluate their training activities by means of formal and informal tools, and use the eTwinning platform to get in touch and remain in contact with partners and fellow participants from different schools and countries. Participation in the courses allows to build both professional and personal relationships that last over time, with the exchange of materials among teachers, students and schools, as well as the planning of multilateral projects of common interest. Exchange and cooperation between foreign colleagues and students is a guarantee of quality in education, especially from a European prospective. It also permits the aimed and finalized use of TIC. The school has several members of staff  currently involved in Erasmus+KA2, and Twinning and Clil activities, motivating and enriching projects for all concerned that concretely contribute towards the establishment of an identity as European citizens. It stimulates social cohesion and active participation as members of society.\r\nExpected results and longer-term benefits include increased awareness of students' needs, higher motivation of both teachers and students, better use of materials already present in the institution, more informed decisions about teaching and learning to complement the school educational plan. A multiplying effect is also envisaged insofar as the involved staff would share their new competences in informal ways at school and during more formal training events open to staff of other schools, local communities and associations operating within the municipality, as well as start and participate in transnational eTwinning projects. \r\nAll the materials will be upload on the school website and disseminate as we have decided in our plan.

The decision to send them abroad for training comes from the needs the school has as it would like to introduce ICT tools in the classroom, that is, implement the project Innovative Pedagogy 1:1. The headmaster, teachers, School Student Community and Parents Council have expressed their wish to modernize teaching, to integrate the use of tablets and smartphones in the classroom and encourage students and teachers to be innovative and creative at work. We want teachers to acquire new competencies and skills to work with students and engage students to use ICT tools independently and thus enable them to understand social, language and cultural diversity in Europe. We want to encourage students to take initiative, to acquire skills to work with ICT and improve their communication. We wish students to become confident and look for educational and professional opportunities in the European Union. \r\nThe participants of the training will be actively involved in seminars and structured educational visits, talk to teachers and pedagogical workers, learn new forms and methods of teaching and compare them with the traditional school practice in Slovenia. The programmes of all seminars include presentations and lectures on cultures and traditions of host countries. New acquired knowledge will be disseminated among their colleagues at school and in the local community. Training will be beneficial for the teaching and other staff at school as they will gain new insights into education despite not participating in seminars. Different means will be used to disseminate the results of training: the school website, Facebook, print media (educational and local magazines and newspapers), Open Days, study meetings organized by the National Institute of Education, SIRIKT etc.\r\nTraining and seminars will have a positive effect on our students. New contemporary teaching methods will make traditional ways of teaching more interesting, especially modern foreign languages and science subjects. Students will learn by using ICT tools and learn to take initiative, develop digital competencies, communication skills in foreign languages. Introducing ICT tools in teaching makes students be more motivated to study, which in turn means it would reduce the number of drop-out students and also increase the interest of potential students to enter our school. ICT tools make it possible for the children with special needs and immigrant children to be easily integrated in the new school environment and encourage them to improve their persistence to complete their education.\r\nWe want to send our teachers and pedagogical workers for training abroad to improve their teaching practice and enable them to follow the needs of students with special needs and offer immigrant students lessons in Slovene language as soon as possible. For this reason, our school needs to cooperate with schools abroad and exchange experience with teachers from foreign countries and organizations. In this way the school would find it easier to plan formal and informal education, boost team spirit and cooperation among the school workers and the local community, improve planning of international projects and strengthen cooperation with foreign partners. If we get involved in international projects, we will become active members of the European teachers' network.\r\nThe outcome of training is seen in the improvement of the school development plan. It is believed that a model of sustainable structures and school innovations will be created (an improved and increased communication in foreign languages, the use of tablets in most classrooms, a rise in international cooperation). Regarding the school enrolment for 2017/2018 one class of students will be taught following the principles of the Innovative Pedagogy 1:1 method and teachers will be encouraged to teach in this class.\r\nLong-term effects will be visible at the level of work with talented students, students with special needs and immigrants. It will be easier to follow them and they will be monitored more frequently. A special importance will be given to the results of the school leaving exams and enrolment in our school.

Teachers must have the opportunity to try new practices, acquire new roles and create a culture of enquire-based learning. The development of teachers also means offering opportunities to critically reflect on its practices and building  new  content knowledge  and pedagogy.\r\nResearch has shown that good teaching practices can do more to break down the indifference of students  than extraordinary efforts to motivate them directly. Many students react positively to a very well organized and developed lessons  by a motivated teacher who has a genuine interest in the students and in what they learn.

In addition, it serves as a basis for the planning and execution of projects with an alternative concept: two-week placements in cooperation with tried and new partners with the objective of exchanging views and experience of professional practice through company visits and discussion with all of those involved in vocational training. Furthermore, relevant topics can be included flexibly, e.g. current developments in the EU.\r\n\r\nOur contact to Lyc\u00e9e Pierre de Coubertin, Calais, will be reactivated.

Sitting in on lessons, company visits as well as extramural activities provide for enhanced intercultural competence and the opportunity for didactic reflection and development.\r\n\r\nThe relationship with Omnia, in Espoo, Finland, should develop along similar lines, whereby English will be paramount.

As our English department expands and is strengthened through the Vocational College English Qualification at the Oldenburg Further Education Centre, Liverpool runs a particularly apposite intensive course culminating in the Cambridge Teaching Knowledge Test (TKT). Participants not only consolidate specific vocabulary, but also through teaching their main subject to the Liverpool study group explore, expand and develop didactic approaches. A parallel course offered by the established International Study Programme gives us even greater flexibility to enable our staff to acquire further qualifications.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have offered our apprentices the professional KMK English Language certificate at Level B2. The successful initiation of the Europakaufmann qualification in cooperation with five other internationally engaged Bremen vocational colleges has attracted 47 participants in 2017.

We will now make a vigorous effort in our different school units and have recruited \u201cfirst teachers\u201d that will develop the educational goals from EU 2020,\u201cVision 2025\u201d- the municipality of Varberg\u2019s own development plan and our own European development plans.  This application is part of a long-term and on-going process to reach the goals on a local as well as on a global level. In the long term our efforts will lead to a better education, increased literacy and language skills, better mathematical skills, an understanding of the transnational society, an understanding in how to develop a sustainable future and an increased employability. In the short term will the teachers\u2019 increased knowledge result in better teaching methods,make more studeents choose higher courses in mathematics, give the students opportunities to achieve better result, more students will fulfill their education and be better prepared for further studies. This work will be part of our daily routine both in short and in the long run. All our activities will be impregnated by a formative approach where the learners will be participating in their own learning process. Activities such as: reading and literacy projects, entrepreneurial learning, mathematical projects and sustainable developmen with special focus on Circular Economy. The internationalisation will make us advance quicker with trends that already have been proven useful in other places. Increased mobility means references that we can share and develop in our schools but and in the municipality. Accordingly with the general goals of EU2020 are we emphasising entrepreneurship in all kind of education to increase the quality and the results in our educations. This project will prevent early withdrawal, increase the employability, give improved language skills, European Citizenship,  entrepreneurial learning and sustainable development.  The elementary focus will be that our developing activities are high-quality work for everyone. Not only the participating teacher (mobilities) are able to participate in the activities/development. Everyone will be given an opportunity to implement and develop the new knowledge. Conferences, dialogues, meetings,  seminars, workshops, lectures and presentations are examples of how we will share the information all over the schools and the municipality. The project will be shared on Facebook, e-Twinning, the UF-page jaewb.org and in regional and local working groups the local papers. Learners, teachers and other staff will evaluate the new experiences with questioners, self-assessment of own goals and dialogues. Since we are aiming for a long-term development will we be using statistics, grades. The group in charge of the project will be responsible for all agreements, insurances, economy, the follow-up, evaluation and reports.", "http://International-Study-Programmes.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA101-038754_4"], ["4EB", "We Open Wide the School and the Minds", "International Study Programmes", 34680.0, "THE PROJECT WOW AT THE INSTITUTION SAINTE MARIE RIBEAUVILLE\r\nThe KA1 project  WOW (We Open Wide the school and the Minds) takes place in the Institution Sainte Marie in Ribeauvill\u00e9 in Alsace, France member of la Fondation Providence de Ribeauvill\u00e9. The school is composed of a primary school, a lower secondary school and a boarding school for girls and boys. We have 320 pupils. 12 members of staff of which 8 secondary school teachers, 2 primary teachers and 2 members of the administrative staff have decided to get involved in the project.\r\nRESPECT OF EACH PERSON AND OPENNESS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD\r\nTwo priorities have been identified. First, the staff of our school (teachers, educational staff, administrative staff, the Principal) has noticed that our students  coming from very heteregoneous backgrounds don't necessarily show respect to their classmates, the staff members, the material or the premises. \r\nWe welcome in our boarding schools at any time during the year new students due to social, educational, financial or other motives   Some students also leave us during the year for the same reasons. It is our duty to welcome them in our institution as best we can, to enable them to trust us, to help them like school, the place where they can get the best preparation for their future professional life.  Respect towards each person  must be shown so that our students feel good at school. A renovated, active and personalized policy of welcoming everybody, trying to understand everyone, whether be it when they first arrive or during their stay with us is vital.  The project WOW aims at welcoming everyone in our school in the respect of his/her past taking his/her weaknesses and strenghts into account.  A positive and tolerant atmosphere will enable our students to concentrate on school. Our second priority is to open the school towards the outside world: the town, the charities in our region and the parents. We want to open the doors of our school and work with them for a better understanding of each other. Finally we think that it is vital to widen our intercultural approach so that our students can fit in tomorrow's world at best. Through E-Twinning or other exchange projects they should become aware of the necessity to understand another language and work with citizens from the European Union. Focus on foreign language is then essential.\r\nTRAINING SESSIONS FOR A PERSONALIZED APPROACH AND OPPENNESS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD\r\nA group of 12 staff members have volunteered to attend training sessions about various topics all through Europe. The courses dealing with Multiple Intelligences, preventing bullying, Hidden Talent in your classroom or Inclusive teaching were chosen to help us understand how we can better work wih our students.  Partnership with the outside world will be achieved through a training session about the way to discover the city and observation in a finnish school. Other training sessions concern languages (English, German and italian) to show that interculturality is really important to us.  Finally a training session about the European citizenship and multiculturality in the European projects is also planned. These training sessions will enable us to achieve our goals of accepting everyone in a respectful atmosphere, reducing the school dropout and widening our cultural horizon. \r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nThe first training sessions focus on languages (English, Spanish, German and Italian) so that the following courses are attended without linguistic apprehension. Follow the courses about inclusive education, hidden talent in the classroom, anti-bullying or multiple intelligences. The other partners in the project (parents, students, teachers) will be asked their opinion through surveys so we can adjust our project. The whole staff will be informed through meetings. (for the teachers every 6 week and for the rest of the staff twice a year). \r\nIMPACT\r\nFor our students, the impact will be seen through a renewed involvement in school, a better self-esteem and  trust towards other but also with better relational, intercultural and academic skills. The teachers will manage their classes in a different way for a better teaching and learning. For our school the impact will be a new positive and committed image in the large communities of parents, mayor, members of our Foundation and  the academic authorities of Alsace.\r\nBENEFIT\r\nThe benefits can be from a personal point of view for our students, staff members  but are also institutional. Our institution hopes to keep its students and to attract new ones thanks to this policy of respect and individualization.\r\n\r\n\r\n.", "http://International-Study-Programmes.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA101-046161_1"], ["4EB", "Lehrermobilit\u00e4t als Voraussetzung zur Weiterentwicklung der europ\u00e4ischen Dimension", "International Study Programmes", 12321.0, "The project is aimed at a total of 5 teachers of the OSZ Elbe-Elster and 2 members of the school management.

In addition to an increased number of participants from academic fields that have already successfully participated in earlier project, new groups of students will be given the chance to do internships abroad in participating European countries to develop their intercultural skills, language skills and to give up any prejudices that may exist. In addition, the project will be helpful for the students in the process of establishing a career or in increasing their chances for professional applications.\r\nA total of 80 students will do internships in a variety of businesses, which have been carefully selected according to their training. Six medical technical assistants will have the chance to expand their professional competence for three weeks at a hospital in Innsbruck, Austria.  Ten participants, foreign language office assistants, who need to do an eight-week-internship as stated in their exam regulations, will do internships in Spain, England, Ireland or France, in particular to expand their professional knowledge and to get a first-hand experience in their profession. The same applies to the thirty participants from the field of office management and administration and the fourteen participants from the fields of Reals Estate, Insurance and Banking. Ten participants from the full-time higher vocational school will increase their chances to find appropriate training positions at home by doinf internships at international companies improving their English language skills.\r\nAll participants will be supervised and monitored closely by the experienced staff of the partner organisations and the project co-ordinators during their work placements.\r\nThe aim of all activities is the consolidation and expansion of language skills, achieving a greater intercultural competence, as well as insights into the world of work and the social structure of the host countries.\r\nThrough the dissemination of the results at the local level, we expect that the employing companies and public institutions will clearly see the importance of these objectives and welcome the gained experience of their returning trainees.\r\nAt the international level, we hope that other partner organizations in more participating countries will contact us, so that we can extend these kind of programmes in the future.\r\nThe best form of advertising will be the reports of the returning participants on the webpage of our school, in flyers, and by presentations before other students on our \u201eInformation Day\u201c to encourage more students to participate in future mobility projects or to apply for pool projects. \r\nBy including teaching staff in the project the school hopes to strengthen strategies for the internationalisation of our school, especially through the activities of our multiplicators who will personally gain linguistic and methodological competence which their students profit from.

Most of them will be in their second year of a BTEC qualification (1\u00e8re bac pro) in different vocational subjects, such as : agriculture, health and social care, community service, business, retail, construction, woodworking, mechanics, maintenance,  hospitality and catering... Two groups of students are taking a vocational training qualification (CAP) to become general catering assistants, joiners and carpenters.\r\nIn total, more than 245 students and 116 members of the staff will carry out a training period abroad.\r\n\u2022 Secondly, staff from VET schools : 34 people ; teachers and other staff (headmasters\u2026), members of board of directors will lead the students during their work placement.\r\nNote that for many of them, carrying out a mobility abroad could be their unique opportunity to travel to Europe. A lot of them have few chances to travel with their family who have limited financial resources (with about 40% of grant holders). Morevoer, about 60% are coming from a farming background, and remain strongly attached to their territory.\r\nThe planned activities focus mainly on the students\u2019 work placement in a company. The professionnal content will be discussed closely with the host companies in each different professionnal sector. The host companies are selected on their specific skills which are very often complementary to the ones in French companies. The learning outcomes will help many young people to have a broader overview and analysis on their professional practices in their French companies. These practices will be taken into account in the ECVET process.\r\nThe students will do some cultural and heritage visits outside working hours.  Non formal learning outcomes will be developped on their different places of accomodation (for example alongside their host families). These situations will enable them to be more autonomous and responsible, and to get them more interested in learning languages. The participants will then be able to open up to different cultures, realities and customs\u2026\r\nIn order to run this project, we set up a consortium. Eighteen VET schools work together and share their practices. The Federation of Maisons Familiales Rurales of Bourgogne and Franche-Comt\u00e9, in partnership with the DAREIC, coordinate the project. Several coordination meetings are held all along the project. Different tasks have been established in order to enable the sending organisations (VET schools) to focus on the students who will carry out a work placement with Erasmus +.\r\n The project will have an impact on various levels : an individual impact on the sending organisations, but also at a regional and national level. A promotion of the project is planned in all VET schools in order to allow everyone to share their results and experiences. To promote the project, public events take place most of the time, leading the largest number of people to know more about the impact of this project. An ambitious dissemination plan has been set up to widely communicate on the project, and to value the young people, as well as their activities.\r\n Several meetings will be held regionally, such as awarding ceremonies that will have an impact at a regional level.
