In this case, the student is an active component of a learning model focused on improving competence . The project \"Designing School New Perspectives\" is a tool implemented by the Piano Nazionale Scuola Digitale (Digital School National Project), since it aims at increasing the individual competencies of \u2018\u2019digital animators\u2019\u2019, who are professionals working in this field.The digital animators will be a catalyst within their schools, experimenting and optimizing active didactic methods not only to acquire the competencies required of them by the work and social worlds, but also for students to develop social consciousness, entrepreneurship, and proactivity. The Project:\u2022 moves from an analysis of the local needs, through an extensive survey;\u2022 provides the participants with advanced training programs. These are models of active didactics, based on environments that enhance the use of technology in didactics, through Job Shadowing and training courses in other European countries;\u2022 re-elaborates experiences to fit the context of Italian teachers and technicians;\u2022 monitors the effects in school;\u2022 spreads experimentations and outcomes validated not only in school networks, but also all over the territory.The learning outcomes from the re-elaboration of formative experiences will bring about benefits and changes in the learning environments of all the schools taking part in the project. Also, they will be useful for the implementation of new policies both on a national and European scale, which is closely related to the changes brought about globally by technology information.The formation of a \"community of practice\" by the participants will surely have to be recognized among the results of the project. It will be extended to all stakeholders, within which they are able to share knowledge on computational thinking, on flipped classroom and \"backward design\u2019\u2019, i.e. varying skills. The goal is to optimize the use of resources made available by the digital world.Teachers (both in humanities and scientific subjects in primary and secondary schools) directors and technicians participate in the mobility plan; all 30 participants are involved in the Digital School National Plan.The dissemination will be implemented and supported by a concrete evaluation plan throughout the project life.Sustainability will be ensured through distance training processes after the end of the period for which the project will be financed.It will be possible to extend the training processes to the partnerships Erasmus Plus KA2, both in school and in the VET sector, for an international sharing of teaching methods with the use of ICT.", "http://www.newburyparkschool.net", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT02-KA101-023342_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "IG2"}
