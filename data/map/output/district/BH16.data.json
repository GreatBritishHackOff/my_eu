The European electronics assembly industry faces many issues with achieving high quality joints at the time of manufacture and also once the assemblies are in service. Even if a high quality joint is manufactured it may degrade through a number of mechanisms over time; these negative mechanisms are accelerated by extreme service environments such as elevated and sub-zero temperatures and vibration.\n\nAn estimated 1014 soldered joints are made in Europe each year; the cost of electronic assembly failure to the European Community can be severe resulting in loss of productivity, facilities or even lives.\n\nThe MicroStir project will develop small scale friction stir welding (FSW) for use in electronic connections and encapsulations seeing harsh service environments. FSW has proven to be a high integrity joining technology at a macro scale and has already been scaled down for sub-millimetre joining, termed micro friction stir welding (\u00b5FSW). The MicroStir project will develop tooling, procedures and prototype production assembly equipment in order that industry may take advantage of \u00b5FSW to produce high integrity, stable joints.\n\nUsing the MicroStir project developments European manufacturers and consumer will be able to guarantee electronics assembly performance and avoid the occurrence of defects such as tin whiskers which can disable safety critical equipment without warning.", 71528.0, 1214374.0, "MicroStir", "A promising alternative to solder", "Conventional soldering currently forms most of the circuitry connections on electronics. EU-funded scientists have downsized an important welding process to the micro scale, promising important benefits for producers and consumers alike.", "Currently, most electronic joining is done with a metallic filler (the solder). It is melted and dropped between the two circuit components of interest, solidifying and forming a bridge for current to flow. These tiny connections are subject to degradation over time, a process sped up by harsh environments of extreme temperature and vibration. Failures can have important consequences both for businesses and end users.\n\nA novel joining technique first applied to large components in the transport sector has now been downsized even further. With EU funding of the project http://www.microstir.eu (MICROSTIR), scientists developed micro-friction stir welding to accommodate ultra-thin sheet metal and specialist circuitry.\n\nFriction stir welding is a solid-state joining procedure that essentially softens the two components to be joined via frictional heat created by a rotating welding tool. The components are then pressed together, creating smooth joints with ultra-fine grain structure.\n\nIn addition, friction stir welding can produce high-quality joints between dissimilar materials with minimal formation of undesirable compounds at the joint. To top it off, the process consumes much less energy and produces virtually no pollutants compared to conventional processes; it is also safer for workers.\n\nThe team created the tooling, processes and prototype production equipment for electronics assembly and encapsulations targeted for harsh environments. Accordingly, two prototype systems were developed: spot welding for electronics and seam welding for hermetic sealing.\n\nBoth were implemented in trial production runs, producing quality welds and simultaneously enabling identification of the physical limits imposed by miniaturisation. Data collected has led to a rigorous determination of potential applications, welding parameters and set-ups.\n\nMICROSTIR has pushed the frontiers of friction stir welding with prototype tools and processes for electronics assembly and encapsulation of components headed for harsh service environments. Further optimisation promises commercialisation and important benefits for small and medium-sized enterprises in the electronics assembly business.", null, "http://www.europlacer.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/149908.jpg", "fp7_100351_965602409"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BH16"}
