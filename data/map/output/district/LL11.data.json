At present FIR observations lie in a resolution gap of 2 orders of magnitude represented by the James-Webb Space telescope in the mid-infrared on one side and the ALMA interferometer, in the sub-mm, on the other. Only with the development of space borne interferometers can we hope to bridge this divide.\nThis project brings together the leading international experts on FIR space instrumentation and experienced astronomers in a unique collaborative effort to address the development needs of a high resolution FIR observatory through two major activities. Firstly to identify the scientific questions which require high spatial resolution observations in the FIR.  We will translate these into the definition of an ambitious space mission and its associated key technologies.\nAt the same time we will study a number of technologies relevant to space interferometers which are at a low Technology Readiness Level. These include free-space beam combination with cryogenic delay lines, deployable low-mass telescopes, accurate satellite position measurement techniques and advanced ground calibration scenarios. We will develop these technologies through a consortium of universities, research establishments and industry which combine the best academic and industrial expertise.\nThe outcome of this work will advance the knowledge and technology required for a future FIR mission, consolidate the scientific community and bring world-wide expertise to the EU consortium. We will promote the results to a wider scientific community through a number of international workshops centred on the definition of a future FIR space mission.", 57240.0, 2060899.0, "FISICA", "Interferometric observations from space", "An EU-funded project has brought together international experts to review the science case for a European-led far infrared (FIR) interferometer based on recent results of the Herschel and Planck space missions.", "The FIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum \u2014 extending from roughly 30 to 300\u00a0micrometres \u2014 offers a unique window on astrophysical processes that are obscured at other wavelengths by cosmic dust. These include the formation of stars and planetary systems, as well as massive black holes as they glow at the centre of active galaxies.\n\nThe European Space Agency's (ESA) Herschel and Planckmissions have made a huge contribution to our knowledge of this invisible Universe. But these space-borne telescopes suffer from the fact that their ability to see details of distant objects is determined by their size. Moreover, laboratory testbeds devoted to the development of new FIR interferometers have largely stopped work due to lack of funding.\n\nWith financial support of the EU, the http://www.fp7-fisica.eu/ (FISICA) project has brought together experts on space FIR instrumentation with leading astronomers. Engineers and scientists joined their efforts to identify still-open scientific questions that a Far-Infrared Space Interferometer could help understand, therefore addressing the current lack of observational capability in the FIR and complementing the many findings of the Herschel and Planck missions, as well as of the ground-based Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to improve our understanding of the Universe, near and far.\n\nTo address questions that require high spatial resolution observations in the FIR, the optimum instrument design is currently being defined. The FISICA partners' goal is to ultimately outline the design and model the performance of a space-borne FIR interferometer that combines the necessary angular resolution with high sensitivity and wide spectral coverage. Critical technology developments needed to make a realistic proposal are, therefore, identified.\n\nA computer model of the chosen conceptual design has been created to predict the observational performance of the FIR interferometer in different scenarios. On the other hand, the technological readiness level of key optical components required for the FIR interferometer design is advanced in a dedicated experimental development programme.\n\nDetection of extremely weak FIR signals demands ultra-sensitive detectors and instruments capable of operating at maximum efficiency. The outcome of the FISICA project will pave the way for a truly pioneering mission, able to make significant progress in our understanding of dust-obscured astrophysical processes.", "http://www.fp7-fisica.eu/", "http://www.glyndwr.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/158193.jpg", "fp7_106557_968694284"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1AR", "WREXHAM COUNTY BOROUGH COUNCIL*WCBC", 20297.0, "Information outlets (16.03.01.03)", "fts_2016_66599", 2016], ["1AR", "WREXHAM COUNTY BOROUGH COUNCIL*WCBC", 8188.0, "Cohesion Fund \u2014 Operational technical assistance (13.04.61.01)", "fts_2016_72643", 2016], ["1AR", "WREXHAM COUNTY BOROUGH COUNCIL*WCBC", 21806.0, "Information outlets (16.03.01.03)", "fts_2017_65172", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "LL11"}
