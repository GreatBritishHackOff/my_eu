DoReMi provides an operational tool for the development of the proposed MELODI platform (Multidisciplinary European Low Dose Risk Re-search Initiative) consisting of major national bodies and research programmes that have long term commitment in low dose risk research in Europe. A Letter of Intent between the core members of MELODI has been signed in April 2009. During the project, new members are expected to join the Initiative.\n\nThe Joint Programme of Activities (JPA) of DoReMi includes: (i) a Joint Programme of Research (JPR) covering the issues outlined above and providing an overview of the needs for research infra-structures of pan-European interest and facilitating multilateral initiatives leading to better use and development of research infrastructures; (ii) a Joint Programme of Integration (JPI) to develop a coor-dinated European roadmap for the long term needs of the key players in Europe; and (iii) a Joint Pro-gramme for the Spreading of Excellence (JPSE), covering knowledge management, training and mo-bility and its implementation. The JPR focuses on the areas identified by the HLEG as the most prom-ising in terms of addressing/resolving the key policy questions, namely: the shape of dose response curve for cancer, individual susceptibilities and non-cancer effects. Radiation quality, tissue sensitivity and internal exposures will be addressed as cross cutting themes within the three main research areas. A substantial proportion of the JPA will be dedicated to the joint programme of research. The pro-gramme describes a multidisciplinary approach including interfaces with the broader biological toxico-logical and epidemiological communities. Strategic planning will be carried out in close collaboration with MELODI. The long term Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) will be developed by MELODI, whereas DoReMi research priorities are based on a shorter term Transitional Research Agenda (TRA), focusing on goals that are feasible to achieve within the 6 year project and areas where barriers need to be removed in order to proceed with the longer term strategic objectives.", 58755.0, 17592991.0, "DOREMI", "Assessing the risk of low-dose radiation", "Low doses of radiation from occupational hazards, medical diagnostic procedures and the environment are an increasing health concern.

The 'Low dose research towards multidisciplinary integration' (http://www.doremi-noe.net/ (DOREMI)) 6-year EU-funded project that started with 12 partners in 2010 and expanded to 36 by July 2014, is facilitating joint research, integration and training.\n\nDOREMI is supporting the development of the Multidisciplinary European Low Dose Initiative (MELODI) proposed by the High Level and Expert Group (HLEG) on low-dose risk research. The MELODI platform will represent the major national organisations and research projects concerned with low-dose radiation risk. MELODI will develop a long-term Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) to resolve key policy issues identified by HLEG. DOREMI is establishing the more detailed shorter-term Transitional Research Agenda.\n\nMany DOREMI activities are focused on the joint programme of research covering three areas: shape of the dose-response curve, individual sensitivities and non-cancer effects. In addition, all research activities address the cross-cutting issues of radiation quality, tissue sensitivity, and internal emitters and exposure.\n\nScientists have significantly expanded their network to include competence in fields such as biomarker identification, stem cells and genome reorganisation. Targeted training and education of next-generation researchers will ensure continuity and long-term success.\n\nExperimental radiation research is dependent on access to radiation sources that are reliable, robust and accurate across a range of radiations. It also requires epidemiological infrastructure, databases and biobanks as well as analytical tools. DOREMI has successfully provided access to several new infrastructures that will enhance European capabilities for addressing key radioprotection issues. The website is a forum for information dissemination that encourages visitors to join the network and participate in activities.\n\nMuch is known about the effects of ionising radiation, but uncertainties and differing viewpoints exist as to the health effects of low doses. DOREMI is supporting the establishment of the MELODI platform to ensure a sustainable joint SRA to address issues of low-dose radiation risks. In light of indications that many EU Member States have lost key competences and cannot independently maintain effective radiation research programmes, organised and targeted cooperation could not have come at a better time.", "http://www.doremi-noe.net/", "http://www.awe.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/158728.jpg", "fp7_94439_971310471"], ["8EA", "A European volcanological supersite in Iceland: a monitoring system and network for the future", "Guralp Systems Ltd", "The main objectives of FUTUREVOLC are to establish an integrated volcanological monitoring procedure through European collaboration, develop new methods to evaluate volcanic crises, increase scientific understanding of magmatic processes and improve delivery of relevant information to civil protection and authorities. To reach these objectives the project combines broad European expertise in seismology, volcano deformation, volcanic gas and geochemistry, infrasound, eruption monitoring, physical volcanology, satellite studies of plumes, meteorology, ash dispersal forecasting, and civil defence. This European consortium leads the way for multi-national volcanological collaboration with the aim of mitigating the effects of major eruptions that pose cross-border hazards. Iceland is selected as a laboratory supersite area for demonstration because of (i) the relatively high rate of large eruptions with potential for long ranging effects, and (ii) Iceland\u2019s capability to produce the near full spectrum of volcano processes at its many different volcano types. Based on present monitoring networks and ongoing research, the project will bridge gaps and combine efforts for a coherent close-to-real-time evaluation of the state of Icelandic volcanoes and their unrest. The project will provide timely information on magma movements from combined interpretation of earthquake sources relocated in three-dimensional velocity models, magma sources inferred from ground and space geodetic data, and measurements of volcanic volatiles. For better response during eruptions, the project will develop operational models of magma discharge rate, contributing directly to improved forecasts of ash dispersion. They will help to minimise economic disruption on a European scale during eruptions.

Activities are being carried out in high-volcanic\u2013risk areas that account for more than half of all eruptions in Iceland.\n\nTeam members set out to better understand volcanic eruptions over a period of time. This information will be supplied to relevant actors, helping to erase doubt in prediction models of ash emission across Europe. Data will be collected from space-, air- and ground-based monitoring before, during or after a volcanic eruption.\n\nResearchers piloted a system that will contain volcano monitoring data in Iceland. Once finalised, it will be made available to the EU. They analysed feedback from various actors across Europe on communications and response to Icelandic eruptions with the aim to support future risk management.\n\nProject work has led to the development and installation of various instruments to monitor in near-real-time the characteristics and evolution of eruptions. Other advances include innovative techniques to provide better response during eruptions.\n\nThe team is devising a catalogue detailing the probability of Icelandic eruptions. This will contribute to the development of international standards in volcanic hazards databases.\n\nFUTUREVOLC outcomes should enhance knowledge delivery about eruptions and volcanic threats to civil protection stakeholders.

Researchers calculated risk probabilities for the next 5-, 10- and 50-year periods, and developed a 3D model to simulate ground motions for possible earthquake scenarios.\n\nThis ongoing research will help decision makers develop disaster mitigation policies in the high-risk Marmara region and improve the community's emergency response through public awareness.
