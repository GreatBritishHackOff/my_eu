Focussing on arable and grassland systems, the six objectives are to: 1) identify current best practice for plant teams through participatory engagement with agricultural practitioners and scientific literature; 2) determine the mechanisms promoting positive plant-plant and plant-environment interactions using ecological principles to define experimentally the underpinning processes; 3) devise improved plant teams and identify potential breeding targets with a trait-based approach and novel tool to select crop types and deployment strategies that promote performance; 4) collaborate with stakeholders in European pedo-climatic regions and beyond to validate and demonstrate plant teams and devise practical crop management prescriptions; 5) construct a plant teams decision aid for practitioners by collating trait and agronomy data in a framework that can be interrogated for information on crop selection and management in different regions; and 6) work with stakeholders and RUR-6 for participatory knowledge exchange between different actors, EU policy and wider society through an appropriate and targeted array of communication media and activities. The co-innovation approach will allow tacit and scientific knowledge to be applied to real-world challenges in plant team cropping for developing practical solutions, in the form of teams with improved productivity, pest and disease control and environmental benefits. Knowledge exchange on crop traits, management and the decision aid will have impact on farmers, advisors, breeders, science and policy, improving awareness and overcoming barriers to uptake of plant teams for yield stability, diversification, sustainability and resilience.", 85981.0, 4366739.0, "DIVERSify", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_210488_922555846"], ["2TL", "Nano-Enabled Conducting Materials Accelerating Device Applicability", "Crown Packaging Manufacturing Uk Limited", "The project targets the incorporation of advanced functional materials to deliver customised conductive inks and flexible adhesives compatible with high volume manufacturing platforms.

Inasmuch as international mobility has proven to be highly relevant for the acquisition of professional skills linked to education, and helps open the door for future teachers, and thereby their future pupils, to European and international exchanges, the ESPE uses its own funds to finance 2-week international training courses during the first year of the Masters course. The aim of the STEPS project is to develop this mobility via European financing for 33 students, in their second year of the course, who have passed the teaching examination and thus gained the status of trainee civil servant.  \r\nIn February-March, participants will undertake a two-week training course in a primary or secondary educational establishment in one of the following eight countries (UK, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Greece, Ireland, and Bulgaria). To the extent that participants are at the head of a class in France on a part-time basis, this course will be held over a period split between the school holidays and the work time of their schooling with the ESPE. Placements in educational establishments will be made by way of intermediary placement organizations (universities or higher schools of education, associations, etc.) with whom the ESPE has been working for a number of years.  \r\nThe international course experience will be fully integrated into the learners' curriculum. It will be prepared under the teaching course units of \"training course support\", \"digital educational project\", \"initiation to research\" and \"teaching in a foreign language\".  It will foster the work produced by students aimed at validating the second year of their Masters course.\r\nThe project should help to train new-generation teachers and educators who will be able to enhance their knowledge with teaching practices developed in other European countries. On a regional and local scale, it will strengthen already active bilateral cooperation programmes. On a national scale, it will provide the wherewithal to test a new form of mobility during students' initial training that could prove transposable to other ESPEs. On the European scale, it will help to boost pan-European education. Inasmuch as the beneficiaries are teachers starting out on their careers, the project will have a significant multiplier effect.
