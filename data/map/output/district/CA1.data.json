Focussing on arable and grassland systems, the six objectives are to: 1) identify current best practice for plant teams through participatory engagement with agricultural practitioners and scientific literature; 2) determine the mechanisms promoting positive plant-plant and plant-environment interactions using ecological principles to define experimentally the underpinning processes; 3) devise improved plant teams and identify potential breeding targets with a trait-based approach and novel tool to select crop types and deployment strategies that promote performance; 4) collaborate with stakeholders in European pedo-climatic regions and beyond to validate and demonstrate plant teams and devise practical crop management prescriptions; 5) construct a plant teams decision aid for practitioners by collating trait and agronomy data in a framework that can be interrogated for information on crop selection and management in different regions; and 6) work with stakeholders and RUR-6 for participatory knowledge exchange between different actors, EU policy and wider society through an appropriate and targeted array of communication media and activities. The co-innovation approach will allow tacit and scientific knowledge to be applied to real-world challenges in plant team cropping for developing practical solutions, in the form of teams with improved productivity, pest and disease control and environmental benefits.

They will travel to the University of Cumbria, as students from M\u00edR are able to apply for the third and final year there and finish a BA degree. They\u2019ll be visiting the illustration department, the drawing and fine art department and the computer games design department. It is important that the students get an insight into the courses and even to meet potential classmates. The main aim of the trip is to introduce the students to the British university system and it\u2019s potentials for them at the end of their studies in Iceland as well as the various job opportunities that might await them. The students will visit galleries that show the history of art and design within their chosen field. \r\n\r\nThe participants in the VET traineeship are 3 students from the diploma Textile department who have either completed their first year or are graduating from M\u00edR. The goal is to gain further specialist knowledge in the fields of knitting, textile printing and textile patterns as well as the running of businesses within this field. The project supports new possibilities in study and the creative fields. An emphasis is placed on art and design at the 5th level of EQF-European Qualification Framework. The project is part of the Icelandic government\u2019s goal to try and provide those who have not finished secondary school (at least 33% of the work force) with the potential to be able to get further education and improve their work possibilities.\r\n\r\nVisiting European Universities with the goal of looking at student evaluation is the goal of the staff training trip. There are 4 participants who will take the trip, all heads of diploma departments. All four are university educated in art and design, and have years of experience in running departments and teaching. The goal of the project is to share knowledge and experience about teaching practices, evaluations, student self-evaluations and how the different institutions evaluate the employment potentials of students. Discussions are taking place about a unified European credit system for vocational education and training and it\u2019s very important that M\u00edR takes an active part in these discussions. The hope is that the fruits of these projects will encourage more effective approaches to evaluation which will enable teachers to give a thorough and well thought out evaluation which will in turn positively encourage students to increase the quality of their work. The participants will be encouraged to increase and strengthen their personal and professional network of contacts in European institutions that they visit. To be able to evaluate and to get the best picture of working institutions and departments, the trips are planned for the school year 2014-2015.\r\n\r\nWhen the trip is over all conclusions and observations will be compared and used to strengthen the functioning of the diploma departments at M\u00edR. Emphasis will also be placed on sharing the knowledge gained with other art and vocational institutions in Iceland.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the staff training trip are:\r\n\r\n- Sharing experiences and knowledge of the teaching of art and design in Europe. \r\n\r\n- Taking part in discussions about the EQF system and comparing evaluation within vocational institutions (ECVET).\r\n\r\n- Learning about new methods of evaluation in the teaching of art and design.\r\n\r\n- Looking at how other institutions set up evaluations, self-evaluations and how they evaluate the effect of their courses on employment potential and on other colleges.\r\n\r\n- Increasing the quality of the diploma courses at M\u00edR.\r\n\r\n- Looking at the demands made on applicants for new students in art and design at other European universities.\r\n\r\n- Getting to know colleagues in Europe.\r\n\r\n- Creating cooperative partnerships for the future.\r\n\r\n- Strengthening networks between institutions.\r\n\r\n- Widening the horizons of participants and increasing their knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\n- Working through conclusions and sharing the resulting knowledge with other art and design institutions in Iceland.", "http://www.cumbria.ac.uk ", null, "erasmus_2014-1-IS01-KA102-000044_4"], ["1LL", "Enriching the Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence Programme", "Carlisle United Association Football Club (1921) Limited", 39255.0, "In the 2012/2013 season the Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP) was agreed and introduced to the Premier League and Football League.

Supplementary to this focus is an aim to learn from other European Clubs/Governing bodies in order to improve on a number of the other key development areas including VISION, COACHING, SPORT SCIENCE AND MEDICINE, and FACILITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis group of YOUTH players undertake the Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (ASE) programme, a recognised government funded vocational qualification which is delivered and managed by CUFC in conjunction with League Football Education (LFE). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLFE's research shows that of all ASE learners (1300 at any one time across the country) approximately 60% of players don't receive a professional contract upon completion of the ASE programme. Also, of the 40% that do gain a professional contract, 50% of those do not receive a second contract. This means that of the original cohort 80% are not in professional football a year after completing the programme. There is also an ever increasing influx of foreign players moving to the English Leagues with minimal movement in the other direction. There are consistently poor performances by the National Side in international competitions, especially when compared to investment levels in training. Finally, the issue of senior players coming out of the game and needing to retrain needs to be further recognised and supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis leads to the following participant specific aims for the project: \r\n\r\n1. To achieve both quantitative and qualitative improvements in the development of the participants as footballers \r\n\r\n2. To improve the knowledge and understanding of Lifelong Learning principles within Apprentices \r\n\r\n3. To improve the knowledge and understanding of the European opportunities in football and other careers \r\n\r\n4.

Fourteen students and 2 teachers from the Forming Department will visit the Weissensee Kunsthochschule Berlin (the department\u2018s partner in this project) and various porcelain manufacturing companies, workshops and research institutions as well as museums in Germany. One of the aims of this project is to give students the opportunity to learn more about materials, production processes and possibilities, educational routes and cultural emphasis in the study of ceramics. The students are in their second semester in which the curriculum focus is on materials. Sixteen students and 2 teachers from the Drawing Department will visit France and England. The trip begins with a visit to the International Comic Festival in Angoul\u00eame in France The festival is the second largest comic festival in Europe and the third largest in the world. It has been held every January since 1974.The festival takes over the whole town and participants get the chance to see exhibitions, buy books and most importantly to see world famous professional illustrators at work. The festival is an inpiration to students and teachers alike. From Angoul\u00eame the students travel to Great Britain where they visit their partner school, the University of Cumbria. The  aim of the visit is to get an insight into the structure of the Drawing department, the Games Design department and  Illustration and Graphic Design. Students have the possibility to apply for the third and final year of a BA at the University after finishing their diploma courses. The aim of the visit is also to maintain a relationship between these schools. Visits will also be made to few other universities in England: Cambridge School of Art, Kingston University, The London College of Communication and the Glasgow School of Art. \r\nFourteen students and 2 teachers from the Textile Department will visit Europe. The aim of the trip is to expose the students to a varied view of textile production, research, study possibilities and various musuems. To be able to get a complete picture, the students travel to three countries starting with Holland known for its very avant-garde designs and high-tech production. From there the students travel to Antwerp in Belgium where the focus is on fashion and clothes design. Finally the students travel to Great Britain where museums and textile producers are visited as well as the department\u2018s partner school, the Heriot-Watt University, The School of Textiles and Design. \r\nThe main goals of these study trips is to expose the students and their teachers to European educational and vocational possibilities. The trips open up new horizons for the participants. They learn  about new educational possibilities and what they can apply for after they finish their diploma courses, discover new vocational routes and ways to set up small companies.The student gains contextual awareness through visits to cultural institutions and not least, interact with other students in Europe through visits to different schools.Another important part of the study trips is the connection that students and teachers make with other professionals working within their chosen areas of study.The project is in step with the aims of the Icelandic governments\u2018s aims to promote the possibility for those who haven\u2018t finished their studies (about 33% of people in work)  of further study and realizing their dreams of bettering their position in the work force.\r\nThe project is also instrumental in revitalising and encouraging teachers to broaden their own horizons in teaching and as professionals in their different fields.\r\n\r\nThe three study trips will address the need to expand all students views and experiences by introducing them to the European education and employment system of further education and possible routes of study. It is expected that the trip will broaden their views on their potential options for work or further studies in their chosen fields as well as inspire them in their studies after their return to Iceland to finish their diploma courses.The three mobilities will take place during the spring term 2017 and are fully evaluated into the participating students\u00b4 education in RSVA to the amount of 5-6 ETCS.

Inasmuch as international mobility has proven to be highly relevant for the acquisition of professional skills linked to education, and helps open the door for future teachers, and thereby their future pupils, to European and international exchanges, the ESPE uses its own funds to finance 2-week international training courses during the first year of the Masters course. The aim of the STEPS project is to develop this mobility via European financing for 33 students, in their second year of the course, who have passed the teaching examination and thus gained the status of trainee civil servant.  \r\nIn February-March, participants will undertake a two-week training course in a primary or secondary educational establishment in one of the following eight countries (UK, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Greece, Ireland, and Bulgaria). To the extent that participants are at the head of a class in France on a part-time basis, this course will be held over a period split between the school holidays and the work time of their schooling with the ESPE. Placements in educational establishments will be made by way of intermediary placement organizations (universities or higher schools of education, associations, etc.) with whom the ESPE has been working for a number of years.  \r\nThe international course experience will be fully integrated into the learners' curriculum. It will be prepared under the teaching course units of \"training course support\", \"digital educational project\", \"initiation to research\" and \"teaching in a foreign language\".  It will foster the work produced by students aimed at validating the second year of their Masters course.\r\nThe project should help to train new-generation teachers and educators who will be able to enhance their knowledge with teaching practices developed in other European countries. On a regional and local scale, it will strengthen already active bilateral cooperation programmes. On a national scale, it will provide the wherewithal to test a new form of mobility during students' initial training that could prove transposable to other ESPEs. On the European scale, it will help to boost pan-European education. Inasmuch as the beneficiaries are teachers starting out on their careers, the project will have a significant multiplier effect.
