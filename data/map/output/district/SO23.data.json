Low reliability of biofilter systems are considered the main reason why people avoid entering fish farming business. Our idea is to reduce the bio-filter recovery time after failure by developing an Intelligent Biofilter Control (IBC) system.

At healthy period excess bacteria are extracted, prepared for storage and stored by automatic collection system. In case of biofilter failure, the stored culture will be cultivated for rapid recovery of the biofilter thereby providing increased productivity of the farm. The major barriers to overcome are: (a) Biofilter start-up and recovery processes in fish farm are slow, taking 3-6 weeks. (b) Methods of bacteria extraction and storage are designed for usage in laboratory and not providing the efficiency required for industrial applications; (c) Limited knowledge about how is the recovery performance of recultivated bacteria related to the health before collection; (d) Existing methods to assess the viability and metabolic activity of bacteria are complicated and time consuming. We intend to overcome these barriers by speeding up the recovery of a bio-filter by recultivating the stored adapted bacteria.

European research has optimised an automatic biofilter for recirculation systems in fish farms.", "Toxic build-up of ammonia and nitrite from the breakdown of faeces and excess food in fish farms can be hazardous to fish. The biological way to remedy nitrogen-based toxic build-up is to use nitrifying bacteria that ultimately convert the ammonia into harmless by-products such as nitrogen gas. The bacteria are housed in biofilters composed of material such as plastic sheets or sand grains. \n\nUnfavourable growth periods for the bacteria result in a decrease in population and inability to purify the water. As it may take weeks or months to recolonise a biofilter, the EU-funded ADAPOND project has developed an Intelligent Biofilter Control (IBC) system. System reliability was enhanced with reduction in the biofilter recovery time after failure.\n\nThe IBC has three critical components. There is a real-time monitoring system to detect the viability and metabolic activity of the bacteria in the culture. An automatic collection system extracts excess bacteria during their optimal growth period. These are then cultivated to be ready for use in the event of a biofilter failure. \n\nThe ADAPOND system has many advantages over currently used systems. Most available commercial enrichment cultures are in liquid, dried or freeze dried form and therefore easily washed out from the system. ADAPOND nitrifying bacteria are attached to the biofilter carrier material and are therefore ready for immediate action. \n\nAnother feature is that the bacteria are cultured and stored in the actual farm and are therefore adapted to thrive in that specific environment. Research has shown that the reaction rate in a biofilter is influenced by the history of the inhabitants \u2013 locals are adapted to the conditions!  \n\nNew biofilter starters can cause a 30\u201380 % loss in sales during the adaptation period of the biofilter.

This requires deep understanding of the interactions of lipid membranes with nano-objects including functional biomimetic polymers, polymeric micelles, carbon nanotubes and polymer therapeutic complexes/conjugates to enable the intelligent design of novel materials with improved bilayer modifying properties.
