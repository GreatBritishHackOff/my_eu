The global LAB market is expected to grow by 59% to \u20ac71.6 billion by 2022 with Europe accounting for the second largest market share. Waste LAB recycling rates are as high as 95% in Europe, but the current recycling process \u2013 smelting waste LABs in a furnace \u2013 consumes vast quantities of energy, is highly polluting, wasteful, large scale and expensive. Furthermore, smelted lead must be further processed to produce the essential LAB ingredient: the active lead oxide paste. A new lead recycling process is needed that is energy efficient, non-polluting, low cost, scalable and produces LAB-ready lead products. Such process would meet EC priorities by addressing resource efficiency, the sustainable supply of raw materials and drive the circular economy. AEL has developed a novel hydrometallurgical process technology to recycle waste LABs in a highly energy efficient, non-polluting and cost effective way. NUOVOpb\u2019s commercial appeal lies in its low cost and scalability, and our ground-breaking ability to produce LAB-ready products that exceed the performance of current products on the market. Our LAB-ready paste can create new LABs with 22% greater energy capacity and 50% longer life.  The technology has the potential to transform the global battery recycling industry, which has an expected value of \u20ac9.5 billion in 2024. 5 years post project, we expect to be operating 18 NUOVOpb facilities across the world. These will be processing 490,000 tonnes of waste LABs (6% of the global waste LAB market) and avoiding 196,000 tonnes CO2 emissions every year. In doing so, AEL will secure annual revenues of \u20ac206 million, profits of \u20ac54 million, and will have created 200 jobs within AEL.  NUOVOpb is the most complete closed-loop recycling system in the world, providing significant commercial opportunities for businesses in both the LAB recycling and LAB manufacturing supply chain, globally.", 1147859.0, 1639798.0, "NUOVOpb", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_211707_915452148"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8DW", "L\u00e4ra av varandra - \u00f6kad kvalitet genom jobbskuggning 2017-2019", "Ss John & Monica Catholic Primary School", 29186.0, "The Childcare and Education department of Eskilstuna Municipality in Sweden has the ambition to continuously develop and improve the quality of teaching, improve the results and give the pupils a good foundation in order for them to succeed with future education and work.    The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other in order to develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and this job shadowing project is part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe consortium consists of the Childcare and education department and five schools: Lagersbergsskolan, H\u00e5llsta skola, Fristadsskolan, Skogstorpsskolan and Djurg\u00e5rdsskolan.  During the years 2017 \u2013 2019 we are planning to send a total of 22 staff members from these schools on job shadowing activities in Birmingham (head teachers, deputy head teachers, leaders of learning, teachers of Swedish as a second language and also special pedagogy teachers).   They will spend a week at one of our partner schools within the BCPP where they will have the opportunity to learn and get valuable experience that will be used in the quality development of their own schools.  \r\n\r\nIn this project the consortium has three objectives:\r\n\u2022 We want to gain knowledge and experience that will lead to a positive development of our schools with the aim to improve the quality of teaching and improve the pupils\u2019 results.   Besides looking at teaching methods, we would like to see how the staff and the teaching are organized in order to make the most optimal use of the resources and also how different schools work with collegial learning.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Through the job shadowing activities we want to gain knowledge and experience which leads to a development of methods in order to take care of and educate pupils who have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  We want to develop their knowledge of Swedish and to maximize their learning and results in the multicultural classroom.  Eskilstuna is a multicultural city where 31% of the pupils have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 We want to improve the quality and results within special pedagogy by educating the staff in finding and developing different teaching methods and tools in the teaching of special needs pupils.  We especially want to focus on methods and tools involving ICT.\r\n\r\nAfter the job shadowing activities the school development will progress at the individual schools, based on the needs of the school, what experience and knowledge that the staff has gained and also based on the reflections of what already works well.  Collegial learning will be a different factor in this work.\r\nThe development will also be driven forward by the Development unit at the Childcare and Education department.  Here there are networks for head teachers, deputy head teachers and leaders of learning where discussions and dissemination activities will take place, in order to share the experiences that have been made during the job shadowing activities with colleagues who are not in the project.  This way, the job shadowing activities can lead to positive development at other schools as well.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the knowledge and experience which we gain from the job shadowing activities will contribute to an improved quality of teaching and better results in general, but also more specifically within the teaching of Swedish as a second language in the multicultural classroom and within special pedagogics.   We hope that this project will help give the pupils a good foundation to stand on so that they can succeed in their future education and working life.", "http://www.stjonmon.bham.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA101-034303_10"], ["9SW", "InforMigration", "Hidden Voices", 17202.0, "The youth exchange \u2018\u2019 InforMigration\u2019\u2019 is a youth exchange that will take place in Bansko, Bulgaria from 1st until 9th of April 2018. The exchange topics are related to migration, refugees,  hate speech and human rights. The world has always been on the move and the Erasmus + program, as well as the previous life long learning programs, have been focused over decades on facilitating not only this movement but also cultural exchanges for young people in Europe. Migration processes have been part of the human history. However, over the ast few year millions of people have been forced to flee their homes due to several reasons-the wars, civil conflicts, poverty and climate changes. The United Nations (UN) estimates that in 2008 20 million people were displaced by climate change.\" In the longer term, he said, \"you can imagine that the UN estimates of 200 million such refugees, more than the total number of worldwide migrants today,  Hidden Voices has discovered that the most effective way to campaign for social issues which are not widely acknowledged, such as refugee crisis and more specifically climate refugees, is to educate people. As climate change is an increasingly significant issue across the world, more people will be forced to migrate into the near-future. However, as these people are not protected under international law, governments will encounter further immigration obstacles if these people are viewed as economic migrants rather than refugees. At the same time, there is a rather worrying trend - increased fear of newcomers, misunderstanding and unwillingness to engage and accept the migrants in the local community, which in many cases come to use hate speech and violence based on hatred towards refugees. According to a report by the Council of Europe's Commission against Racism and Intolerance for 2015, there is a climate of intolerance and xenophobia against refugees all over Europe. More and more ultranationalist groups and political parties are operating in some parts of Europe. In its report, ECRI makes a number of recommendations to the authorities, including an urgent awareness raising campaign to promote positive image and tolerance for asylum seekers and refugees.\r\nMain objectives of the project:\r\n- Understanding the processes, reasons and effects of migration processes by young people\r\n- Allow participants to gain a better understanding about climate change and its social, economic, political and environmental consequences;\r\n- promoting positive attitude and acceptance and understanding towards refugees and migrants\r\n-to help young people understand better what hate speech is, to distinguish it from freedom of expression and providing ways and channels for reporting hate speech online\r\n-informing young people how to effectively combat hate speech to refugees in a peaceful way\r\n-To introduce young people with the No hate speech movement of Council of Europe \r\n-To promote tolerance, mutual understanding and dialogue between young people of different nationalities.", null, "Hidden Voices", "erasmus_2017-3-UK01-KA105-046549_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["8PY", "AURELIUS ENVIRONMENTAL LTD", 1137504.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_21432", 2017]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["8JL", "RYW", "MOSELEY HALL HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B13"}
