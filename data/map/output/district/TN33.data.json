These comptences are needed and crucial for the working life as well as in the vocational education in Northern Finland due to the increasing tourism and internationalization of working life in the area. Furthermore, the students and staff in Lappia are more and more interested to gain international know-how during their vocational studies and teaching.\r\n\r\nThe students will receive an international perspective to their work and they will also improve their language and cultural skills during their on-the-job-learning periods abroad. This will benefit them during their studies and later in their profession .  The experts will have the opportunity to improve their professionality in international environments and strengthen the international relations with the colleges participating in this project. Furthermore, the comparison of the education and the working life, and their collaboration during vocational education abroad is an important way of learning in this project. In this context, learning from the comparison of the methods and evaluation will increase the international competencies of the students and staff in Lappia. The evaluations of the students' learning will be executed according to EVCET.\r\n\r\nInternational know-how in Northern Finland and in Sea-Lapland is crucial and the project's aim is to produce competent employees for the working life and vocational education. The experts will gain access to the colleges in different cultures where they will see in first-hand how the teaching and training periods of their own profession and study field have been organized. They will improve their language and cultural proficiency and gain international preparedness in their work. Moreover, the staff will improve their skills for motivating students abroad for training as well as receiving foreign students and experts to their home institution.  This will develop and increase the international operations of the Vocational College Lappia.\r\n\r\nThe number of participants applied for this project is 46 for VET learners and 14 for staff/experts. The students' on-the-job-learning periods are 4-8 weeks and the experts' periods 4-7 days. Fields of study participating; Service, Welfare, Technical and Culture. The operation period of this Erasmus+ KA1- project is 1.6.2017-31.5.2019.\r\n\r\nWith the project the aim is also to start, continue and develop the excellent cooperation with the partners from Spain, Netherlands, Italy, Poland, UK, Estonia, Germany and furthermore, extent the collaboration into new international projects.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA102-034397_3"], ["9AE", "Vlog up!

Viewpoints to Multiculturalism\u201d is a joint student and teacher mobility project coordinated by Salpaus Further Education and realized by Sanare, a network of Finnish vocational institutions and education providers. The network partners are Finland\u2019s Diaconia College, The Federation of Education in Jokilaaksot/Ylivieska Vocational College, South Ostrobothnia Folk High School, Rovaniemi Municipal Federation of Education/Lapland Vocational College, The Federation of Education in Central Ostrobothnia, and Kemi-Tornionlaakso Municipal Educational and Training Consortium Lappia/Vocational College Lappia. The project is carried out in co-operation with our foreign partners in Spain, Denmark, Czech Republic and the UK. In choosing the partners, versatility has been taken into account to the effect that there are on-the-job learning places both for practical nursing students and for youth and leisure instructor students. In addition, the foreign partners have experience of multiculturalism, the central theme in the current project. The on-the-job learning places are in day care centres, schools and in care units for the elderly and the disabled. In the \u201cVlog Up!\u201d project there will be altogether 54 student mobilities and 14 staff mobilities.  \r\n\r\nThe Sanare network has carried out international projects previously, too, the most recent one being the Erasmus+ KA1 project \u201cIlona \u2013 voluntary work as part of the welfare field\u201d (2015-17). The previous experiences in collaboration act as a starting point in the current project. Thus, the practices that have proved to be good previously, as well as the designation of assignments within the network, are adopted to efficient use in the current project.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to increase the knowledge possessed by the applying network and the collaborating working life networks about the opportunities and challenges of multiculturalism in the European partner countries and in this way promote a new kind of European sense of community and equality. This goal is reached through video blogs, or vlogs, produced by the students taking part in the mobility periods. \r\n\r\nThe Sanare network has international partners, of which the ones chosen to be in this project are the ones with the most experience of supervising students from different cultural backgrounds and in whose staff and/or clients the multicultural dimension has traditionally been present. \r\n\r\nAs the concrete result of the project there will be, in addition to the mobility weeks, video blogs made by the participating students. In these vlogs, the various manifestations and forms of multiculturalism, as encountered in the on-the-job learning places abroad, are recorded and presented. The vlogs are recorded using for example cameras, smartphones and tablets. The students will update the vlogs in real time during the on-the-job learning periods. The vlogs will be advertised on the websites of the participating colleges. The vlogs can also be used for example in the marketing campaigns of the colleges, in parents\u2019 nights, and in staff education. \r\n\r\nThe mobility periods are recognized using the Europass mobility certificate. In addition, the mobility periods are recognized as on-the-job learning periods belonging to the students\u2019 qualifications as an obligatory part. \r\n\r\nThe various activities of the project are planned in detail in the autumn of 2017. At the same time, orientation is arranged for the first students going abroad in the spring of 2018. The staff mobility periods will take place in an early stage of the project, mostly in the autumn of 2017. The student mobility periods will take place between the spring of 2018 and the spring of 2019.

It provides the tools and environment to facilitate education for the head, heart and hands  (i.e. the whole person)  based on the ethos and principles of the Swiss philosopher, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi.  We have more than 60 years' experience of offering life-changing opportunities to young people from disadvantaged communities around the world.\r\n\r\nWe award scholarships to exceptional 16-19 year olds who are academically gifted but because of their economic circumstances have limited educational prospects in their home countries.  Our students come from India, Nepal, Bhutan, the Tibetan communities in exile, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Belize and Indonesia. These young people live for two years in a multi-cultural, multi-faith community in Sedlescombe in East Sussex, where they welcome difference and embrace diversity.  They study at local colleges and undertake a broad range of extra-curricular activities, gaining an holistic education focused on the Pestalozzi principles.\r\n\r\nWe are seeking a maximum of two volunteers between the ages of  23 and 29 who are hoping to  improve their spoken and written English, to develop their teaching skills and to challenge themselves to a kind of adventure which is out of their usual comfort zone. They must be willing to join in the life of the community, able to make friends quickly and easily and keen to try life away from home in a new country. Some of our most successful EVS volunteers have come from a Social Welfare background.\r\n\r\nWe look for volunteers who are interested in different cultures and are keen to share their own with others.  They should be enthusiastic, friendly and sociable, be prepared to share a flat with other volunteers and be happy to occasionally generate their own entertainment due to the rural location of the village (Pestalozzi is situated in the heart of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty,  20 minutes drive from the nearest large town).  Volunteers should be interested in international development and environmental issues as well as international co-operation and understanding. \r\n\r\nIdeally each volunteer should have some relevant experience of working with young people from diverse backgrounds, an interest in Pestalozzi and its ethos, a relevant area of expertise that they can share with Pestalozzi students, a mature attitude and outlook, a willingness to undertake a variety of tasks, an ability to be flexible with working patterns (evenings and weekends) and the skills to tutor students (up to age 20) and on occasions have responsibility for their care.\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that the volunteer will develop and improve their language and communication skills through attending English classes at a local college and through teaching Spanish to the Pestalozzi students.  Providing Spanish tuition will also develop the volunteer\u2019s skills in how to plan and develop tutorial sessions and assess/support individual students\u2019 language needs.  It is anticipated that volunteers will gain further knowledge of sustainable development/environmental and global issues in general that will enhance their personal development and further their understanding and empathy for people in the developing world and the causes of their poverty (conflict situations, climate change, lack of resources, unfair trading rules etc) and that this knowledge and understanding will enable them to become a more active and responsible European/global citizen.\r\n\r\nEVS volunteers have a local, regional, national and international impact through the support that they provide to Pestalozzi students.\r\nLocally they will help our students to organize regular cultural evening events that are designed to engage with the community immediately around Pestalozzi, bringing new visitors to the Pestalozzi Village to learn about our students, their home communities and their customs.  Regionally they may facilitate the students' interactions with schools across Sussex, offering British students the opportunity to engage firsthand with young people whose backgrounds are very different from their  own, helping them to develop a global perspective.  Nationally,  EVS volunteers are an integral part of the team that supports Pestalozzi students to participate in the  London International Model United Nations discussions and debates with undergraduates from across the UK. At an international level, every Pestalozzi student will take the learning from their interactions with EVS volunteers with them when they return to their home countries or take up scholarships at universities such as Stanford, MIT, NYU and Princeton.", "http://www.pestalozzi.org.uk", "Pestalozzi International Village Trust", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-036373_coordinator"], ["9AE", "2015-1-FI01-KA109-009223", "Pinelands Language Centre", 179988.0, "The main strategy for 2016 \u2013 2020 of Vocational Education Center Sedu has paid a special focus on an international vision: Sedu \u2013 pioneer in competence for us and the world. Vision remarks further with the statement: Sedu supports internationalization and works daringly in global networks; according to this mission, we develop international operations.  Sedu wishes to works as a pioneer of internationalization with collaboration between its regional and international partners.  International mobility numbers are used as measure for the development work and an indicator for the success of the strategy.\r\n\r\nSedu has invested in advancement of international mobility and aims for the controlled growth of both student and staff mobility. Mobilities are financed by Erasmus + programme, education centre\u2019s own funds and with the project funds from Finnish Board of Education. \r\n\r\nThe quality of the mobility periods of the students and staff that funded by the Mobility Charter have been the significant part of our school\u2019s international operations. Alongside the mobilities the home internationalization is the second key priority of the international operations. Vocational Education Center Sedu also accepts big amounts of students from our foreign educational partners, which also supports our home internationalization.\r\n\r\nAccording to the mobility statistics of the year 2016 the long term exchange periods of the students has been significantly grown since the previous year, and steady growth is expected in the future.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we seek to ensure the equal opportunity participation in mobility periods for students from all sectors and all ages. Boys have been less interested in the past for participating in exchange periods and so in the future we will give more attention to this fact in the recruitment process. We will also give more attention to the fields that have been participating less in exchanges in the past and additionally the VALMA \u2013 preparatory training students are guaranteed to participate in the mobilities equally with the assistance of supporting staff for the whole period.\r\n\r\nAdult education and apprenticeship-training students\u2019 interest towards international activities is increasing and Sedu is dedicated to increase the demand further. In the light of the vocational education reform, foreign exchange periods can be seen as one of the natural possibilities for personalization and implementation of the personal education pathway. The individual needs of the student is addressed by the wide variety of international partner networks, that helps us ensure for high quality foreign exchange periods.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, our education centre is active in Education Export and development of the staff\u2019s international skills. Sedu supports staff on their international work placement periods in partner institutions and companies to learn good practices and improve their cross-cultural skills. Besides the initiating immigrant training causes challenges for the staff\u2019s existing skills, the foreign exchange periods can increase staff skills in this point as well.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA116-034411_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TN33"}
