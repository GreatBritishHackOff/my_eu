Ultravisc will allow the production of higher grade products from recycled materials, and will reduce costs for plastics recyclers and processors, thus increasing European competitiveness. It will also provide significant environmental benefits, through conservation of non-renewable raw materials, processing energy, and CO2 emissions, and a reduction in landfill use. The lack of highly efficient separation processes for consumer plastics results in materials that are contaminated and inconsistent regarding physical properties. This results in two distinct problems in the processing of these materials by extrusion methods. The first is the presence of small particulate contaminants, which can give rise to serious defects and the generation of scrap product. The second is batch-to-batch variability in the bulk melt flow index, due to differences in the source of the waste materials used. This demands re-optimisation of machine operating parameters, resulting in line downtime and materials wastage. Our process will be based on novel \u2018Soft Sensor\u2019 technology, which will monitor the viscosity of the polymer melt during processing and control the selective application of ultrasound to ensure consistent processing, using an intelligent fully closed-loop system. We will also develop an ultrasonically assisted filter pack capable of filtering fine particulate contaminants with a low back pressure, improving filtration of plastics.

Scientists successfully addressed the batch-to-batch variability in flow properties due to the aforementioned issues with EU funding of the project http://www.cherrypipes.com/ ('Sensor-based ultrasonic viscosity control for the extrusion of recycled plastics') (ULTRAVISC).\n\nThey exploited novel soft-sensor technology that essentially uses computer algorithms to draw inferences from process observations when the use of hard sensors is not possible. Information from the soft-sensor\u2013monitoring technology is used to control the application of ultrasound to alter the viscosity of materials in the extruder. The system also used ultrasound to aid in filtering fine particulate contaminants. Process trials with a variety of dies and both virgin and recycled feedstock demonstrated the ability of the technology to reduce viscosity, maintain desired viscosity and increase throughput.\n\nULTRAVISC technology will enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to exploit the full potential of recycled plastic in the manufacture of new products. The large number of EU SMEs in the field can now continuously monitor and control the viscosity of extruded materials to minimise waste while producing higher-quality products. Better control has even opened the door to new markets, including products with thinner walls than previously possible.

The outcome is damage on an extraordinary scale, to the hugely expensive aircraft they are servicing. The direct cost of ground accidents involving Ground Support Equipment (GSE) and their aircraft amounts globally to \u20ac1billion annually and a staggering \u20ac5billion in indirect costs. As more aircraft manufactured from composite materials come into service, these costs are likely to rise even higher. More worryingly, safety will be compromised as damage to composites can easily go unnoticed.\n\nExisting state-of-the-art technologies cannot address this growing problem. The Ramp-Aware project will develop a novel system for sensing the location of GSE in relation to aircraft, thereby greatly reducing the number of costly collisions between GSE and aircraft. This system will provide a robust solution for its environment, by achieving the following objectives: specialist short range radar capable of 50mm ranging accuracy at 30m from aircraft with a vehicle orientation detection accuracy of 0.1\u00b0 in all weather conditions and a GSE positional tracking system with overall accuracy of 50mm.\n\nUsing this solution the project expects to comprehensively address the problem of accidents involving GSE & aircraft on the ramp.

All staff want to ensure that there is progression in play from nursery to P1 and then into P2.  \r\nAs the school has a high percentage of Newcomer pupils the staff involved in small group withdrawal of these pupils wish to avail of training to help them make their time spent with these pupils as meaningful as possible & to ensure that there is lots of concrete learning going on that can applied by the children when they return to the main class. \r\neach year we are seeing more pupils with sensory issues and staff are keen to avail of training on more physical teaching methods to help not only those pupils with sensory issues but all the children in the classes.\r\nLanguage development, creativity and the teaching of STEM  subjects are all part of our new SDP and the EYFS staff want to ensure they are equipped to deliver these in the most innovative way possible. \r\nThis project offers an opportunity for teaching and support staff to gain new skills that can shared with their colleagues who are not taking part. \r\nThe 2 support staff working with the FS & KS1 Newcomers will avail of the training in Iceland and the one  working with the FS pupils will attend the course in Malta too. \r\nA member of staff from each of the 3 classes in EYFS will attend the training in Iceland and Italy. The Nursery Teacher will also attend the training in Malta as they have the most number of children starting school with little or no English.\r\nThe school will share all skills and methods learned with our partner school and in wider clusters with local schools and the N.I wide  integrated sector.\r\nIt is hoped that staff would be able to share some of the skills learned with parents during 'Stay and Play' sessions to help parents realize the benefits of learning in a more physical and creative way.", "http://www.windmill.educatr.com", "WINDMILL INTEGRATED PRIMARY SCHOOL LIMITED", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047002_coordinator"], ["7BE", "Impacto educativo a trav\u00e9s de las TIC y las nuevas metodolog\u00edas emergentes", "WINDMILL INTEGRATED PRIMARY SCHOOL LIMITED", 7655.0, "Valverde is a rural district located between Elche and Santa Pola (Alicante), located in an environment that enables learning and good coexistence. From the CEIP La Vallverda we bet for the educational innovation and the continuous formation of the teaching staff. This project arises due to the need for ICT training and methodological trends on the part of the faculty, together with the need to internationalize the center, opening it up to new networks of European centers. The main areas to improve are:\r\n- To provide teachers with new ideas and materials to effectively introduce ICT in Infant and Primary.\r\n- To improve the use of ICT applied to education in different areas.\r\n- To know new emerging methodologies in Europe.\r\n- To promote STEM teaching so that students acquire adequate scientific and technological literacy and develop key competences for the 21st century.\r\n- To generate European awareness and provide internationalization to the center.\r\n- To promote the equality and access of women to science and technology from Early Childhood Education.\r\n- To acquire greater competence in the use of ICT to improve the quality of teaching.\r\n- To encourage creativity and innovative spirit.\r\n- To improve the educational skills of students and school performance.\r\n- To prepare didactic materials and interactive digital educational resources that facilitate attention to diversity.\r\n- To create scientific concern in students (exploring, collecting data, considering problems, possible solutions, ...)\r\n- To improve the development of the introduction of ICT in the curriculum by learning to use and make different multimedia resources and formats (videos, short films, time-lapse, stop-motion, use of social networks, etc.).\r\nWe propose that three teachers attend short-term training courses abroad. It is proposed that the ICT coordinator attend a course in the last week of July in Dublin, Ireland. The course is entitled \"Tablets and smartphones: using mobile devices as educational tools\", to learn how to integrate mobile devices in the classroom and reinforce learning in a motivating way. The following course \"Interactive ITC-based, digital and web tools for an effective blended, flipped and cooperative learning\" will be done by a Primary teacher. It will take place in the third week of July in Rome, Italy, it aims to raise awareness of key issues on digital literacy, reflect and analyze teaching and learning by integrating ICT. The third mobility is the \"Creative teaching in the primary classroom\" course. It will be held in the second half of July in Oxford, United Kingdom. The Primary Coordinator will attend. The aims is to acquire new creative teaching techniques. The fourth mobility will be a jobshadowing period at the Windmill Integrated Primary School in Dungannon, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom during the second week of October. In this jobshadowing a pre-primary teacher and a member of the Management Team will participate to observe the operation and organization of a rural school in the United Kingdom, as well as work in the use and promotion of ICT.\r\nOnce the mobilities are completed, a significant impact will be created on students, teachers, families and the educational community, through the dissemination of results by teachers. They will share the experience with the rest of the teaching staff in the schools of the area of the Country of Elche, disseminating the resources and materials prepared.\r\nThe planned activities are: development of a bank of digital resources, digitization of the bibliographic collection of the school library, digitization of the assemblies of Pre-primary Education, choice of the slogan \"Science and Technology and the role of women in this world\" as a guiding thread of the complementary activities, creation of a space with mobile devices available to students after school, booktrailers and video-reviews by the students of the reading books, participation in eTwinning projects, digital presentations and creation of wikispaces by the students, introduction of the gamification in the teaching practice, visit of a scientific woman, stay in a campus of linguistic scientific immersion, video-making projects of Sciences and a final day of open doors.\r\nThe impact of the project will be the acquisition of new digital tools and methodologies that will have a positive impact on the students since it will improve their digital competence, motivation, educational skills and school performance, which will be evaluated comparing previous years. The families will participate in the activities and observe the changes produced in the center.\r\nThe dissemination will be carried out through shared activities in eTwinning with other European centers, enabling future KA2 associations. These actions will help to conserve and guarantee the sustainability of the project.", "http://www.windmill.educatr.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA101-049190_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT71"}
