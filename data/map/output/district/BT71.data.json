Ultravisc will allow the production of higher grade products from recycled materials, and will reduce costs for plastics recyclers and processors, thus increasing European competitiveness. It will also provide significant environmental benefits, through conservation of non-renewable raw materials, processing energy, and CO2 emissions, and a reduction in landfill use. The lack of highly efficient separation processes for consumer plastics results in materials that are contaminated and inconsistent regarding physical properties. This results in two distinct problems in the processing of these materials by extrusion methods. The first is the presence of small particulate contaminants, which can give rise to serious defects and the generation of scrap product. The second is batch-to-batch variability in the bulk melt flow index, due to differences in the source of the waste materials used. This demands re-optimisation of machine operating parameters, resulting in line downtime and materials wastage. Our process will be based on novel \u2018Soft Sensor\u2019 technology, which will monitor the viscosity of the polymer melt during processing and control the selective application of ultrasound to ensure consistent processing, using an intelligent fully closed-loop system. We will also develop an ultrasonically assisted filter pack capable of filtering fine particulate contaminants with a low back pressure, improving filtration of plastics. These innovations will enable consistent processing of variable grade recycled plastic materials.", 281403.0, 1108547.0, "ULTRAVISC", "Ultrasound improves recycled plastics flow", "Recyclation of plastics has become increasingly common throughout the EU. Scientists have delivered monitoring and control technology to ensure that manufacturers can reliably use waste to manufacture other products.", "Without highly efficient methods to separate post-consumer plastic waste, feedstock exhibits significant variations in physical properties and level of contamination. Scientists successfully addressed the batch-to-batch variability in flow properties due to the aforementioned issues with EU funding of the project http://www.cherrypipes.com/ ('Sensor-based ultrasonic viscosity control for the extrusion of recycled plastics') (ULTRAVISC).\n\nThey exploited novel soft-sensor technology that essentially uses computer algorithms to draw inferences from process observations when the use of hard sensors is not possible. Information from the soft-sensor\u2013monitoring technology is used to control the application of ultrasound to alter the viscosity of materials in the extruder. The system also used ultrasound to aid in filtering fine particulate contaminants. Process trials with a variety of dies and both virgin and recycled feedstock demonstrated the ability of the technology to reduce viscosity, maintain desired viscosity and increase throughput.\n\nULTRAVISC technology will enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to exploit the full potential of recycled plastic in the manufacture of new products. The large number of EU SMEs in the field can now continuously monitor and control the viscosity of extruded materials to minimise waste while producing higher-quality products. Better control has even opened the door to new markets, including products with thinner walls than previously possible. As consumers continue to recycle more and more plastic materials, SMEs can now take better advantage of it, increasing their competitive position while preserving natural resources.", "http://www.ultravisc.org", "http://www.cherrypipes.com", "/docs/results/images/2014-01/58254.jpg", "fp7_107640_996648326"], ["6LA", "Development of a robust cost-effective collision awareness and avoidance system for ground support equipment operating on the airport ramp", "Mallaghan Engineering Limited", "Even without taking into account expected increases in airport capacity, ground handling crews responsible for aircraft turnaround are already operating under time constraints and in highly congested areas, often in difficult weather conditions. The outcome is damage on an extraordinary scale, to the hugely expensive aircraft they are servicing. The direct cost of ground accidents involving Ground Support Equipment (GSE) and their aircraft amounts globally to \u20ac1billion annually and a staggering \u20ac5billion in indirect costs. As more aircraft manufactured from composite materials come into service, these costs are likely to rise even higher. More worryingly, safety will be compromised as damage to composites can easily go unnoticed.\n\nExisting state-of-the-art technologies cannot address this growing problem. The Ramp-Aware project will develop a novel system for sensing the location of GSE in relation to aircraft, thereby greatly reducing the number of costly collisions between GSE and aircraft. This system will provide a robust solution for its environment, by achieving the following objectives: specialist short range radar capable of 50mm ranging accuracy at 30m from aircraft with a vehicle orientation detection accuracy of 0.1\u00b0 in all weather conditions and a GSE positional tracking system with overall accuracy of 50mm.\n\nUsing this solution the project expects to comprehensively address the problem of accidents involving GSE & aircraft on the ramp. In doing so, we will deliver \u20ac42.02 million revenue with a profit of \u20ac10.95 million to the SME partners after 5 years. This will lead to the creation of over 200 highly skill jobs, greatly reduce the enormous direct and indirect costs of damage for ground handling providers and airlines, alleviate travel disruptions to passengers, make the job of the ground handler more manageable and safer, reduce the emerging threat of unnoticed damage to composite aircraft which will maintain and improve air safety standards.", 286387.0, 1319889.0, "RAMPAWARE", "Safely guiding airport vehicles", "An EU group is developing tools that prevent drivers of aircraft support vehicles from colliding with parked aeroplanes.

Yet, as a consequence, airport-apron accidents have dramatically increased, causing worker injuries and many billions of euros worth of damage to aircraft.\n\nThe EU-funded http://rampaware.eu/ (RAMPAWARE) project  comprises eight-members in a consortium whose expertise includes radar design, control systems, system integration and navigation systems.\n\nThe proposed sensing and navigation technologies include synthetic aperture radar (SAR), the automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast (ADS-B) type of satellite positioning, an inertial navigation tracking system and other smart sensors. The project is also summarising the sensor information for the vehicle driver via a graphical user interface.\n\nTeam members initially developed specifications for system requirements and conducted basic SAR research concerning quick detection of large objects. The research yielded optimal algorithms for accurate tracking of vehicle position and shape changing, control systems suitable for most GSE vehicles and an automated immediate braking system. The project also developed its inertial navigation tracking system, and validated the associated prototype software. Other technologies under development include a radar sensing system for feature extraction and accurate, all-weather positioning.\n\nThe RAMPAWARE project deliverables stand to create jobs and business opportunities, while improving airport worker safety and increasing aviation profitability.", null, "http://www.mallaghan.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-07/159409.jpg", "fp7_107426_953608456"], ["7DX", "Developing SUstainable PERmanent Grassland systems and policies", "The Nothern Ireland Agricultural Research and Development Council", "The existence and management of permanent grasslands (PG) is key to the delivery of multiple ecosystem services (ES) across Europe.
