The development of the project will reach the following results:   \uf0a7 The solution for the profitability management of the whey as by-product.  \uf0a7 The diversification of the whey product market avoiding strong whey prices fluctuations. \uf0a7 Production of a new high added value product (lactic acid) at low cost from whey.   The general aim of this proposal is to design a process for the lactic acid production from deproteinized whey. New immobilisation techniques will be applied in fermentation process with near Infrared spectroscopy that will be set as analytical tool to control the process in a quantitative way, at real time. Green chemistry strategies will be used for the simultaneous reaction and extraction of lactic acid in supercritical fluids technology in order to get a whole sustainable and environmental friendly process.   The potential market to produce lactic acid at a low cost with higher purity based on new production technologies will suppose a great increase in the demand and the evolution of new applications.  Lactic acid and its derivatives are widely used in the pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic, \u2026.  Recently, in the pharmaceutical filed, there has been an increased interest in lactic acid production, since it can be used as a raw material for production of L(\\)-polylactic acid, a polymer used for manufacturing high cost biomedical implants and environmental-friendly biodegradable plastic.  This project requires the use of advanced facilities and the simultaneous collaboration of experts in biotechnology, supercritical fluids and processes developers. Three RTD performance has been selected to ensure the achievement of these objectives.

The whey is the residual liquid fraction that is obtained during the production of cheese. Its raised content of lactose makes it a high contaminant waste which needs to be processed before disposal. Postharvest disinfection of F&V is crucial for extending the market time of the produce, and chlorine is the sanitizer most widely used. However, the likely formation of carcinogenic chlorinated compounds in water has called into question chlorine application, which is already banned in several EU countries.\nWhey and its derivatives have shown promising perspectives as natural preservatives for disinfection of F&V. The project WHEYSAN aims to develop new technologies for the decontamination of whole and fresh-cut F&V and for the processing of whey to achieve a profitable byproduct with sanitizing properties. For this purpose, the whey produced by the dairy SME will be treated under different processing conditions and the efficacy of the whey derivatives as sanitizing agents for F&V will be assessed. The most successful whey derivatives will be fully characterized. Also, a protocol for whey processing will be established to reduce the heterogeneity among the samples.\nIn order to make real the industrial exploitation of the new disinfection strategy, a commercial formula containing the whey derivatives will be developed. Moreover, the laboratory results will be scaled-up and the most efficient conditions for disinfection of whole and fresh-cut F&V will be defined at pilot and industrial scales. Consequently, the project WHEYSAN will provide two major benefits for the participant SMEs: a new source of revenue from the whey-based sanitizing formula, and an increased turnover from the commercialization of chlorine-free F&V in the organic market", 83979.0, 923934.0, "WHEYSAN", "Organically cleaned fruit and vegetables", "Using a by-product from cheese production, a natural fruit and vegetable wash can be created. This solution might be an organic alternative to chlorine.", "The shelf-life of fruits and vegetables must be extended in order to meet consumer demands. The dairy industry produces a large amount of the by-product whey, which is considered a high-contaminant waste if not processed before disposal. Exploring the possibility of using whey is a solution to both issues.\n\nFunded by the EU, the http://www.contactica.es/wheysan/ (WHEYSAN) project proposes a natural whey-based disinfection formula as a solution for sanitising whole and fresh-cut fruits and vegetables. One of the main objectives of WHEYSAN is to find a natural sanitising alternative to chlorine for fruits and vegetables. Another objective is to find a solution for a highly polluting by-product of the dairy industry, unprocessed whey.\n\nFour different kinds of cheeses and the respective types of whey were analysed and underwent different potential processes. In total, 16 different combinations of whey types and treatments were obtained and brought to the analytical lab for a further physico-chemical and microbial analysis.\n\nThe eventual results of the project will include a whey-based raw material with sanitising properties and a whey-based commercial formula. Industrial protocols for whey processing, for sanitiser application on whole fruit and vegetables, and for sanitiser application on fresh-cut fruit and vegetables will be created.\n\nA whey-based commercial formula is the project's main breakthrough, and while not yet identified, antimicrobial and proximate analyses have been performed. It was determined that the following three methods are required to determine antimicrobial activity: disk diffusion, agar dilution, and broth dilution. Of these three, disk diffusion and broth dilution were chosen for usage.\n\nProtocols for whey processing with EU directives were identified regarding information related to customers, food safety, environmental issues and the commercialisation of biocide products. In terms of creating an industrial protocol for sanitiser application, issues such as the types of washers, factors influencing washing efficiency and the basics of fogging have been considered.\n\nThis project offers an important opportunity to transform a harmful waste product into a natural and environmentally friendly sanitisation alternative, thus achieving a profitable by-product.", "http://www.contactica.es/wheysan/", null, "/docs/results/images/2015/144654.jpg", "fp7_105761_998880490"], ["1BJ", "A novel system for the treatment of milk based on the combination of ultrasounds and pulsed electric field technologies", "Highland Fine Cheeses Limited", "The EU dairy industry produces 130 billion litres of raw milk each year for consumption and for application in the production of many food, feed and pharma products. Without doubt the quality and safety of milk and milk products is of paramount importance for safeguarding the health and safety of EU consumers. While pasteurisation has resulted in a dramatic decline in milk-borne disease outbreaks, consumption of raw or inadequately pasteurised milk has been associated with several outbreaks of enteric infections with pathogens such as Listeria and Campylobacter. Furthermore, not all consumers want to drink milk that has been pasteurised, and although a niche product, consumer interest in raw milk is growing as many people believe it contains a higher proportion of beneficial microorganisms and vitamins. Raw milk continues to be consumed directly by large numbers of people in rural areas across the EU. There is a need for a technology that will improve the treatment of milk and provide an alternative to pasteurisation. Research carried out by University College Dublin revealed that the treatment of milk with thermosonication (TS) combined with pulsed electric field (PEF) achieved a degree of inactivation of L. innocua comparable with conventional pasteurisation, while substantially reducing the severity of the time/temperature exposure. This project will build on this research and will build a TS and PEF- based pre-competitive prototype system called SmartMILK. It will be tested and validated in milk production facilities. A key innovativion of the SmartMILK project will centre on optimising the combination of TS and PEF, whereby TS can assist the treatment technology in resulting in a lesser degree of thermal damage in the milk, thereby retaining more of the organoleptically and nutritionally favourable characteristics of the fresh product, while potentially achieving similar or superior shelf life to the conventional treatment.", 58512.0, 1287314.0, "SMARTMILK", "An alternative to pasteurisation", "Researchers have developed a new approach to milk treatment in response to a growing preference to consume milk that is safe but which retains more of the natural characteristics of raw milk. Their prototype machine uses milder conditions than pasteurisation, resulting in less thermal damage to the milk.", "Rural populations across Europe often still drink raw milk, and other consumers prefer unpasteurised milk, believing it to have a higher nutritional value. However, the consumption of raw or inadequately pasteurised milk has been associated with foodborne illness such as Salmonella.\n\nPasteurisation prevents this by killing bacteria, yeast and fungi, but the high temperatures used also change the taste, and reduce the levels of vitamins and bioactive compounds. The EU-funded SMARTMILK initiative investigated an alternative milk treatment technology that would retain the natural flavours and components of milk, while ensuring consumer safety.\n\nThe SMARTMILK prototype combines a pulsed electric field (PEF) with ultrasounds at moderate heat. This approach employs milder conditions to inactivate microorganisms, but results in a similar shelf life achieved with conventional pasteurisation.\n\nProject developers were committed to making the system affordable, robust and easy to maintain. In the initial stages of the project, they surveyed milk processors, cheese makers, yoghurt manufacturers and dairy equipment providers in order to define the industrial specifications. From this, a modular prototype unit that can be easily transported and used in typical industrial dairy plants was developed.\n\nThe functionality and technology of the system was validated in a pilot plant facility in Spain. It was tested for the treatment of milk, as well as for its suitability in cheese making and yoghurt manufacture.\n\nThe results of the validation tests indicated that the SMARTMILK system can be used to inactivate the microorganisms present in the raw milk. The sensory characteristics of pasteurised milk cheese were preferred over SMARTMILK cheese. Unlike conventionally pasteurised dairy products, SMARTMILK yoghurt showed lower viscosity and a smoother texture.\n\nAt this stage, the prototype proved the concept in industrial conditions, but it is not yet suitable for systematic industrial exploitation. During the post-project phase, more work will be done to scale the technology up to commercial scale for market exploitation. The potential for this system to be used in the treatment of other liquid products such as fruit juices, wine and beer is high. The SMARTMILK approach is expected to benefit consumer safety and confidence, which could in turn improve the competitiveness of thousands of European milk processing small-to-medium enterprises.", "http://www.smartmilk.eu/", null, "/docs/results/images/2013-09/56268.jpg", "fp7_96180_998880490"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1EU", "French Immersion Course", "Craighill Primary School", 2028.0, "Our school currently has a 1+2 policy on our School Action Plan and is a key priority of the schools aims.
