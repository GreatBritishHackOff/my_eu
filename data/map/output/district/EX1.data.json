Mobility is an added value to our educational programmes and it diversifies everyday activities in all our partner schools be it for students or teachers.", "http://www.corkscrew.io", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SI01-KA102-035380_2"], ["1QA", "Sparking Emotional Intelligence & Employability Through Entrepreneurship", "Corkscrew Ltd", 162391.0, "Whilst internships and work placements can provide a brief window into the working world, they do not go far enough in developing a learner\u2019s professional skill set or provide an environment for learning the key attributes of entrepreneurship. This innovative 2 week mobility in Dublin and Barcelona addresses this by blending practical training with relevant work placements within local startup organisations.\r\n\r\nThe Sparking Emotional Intelligence & Employability Through Entrepreneurship mobility will take 88  learners enrolled on BTEC business and Enterprise Courses or BTEC Tourism and Business and 2 Enterprise staff from 4 Colleges in the UK to two of the most entrepreneurial cities in Europe and immerse them in the world of startups at cowork spaces MOB or the GEC.  Over the 2 weeks they will develop the 3 main pillars of their entrepreneurial mindsets; creative problem solving, initiative and confidence in leadership, as well as more specific technical skills in business startup such as social media marketing, branding, finance and project management.    The principles of Emotional Intelligence are embedded within the SEE Entrepreneurship mobility, enabling learners and staff to explore the personal skills fundamental to an entrepreneurial mindset, which will set them apart and influence their lifelong personal and professional attitudes. \r\n\r\nThe vocational startup training programme developed by Corkscrew, IEP and MOB will introduce key aspects of entrepreneurship to learners and staff in a practical learning journey, developing the creative skills to spot business opportunities and identify the feasibility of an idea.  The process of lean startup will be introduced, and how to take an idea to market (website creation, social media marketing and testing). All training is conducted in a real working environment, in a live context, and directly related to the course curriculum, allowing the transfer of credits onto specific modules through the ECVET framework.  Coursework and vocational training will be enhanced and extended by the online resource developed by Corkscrew for 2017, which becomes an integral part of the SEE Entrepreneurship programme, giving access to resources, ideas and an international community of innovative thinkers.\r\n\r\nThe work experience element of the programme, also conducted at the cowork spaces in Barcelona and Dublin, enables learners to work on business projects for residents of the space, while staff shadow entrepreneurs in their daily working life. Projects will have a direct implication to the host organisations, providing a tangible work project that allows learners to develop confidence and experience in a working startup environment, making them more employable on their return to the UK.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying staff will assess, evaluate and ultimately implement the learnings of the mobility, with the targeted impact of introducing more entrepreneurial activity within education.  Staff will work closely with all stakeholders in validating the entire lifetime of the project and how best to influence curriculum, not only within the selected BTEC Business and Enterprise courses, but the institutions as a whole. Supported by the new online resources, staff will be instrumental in assisting future mobilities and enhancing and embedding entrepreneurship in education, in line with UK and EU proposals.\r\n\r\nThe success of the SEE Entrepreneurship Mobility is due to the clear methodology developed by the consortium, through understanding the needs and impacts of all stakeholders and a project life-cycle appraisal from preparation to completion, including recruitment, learner agreements, delivery, assessment, evaluation and dissemination.  This has resulted in new innovations for 2017;  the introduction of the impact of emotional intelligence on personal mindset and professional success, and the development of the Corkscrew online resources to provide ongoing wraparound support to both learners and staff as they continue in their startup journey. \r\n\r\nResults from previous mobilities have far exceeded expectations in the level of impact on the learners professional and personal development, and on the staff delivery of higher value course structure in the UK with EU dimensions.  The impact is also felt at institutional level as we gain interest in future EU mobility partnerships and opportunities.   A further year will allow us to build our European Development Plan, with the addition the new online platform which will extend the period of learning and influence beyond the mobility, supporting development of entrepreneurial skills and innovation both before and after the students visit the cowork facilities.  Continued access to the platform for students through their journey beyond college will continue to support their entrepreneurial mindset, allowing us to track the impacts of the SEE Entrepreneurship Mobility into the workplace.", "http://www.corkscrew.io", "Corkscrew Ltd", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-035795_coordinator"], ["1QA", "ESTANCIAS INTERNACIONALES PARA ALUMNADO Y PROFESORADO SEFED", "Corkscrew Ltd", 280770.0, "Inform Foundation manages since 1987 the SEFED Programme (Simulation for Business Educational Purposes - The Practice Firm concept) which offers training to around 7.000 students delivered by 800 teachers in vocational training institutions and training for the unemployed in Spain. All these students are being trained in professional and social skills in the business and managing of companies field.\r\n\r\nThis professional and practical training aimed at finding jobs is well know and acknowledged by the Ministry of Labour issuing a professional certificate with level 1 or 2 by the corresponding Ministry of Education issuing a medium level of vocational training in the administration or comercial field.\r\n\r\nInform has always considered working experiences abroad as part of and an added value to the training delivered in the SEFED Programme. Thus, Erasmus + K1 Programme allows us to support our students and teachers in training activities to achieve and use knowledge, skills and qualifications for their personal development, ocupability and participation in the European labour market. \r\n\r\nThe participants of this project are:\r\n\r\n- Unemployed students or VET students (mainly young people and women over 25 years old) who are being trained in the SEFED Programme and who would like to improve not only their knowledge and skills in the business field, undertaking working experience stays in Ireland or Great Britain, but their language skills as well. Thus, the project is about to undertake 100 working stays in Irish, Italian, Lithuanian or UK companies and undertake business and management tasks during 4, 5, 8 or 12 weeks as a maximum as participants cannot have longer stays because of personal reasons and the need they have to look for jobs. We include accompanying teachers to help and support students in the firts days of their mobility, so most of them are under 18 and/or they have not any labour experience.\r\n\r\n- Teachers and professional staff working for the SEFED Programme: the project allows us to offer a unique opportunity for 40 teachers and professional staff working for the SEFED Programme to be able to share and improve their knwoledge and experiences in a different country and in different organizations, including the transfer of skills and/or methods and innovative ways of doing things in the training field. The transfer of know-how is meant to improve the quality and access to continuous training, to update and adapt the european educational and training systems. When improving knowledge, attitudes and individual skills from all professional staff involved in the SEFED Programme, we will improve in the development of the european labour market and social economy.\r\nThe project is based on professional stays in 6 countries, 4 of them already have practice firm networks and are members of Europen-Pen International, from which Inform Foundation is a founding member. Specifically, the professional/pedagogical team will undertake training stays for 5 days in different training organizations which have practice firms in Belgium, Finland, France and Lithuania in which teachers and professional staff will share experiences and best practices regarding the practice firm concept, the organization and management of practice firms as active learning tools.\r\nThere will also be some stays in Ireland and UK in which there will be a combination of know-how transfer, innovative learning ways of doing things and application of IT in training. There will also be visits to Irish and English companies so as to undertake job-shadowing.\r\nThe participants will be teachers in language skills, foreign trade skills and counselors and training professional staff. There will also be professional staff from Inform Foundation with the aim to set up links with the Central Offices for Practice Firms from the 2 members of Europen-Pen International (Belgium, Finland, France and Lithuania).\r\n\r\nThe project is meant to improve the quality of the SEFED Programme, the ocupability and competitivity of students and professional staff in training participating in the project.\r\n\r\nTo prove the success there has been some success indicators set up as the level of labour ocupability of students, the improvement degree of language skills, or the increase of foreign trade orders.", "http://www.corkscrew.io", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037404_2"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["3PB", "MET OFFICE*", 1715910.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_1417", 2017], ["1JG", "WRG EUROPE LTD", 268113.0, "Making the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system (08.02.03.03)", "fts_2017_2602", 2017], ["3PB", "MET OFFICE*", 430637.0, "Achieving a European transport system that is resource-efficient, environmentally friendly, safe and seamless (08.02.03.04)", "fts_2017_5169", 2017], ["3PB", "MET OFFICE*", 188832.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_8173", 2017], ["3PB", "MET OFFICE*", 607850.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_8982", 2017], ["1JG", "WRG EUROPE LTD", 79765.0, "Making the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system (32.04.03.01)", "fts_2017_13868", 2017], ["3PB", "MET OFFICE*", 355360.0, "Leadership in space (02.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_22138", 2017], ["1NS", "HORIZON CONSULTING ENGINEERS LIMITED", 15701.0, "Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie actions \u2014 generating, developing and transferring new skills, knowledge and innovation (15.03.01.01)", "fts_2017_25352", 2017]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["2ED", "RBZ", "HEAVITREE HOSPITAL"], ["3RB", "RBZ", "WHIPTON HOSPITAL"], ["2ED", "RH8", "HEAVITREE HOSPITAL"], ["3RB", "RH8", "EXETER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"], ["3PQ", "RWV", "HOSPITAL LANE"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EX1"}
