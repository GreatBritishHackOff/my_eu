Integrating the PC and SERS based sensors with integrated optics coupling structures within a single sensor platform allows the implementation of a high-performance multi-parameter sensor. Currently, utilization of multi-parameter sensing is hindered by the lack of low-cost and, highly reproducibility fabrication methods for nano-structured surfaces. PHOTOSENS addresses these challenges by developing new roll-to-roll nanoimprinting manufacturing methods.\n\nScientific work includes development of the multilayer nanophotonic sensor structure, nanoimprint materials for large-area fabrication, functionalized molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) and high-volume manufacturing methods including Roll-to-Roll (R2R) nanoimprint processes for nano-texturing of large-area plastic films. PHOTOSENS will greatly increase understanding of photonic and plasmonic dispersion and field localisation effects in periodic nanostructures, such as Photonic Crystals, and their applicability to sensing purposes. PHOTOSENS demonstrates a multi-parameter large-area sensor platform for environmental and pharmaceutical sensing. The consortium is composed of 4 world-class research organisations, 2 SMEs and 3 large companies from 6 European countries representing the complete supply chain from technology developers to end users. The position of these organizations in their respective markets guarantees that the results of the project will be widely exploited providing the companies with a technological advantage over their global competitors and thus creating new high-tech jobs in Europe in this rapidly growing market.", 145981.0, 5784507.0, "PHOTOSENS", "Rolling out flexible chemical sensors", "Nanostructured sensor arrays enable detection of many molecules or parts of molecules in a given sample with a single test platform.

Tissue engineering using autologous cells offers a feasible alternative for functional restoration of the damaged urinary sphincter muscle and represents an ideal treatment option that could reverse the underlying pathologic conditions.\nMUSIC aims at translating basic knowledge on regenerative medicine (RM) and stem cell therapy into the clinic by undertaking a 'first-in-man' multisystem study using autologous muscle precursor cells (MPCs) in a combination with neuromuscular electromagnetic stimulation (NMES) in 40 female patients. We will carry out the specific tasks to prove safety and efficacy of the proposed novel multilevel treatment as well as reproducibility of the therapeutic effect.

The MUSIC consortium has an exclusive opportunity to determine the validity of this MPC cellular treatment in combination with NMES and to further improve its feasibility and clinical efficacy.

This is part of a sustained approach to the development of languages as advocated by Glasgow City Council.  We propose to send four members of staff (from a variety of stages) to an LFEE French immersion course in order to improve classroom methodologies in the teaching of French making excellent use of ICT.  This will also help to embed a European dimension into our school's curriculum.  Our school is striving to become a model of excellence in terms of modern languages provision.  The project will provide staff with training, expertise, resources and increased confidence to deliver enhanced French language lessons from primary one to primary seven.  \r\n\r\nIt has been acknowledged that the introduction of modern languages at an early age is beneficial to the knowledge and understanding of a child's mother tongue, as well as providing a useful future work skill.  The project will also promote increased cultural awareness and understanding of another European country.  It will extend our international activities, to include partnership work with other European schools.  The potential for networking with other European colleagues and establishments will be provided through the immersion training.  Currently, our primary seven pupils are given the opportunity to visit Paris on an annual basis.  This is being extended to include primary six children from next year.  This is a valuable starting point from which we hope to build.\r\n\r\nThis project can be viewed as a stepping stone towards a longer term vision.  When French has become fully embedded in our curriculum, we propose to introduce another modern language in a similar manner.  At the moment we have a member of staff studying Gaelic at Glasgow Gaelic School, and she has started teaching this second language at the primary three stage.

With the ever growing obesity problem in Glasgow we must raise awareness to our pupils, staff and parents on ways in which they can make healthier food choices which will promote healthier lifestyles. We intend to work with the Ecole Primaire publique Francois Moisson in France to share ideas on how we can promote better eating choices among our learners. We will learn from France how to eat and cook healthier options for our learners. We will do this by providing pupils with a range of healthy foods which they can explore and use to make recipes. We will provide pictorial recipes and also step by step instructions using talkers and other AAC devices. This will be beneficial for our learners with Autism as it will encourage them to explore different textures and colours of food. It will also expand their limited diets and provide more variety.\r\nOur main objectives are :To promote healthy eating and cookery among pupils and their families; To use Alternative Augmentative Communication to aid pupils in using recipe cards to effectively make a food dish; To enhance skills and knowledge regarding healthy eating and cookery among staff.; To experience the culture, language and healthy eating in France.; To exchange healthy recipes and cookery ideas with France. Both schools will work in close partnership to achieve the objectives. \r\nWe hope this will result in a greater motivation among our learners to try healthier options at school dinners and sample healthier foods. We also hope that pupils will develop their life skills by using money in supermarkets to purchase fruit and vegetables as shown on pictorial shopping lists. \r\nLong term benefits will be a greater knowledge and awareness among staff about the importance of healthy eating for our pupils. Staff will gain skills in using communication devices effectively and creating child friendly healthy recipes which are motivational food choices for our pupils.  Parents will begin to purchase healthier foods for their children and gain confidence in cooking healthy dishes using a variety of utensils and appliances.\r\nThe participants taking part are established, experienced teachers at Croftcroighn school. They will have a knowledge of France, its local culture, traditions, customs and language. The participants are all active members of the international schools team and are experienced in the use of ICT and promotion of Health and wellbeing. \r\nThis project will have long term health benefits for both our staff and pupils of each school. Pupils will learn how to grow their own fruit and vegetables and understand the cycle of growing and eating produce. They will learn which foods keep them healthy and how to prepare these to make food dishes. Our learners with Autism will overcome their fear of experimenting with new foods. We will carry out a baseline food assessment on a small group of autistic learners to measure which foods they liked/disliked at the beginning and end of project.\r\nThere will be eight participants with one accompanying international schools coordinator.
