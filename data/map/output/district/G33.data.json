Integrating the PC and SERS based sensors with integrated optics coupling structures within a single sensor platform allows the implementation of a high-performance multi-parameter sensor. Currently, utilization of multi-parameter sensing is hindered by the lack of low-cost and, highly reproducibility fabrication methods for nano-structured surfaces. PHOTOSENS addresses these challenges by developing new roll-to-roll nanoimprinting manufacturing methods.\n\nScientific work includes development of the multilayer nanophotonic sensor structure, nanoimprint materials for large-area fabrication, functionalized molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) and high-volume manufacturing methods including Roll-to-Roll (R2R) nanoimprint processes for nano-texturing of large-area plastic films. PHOTOSENS will greatly increase understanding of photonic and plasmonic dispersion and field localisation effects in periodic nanostructures, such as Photonic Crystals, and their applicability to sensing purposes. PHOTOSENS demonstrates a multi-parameter large-area sensor platform for environmental and pharmaceutical sensing. The consortium is composed of 4 world-class research organisations, 2 SMEs and 3 large companies from 6 European countries representing the complete supply chain from technology developers to end users. The position of these organizations in their respective markets guarantees that the results of the project will be widely exploited providing the companies with a technological advantage over their global competitors and thus creating new high-tech jobs in Europe in this rapidly growing market.", 145981.0, 5784507.0, "PHOTOSENS", "Rolling out flexible chemical sensors", "Nanostructured sensor arrays enable detection of many molecules or parts of molecules in a given sample with a single test platform.

It represents a condition with a prevalence of 20-50% in women, thereby creating an immense socio-economic burden. The currently available treatment strategies entail various complications and offer only short-term relief to the patients. Tissue engineering using autologous cells offers a feasible alternative for functional restoration of the damaged urinary sphincter muscle and represents an ideal treatment option that could reverse the underlying pathologic conditions.\nMUSIC aims at translating basic knowledge on regenerative medicine (RM) and stem cell therapy into the clinic by undertaking a 'first-in-man' multisystem study using autologous muscle precursor cells (MPCs) in a combination with neuromuscular electromagnetic stimulation (NMES) in 40 female patients. We will carry out the specific tasks to prove safety and efficacy of the proposed novel multilevel treatment as well as reproducibility of the therapeutic effect. Additional objectives are optimization of the advanced-therapy medicinal product (ATMP) towards totally xeno-free and facilitated manufacturing as well as the introduction of a novel injection technique for more efficient and precise implantation of the final product.\nCombining expertise, MUSIC features a unique infrastructure, including the knowledge of experts in the fields of RM, urology, cellular biology and biomaterials throughout Europe (CH, NL, UK, A, D). The MUSIC consortium has an exclusive opportunity to determine the validity of this MPC cellular treatment in combination with NMES and to further improve its feasibility and clinical efficacy. The ultimate goal is to significantly improve the patients` quality of life and to exploit a future commercial opportunity by expanding the know-how to various smaller RM centers and companies within Europe, thus, making personalized medicine using autologous cells a more feasible SUI treatment option.\n\n\n'", 490191.0, 5775275.0, "MUSIC", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_207193_934063150"], ["1AP", "Development of Biomaterial-based Delivery Systems for Parkinson\u2019s disease - an Integrated Pan-European Approach", "Collagen Solutions (Uk) Limited", "BrainMatTrain focuses on a comprehensive understanding of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), from basics to translation, fully supported by 8 full partners partner organisation (4 research institutions, 2 hospitals, 2 SMEs) and one partner organisation (SME specialist in device design).
