The GIFT project suggests creating meaningful personalization through digital gifting and emotional appropriation: Designs for allowing visitors to create their own museum tours as digital 'mixtapes', and to play with technologies that measure emotional responses to artwork as a playful reappropriation of museum spaces.\n\nWe aim to accommodate the complex ways in which users may confront art and heritage content, and engage users to participate and share experiences that are emotionally poignant and personally profound. Through multidisciplinary, practice-based research we will develop, test and validate two ground-breaking prototypes for digital encounters with cultural heritage. From this process we will develop a framework with theory, tools, design guidelines and best practice recommendations for creating meaningful personalization of hybrid virtual museum experiences.\n\nThe GIFT consortium includes leading artists and researchers with a long history of successful collaborations, who will be working with a panel of 10 lead users from prominent European museums, to develop theoretical and practical advances with great impact for the cultural heritage sector and European society.\n\nBy enabling more engaging hybrid virtual/physical museum experiences, we will contribute to increasing citizens' curiosity and engagement. The hybrid format will also help make both virtual museum experiences as well as physical visits more engaging and attractive, thus contributing to economic growth through ticket sales as well as digital sales. By providing frameworks that help non-technical experts in the heritage sector to build and experiment with meaningful personalization of digital cultural heritage, the project gives the sector tools to build and innovate further.\n\n'", 284344.0, 2130332.0, "GIFT", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_205705_937136595"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2LA", "Betriebspraktika in europ\u00e4ischen Unternehmen 2017", "Loxdale English Centre/Swedish Folk High School", 81814.0, "In 2017 and 2018, 34 participants of the biennial and triennial (see 1) vocational course of State-Certified Commercial Assistants for Foreign Languages, 5 participants of the so called \u2018dual educational courses\u2019 (see 2) of Personnel Service Providers, Insurers, Retailers, and 8 participants of the course of Foreign Language Correspondence Clerks/A-levels will take part in the internship programme.\r\nThe Commercial Assistants who do their internship at the beginning of their last year of vocational studies then will have substantial demand of both, foreign languages in the field of commercial correspondence and terminology in foreign trade. They will have already obtained knowledge concerning such matters of commercial correspondence as enquiry, offer, order, delay in payment and notice of defects. Further, they will have learned how to handle different types of forms in the field of foreign trade and will have acquired detailed knowledge in the subjects of business administration, national economy and infonomics. In the latter they will have learned how to use computer programmes like Excel, Word and Powerpoint and will be well trained in word processing.\r\nDue to all these skills acquired, they are qualified for working in international importing and exporting enterprises, shipping companies, international industrial concerns and organisations as well as in hotels and/or language schools.\r\nAt a time when their state of knowledge enables the trainees to deal with responsible tasks in a company or an institution, the internships offer the opportunity to link their theoretical knowledge with practical training. What concerns us primarily is that for teaching purposes didactically reduced case studies become verified in a real environment in order to enhance the students\u2019 chances on the European labour market.\r\nAs this is a full-time vocational school training, the trainees have got few opportunities to work in side jobs to earn their own living. Thus, doing an internship in a foreign country does not only mean financial losses during the time of their stay but also considerable problems in raising the funds for a period abroad. Only if our trainees will be sponsored by the ERASMUS+ programme, we are able to realise our project which is continually carried out and supervised by qualified teachers experienced in this area.\r\nMoreover, this programme constitutes the frame of security, trustworthiness, approval and professional advice and support which is so important to our partners and beneficiaries.\r\nThis year\u2019s project of 8 to 11 weeks will be carried out in companies and institutions based in the UK, France, Spain, Ireland, Cyprus, Malta and Turkey.

For already three years now, we have been applying the ECVET instruments in co-operation with these partners. In recurrently held workshops we regularly update and adjust the instruments to the corresponding needs.\r\nAll details described above are mainly applicable to the Foreign Language Correspondence Clerks/A-levels, except the fact that these students are at the initial stage of their vocational training at the time of their internship. The trainees of the dual educational courses benefit from their three-week internship by testing their practical knowledge in other European countries. The teachers draw upon this experience by improving the quality of their training and to provide the entire staff with the newly gained knowledge and competences. \r\nThe participants of the project will benefit considerably and sustainably, both, in their professional and private life from the improvement of their language skills, newly gained cultural insights and, last but not least, their personality development. \r\n\r\n1 The students of the triennial course do a combined degree course of AVCE and State-certified Commercial Assistant for Foreign Languages.\r\n2 Dual courses are a combination of theoretical vocational training at school and practical training in a company.", "http://www.loxdale.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003828_5"], ["2LA", "APL in Europe", "Loxdale English Centre/Swedish Folk High School", 88984.0, "For several years, Midsommarkransens gymnasium has cooperated with Loxdale Centre in Brighton, England, as well as Lyc\u00e9e priv\u00e9 chalonnais Saint Charles.
