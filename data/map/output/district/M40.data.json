The project aims to achieve at least 20% to 30 % energy savings in the energy recovery systems from the successful completion of the project, through: (i) Enhancing our understanding of heat exchange and waste heat recovery; (ii) Combining enhanced heat transfer innovative design to achieve the synergy of separate novel technologies with focus on conventional, plate-fin and membrane exchangers. Current trends will be taken into account that whilst new types of exchangers are making an increasing impact and acceptance in the process industry, the main exchanger types are based around tubular constructions, shell and tubes and air cooled exchangers and that it is likely to remain so for many practical and pressure withstanding reasons.

An easy-to-use software toolbox will enable plant managers to consider all critical points in the plant.", "\n\t\tAlthough numerous technologies exist and are employed to varying degrees, heat recovery rarely achieves its maximum potential. A group of SMEs and scientists initiated the EU-funded project 'Intensified heat transfer technologies for enhanced heat recovery' http://intheat.dcs.uni-pannon.hu ((INTHEAT)) to maximise the heat recovery of heat exchanger networks (HENs) in processing plants.\n\nScientists collected data on current heat exchanger trends and applications and analysed emerging heat exchanger designs. They sought to apply novel techniques for enhanced performance only at the critical parts limiting overall system performance. Better understanding of heat exchanger fouling and of the properties of new materials for heat exchange led to an innovative methodology for combining heat transfer design with process integration to reduce process plant energy consumption.\n\nThe INTHEAT toolbox for heat exchanger retrofit or new design encompasses three levels of assessment in an easy-to-use software package for plant process engineers. It uses commercial software for individual heat exchanger design, INTHEAT software for modelling the HEN with all heat exchangers and their specific parameters including those of enhanced heat recovery and, finally, commercial software for HEN screening and optimisation.\n\nEnergy integration and intensification software was tested at a refinery plant with 31 heat exchangers and 14 processing streams as well as at 3 food-processing plants with exciting results regarding consumption, emissions, operating costs and profit. By considering all energy systems and optimising overall heat recovery with a focus on critical points, the INTHEAT decision support system should have significant impact on the energy efficiency of industrial plants and thus on both EU competitiveness and global climate change.\n\t", "http://www.intheat.eu", "http://www.proint.org", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58202.jpg", "fp7_96914_985484402"], ["7RU", "Up-Scaled Production of Graphene Reinforced Thermosetting Polymers for Composite, Coating and Adhesive Applications", "HMG Paints Ltd", "The concept of PolyGraph is to develop new production techniques which will deliver industrial-scale quantities of graphene-reinforced thermosetting polymers, suitable for use in a number of key applications where improvements are needed in the strength, stiffness, toughness, electrical conductivity and thermal properties; such as fibre-reinforced composite resins, coatings and adhesives.\n\nThe ultimate aim of PolyGraph is to develop a process in which graphene can be produced and dispersed \u201cin-situ\u201d within thermosetting polymer resins, using relatively inexpensive expanded graphite as a starting material.\nWe propose a staged approach to reach this ambitious goal, starting with production of graphene via new chemical and mechano-chemical methods and its subsequent dispersion in thermosetting resins. We will then further develop and modify existing mixing and dispersion equipment to enable the exfoliation of expanded graphite to be carried out directly in thermosetting resins. A further aim is to optimise techniques for the production of fibre-reinforced composites, adhesives and coatings, to ensure that the graphene remains well distributed in the final part.\n\nAs a result, we will significantly lower the overall cost of these materials and make them viable for use in the composites, coatings and adhesives industries.", 199189.0, 5781254.0, "PolyGraph", null, null, null, null, "http://www.hmgpaint.com", null, "fp7_110823_939014224"], ["5BP", "Development of bio-oil dewatering and fractionation processes and testing of upgraded bio-oil as engine fuel and feedstock for the production of lubricants", "Process Integration Limited", "'There is globally a large and growing market for biofuels, mainly due to environmental and safety of energy supply concerns, which is only limited by production capacity and competitive prices.

Therefore the rising pressure towards shifting to biomass residues and waste feedstock, is only hampered by the strong scientific and technological barriers still hindering the economic sustainability of so-called second generation biofuels production. The lead SME in the GREEN-OIL project holds a promising innovative process, based on microwave enhanced catalytic depolymerisation for the production of second generation bio-oil from feedstock materials like agricultural, industrial or municipal organic waste. However, currently the process generates bio-oil with high water content and consequently low sales price. The group of SMEs behind the GREEN-OIL project aims at developing new technology to upgrade this bio-oil for utilization in transportation (engine fuels) and for the production of lubricants. Specifically, the consortium wants to develop (1) an innovative dewatering process to reduce bio-oil water content below 2% and (2) a new fractionation process and conversion schemes for refining the dewatered bio-oil. Furthermore, the refined bio-oil will be tested as engine fuel, and the heavier fractions will be assessed as fossil crude replacement for manufacturing lubricants.
