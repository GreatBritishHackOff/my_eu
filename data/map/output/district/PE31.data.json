However, some plants use a super-charged photosynthetic mechanism called C4 photosynthesis. The C4 pathway is used by the most productive vegetation and crops on Earth. In addition to faster photosynthesis, C4 plants demand less water and less nitrogen. Overall, our aim is to introduce the characteristics of C4 into C3 crops. This would increase yield, reduce land area needed for cultivation, decrease irrigation, and limit fertiliser applications. If current C3 crops could be converted to use C4 photosynthesis, large economic and environmental benefits would ensue from both their increased productivity and the reduced inputs associated with the C4 pathway. It is important to note that the huge advances in agricultural production associated with the Green Revolution were not associated with increases in photosynthesis, and so its manipulation remains an unexplored target for crop improvement both for food and biomass. Even partial long-term success would have significant economic and environmental benefits. Efficient C4 photosynthesis would be achieved by alterations to leaf development, cell biology and biochemistry. Although initially we will be using model species such as rice and Arabidopsis we envisage rapid transfer of technological advances into mainstream EU crops, such as wheat and rape, that are used both for food and fuel. We will build capacity for C4 research in Europe in this area by the training of future generations of researchers. To achieve this aim we need to increase our understanding of the basic biology underlying the C4 pathway. Our specific objectives will therefore address fundamental aspects of C4 biology that are needed for a full understanding the pathway.\n\nSpecifically we aim:\n1. To understand the roles and development of the two cell types (mesophyll and bundle sheath) in C4 plants.\n2.

Central to this carbon fixation process is an enzyme called RuBisCo, which first evolved 3.5 billion years ago in photosynthetic bacteria.\n\nMany crop plants, including wheat, barley, rice, soybean and potatoes, use RuBisCo in an inefficient pathway \u2013 known as C3 photosynthesis \u2013 to fix carbon. More recently evolved grasses like maize have altered their leaf structure and biochemistry to use RuBisCo in the more efficient C4 photosynthesis pathway.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.3to4.org/ (3TO4) (3to4: Converting C3 to C4 photosynthesis for sustainable agriculture) project aims to transfer these efficient C4 traits into food and fuel crops. This can be achieved by genetically altering leaf development, cell biology and biochemical pathways in C3 plants, but first researchers must better understand C4.\n\nThey began by developing a detailed model of the entire C4 photosynthesis process, including how and where carbohydrates are synthesised. Genetic differences between C3 and C4 plants, including those controlling development of specific tissues that allow C4 plants to fix carbon more efficiently, were identified.\n\nResearchers also identified modifications to enzymes that are vital for C4 photosynthesis, as well as regulatory genes that control production of C4-associated gene products. They are using this information to integrate some components of the C4 pathway into a C3 crop, aiming eventually to create entirely new C4 crops.\n\nIntroducing the characteristics of C4 photosynthesis into C3 crops should improve yields, reduce land area needed for cultivation and allow the crop to tolerate drought. By training young researchers, building European research capacity and involving industry stakeholders, 3TO4 will also provide a strong foundation for long-term photosynthesis research.", "http://www.3to4.org/", null, "/docs/results/images/2015-07/159230.jpg", "fp7_101753_968764124"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PE31"}
