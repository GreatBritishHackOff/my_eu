The project responds to the urgent need to monitor and map time-dependent hazard and vulnerability, by triangulating space-based and in-situ data-collection, according to the type and extent of the natural hazard. The project will analyse the data needs of the end users through the three civil protection partners.\nA novel sampling framework will be developed that guides the in-situ data collection and integration process. Novel in-situ data collection tools (e.g. omni-directional imaging) will be included. Advanced analysis and processing of current and future space-based products will enhance the approach. Uncertainties will be fully considered. Soon-to-be-released space products such as DLR Global Urban Footprint will be validated and their integration with the proposed methodologies explored. Data needs for post-disaster recovery will be addressed within the same framework, resulting in a comprehensive methodological solution to the monitoring of time-varying indicators at multiple spatial scales throughout the disaster cycle.\nThe consortium of 8 prominent scientific institutions and highly skilled SMEs has considerable experience in their respective fields. Many partners currently collaborate on the Global Earthquake Model Inventory Data Collection Tool (GEM IDCT). The ultimate goal is to produce a multi-resolution time varying indicator monitoring framework that applies to the whole disaster cycle. The framework is intended to become the de-facto standard for future mapping of vulnerabilities.", 154016.0, 2019873.0, "SENSUM", "'Eyes' in the sky protect lives on Earth", "By exploiting the world's biggest Earth monitoring system, EU-funded researchers have worked out how to help people prepare and respond to natural disasters.", "As part of the EU's Copernicus programme, the first Sentinel satellites were launched in April 2014 with the support of the European Space Agency (ESA). Placed in low Earth orbit, they will provide the clearest pictures ever obtained of our planet's land, seas and atmosphere. One of the most innovative uses of Copernicus data will be to mitigate the effects of natural hazards.\n\nIn particular, the Copernicus Emergency Mapping Service (EMS) will monitor the effects of natural disasters in Europe and the rest of the world. Within the EU-funded http://www.sensum-project.eu/ (SENSUM) project, researchers have developed the software tools to make maps of earthquakes, floods and landslides readily accessible to everyone \u2014 from town planners to the general public.\n\nThe SENSUM tools integrate data from the Earth observation satellites with ground-based systems, such as omni-directional camera surveys. The combination is expected to lead to more robust estimates of the potential losses. For example, the software identifies which Copernicus observations best show the patterns of extreme rainfall and the infrastructure at risk.\n\nFrom the beginning, project researchers relied on free and open source software to allow the wide dissemination of maps to disaster management authorities. More importantly, the tools translate observations from Copernicus into information that is easy to interpret even by untrained people. The general public can also view the relevant observations to prepare for and respond to a natural disaster.\n\nAs more Sentinel satellites will follow in the coming years, with the last Sentinel scheduled to be placed in orbit around 2030, the Copernicus observational capacity will improve. At the same time, SENSUM's software tools could grow from experimental to fully fledged services that will help authorities quickly direct their emergency resources.", "http://www.sensum-project.eu/home", "http://www.imagecatinc.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/153712.jpg", "fp7_106561_958432460"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["2SB", "RA2", "CAPIO ASHTEAD HOSPITAL"], ["2SB", "RAX", "ASHTEAD HOSPITAL"], ["2SB", "RTK", "ASHTEAD HOSPITAL"], ["2SB", "RVR", "ASHTEAD HOSPITAL"], ["2SB", "RXH", "ASHTEAD HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "KT21"}
