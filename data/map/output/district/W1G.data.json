The target source for the new enzymes is a range of self-replicating mobile genetic elements (phages, plasmids and transposons) from thermophilic bacteria.  Increased understanding of self-replication in many mobile genetic elements, such as phi29, has now made the commercial development of new self-priming & strand-displacing polymerases and other enzymes, much more plausible. A number of candidate enzymes, such as a new transposon-coded Thermus DNA polymerase are at hand for this project in the thermophilic bacteria & phage genome bank at Matis.\n\nNucleic acids based technologies now underpin a large and fast-growing industry, including research, diagnostics and pharmaceutical production. Thermophilic enzymes have played a key role in this development, as polymerases (DNA and RNA), ligases, nucleases, reverse transcriptases, polynucleotide kinases, lysozymes and more, are of great importance in the research industry today.  The partner SME\u00b4s are all active players in this area from bioprospecting (Prokazyme), laboratory distribution (A&A Biotechnologies), LNA manufacture & diagnostics (Exiqon) to DNA vaccine production (Touchlight Genetics).\n\nTogether with the highly competent RTD partners the consortium is well positioned to implement the project according to its goals.

Thermostable enzymes found in thermophilic bacteria are produced recombinantly and used both in industry and biotechnology. For example, the thermostable enzyme Taq-polymerase is used in polymerase chain reaction, a very sensitive and widespread tool for genetic analysis.\n\nThe search for new thermostable enzymes continues. The project 'Exgenome Molecular Enzymes' (EXGENOMES) intended to develop new and improved enzymes for use in large-scale DNA synthesis. The target source for the new enzymes were self-replicating mobile genetic elements (phages, plasmids and transposons) from thermophilic bacteria.\n\nIn addition to using existing genetic databases for thermophilic bacteria and phages, novel genetic material was obtained from hot springs in Iceland and sequenced. The candidate genes were selected, cloned and expressed. Produced enzymes were purified, characterised and tested.\n\nA total of 39 new enzymes were selected for cloning and expression, out of which 23 enzymes were produced and purified for activity evaluation. Eight types of thermostable enzymes were represented, such as DNA polymerases, protelomerases, lysozymes, helicase, RNAse H, Rec A, primase and single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB). After activity evaluation, 14 enzymes were further purified and characterised, and finally 6 enzymes were developed into commercial products. These are: LysT lysozyme from Thermus phage Pro2631; Lys2119 lysozyme from Thermus phage Ph2119; RecA recombinase from Thermus phage T72; RadA recombinase from Pyrococcus woesei; Pol72 DNA polymerase from Thermus islandicus; and SSB M2 from metagenome.\n\nIn addition, two new protelomerases, TelA and TelK, were cloned, expressed, purified and used for experiments in making new DNA vaccine constructs. New enzymes were described in six scientific publications, and two patents were filed.\n\nDevelopment of new thermostable enzymes for commercial applications promises benefits for the smaller enterprises involved in the project.

Counterfeiting is a major global problem, with important societal and economic consequences, including the expansion of organised crime, loss of jobs and tax revenues, as well as serious health and safety risks, for which the pharmaceutical sector is particularly vulnerable. Thanks to a successful project supported by the European Commission \u201cNaginels\u201d (COOP 512931), an innovative process allowing to engrave inside of the transparent materials without any damages for the material has been developed. Direct engraving of the products with this technology linked with diffractive designs, coding and vision systems provides a full Track and Trace solution. The current process speed is well suited to luxury applications, but does not yet meet the requirement of the pharmaceutical industry. No suitable on-line high speed reader is available today for the invisible engraved codes. Unfortunately, it is not possible to improve the current technologies used by Naginels. Main technology breakthroughs have to be made. No other technology than Naginels is suitable for such anticounterfeiting applications for pharmaceutical industries. Developing and validating a new technology and system as defined in SFERA project will led to a direct answer for an urgent request of this industry, as shown by all the letters of interest received from the main players in this field. In addition, the new process speeds will open new glass applications, as innovative decoration.

Advanced technological solutions are needed to identify counterfeit products and keep consumers informed. Counterfeiting is also a major global problem with important societal and economic consequences. It encourages organised crime, loss of jobs, evasion of tax revenues, and poses serious health and safety risks.\n\nAn EU-funded project called 'Sub-surface fast internal engraving and reading system for anticounterfeiting applications' (SFERA) is taking up the challenge with marked success. SFERA has successfully developed a new laser-making system that addresses all issues related to the marking of containers. The system addresses product flow through production processes, effective traceability, and application of anti-counterfeit measures. It also involves marking containers without causing cracks or contamination and applying readable marks for proper and rapid redirection of containers in production. It can effectively identify products throughout the supply chain and authenticate products to reduce the risk of counterfeit products entering the market.\n\nThe engraving system developed during the SFERA project has built on cutting-edge technology to provide marking speeds suitable for the pharmaceutical industry and applications requiring large-area processing. SFERA built on an earlier EU-funded project called 'Non aggressive internal engraving laser system' (Naginels). As a result, SFERA managed to develop a new high-average power ultrafast laser and a high-speed portable reading system. It also developed a high-speed beam delivery system and handling system, plus a specific process control and encryption model.\n\nThese components have been integrated in an industrial workstation, compatible with the requirements of the pharmaceutical industry among others. Many European countries from Belgium, France, Italy and the UK, in conjunction with industrial experts, have contributed to the project.\n\nAnother fringe benefit of packaging in cosmetics and any packaging that requires decor embellishment was the patented 'diffractive effect'. This combines anti-counterfeiting, traceability and a surprising rainbow pattern in the markings. The project also developed an option of marking readable codes in reflection, easing the integration of the process on production lines and expanding market opportunities.\n\nThe SFERA technology is much better than existing anticounterfeiting techniques for packaging such as inkjet technology, RFID tags and classic laser techniques. It has been recognised as 'best practice for anti-counterfeiting issues' and holds outstanding promise for many industries.
