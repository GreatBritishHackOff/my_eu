As areas become stressed due to water exploitation or environmental pressures, the amount of water resources available for use have been decreasing (World Meteorological Organisation, 1999) and Europe has not been able to avoid these pressures. It is crucial to protect and improve water consumption to provide a sustainable practice for economic development and to maintain human settlements. LOWTEV will bring considerable water savings to the food industry which is comprised of over 230,000 SME organisations. With an excellent consortium with experts in the fields of food science and sanitisation we will develop a low water pressure ultrasound device integrated with an automated rapid hygiene monitoring system. By providing an alternative system for cleaning in place technology on bulk handling equipment for food processors, a factory site would benefit from at least a 10% savings in overall water use. This equates to an estimated \u20ac30,000 worth of savings on water and energy bills per factory, providing a return on investment in under 1 year of installation. The food industry sector within Europe lag behind in terms of innovation and R &amp;D investment; this project will address the environmental issues to improve water resources and will also improve the competitiveness of the SME food processing and bulk handling communities. Through reducing the clean cycle times on conveyor equipment, this will realise more productivity within the food processing cycle by reducing the labour costs and times for cleaning.", 385129.0, 1257650.0, "LOWTEV", null, null, null, "http://lowtev.pera.com/", "http://www.guttridge.co.uk", null, "fp7_92643_999449104"], ["4TA", "Improved Service Life Prediction and Test Capability for Wood Coatings", "George Barnsdale & Sons Limited", "The paints, coatings and varnishes manufacturing sector in Europe is worth an estimated \u20ac20billion, supporting approximately 4130 SMEs and is responsible for employing 59,600 people within these SMEs. In particular, the wood coatings sector is facing a number of threats. The sector is coming under increasing pressure from low cost imports from Asia that have low solids content and subsequently poor durability. There is a need in Europe to maximise the use of timber as a sustainable resource within the built environment. For coated components including windows, doors and cladding this requires maximising service life and minimising maintenance costs. Wood coatings have themselves undergone considerable change in response to environmental and other legislation and require substantial testing to establish or predict service life across different wood species and climatic zones. The pace of development and potential long life of modern coatings means that real life durability data will not be available when new products are brought to the market place and this creates a risk which affects SME joinery manufacturers and applicators. Ultimately it will also affect the downstream customer and consumers who in the absence of credible guarantees may use less sustainable substrates for components, such as uPVC or Aluminium. A response to this problem has been the emergence of national and institution certification schemes. However these can effectively amount to barriers to trade between countries and do not rigorously address the issue of service life prediction. The SERVOWOOD project will address this issue by developing a service life prediction methodology which can be incorporated into the portfolio of European Standards for exterior wood coatings. To this end the project brings together experts on wood coatings from the relevant European Standards Committee with representatives from trade associations and others in the supply chain.", 203295.0, 2881570.0, "SERVOWOOD", null, null, null, null, "http://www.georgebarnsdale.co.uk", null, "fp7_111562_951950435"], ["3UU", "Development of an efficient technique for the reduction of waste in sheeting dough processing in the baking industry", "Guttridge Ltd", "Current dough-sheeting process produces up to 30% of waste (The mass of waste is of 20% order of the end-product produced).

Such high cost has burdened the industry greatly, and SMEs are particularly vulnerable to further increase of landfill tax.
