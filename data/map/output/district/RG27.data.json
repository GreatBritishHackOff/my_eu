We intend to develop, validate and start manufacturing of a complete new and innovative concept of a versatile multi-analyte device for the diagnosis of congenital syphilis and HIV co-infections. Equipped with a simple portable reader for transmission and central information storage epidemiological information may be collected and analysed to guide active surveillance and prevention programs. The market for point-of-care test is rapidly growing and the development of this device will allow the participating SMEs to increase their research capacity and to strengthen and expand their market position. Potential this multi-analyte assay will also find other applications such as in the diagnosis of infectious diseases that are in the same differential diagnosis, testing of drugs of abuse and combinations of tumor markers.", 257821.0, 2193345.0, "PREVENTIT", null, null, null, "http://preventit.drupalgardens.com/", "http://www.fleetbioprocessing.co.uk", null, "fp7_104049_967546483"], ["8NY", "Acoustic Technology for observing the interior of the Arctic Ocean", "Aquatec Telemetry Limited", "ACOBAR will develop an observing system for the interior of the Arctic Ocean based on underwater acoustic methods including tomography, data transmission and communication to/from underwater platforms, and navigation of gliders.

Data collection and  transmission from the water column, the seafloor and the subseafloor will be possible in ice-covered seas based on research conducted in ACOBAR. The research will contribute to filling gaps in the global ocean observing system and thereby support the development of GEOSS. ACOBAR will implement field experiments with acoustic sources and receivers as well as gliders in the Fram Strait. Acoustic travel time data will be used to obtain integrated 3-D fields of temperature, transports and heat fluxes. Long-range acoustic navigation commands will be tested to operate gliders. Data transmission from fixed moorings via acoustic modems to the surface for downloading from ships or for satellite transmission will be implemented. The existing array of acoustic sources from ice-tethered platforms in the Arctic Ocean will be tested for tomographic measurements of water mass properties. Data from tomography arrays and other underwater platforms will be disseminated to users with near real-time capability, including assimilation in ocean models. ACOBAR will extend and improve methods for underwater data collection that was first tested in DAMOCLES IP. The acoustic technologies in ACOBAR aim to be used for transmission of multidisciplinary data from underwater observatories developed in ESONET NoE.

While efforts have proved quite fruitful in technological development regarding monitoring of open oceans, ice covered areas in polar regions have been severely under-sampled due to technical limitations.\n\nThe lack of data makes development of predictive models difficult if not impossible. Thus, understanding of ocean and ice interactions and detection of climate change signals from polar regions has been limited.\n\nEU funding of the 'Acoustic technology for observing the interior of the Arctic Ocean' (http://acobar.nersc.no (ACOBAR)) project helped improve understanding. Scientists developed and tested new technologies to observe systems in the polar oceans.\n\nProject partners deployed gliders and floats under the ice as well as advanced ice-tethered platforms (AITPs). Technologies used for data collection and analysis included acoustic techniques and communication technology for use between underwater and surface platforms.\n\nResults included the ability to determine the internal Arctic Ocean temperature with an accuracy of 0.01 degrees Celsius over a range of 200\u00a0km via acoustic thermometry and tomography. Gliders complemented the excellent temporal resolution of technology with greater spatial resolution between the surface and a depth of 1\u00a0km.\n\nA cluster of AITPs provided regional acoustic navigation for gliders and floats under the ice. A high-resolution ice and ocean model was then applied using data collected from the observation platforms together with satellite data.\n\nThe consortium also developed and demonstrated more cost-effective systems for use in the Arctic, which enabled continuous monitoring of physical, biological and biogeochemical systems. This will benefit areas such as ocean and climate monitoring, marine transportation and safety, oil and gas exploration, resource management and protection of the marine ecosystem.\n\nCompanies representing offshore industry, underwater technology and the manufacture of observation systems were involved in ACOBAR. The experience gained will strengthen the competitiveness of European industry (especially small and medium-sized enterprises) within the marine observing sector. Experience from Arctic field trials will give a competitive advantage to companies aiming to be at the forefront of Arctic underwater technology.\n\nThe large-scale observations conducted by ACOBAR will increase understanding of ocean processes, biology, biogeochemistry, climate change and marine health, and improve model validation.

The selected application areas are organic and inorganic light emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells and touchscreens.  The physical properties of interest are the transparency, electrical conductivity, work function, texture, and chemical and thermal stability.\nTo reach its overall goal, INREP brings together industrial and academic experts in TCOs, the technology and processes for their deposition and their applications in a concerted research programme that will result in the creation of TCOs and deposition technologies with the optimum opto-electrical properties suitable for the economic and safe manufacture of the specified photonic or opto-electronic components.\nThe approach will include life cycle assessments of the environmental impact of the developed TCO materials and of their formation technologies over the entire period from application in manufacturing, throughcomponent operation into waste management.", 471537.0, 4998134.0, "INREP", null, null, null, null, "http://www.plasmaquest.co.uk", null, "h2020_193859_998776312"], ["8AS", "Autologous Stem Cell Seeded Tissue Engineered Trachea", "Tmc Pharma Services Limited", "CLINICAL PROBLEM AND UNMET NEED\nThere are 11,827 patients with severe structural airway disease in Europe.

The barrier to children\u2019s learning is mainly the teachers\u2019 language competency. This means that they are less confident at delivering the subject resulting in slower progress made by the children. We need to develop teachers CDP to feel more confident in teaching the language.
