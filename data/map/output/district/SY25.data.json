Therefore curricula and school development concerning ESD need to be tackled and an integration of ESD on curricula and school programme level need to take place. \r\n\r\nEducational challenge\r\n\u2022 Issues/topics of sustainable development should be prepared and organized in such a methodical way , that students can make a connection between their (daily life) habits, their professional training and global challenges.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Many topics are presented solely cognitive, so that it is difficult for students to develop their own mind-set/attitude towards a certain subject/topic and to verify/reassessing their values and knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe main aims and objectives of the projects:\r\nAs part of the project, teachers shall be trained to facilitate key competences to students (systems-thinking skills, (sustainability) entrepreneurship skills, values and needs biography (see attachment).\r\nThe key competences can be implemented within all teaching subjects and also interdisciplinary. \r\nA dualistic approach:\r\n\u2022 a) training of teachers for the methodical implementation of already developed modules of/for ESD; \r\n  b) teacher test the modules in the school and reassess on students learning achievements;\r\n\u2022 the schools integrate the modules into the school's curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe modules, that will be transferred, meet the requirements of a Europe-wide vocational training.
