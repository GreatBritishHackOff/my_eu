Consisting of a centre for co-ordination, calibration and data in conjunction with networks of atmospheric and ecosystem observations, ICOS is designed to create the scientific backbone for a better understanding and quantification of greenhouse gas sources and sinks and their feedback with climate change.  The overarching objectives of ICOS are: To provide the long-term observations required to improve understanding of the present state and future behavior of the global carbon cycle and greenhouse gas emissions, and the factors that control the changing atmospheric composition in greenhouse gases.  To monitor and assess the effectiveness of carbon sequestration and/or greenhouse gases emission reduction activities on global atmospheric composition levels, including attribution of sources and sinks by region and sector at atmospheric and ecosystem level. These objectives will be achieved by:  Establishing a central facility, the ICOS-centre, which is responsible for co-ordination, calibration and data handling.  Maintaining a co-ordinated, integrated, long-term high-quality network of atmospheric and ecosystem observations.   Improving access to existing and future atmospheric and ecosystem data for research, and forpolitical decisions. Improving access to state-of-the-art facilities for ecosystem measurements for the European research community. Providing European terrestrial ground-truth data for the validation of emerging remotely sensed datasets on atmospheric composition and land cover as provided e.g. by GMES.   Contributing the European share to a global greenhouse gas observation network under IGCO and UNFCCC.

The acquisition, modification, maintenance and operation costs will be precisely quoted. Procedures will be defined for the selection of the aircraft and data management operators. A network of academic centres of excellence and SMEs will be constituted for the development and airborne certification of innovative instruments for the community aircraft.
