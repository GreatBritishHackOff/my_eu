The objectives of IDEA are to understand how the presence of worm infections affect immune responses specific to HIV, TB and malaria. The effects of parasitic worms on the clinical progression of these diseases are also under study.\n\nThe IDEA Central Database was established  which unifies demographic, clinical and parasitological data and allows for centralised analysis. Meta-analysis of data obtained from HIV-TB- and malaria patients' cohorts from different sites is constantly underway.\n\nInnate, or immediate immune response elicited by worm infections has been characterised. The scientists have determined whether the worm-induced innate immune response modulates the innate and adaptive immune response to HIV, TB and malaria antigens. Preliminary results were obtained regarding immunological interplay between helminth infections and HIV- and TB-specific T cell responses.\n\nThe effects of worm infections and anti-worm treatment on incidence, clinical presentation and immune responses against worms, as well as HIV, TB and malaria have been analysed. To determine the effect of worm-infections on vaccine-induced immune responses, the researchers have started vaccine trials for HIV, TB and malaria.\n\nThe IDEA research programme has made a substantial contribution to sustained and integrated research in sub-Saharan Africa.

CRDTs allow unsynchronised concurrent updates, yet ensure data consistency. This revolutionary approach maximises responsiveness and availability; it enables locating data near its users, in decentralised clouds.<br/>Global-scale applications, such as virtual wallets, advertising platforms, social networks, online games, or collaboration networks, require consistency across distributed data items. As networked users, objects, devices, and sensors proliferate, the consistency issue is increasingly acute for the software industry. Current alternatives are both unsatisfactory: either to rely on synchronisation to ensure strong consistency, or to forfeit synchronisation and consistency altogether with ad-hoc eventual consistency. The former approach does not scale beyond a single data centre and is expensive. The latter is extremely difficult to understand, and remains error-prone, even for highly-skilled programmers.<br/>SyncFree avoids both global synchronisation and the complexities of ad-hoc eventual consistency by leveraging the formal properties of CRDTs. CRDTs are designed so that unsynchronised concurrent updates do not conflict and have well-defined semantics. By combining CRDT objects from a standard library of proven datatypes (counters, sets, graphs, sequences, etc.), large-scale distributed programming is simpler and less error-prone.

They built a laboratory prototype solvolysis reactor, identified main process parameters of interest, and set to work to identify the range of parameters leading to the best recovery of desired products.\n\nPreliminary results enabled identification of recovered components as well as testing of their properties to determine whether or not interesting materials were present and if they could be reused. During the second phase of the project, a large-scale prototype reactor was built. Solvolysis trials were initiated using parameters defined in preliminary tests and modified according to need with the new reactor. Scientists successfully recovered mineral fibres to be reused as reinforcement in new composites and small molecules from the organic phase (polymer matrix) to be used by the chemical industry. A life-cycle assessment (LCA) highlighted areas for optimisation to achieve economically feasible industrial upscaling.\n\nEurecomp demonstrated the technical feasibility of using state-of-the-art solvolysis to obtain useful fibres and chemicals from thermoset composite waste.

The actual internship: The students will do a 3-week internship during the periods March-April of 2015 and 2016. Accompanied by 3 teachers, they depart together on the Eurostar. They stay in serviced apartments. These are apartments with one or two bedrooms and their own kitchen, which improves their ability to be self-sufficient. They are expected at their trainee posts 5 days a week. They have to get there by Tube. The teachers are there to help them with their problems, but also to evaluate them during their internship. Each students is evaluated by the trainee supervisor at the trainee post and by the supervising teachers.\r\n\r\n3. Discussion and evaluation\r\n\r\nAfter their London work experience, each student has to fill in their evaluation in the Ecas System.

Businesses, which are very often internationally orientated, would thus benefit from highly motivated employees who would be more self-assured in their treatment of foreign customers and suppliers. Participation in the project can also lead to enhanced willingness to work abroad inside the EU.\r\n\r\nThe project is aimed at students with university entry qualification and those entitled to study at specialist colleges and universities of applied sciences, whose level of proficiency in English is at least B2 (for Great Britain), and good students who graduated from middle school with a sound knowledge of English, which they can use to bridge communication gaps (for Estonia).

The objectives are learning Spanish - in closed group with a three-week intensive course by 20 hours/week and to get to know the Spanish tourism market better. Therefore sightseeing day trips to touristic meaningful places have to be developed and carrying out by the trainees. Three enterprises of the tourism industry have to be visited and interviewed. Another important aim is the training of intercultural competence. Here the intensive contact with the Spanish neighborhood, the teaching of the Sevillana dance, the joint cooking experience of Spanish cuisine shall contribute to this objective. During the workshop the vocational school subject of \"Projects & Exercises\" shall be tested in an extracurricular way in Spain. This is a general lesson involving many subjects. Particularly the subjects of \"Business Processes in Tourism\", but also communication in a foreign language and IT are involved. All results of the above described activities have to be written down and presented to an audience at the end of the stay.

It is believed that by 2020 every third visitor will have attended these regions. \r\nOne of the vital criteria in recreational services to ensure quality are professional labour resources. This is the main factor to provide recreational and other services. Business representatives responsible for organizing recreational services often lack management skills so there is much to be improved in training future professionals in Lithuania. Thus, there is a must to create opportunities for staff to refine and refresh their skills. \r\nProfessional staff able to greet, accommodate, provide catering, entertainment and cultural programme are needed to satisfy the needs of tourists coming to Lithuania. Professionals able to provide the best services for people in Lithuania going abroad are also a need. Professional attitude results in satisfied customers and profit. Theoretical knowledge in tourism marketing and practical application of the marketing conception determines successful activity in this field. Students acquire skills and practice at school and companies during their practical training. Competent teachers are important to provide high quality education which satisfies the needs of labour market. Teachers need to refine their technological competencies not only in Lithuania but in foreign companies as well. \r\nAnother important factor is development of sectoral practical training centres. \r\nThe project is based on European dimension plan and strategic plan for the period of 2014-2015. It is planned to encourage vocational teachers to improve their technological competencies, creativity, innovative ideas and to ensure quality in practical training when opening a sectoral practical training centre in 2014, September 1. Business practice firm operating as a travel agency will be created so teachers will need sufficient knowledge and skills about providing travel and accommodation services and organizing active and passive recreation. \r\nThe participants are 32 vocational teachers teaching recreational subjects and school authorities who are responsible for educational process. High requirements and challenges arouse when teachers try to pursue a higher quality of training. A teacher is involved in organization of practical training and in teaching-learning process. He/she is a competent and motivating advisor as well as the main source of ICT skills.  \r\nThe aim of the project is to satisfy the needs of participants to improve their qualification, the quality of educational process and make vocational schools more attractive. \r\n32 specialists from Klaip\u0117da Tourism School, \u0160ilut\u0117s Tourism and Business School, Panev\u0117\u017eio Trade and Business School and National Tourism Business Association, will be sent to foreign schools and companies to get introduced with preparation of staff working in recreation. \r\nThe following results are expected.

Having started with 40 participating students we are actually sending 60 students to London.\r\n\r\nThe title of the project \u2018Banking centre London among the shades of the financial crisis\u2019 clearly describes our aim: future bank employees should act faithfully and reliably on international financial places. During their stay in London the students should discover banking centre London with its severe problems. They should learn about British economy, banking centre London und British politics.  Visiting the docklands, the Bank of England and the stock exchange for example our students will make up their mind about London.\r\n\r\nTarget group of our project are \u2018Investmentfondskaufleute\u2019 and \u2018Bankkaufleute\u2019 who started their traineeship one year ago.

Their employers are mainly banks and investments funds companies in Frankfurt.\r\n\r\nIn London students mainly spend their time in college and getting to know the city as a financial centre. The college works out a training scheme tailored to needs of our students and is responsible for conducting the subjects. The lessons are held by native speakers.

Furthermore they have to live and work with students of other institutions in an unknown surrounding. This requires a high level of social responsibility.

This course aims to enable interested students to complete a vocational, linguistic and cultural advanced training beyond the scope of their daily work and school life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAims of the project:\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the course is aimed at improving the participants\u2019 language skills in specific vocational and general topics. On the other hand, by providing them with an insight into the British economic capital, the apprentices will have a chance to widen their perspectives beyond their own/national experience and thus be more able to contribute to the development of the European community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber/Profiles of the participants: \r\n\r\nEvery year, 22 young people, who are completing their first apprenticeship in different commercial professions, participate in this course. The students are aged between 17 and 20 years (depending on their educational background). As the participants are from different commercial courses, many of the group members first get to know each other during the four preparatory meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the activities: \r\n\r\nIn a preparatory phase lasting approx. 6 months, the supervising teachers prepare the apprentices intensively for the training course during four preparatory meetings, in order to ensure productive work at the College. During the three-week stay in London, different lecturers from the College - together with the participants - will work on subjects in English, such as: presentation skills, business correspondence, the modern British economy, business ethics, corporate social responsibility, career development opportunities etc. During a three-hour exam in their third project week, the students will be tested on the knowledge aquired about the topics they have dealt with. In addition, at the end of the training course, the participants have to make a presentation in English about a previously chosen topic, which will be marked together with the summary that has to be handed in. Apart from school activities, the lecturers make various topic-related field trips together with the apprentices. Furthermore, two companies will be visited in order to gain an insight into the work environment of the financial centre of London. To round things off, guided city tours and visits to theatres and museums are offered as well. Despite the wide range of the course content, it is also important for us that the young people still have the possibility to explore the cosmopolitan city of London on their own and come to terms with a multicultural population. For this reason, the accommodation in host families \u2013 in a foreign-language environment \u2013 has proved itself to be very valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods: \r\n\r\nIt is agreed with the College that the three-week training course is instructed and accompanied by lecturers and supervising teachers. However, the participants have to complete their tasks independently and on their own responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLasting advantages which can be expected by participating in this project:\r\n\r\n1) Informing others in their company, school and private surroundings of the many impressions they have gained: these young people come back to their familiar environment with new and diverse experiences from abroad. In doing so, they pass on their impressions to their families, friends and acquaintances which leads to a widening of general interest. The companies feel encouraged in their active support when they recognize that their apprentices have improved noticeably in all areas. Thus, very often, new enquiries from the training companies regarding future projects arise only shortly afterwards. In school, the students present their project work to their classmates in English and thereby awaken their curiosity and earn additional respect because of their good performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Expansion of professional/personal perspectives: \r\n\r\nExperience shows that the young students returning from the three-week programme in London are more self-confident, balanced and motivated. In many cases, their attitudes towards other cultures have changed and their wish to have further experiences abroad has grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3) Increased professional/personal opportunities: \r\n\r\nDealing intensively with cultural, linguistic and vocational matters in a foreign environment, the students who complete this course will gain new opportunities in their professional as well as in their private lives. Their improved foreign language skills, which can be presented to any (future) employer with the Certificate and the Europass Mobility, provide an undeniable advantage compared to other applicants.

This model is carried out in cooperation with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Passau and the regional training companies.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the internationalisation strategy of the Public Vocational School 2, a four-member EU-Team consisting of teachers, who among other things organise the international project, was established in 2010.\r\n\r\nThe target group for this formal training and education are trainees with secondary school qualifications as well as high school graduates. By now, 30-40 participants take part in this foreign measure, each year.\r\n\r\nWe organise the stay in England as a combination of 2 weeks occupational project work at the European College of Business and Management in London, and 2 weeks work placement in small and medium-sized companies, organised by Tellus Group Ltd in Plymouth (South England). In a precisely designed training programme at the ECBM the aim is to especially promote the professional and linguistic skills of the trainees. During their work placement, the trainees work in international teams and correspond with foreign business partners, which in return, should encourage their intercultural occupational competence. Accommodating the trainees with guest families leads to improvement of their linguistic skills and a better understanding of the English way of life.\r\n\r\nDue to a genuine encounter with a different culture, the entire stay leads to an awareness-raising and cultural openness of the participants. The relativity of values, perceptions as well as mentality and manners are sharpened. They have the ability to act appropriately in both professional as well as private intercultural situations.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each stay abroad, we have found that our trainees have become independent and self-confident and have reduced their fear of the new/unknown. The skills acquired through the project and certificates (e.g. Europass Mobility) improve the employment opportunities especially in international companies. Since 2008, in the course of this project, the offered training places for our education and training model have increased from 16 to 34 places. The success of this project was certainly one of the reasons why another vocational school in Lower Bavaria, the vocational school in Landshut, has decided to adopt this double qualification.", "http://www.eurocollege.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000449_1"], ["3HU", "Teacher Development for Professional Purposes in Vocational Education and Training", "European College of Business and Management", 106525.0, "On this project teachers from commercial schools of Bayern, Nordrhein Westfahlen and Hessen have the possibility to attend a professional development for business orientated English and Economics in London.

They will have already obtained knowledge concerning such matters of commercial correspondence as enquiry, offer, order, delay in payment and notice of defects. Further, they will have learned how to handle different types of forms in the field of foreign trade and will have acquired detailed knowledge in the subjects of business administration, national economy and infonomics. In the latter they will have learned how to use computer programmes like Excel, Word and Powerpoint and will be well trained in word processing.\r\nDue to all these skills acquired, they are qualified for working in international importing and exporting enterprises, shipping companies, international industrial concerns and organisations as well as in hotels and/or language schools.\r\nAt a time when their state of knowledge enables the trainees to deal with responsible tasks in a company or an institution, the internships offer the opportunity to link their theoretical knowledge with practical training.

This implies English language proficiency on the job. Especially industrial companies, logistics firms and companies in the whole sale trade need employees with these skills. They need that type of staff functioning effectively in a cross-cultural environment. Our vocational school (bsnu) cannot transfer those skills completely as the curriculum provides only 45 minutes per week to train our students in English language and cross-cultural skills. According to academic studies a native speaker of English can teach students, who learn English as a foreign language, more efficiently than an indigenous teacher. This course aims at improving our students\u2019 professional competency as well as British culture and doing business in the United Kingdom.\r\nThe course is designed for 24 participants who are trained within the \u201cdual system\u201d of vocational training in Germany. We will only take apprentices who attend our school and work in companies which provide business orientated training in professions like industrial clerks, logistics clerks or wholesale clerks. Sometimes we have applicants from the retail trade or students who are trained in managing warehouses. Students at our school have an intermediate level of education or A-levels. Applying for our Erasmus+ project does not require A-levels. We recommend applying for participating in an Erasmus+ project of our school in the first or second year of their training because going to London in their final year may distract some students from preparing well for their exams carried out by the chamber of commerce and industry. A group of bsnu teachers and Sarah Iles from ECBM design a concept and the procedures of the new Erasmus+ project. We inform our students by handing out flyers and putting information about the project on the bsnu website. Our teachers inform their students about our planned project. We will send letters to companies which have taken apprentices to provide information about the project. When apprentices apply for participating in our project they must provide a written statement of their company showing they agree that their apprentice will be away in London for three weeks. After evaluating the application forms we will choose the participants. If a company indicates their apprentices require English and cross-cultural skills on the job in an extensive manner, those applicants will be put on a priority list. The advices and recommendations of the remaining companies and of bsnu teachers, who teach the applicants, will also be considered when choosing participants. In future we will not provide any English language courses for the participants. They can use online courses to improve their English proficiency. However, we will go on providing cross-cultural training and a specific training for the ECBM course in London. We will only send one group of students to London. According to our plans this will be in May/June 2015. Ms Yu Fengyan and Mr Albrecht Hofmann will accompany the group when travelling to London. They will stay with the group in London for three weeks and will join the group on their journey back to Germany. The accompanying persons will monitor the group and their learning achievements.  Ms Sarah Iles and the ECBM lecturers will be in charge of the teaching and motivation of the group while they are trained in London. After three weeks in London the participants can show in a presentation and in a written exam what they will have learned. After returning from London to Germany, the participants will have to write an executive summary in English (1000 words) about the topic which they presented as a PowerPoint presentation at ECBM.

It is our goal to continuously offer an increasing number of students in the departments of industry, banking and wholesale trade an opportunity to spend a part of their training abroad. Our partner, the ECBM London, offers a 3-week, intensive course at their college, at which our students may complete and earn the certificate of \u201cinternational businessperson\u201d. This certificate is awarded by the German-British Chamber of Industry and Commerce (AHK London), ensuring that the qualifications and skills gained while abroad will improve the student\u2019s chances in the job market and that the experiences abroad will have a lasting effect. \r\nWe are starting the first flow which, in comparison to previous years, has an expanded group of participants, as well as extending the stay from two to three weeks. The special group of students who are participating in the double certificate program (industrial clerk and secretary with foreign languages) will be complemented in the first flow by motivated students in the 11th grade, who are from the industrial department. \r\n\r\nA selection process should ensure that students with good grades and who are motivated and cosmopolitan will take part in the project. The selection of the students will be cunducted in cooperation with the companies involved with the help of a letter of motivation, the Europass Curriculum Vitae and the  Europass Language Passport. \r\nIn the following years, successive students and companies in the fields of banking and wholesale trading are to be approached in order to arouse the interest and readiness for completing a part of their internship abroad. These three commercial fields of interest offer a good curricular basis for interdisciplinary learning. \r\nOur English partner, the ECBM, is the training college for the German-British Chamber of Commerce. It was founded 22 years ago and is well established in the fields of basic and continuous training. The courses are tailored to our students. In Germany, the vocationally specific learning content is combined with English subject teaching and activity-oriented assignments and projects; traditional teaching forms are alternated with modern, activity-oriented forms. Additionally, factory tours are made to English subsidiaries of internationally operating companies, such as Siemens Crystal, BMW Oxford and FedEx. Excursions to the City of London enable the participants to gain a deeper insight into the British worlds of business and finance. \r\n Our prospective industrial clerks (with or without the additional qualification for foreign language secretary) train in international companies and should gain job-related experience abroad as soon as possible, in order to be effectively successful in the future labour market. Gaining insight into international business processes and using English as the language of business are elements that give these students a professional and personal advantage. \r\nAnother goal of the project is advancement of intercultural competencies, e.g.\r\n\u2022 overcoming timidity to all that is foreign\r\n\u2022 immersion into London\u2019s intercultural society\r\n\u2022 promoting tolerance and eliminating any possible prejudices", "http://www.eurocollege.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000533_1"], ["2BU", "Come together in Europe; technical and cultural exchange as part of vocational education III", "Language Link London ltd", 29520.0, "In our project are trainees of several programmes included.

Thanks to 19 years of European experience, we benefit from a wide network of companies in most of the European countries, facilitating the placement of the trainees. \r\n\r\nRegular contacts between the various partners, the beneficiaries, and companies will facilitate a continuous monitoring of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndividual and group evaluations will allow us to measure the gap between the initial project and its realization. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLiving and working in another country of the European Economic Area will allow job-seekers to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Better match the needs of companies, to strengthen their professional and linguistic skills in a different professional environment \r\n\r\n\u2022 Discover new techniques, new fields of experience, \r\n\r\n\u2022 Know new cultures and another way of company organisation  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Become integrated as soon as possible within the European labour market, \r\n\r\n\u2022 Develop new employment prospects, \r\n\r\n\u2022 Be more autonomous. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, this project allows young job-seekers to live a first work experience in Europe in a context where job offers target only experienced people. This type of programme is often the response to their integration preoccupations. A mobility experience is a real asset to build employment pathway in Europe. All sectors can be concerned. The potential beneficiaries will be informed through posters in the different employment areas (P\u00f4le emploi, local missions, youth areas,\u2026) during employment forums an through www.pole-emploi.fr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will specifically target job-seekers with level IV diploma that didn\u2019t already benefit from a training course in Europe and that know some occupational integration difficulties. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French Region Low Normandy participates financially in this programme and allows the participants to have the intern in vocational training status so they can obtain remuneration during these 9 weeks. \r\n\r\nIn their return, the candidates will have to write a report and will get a certificate of internship in complement to the EUROPASS. A final balance assessment will be realized by the contractor and send to all our partners and financiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intended impact of this project is to get an occupational integration of the targeted public. Indeed, this immersion in a company will be a determining factor in the professional evolution of the candidates. It will allow either integration in the host country, or additional assets for an occupational integration back in France.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this program also concerns the interest of the politics to participate to this kind of action, to build a partners' network specialized in candidates' reception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis year, countries aimed by this program are: Germany, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Malta and the United Kingdom.", "http://www.languagelink.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA102-000978_5"], ["3AH", "Mobilit\u00e9 et rayonnement de la classe euro logistique 2014", "CENTRE D'ECHANGES INTERNATIONAUX LIMITED", 13720.0, "This project is aimed at 12 pupils having registered in the three-year baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel logistics course. At this point these pupils have also attended a European course for two years.\r\n      \r\n       This project answers the specificity of the course for many reasons: \r\n                \r\n                  1 \u2013The activities linked to Logistics are bound to be European and even international.

They ask questions to people their age but also to older people and  to professionals. After spending five weeks in London, they no longer   fear being judged for their English skills and they are able to express themselves freely.  \r\n                          - Academic: After acquiring this self- confidence, they now feel like they can succeed. Academic success is no longer reserved to pupils from Lyc\u00e9e general but it is also attainable for pupils from vocational schools who  make an effort and who are willing to take risks. As a result, they are more motivated and  more willing to attend school, to work and ready to make stronger efforts.\r\n                            - Personal: This project helps our students to mature and to gain an entrepreneurial spirit and to achieve greater autonomy  which are highly valuable skills demanded by most companies. This program also helps our students to develop a greater sense of acceptance towards people of differing racial, ethnic, generational, sexual and religious backgrounds.\r\n                               - On the labour market: Our students will be employed more easily and they will be more willing to work abroad and to share their skills with other companies.\r\n                         In companies, they are expected to be able to:\r\n                                 - Receive and store goods\r\n                                 - Prepare and ship orders\r\n                                - Welcome drivers on the telephone or in person\r\n                                 - Understand written documents.\r\n     \r\n             They will be supervised by the school partners,the project partners (the families and the companies), and the members of the CEI.  Meetings, telephone calls, mails, social networks, videoconferences will be used to manage, communicate, cooperate, monitor and assess the mobility program. The students will be accompanied by the English teacher who will make sure the families and companies live up to the  personal and professional expectations (professional task in keeping with the school curriculum).

The school \"Open Day\", the French families feedback, the meetings with all the members of the school and the students of the mobility, the graduation ceremony, the meetings with the alumni who tell about their professional and personal experience, play a large part in the widening of our school.\r\n       Our regular contact with the CEI,  already very well-known and specialized in jobs and internships placements, and accommodation for individuals and groups ,  also helps us be more influential in the future.\r\n \r\n        2 - Our students in higher education\r\n\r\n        3 - Our students in the European and International labour market. \r\n\r\n         4 - A stronger sense of  citizenship  among our students", "http://www.cei-london.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA102-001314_2"], ["3AH", "De Bonneville \u00e0 Londres : l'engagement vers une ouverture europ\u00e9enne", "CENTRE D'ECHANGES INTERNATIONAUX LIMITED", 17007.0, "Guillaume Fichet secondary school offers  all courses including a vocational section.

The Fachakademie in Nuremberg has been founded to provide this sector with skilled employees. The state certified business managers that graduate at the FAW have excellent  communication skills regarding language and intercultural understanding, which they acquire by participating in the above mentioned project.

We have established the project for the apprentices of Investment Fund Administration and we have been extending it to the benefit of our apprentices in Banking. Having started with 40 participating students we are now sending 60 students to London.\r\n\r\nThe title of the project \u2018The financial centre of London affected by the \u20ac-crisis\u2019 clearly describes our aim: future bank employees should be able to act responsibly and reliably at international financial places. During their stay in London the students are supposed to discover the banking centre London with its severe problems as well as learn about British economy and politics.  Visiting the docklands, the Bank of England and the Stock Exchange, for example, our students will get a deeper insight into London.\r\n\r\nThe target group of our project are apprentices of Investment Fund Administration and apprentices in Banking who started their traineeship one year ago. They have already passed their intermediate examination and have received theoretical training in form of block teaching in our vocational school. Their employers are mainly banks and investment fund companies in Frankfurt.\r\n\r\nIn London students mainly spend their time in college and get to know the city as a financial centre. The college works out a training scheme tailored to needs of our students and is responsible for teaching the subjects. The lessons are held by native speakers. Excursions are also a part of the training programme. At the end of the stay the students have to pass several exams to receive three certificates:\r\n- Certificate of the ECBM \r\n- Certificate of the German-British Chamber of Industry and Commerce\r\n- Kaufmann/Kauffrau International (AHK)\r\n\r\nEarly planning is very important for us: in September 2015 the college, the flights and the hotel rooms have to be reserved. When booking the flight we also apply for a travel cancellation insurance which covers the students\u2019 own contribution of 650 euros. For many years now we have been guests at the Lancaster Hall Hotel in London and we have been working with the college and our travel agency. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s our aim that students improve their professional, social, intercultural and linguistic skills. The following vocational and social competences should be expanded: the participants should discover the banking centre London and they should follow the college lessons about economic, political and cultural topics held in English. Furthermore they have to live and work with students of other institutions in an unknown surrounding. This requires a high level of social responsibility. The participants will get to know a foreign culture, because London itself is a melting pot of cultures. Going to the college by tube or going to museums are also part of the students\u2019 intercultural experiences in a very open and tolerant society.

(e.g. international markets, worldwide suppliers, international co-operatoins, worldwide subsidiaries/branches) Therefore students must also be able to handle complex worksituatiuons in a forgein language, mainly English. In their company stundents are regularly  confrontetd with English speaking customers and correspondence in English. Therfore proficiency of the English language  becomes more and more a basic qualification for these young people.

The experiences we gained there concretised the planning of an own project which was implemented the year after. Both the economic and pedagogic skills of the teachers at the ECBM concerning the transmission of central aspects of the British economy, culture and politics have convinced us to continue this project for more than ten years now.\r\n\r\nThe decision of offering another project (project 2) has prompted us to choose Tellus Group as a further partner organisation for retail clerk respectively wholesale clerk trainees. We got familiar with this company during a further education course about \u201cLeonardo DaVinci\u201d. Tellus Group offer high-quality language courses and organise practical trainings which meet the job requirements of our retail clerk and wholesale clerk trainees.\r\n\r\nThe main aim of project 1 is to enable 24 students from the vocational school \"Staatliche Berufsschule II Memmingen\" to attend a three-weeks course at the European College of Business and Management in London. The students, who train to be a bank clerk, industrial clerk or office clerk, are all in their second year of vocational training. During the course the students are able to improve their language skills in English as well as their knowledge in business administration issues.\r\n\r\nAt the college the students attend lessons every working day between 9.30 am and 4.45 pm. The lessons deal with topics which are related to their vocational training in Germany. The lessons are held by specially trained and experienced teachers from the college. In addition to the daily lessons, the participants have to write out an assignment on a special economic or social-economic topic, which is chosen by them individually. This as well as the final presentation at the end of the course, enhances the language skills immensely.\r\n\r\nConcerning project 2, 12 wholesale and retail clerk trainees take part in a two-week internship in various commercial companies. They will get a close insight into the job-related practical experience and get the chance to interchange with their British colleagues. Additionally, the students attend language courses and other activities at the Tellus College where their foreign language skills will be enhanced individually.\r\n\r\nNext to the course, the students of both projects are obliged to plan and prepare several group excursions. The group leaders decide on relevant topics and talk them over with the students during the preparation meetings. The topics are then prepared in English by the student teams, so that they can be presented by them in London respectively Plymouth and the surrounding area during the group excursions. \r\n\r\nAnother major aim of the project is to enlarge the intercultural, social and individual skills of the students. They enter a new field with unknown cultural and social requirements, they learn to communicate and to cooperate with students and teachers.

The students\u2019 tasks also include research activities (field, internet and other) and a presentation which is part of the examination. This presentation has to be followed by a written executive summary.

The PDP-Programme was especially developed for students of vocational schools. It imparts language competence as well as comprehensive competence in the area of management. It is especially the aim of the project to increase the business knowledge, experience and language skills.\r\n\r\nIndustrial management assistants are deployed in companies of any kind and size. They are responsible for the planning, realisation and control of diverse areas of business responsibilities. It is the aim that an industrial management assistant can handle all business tasks. Due to the international movement of goods two qualifications are becoming more and more important - extended knowledge of foreign languages and intercultural competences.\r\n\r\nThe newly developed training for office management assistants puts special emphasis on the internationalisation of the trainees. Office management assistants organise and deal with office tasks i.e. they handle business management activities such as purchase order processing, purchasing, accounting, marketing and personnel management. The fields of activity are very diverse: office management assistants can work for industrial companies and trading companies as well as for public service or business associations.\r\n\r\nAs part of the internationalisation of the business world the requirements that are made on trainees are increasing. The requirements include foreign language competence, openness for other cultures, self-dependence as well as internationally recognized degrees and the readiness for international employment.\r\n\r\nThe training companies of the Berufsschule Schwabach have production facilities, suppliers and customers within Europe and outside Europe. That's why the companies set high value on the ability to communicate, foreign language competences and intercultural competences. Therefore the practical and intensive application of English and the improvement of the students' communication skills are expected to be advanced and deepened by this project. Another aspect is that the students gain insight into another culture, another way of living and another business world. The participants of the project experience another way of living by staying with a host family. This helps them to reduce potentially existing prejudices towards other cultures.\r\n\r\nIn a working environment that is growing together closer and closer it won't be enough in the future to possess only a national degree.

They will have already obtained knowledge concerning such matters of commercial correspondence as enquiry, offer, order, delay in payment and notice of defects. Further, they will have learned how to handle different types of forms in the field of foreign trade and will have acquired detailed knowledge in the subjects of business administration, national economy and infonomics. In the latter they will have learned how to use computer programmes like Excel, Word and Powerpoint and will be well trained in word processing.\r\nDue to all these skills acquired, they are qualified for working in international importing and exporting enterprises, shipping companies, international industrial concerns and organisations as well as in hotels and/or language schools.\r\nAt a time when their state of knowledge enables the trainees to deal with responsible tasks in a company or an institution, the internships offer the opportunity to link their theoretical knowledge with practical training.

This implies English language proficiency on the job. Especially industrial companies, logistics firms and companies in the whole sale trade need employees with these skills. Companies and employers need that type of personell functioning effectively in a cross-cultural environment. Our vocational school (bsnu) cannot transfer those skills completely as the curriculum only provides 45 minutes per week to train our students in English language and cross-cultural skills. According to academic studies a native speaker of English can teach students, who learn English as a foreign language, more efficiently than an indigenous teacher. This course aims at improving our students\u2019 professional competency as well as British culture and doing business in the United Kingdom. The course is designed for 24 participants who are trained within the \u201cdual system\u201d of vocational training in Germany. We will only take apprentices who attend our school and work in companies which provide business orientated training in professions like industrial clerks, logistics clerks or wholesale clerks. Sometimes we have applicants from the retail trade or students who are trained in managing warehouses. Students at our school have an intermediate level of education or A-levels. Applying for our Erasmus+ project does not require A-levels. We recommend applying for participating in an Erasmus+ project of our school in the first or second year of their training because going to London in their final year may distract some students from preparing well for their exams carried out by the chamber of commerce and industry. A group of bsnu teachers and Sarah Iles from ECBM design a concept and the procedures of the new Erasmus+ project. We inform our students by handing out flyers and putting information about the project on the bsnu website. Our teachers inform their students about our planned project. We will send letters to companies which have taken apprentices to provide information about the project. When apprentices apply for participating in our project they must provide a written statement of their company showing they agree that their apprentice will be away in London for three weeks. After evaluating the application forms we will choose the participants. If a company indicates their apprentices require English and cross-cultural skills on the job in an extensive manner, those applicants will be put on a priority list. The advices and recommendations of the remaining companies and of bsnu teachers, who teach the applicants, will also be considered when choosing participants. In future we will not provide any English language courses for the participants. They can use online courses to improve their English proficiency. However, we will go on providing cross-cultural training and a specific training for the ECBM course in London. We will only send one group of students to London. According to our plans this will be in May/June 2015. Ms Yu Fengyan and Mr Albrecht Hofmann will accompany the group when travelling to London. They will stay with the group in London for three weeks and will join the group on their journey back to Germany. The accompanying persons will monitor the group and their learning achievements.  Ms Sarah Iles and the ECBM lecturers will be in charge of the teaching and motivation of the group while they are trained in London. After three weeks in London the participants can show in a presentation and in a written exam what they will have learned. After returning from London to Germany, the participants will have to write an executive summary in English (1000 words) about the topic which they presented as a PowerPoint presentation at ECBM.

The first week acquaints the participants with London as an economic hub. One key element involves working on case studies in English, presenting results and evaluating the process. This provides additional preparation for investigative company visits in the second week. Working in small groups, the trainees have previously arranged to research a local company in order to conduct interviews and report on a pre-arranged topic relevant to their chosen company. The third week further hones presentation skills as the groups finalize a written report and give a PowerPoint presentation to London teaching staff. The final week culminates in an examination of language skills pertaining to the London imput.

It is an important part of the B4's internationalisation strategy. This strategy is intended to prepare B4's students for changing requirements of the labour market which are due to the increasing internationalisation of the German economy. Since many local companies are very export-oriented (Export rate in the region is 45 %, according to the Chamber of Commerce), they need more and more employees who are familiar with international business practices in addition to business English skills. The willingness of employees to occupational mobility is also becoming increasingly important. The main objective of this programme is to improve the participants' career prospects by increasing their knowledge of international business practices, communication and foreign language skills. The course enables them to obtain the \"Kaufmann International Certificate\" certified by the Deutscher Industrie- und Handelskammertag (DIHK). The target group of this project are VET learners in companies.

The aim of the project is to improve the level of key competences and skills of  our staff, including all teachers, as we use our experts and our expert teams (and tandempartners) as multipliers for all. We believe that everybody is willing to improve his/her teaching methods, therfore we promote participation in courses abroad, in order to foster the intercultural dialogue, social inclusion and solidarity, in particular through increased learning mobility opportunities for teachers.

Participants form groups of two or three to work on a certain topic, which they have chosen before. During that time students work independently most of the time, the college offers assistance if necessary, e.g. providing literature, computer workstation and teachers\u2019 support. To fulfill the project\u2019s requirements, students need to carry out interviews in companies, for example. At the end they will get a mark for their project which consists of a Powerpoint presentation and a ten-page homework. The homework assignment is to be handed in after their visit. Furhermore, they write a three-hour exam in the last week.The seminar is activity-oriented which will primarily focus on key competences such as the ability to work in a team, independent learning as well as verbal and non-verbal communications skills. Students mainly acquire proficiency in the English language and in dealing with foreign cultures.

The aim of this is an increased intercultural and personal competence to help master new challenges in business as well as personal life. Businesses, which are very often internationally orientated, would thus benefit from highly motivated employees who would be more self-assured in their treatment of foreign customers and suppliers. Participation in the project can also lead to enhanced willingness to work abroad inside the EU.The project is aimed at students with university entry qualification and those entitled to study at specialist colleges and universities of applied sciences, whose level of proficiency in English is at least B2 (for Great Britain), and good students who graduated from middle school with a sound knowledge of English, which they can use to bridge communication gaps (for Estonia). The participants will be apprentices of various different professions in their second year of training. The focus will be on bank clerks, industrial clerks as well as clerks in administration, but the project will be open to all other professions, like office clerks and automotive clerks. At the time of departure, students in three-year courses will have passed about one half of their training, those in two-year courses (e.g. financial assistants) will have passed about two-thirds of their training.

In Estonia, the agenda includes participating in classes at the two business colleges, a one-week internship, a visit to the German Embassy as well as guided tours of Tallinn, Riga and Helsinki, which will be prepared by the participants themselves.To sum up, the project is meant to render the participating students highly independent in planning and organising their own learning situations and environment. It is a long-term goal to enhance mobility and to prepare the students for an unknown environment, as it is less and less likely for them to remain in the places where they are being trained. Intercultural competence is becoming increasingly important at school and in the workplace, with colleagues just as with customers. When dealing with them, it is of particular importance to show understanding and empathy, especially for those who come from foreign nations and cultures. Self-organisation of exchange processes is of central pedagogical importance in this project. The participants will have to let themselves in for each other, make decisions together and coordinate their decisions with those of others.

The contents of the trip are organised so as to complement and augment the for the most part theoretical education provided by the College.Aims of the Project:The study trips are founded on the three elements of the foreign language and culture, and the world of business, and are designed to achieve goals relevant to the students' education. The knowledge students have acquired of the foreign language in the classroom can be tried out and deepened in another European country. Students are given the opportunity to undertake operational tasks while gaining an insight into the business life of the foreign country and familiarising themselves with its work culture and lifestyle.Procedure and Implementation:We remain in continuous contact with our partner institutes, so that we can involve students, parents, teachers and the college as a whole during the course of the year leading up to a study trip. As soon as assurance of support has been granted, the project managers contact our partner institutes in order to co-ordinate the details. The project management team deals with the organisation of the trip and the formalities of insurance and legal contracts, also communicating with the parents of the participants on these matters. Host families are selected by our partner institutes. The students themselves finally draw up the supporting programme as part of their course in project management at the College.Aims and Benefits:Participants write reports in which they present their results and how they personally have benefited from the study trip. These reports are summarised and distributed in the form of a general report, which is made available to the local press as well as being displayed on exhibition stands (e.g. at education fairs) and in the library of the College. The results we aspire to achieve are to increase participants' abilities in the foreign language as well as their intercultural competence, and to improve their school marks and education. In addition, they gain practical experience, a more attractive profile for their CV, and contacts at companies in other European countries, all of which are beneficial when seeking future employment.

By disseminating the results, the significance of mobility both for the individual and for vocational education in general is made visible, and awareness of the need for internationalisation in vocational training increased.

The participants will get to know a foreign culture, because London itself is a melting pot of cultures. Going to the college by tube or going to museums are also part of the students\u2019 intercultural experiences in a very open and tolerant society.

This problematic situation leads directly to the most important goal of the project \u2013 improving the employability of apprentices, students in full-time vocational training as well as those who have just completed their vocational training course. We want to reach this goal by offering the target group customized high-quality learning settings abroad. To achieve this we will continue cooperating with the vocational schools, the apprentices\u2019 companies, the Chamber of Commerce as well as with the trade unions and professionals\u2019 organisations. To flank the achievement of these goals we aim to strengthen the competences of the professionals working in schools (particularly at the management level), so they can better aid the young learners to enter the European employment more successfully.An overriding objective of the project is to increase the integration of participants with a migrational background, who are young parents or who are disadvantaged learners into the work force.The following are the main activities we will offer the youths mentioned above:- internships abroad for the youths in their fields- project work abroad for the youths on topics related to participants' vocational fields A majority of the participating youths will be from the following fields: clerical occupations, media, hotel, gastronomy, carpenters/joiners.These main activities will supported by the following flanking activities offered to professionals and student teachers in vocational training centers in Berlin: - Advanced and further training abroad with the topic \u201cprofessionalizing the teacher\u2019s acting in the classroom on the European level aiming to better prepare students for the European job market\u201d.- Professional development training for school management staff regarding \u201cstudents with special needs\u201d.- Training for student teachers with the focus on \u201eLearning from the Best in Europe \u2013 enhancing methodical expertise!\u201d- Training for future school management staff: \u201cHow to successfully develop a vocational training school/institution\u201dOur GoEurope mobility network encompasses 30 different partner organizations in 10 EU countries plus Turkey. All of our partners are specialized in the professional execution of Erasmus+ (formerly Leonardo-da-Vinci)-funded learning stays for youths and professionals in the field of vocational training. The majority of our partners can tap into a network of a several hundred or even a several thousand potential internship companies. They are well connected with the vocational training centers and political institutions in their respective regions. As soon as the decisive parameters of a mobility flow have been defined with our local training institutions the project is actively promoted to the target group and participants are selected from the applicants. As soon as the participants for a particular flow have been secured the partner organization in the host country is commissioned with carrying out the preparations for the flow. The quality of each flow is ensured by a number of measures, e. g. mid-term reports, evaluation meetings, accompanying visits and/or a preparatory visit. The most desired outcome of the stay abroad is always to improve the participants' employability (roughly 10 % of our participants even receive a job offer abroad), improved social integration of participants who are young parents, have a migrational background or learning disabilities, improved proficiency in foreign languages as well as personality development. Furthermore, we intend to create excitement for the European Union in general amongst satisfied participants! All of them can be instrumental in internationalizing their educational institutions. Particularly by helping to create a functional network including the body responsible for the project and local partner organizations.Our network has been growing for ten years now and the long-term effects of our steady growth in terms of quality and numbers of participants are becoming ever more evident. By now 20 Berlin vocational training centers have already appointed an EU-Affairs Representative to manage their collaboration with us. Two vocational training centers now even offer vocational training courses with integrated mobility stays abroad.

During that time, they will be working at the European College of Business and Management (ECBM). The ECBM is the training college for the German-British Chamber of Commerce. It was founded in 1988 and is well established in the fields of basic and continuous training. They offer the \"Professional Development Programme\" (PDP), a 3-week, intensive course, which is tailored to our students. During the PDP, our students will complete and earn the certificate of \u201cinternational businessperson\u201d. This certificate is awarded by the German-British Chamber of Industry and Commerce (AHK London). This is supposed to ensure that the qualifications and skills gained abroad will improve the student\u2019s chances in the job market and that the experiences abroad will have a lasting effect. Selection process:The selection process for the project will be taking place in two different ways. Students from the economics department taking part in the additional qualification \"foreign language correspondence clerk\" offered by the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, will be part of the project as well as other applicants from the economics department. All participating students are obliged to hand in a letter of motivation as well as the Europass Curriculum Vitae as well as the Europass Language passport.The participating teachers in the project are being chosen on the basis of their willingness to take part in the project. In the long term, the staatliche Berufsschule Pfaffenhofen is planning to extend the circle of people as it is one of the main objectives of the school to introduce an internationalisation strategy.Main objectives of the project, concerning students and teachers:Enhancing professional skills and competences:One key objective of the project is a further qualification of the trainees of our economics department. Many of them are doing their traineeship in international companies. Therefore, they should gain job-related experience abroad as soon as possible. Gaining insight into international business processes and using English as the language of business are elements that give these students a professional and personal advantage. Therefore, we are helping our students to be successful on the European labour market. Our teachers, taking part in the project gain insights in planning and conducting European projects and exchange skills and methods with English-speaking colleagues.Developing personal skills and competences:Besides, spending time abroad is helping the students to overcome fears of foreign things and helps them to gain intercultural competences. Our students live in small villages in rural Upper Bavaria. Spending three weeks in multicultural London will make a huge impression on them. Besides, working and living abroad in host families will contribute to a positive personal development. That will also help to promote tolerance and to eliminate prejudices.Our teachers also profit from staying abroad and strengthen their insights into the European idea. Intercultural competences can only be communicated if one is convinced of the idea oneself.Objectives of the project, concerning the staatliche Berufsschule Pfaffenhofen and its partners:The staatliche Berufsschule Pfaffenhofen wants to establish an internationalisation strategy. We want to create a network of national and international partners, from which everyone (companies, students, teacher, and our foreign partners) can profit. Even though, the staatliche Berufsschule Pfaffenhofen is located in the prosperous region north of Munich, which is constantly profiting from a steady influx of people, demographic change has got an impact on all institutions in vocational training. As a consequence, we see internationalisation as a chance to improve our chances as well as those of our partners in the economy to get highly motivated, productive and cosmopolitan trainees.", "http://www.eurocollege.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002853_1"], ["3HU", "SINDBAD/TRANSDUAL/move-it", "European College of Business and Management", 374039.0, "sequa is a non-profit organization of the German private sector.

From 1991 to 2015 sequa has carried out more than 2,000 mobility measures for apprentices, journeymen and professionals in TVET sector. The commitment of sequa in the field of occupational mobility began in 1991 with the founding of the SESAM program for journeymen, which was initially restricted to the cooperation between German and French Chambers of Crafts. Going abroad allowed the participants to learn new techniques within their occupations in the host country and increased their language skills and intercultural competences. The funding opportunities of the EU Leonardo da Vinci programme, now Erasmus+, allowed the extension of the programmes and lead in 2008 to the establishment of the sequa mobility programmes SINDBAD and TRANSDUAL.

This course aims to enable interested students to complete a vocational, linguistic and cultural advanced training beyond the scope of their daily work and school life.Aims of the project:On the one hand, the course is aimed at improving the participants\u2019 language skills in specific vocational and general topics. On the other hand, by providing them with an insight into the British economic capital, the apprentices will have a chance to widen their perspectives beyond their own/national experience and thus be more able to contribute to the development of the European community.Number/Profiles of the participants: Every year, 22 young people, who are completing their first apprenticeship in different commercial professions, participate in this course. The students are aged between 17 and 22 years (depending on their educational background). As the participants are from different commercial courses, many of the group members first get to know each other during the four preparatory meetings.Description of the activities: In a preparatory phase lasting approx. 6 months, the supervising teachers prepare the apprentices intensively for the training course during four preparatory meetings, in order to ensure productive work at the College. During the three-week stay in London, different lecturers from the College - together with the participants - will work on subjects in English, such as: presentation skills, business correspondence, the modern British economy, business ethics, corporate social responsibility, career development opportunities etc. During a three-hour exam in their third project week, the students will be tested on the knowledge aquired about the topics they have dealt with. In addition, at the end of the training course, the participants have to make a presentation in English about a previously chosen topic, which will be marked together with the summary that has to be handed in. Apart from school activities, the lecturers make various topic-related field trips together with the apprentices. Furthermore, two companies will be visited in order to gain an insight into the work environment of the financial centre of London. To round things off, guided city tours and visits to theatres and museums are offered as well. Despite the wide range of the course content, it is also important for us that the young people still have the possibility to explore the cosmopolitan city of London on their own and come to terms with a multicultural population. For this reason, the accommodation in host families \u2013 in a foreign-language environment \u2013 has proved itself to be very valuable.Methods: It is agreed with the College that the three-week training course is instructed and accompanied by lecturers and supervising teachers. However, the participants have to complete their tasks independently and on their own responsibility.Lasting advantages which can be expected by participating in this project:1) Informing others in their company, school and private surroundings of the many impressions they have gained: these young people come back to their familiar environment with new and diverse experiences from abroad. In doing so, they pass on their impressions to their families, friends and acquaintances which leads to a widening of general interest. The companies feel encouraged in their active support when they recognize that their apprentices have improved noticeably in all areas. Thus, very often, new enquiries from the training companies regarding future projects arise only shortly afterwards. In school, the students present their project work to their classmates in English and thereby awaken their curiosity and earn additional respect because of their good performance.2) Expansion of professional/personal perspectives: Experience shows that the young students returning from the three-week programme in London are more self-confident, balanced and motivated. In many cases, their attitudes towards other cultures have changed and their wish to have further experiences abroad has grown.3) Increased professional/personal opportunities: Dealing intensively with cultural, linguistic and vocational matters in a foreign environment, the students who complete this course will gain new opportunities in their professional as well as in their private lives. Their improved foreign language skills, which can be presented to any (future) employer with the Certificate and the Europass Mobility, provide an undeniable advantage compared to other applicants. Many of the participants can imagine working or studying abroad in the foreseeable future.

During this evaluation, an opportunity for growth regarding its international orientation was observed.  The increasing importance of international work experience as part of a successful future work profile is widely recognised. Based on this realisation the German Parliament decided in 2013, that the goal is to enable at least 10% of all apprentices to gain international work experience in some form.  The predominantly small and medium sized company landscape in the region of Kempten/Allgaeu, allows for rather limited opportunities for students to gather international experience e.g. in foreign subsidiaries. As a result, the BS II Kempten decided on integrating the \u201cinternational orientation\u201d into its set of targets. Concrete goal is to support more students, in cooperation with their employers, to gather international work experience.After analysing the demand and defining the strategic goal, available resources to meet the targets were evaluated. As a key result, the main concern is the financial feasibility for the students. As a consequence, this application form was put together. With the financial support of the Erasmus+ programme for the apprentices, the vocational School Kempten II would be enabled to develop an international awareness within its organization by introducing a mobility project and therefore support the Bundestagsbeschluss from 2013.What exactly does that mean? The BS II Kempten is planning a student mobility activity with 22 students from the professions Bank, Industry, Logistics, Retail and Wholesale (potentially IT, Tax Adviser Assistants and Legal Assistants). Our partnering institution is the European College of Business and Management (ECBM) based in London. The ECBM is the educational academy of the German-British Chamber of industry and commerce. It already proofed to be extremely reliable and experienced, which supports our selection as a partnering institution. The 22 participants of the mobility programme will take part in an especially designed 3-week \u201cProfessional Development Programme (PDP)\u201d. Besides the in-depth examination of various topics in business, politics and society from a European and international perspective, the programme will touch on multiple functional and cross-functional topics. The housing of the students will be realized in guest families. Benefit of this is twofold; the students will dive deep into the British culture as well as significantly improve their language skills. With the participation in the PDP the apprentices have the possibility to receive the KIC (Kaufmann International Certificate). This prestigious international qualification will be achieved by an oral and a written exam, as well as a dissertation. Additional requirement for this certificate is the graduation of the commercial apprenticeship in Germany. Furthermore all students will obtain the \"Europass Mobility\" as a record of the acquired competences. In combination with the \"Europass CV\" (which will already be created by the students in the project application process) these documents constitute the foundation for future application possibilities all over Europe. A multilevel application procedure is conducted for the selection of the participants. A specific preparation phase, the mentoring of the students in London and the reflexion phase at the end of the mobility project are further important components. Rounded up is the mobility by the ceremonial award of the \"Europass Mobilit\u00e4t\", where not only the participants but also the school management and administration, the staff and the cooperative companies will be invited. The realisation of the project is accompanied by a project management concept that helps to ensure the success of the project. Especially appropriate evaluation tools should support the continuous improvement process of further Mobilities. The expected impact of the project is multidimensional. The apprentices will not only achieve a substantial increase in different competences, but also experience a leap in their personality development. Taking part in an Erasmus+ Programme improves particularly self-confidence and proactivity in young adults. The mobility is also expected to have an impact on family, friends, school staff and the cooperative companies. By being involved in a mobility project, even if it is just in a passive way, people will be more aware of the importance of the European idea and the peaceful international cooperation.

They will have already obtained knowledge concerning such matters of commercial correspondence as enquiry, offer, order, delay in payment and notice of defects. Further, they will have learned how to handle different types of forms in the field of foreign trade and will have acquired detailed knowledge in the subjects of business administration, national economy and infonomics. In the latter they will have learned how to use computer programmes like Excel, Word and Powerpoint and will be well trained in word processing.Due to all these skills acquired, they are qualified for working in international importing and exporting enterprises, shipping companies, international industrial concerns and organisations as well as in hotels and/or language schools.At a time when their state of knowledge enables the trainees to deal with responsible tasks in a company or an institution, the internships offer the opportunity to link their theoretical knowledge with practical training. What concerns us primarily is that for teaching purposes didactically reduced case studies become verified in a real environment in order to enhance the students\u2019 chances on the European labour market.As this is a full-time vocational school training, the trainees have got few opportunities to work in side jobs to earn their own living. Thus, doing an internship in a foreign country does not only mean financial losses during the time of their stay but also considerable problems in raising the funds for a period abroad. Only if our trainees will be sponsored by the ERASMUS+ programme, we are able to realise our project which is continually carried out and supervised by qualified teachers experienced in this area.Moreover, this programme constitutes the frame of security, trustworthiness, approval and professional advice and support which is so important to our partners and beneficiaries.This year\u2019s project of 8 to 11 weeks will be carried out in companies and institutions based in the UK, France, Spain, Ireland, Cyprus, Malta and Turkey.

In addition there will be various arrangements and meetings to prepare them for their stay in London. In London the pupils will be at the ECBM each day. There they get familiar with different learning and presentation techniques, specific topics, make excursions and work on individual projects. At the end of their stay there will be an oral and a written exam. Back home they will write their executive summary. All three parts are obligatory to achieve the Kaufmann/-frau International Certificate certified by the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce. Before the mobility each participant has to sign a learning agreement. It should include individually chosen topics in combination with language and cultural objectives. Participating teachers attend partner schools for a job shadowing period to develop their teacher personality by getting to know new teaching approaches and methods. Back home multiplication events will be implemented.The project should promote the understanding of social challenges in other countries and cultures among pupils and teachers.

Europe with its linguistic and cultural variety should be experienced and the importance of lifelong learning should be realized. The mobility will lead to an intercultural asset that will be of great benefit for the school itself and its pupils due to the teachers in their function as role models and the integration of intercultural knowledge into concrete school activities.

Above all, trainees who have not had the opportunity of being supported, i.e. especially not through European exchange programmes, should be enabled to profit from this project.Learning outcomesThe participants are expected to improve their general and business-related knowledge of English during the 3-week-course at the European College of Business and Management (ECBM) in London. With the project-related work they shall be encouraged to work on their own, improve their presentation skills as well as develop team spirit \u2013 qualifications which are essential in a modern business world. Moreover, we want the participants to gain valuable intercultural experience, build up a healthy self-confidence and develop selfworthiness not only for their professional career. Closely connected we see the project as a door-opener to a positive attitude against life-long learning and minimizing internal barriers when it comes to work abroad.Participants: Amount and ProfileThe participants are 22 trainees for office and business management assistants in industry concentrating on the commercial side of the business. They have served about half of their apprenticeship of two and a half respectively three years already. They have a basic practical experience, a solid knowledge of English which mainly results from a secondary education, partly higher secondary or A-Levels. Their language skills are above average. Basic task-related vocabulary has been acquired at vocational school. There is also a basic knowledge of intercultural communication.Activities/ImplementationThe course at the ECBM includes lessons as well as group work on a chosen project (assisted by tutors). Their tasks also include research activities and a presentation which is part of the exam. This presentation has to be followed by a written executive summary. Furthermore, the participants have to pass a written examination. The cultural aspects include an overview on British politics, economy and society in lessons as well as excursions with the ECBM.At a personal level the participants will be enabled to experience another culture, life in another household and host family, a totally new surrounding in a world city thus learning to understand, respect and accept other people. Their language skills will profit immensely not only from the stay at the college but the contact to and within the host families. The teachers from vocational school who will accompany and monitor the project will take them on cultural tours, e.g. tours of the city, visit museums, concerts, theatre plays and typical markets.Results / Long-term outcomesOn the long run this project will help improve the participants\u2019 intercultural skills as well as encourage them to see work abroad as part of their business life and accept life-long learning as an essential part of a professional career.", "http://www.eurocollege.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-003057_1"], ["3HU", "Managing Yourself II- Achievement, Inspiration, Motivation(Organisational Units Restructured- Achievement, Inspiration, Motivation)", "European College of Business and Management", 40596.0, "In our recent project MY AIM the self-management approach has been implemented as an integral element of work placements abroad.

Located in the heart of the City of London, with its international, financial and economic markets and institutions as well as its excellent cultural and commercial opportunities, the ECBM is able to offer an ideal location for students who wish to experience, explore and learn about British, European and international business and culture.The  Professional Development Programme (PDP) meets the demands of our students, the curriculum for apprentices in the wholesale and foreign trade business and the expectations of the firms. The participants will acquire job-related, intercultural and linguistic competences that will improve their chances on the international labour market.The involved training companies appreciate especially the intense study programme with an oral presentation, a  written exam and an executive summary. Successful students will be awarded with a Certificate of the German British Chamber of  Industry and Commerce (AHK London).Number and Profile of Participants:20 apprentices from mainly medium-sized wholesale companies will take part in the project. They will between 17 and 20 years old and will just have finished the second year of their vocational training when the project starts. Some of them have already been abroad on school exchange programmes with their former schools, but none of them has ever had to the chance to join a work-related project.Organization:1. Preparation stage: We will match the course topics with the curriculum of the wholesalers in close consultation with Sarah Iles at the ECBM and set up and sign a Memoranda of Understanding, inform the involved companies, select the participants in a responsible way, organize and book flights and transfer to the airport, take out insurance policies, and prepare the students thoroughly for their stay in London. 2. Main activity: During the project, the ECBM is responsible for the transfer from and to the airport, the arrangements with host families, the course programme, the excursions and the evaluation of the teaching units.3. Follow-up: The apprentices  will have to evaluate the whole project, do presentations to inform their classmates and future participants, write an article about their experiences for the \"Jahresbericht\" and the local newspaperThe main objectives of the programme are to deepen business knowledge, improve professional skills on an international basis and enhance language competence to encourage lifelong learning and mobility.According to the IHK in Germany, companies will have to intensify their international activities in the fields of procurement and logistics. This is only possible when employees get the chance to develop further occupational competences. Language skills in the international trade language English as well as the knowledge of country-specific economic structures will be an advantage in economic competition. The involved teachers will benefit from a close cooperation and exchange of ideas on a European level and the insight into the world trade centre London.

We got familiar with this company during a further education course about \u201cLeonardo DaVinci\u201d. B.I.G. Bristol organise practical trainings which meet the job requirements of our retail clerk and wholesale clerk trainees.The main aim of project 1 is to enable 24 students from the vocational school \"Staatliche Berufsschule II Memmingen\" to attend a three-weeks course at the European College of Business and Management in London. The students, who train to be a bank clerk, industrial clerk or office clerk, are all in their second year of vocational training. During the course the students are able to improve their language skills in English as well as their knowledge in business administration issues.At the college the students attend lessons every working day between 9.30 am and 4.45 pm. The lessons deal with topics which are related to their vocational training in Germany. The lessons are held by specially trained and experienced teachers from the college. In addition to the daily lessons, the participants have to write out an assignment on a special economic or social-economic topic, which is chosen by them individually. This as well as the final presentation at the end of the course, enhances the language skills immensely.Within project 2, twenty wholesale and retail trainees get the opportunity to do a two weeks internship in several different commercial companies. There they can obtain a fundamental insight into several types of businesses, gain practical experience and have the chance to get into contact with well versed colleagues on-siteNext to the course, the students of both projects are obliged to plan and prepare several group excursions. The group leaders decide on relevant topics and talk them over with the students during the preparation meetings. The topics are then prepared in English by the student teams, so that they can be presented by them in London respectively Bristol and the surrounding area during the group excursions.

Each project group will consist of 20 trainees.The main goal of this project is the lasting improvement and expansion of personal, social, intercultural and linguistic skills.Another aim is to promote and improve personal and social skills, as students will be required to independently commute to the college and have to live with host families.The exchange will lead to a better understanding of differences and similarities in vocational qualification in Great Britain and increase the participants\u00b4 intercultural competence. This goal, however, will not only be based on the actual experiences made in Great Britain, but will also be supported by a preparatory course and an evaluation seminar which will take place in Neus\u00e4\u00df after the stay.An increase in linguistic and communicative competences will be achieved, as all participants will have to use English on a daily basis in their host families, internships or during other social activites and by being taught by native speakers in the classroom.The participants are involved in real terms operational procedures in their export-oriented companies and therefore need linguistic and communicative competence in the world language English.The trainees will be taught in the ECBM College during three weeks in London to gain the certificate (KIC) \"Kaufmann/-frau International\".

The first week acquaints the participants with London as an economic hub. One key element involves working on case studies in English, presenting results and evaluating the process. This provides additional preparation for investigative company visits in the second week. Working in small groups, the trainees have previously arranged to research a local company in order to conduct interviews and report on a pre-arranged topic relevant to their chosen company.

Then we went to London and this year we expand the project with internships in Nice. The project is constantly improved. We constantly evaluate, improve and expand if possible.OBJECTIVESWe want to prepare our students for the labour market and we want to improve their professional competences. Our students need to speak a foreign language (English or French) so that is really a good practice. We also want to improve the personal skills of our students : problem solving, self-reliance, co-operaration, communication, teamspirit, independence, initiative, dealing with conflicts, showing interest, dealing with customers and colleagues.Finally we want to encourage an attitude for Life Long Learning.PARTICIPANTSAll our final year students of Aesthetic Body Care, Haircare, Fashion & Sales, Commerce/IT/Accounting/Office and Languages, Stage Techniques, Hotel and Restaurant & Kitchen get the opportunity of doing an internship abroad. They have to apply for the job \u2013 just like in real life. We send approximately 12 students of Aesthetic Body Care, Hotel and Restaurant & Kitchen to Nice and approximately 28 students of Haircare, Fashion & Sales, Commerce/IT/Accounting/Office and Languages, Stage Techniques to London.The number of students depends on the interest of the students, their motivation and the number of students in class that year.The students do not have the money to finance this internship so that is why we apply for a scholarship for them.

With all this information we evaluate well and discuss how we will improve. Also with the intern places we discuss what can be improved for the following year. We repeat this flow 2 times because we apply for 24 months.DISSEMINATION OF THE PROJECTWe disseminate our Erasmus+ project via Facebook and our website. We invite the local press a few times to promote what we are doing. The students write a blog and give a PowerPoint presentation to their possible successors.RESULTS AND IMPACTThe project means a perfect showcase of all the different professions at our school. We are really convinced about the value for the education and personal development of the students. They will work on the European labour market so the European borders will be open.

It is the opportunity to build partnerships and thus to develop international relations.The pupils have then a more precise image of what Europe stands for, with a stronger feeling of membership. It is, in a way, an education to citizenship which allows an open-mindedness.Profits for the professional high school will be enormous. Our purpose is to create a dynamics and a synergy within the educational team which will be in of the European Section in electronics.This project allows us to create partnerships establishment / companies. Little by little, we create our network. We wish to direct more the mobility of our pupils in companies specialized in the restoration of multimedia devices intended for needy structures  in poor countries. These internships are often of very good quality. The pupils are appreciated to their just value.

The stays will have a duration of 5 weeks in London ( a one-week cultural integration and a four-week training period).The period of internship will take place in April of their last year in the Professional high school. The pupils will thus have an objective view of the business world since they will have already experimented it in their past training periods. Four weeks is a sufficient duration to allow them to develop language and professional skills. They will have time to adapt themselves to another lifestyle, to another environment.In their return of internship, we shall estimate their progress through the display of various works (small presentations, description of plans, slides...) . They will have the opportunity to report profits acquired both in the linguistic field and the professional in the class. The purpose is to try and make them gradually interested in the mobility and thus, set up a dynamics among all the other pupils.We shall, afterwards,  try to  broadcast the results of our project in the internal as in the external.At the internal level of the high school: - distribution of information leaflets - announcement during events: Start of the school year in September; Newton High School Open Day- page of information on the site of the High school At the external level of the high school:- a ceremony of delivery of the Europass in the presence of the parents, the partners (the City hall, the Region and the Center of Resource Europe)-regular encounters with the journalist of \"Clichy Mag\", the local monthly magazine: an article about our project usually appears in the months of June/July.

They are used today in virtually all professional sectors, particularly in those that we have selected: Hospitality and Catering, and Retail.Mobility project provide an immersion in both host countries, namely the United Kingdom and Spain.The Mobility concerns 31 young people with learning difficulties but who are very motivated to participate in this scheme because it is an opportunity for them to \"pull through\" as they themselves explain it.In order to meet the baccalaureate referential for each vocational sector, the Retail students will complete a four week training period in retail and those of Hospitality / Catering will complete eight weeks training in the front or the back of a restaurant.

Constant attention is paid to teach new technologies and promote self-realisation of students.  The examination of problematic children indicated an array of factors influencing their behavior: family, school, economic reasons (emigration of parents, poverty),the inner values, peer subculture, personal qualities (character), influence of the media.Scientists describe the disadvantaged children as children, who do not go to school, have behavioral problems at school, abuse alcohol and psychotropic substances, tend to engage in criminal activities, are at risk of psychological, physical or sexual abuse or violence in the family and their ability to develop and participate in public life is limited. Studies show that these children cannot use their abilities in decent ways, do not participate in social life, do not trust themselves (so they quickly take offense for a teacher\u2019s or peer\u2019s notes), lack social skills, their interests are narrow. They often have psychological difficulties in learning and behavior but can quickly  respond to changes. They are quite well targeted, can react to changes, but they find it difficult to take over the values, because their life experience does not rely on them.In consortium partner schools a number of students come to learn from disadvantaged families where parents cannot properly care for the children because of  lack of social skills or use state support not for family needs, so there is a risk for child\u2019s mental, physical, spiritual and moral development and security.Schools try to cooperate with families, social welfare institutions and help these children. As the survey was taken with partner schools, there are more and more such children coming to schools. There are many challenges facing teachers who first need to solve their psychological, social and personal problems and only later do their direct job-help to learn and teach. Therefore, the project is given for the teachers to visit schools in other countries and have insights about ways and methods to work with the family and to aid students, meet specialists working in institutions. Teachers need not only pedagogical and psychological knowledge, but constantly upgrade the competencies that will be required in the future to better meet the needs of these pupils and help them integrate and adapt in educational and social environment.This corresponds to Klaipeda Tourism School and the partners\u2019 strategic plans to improve the quality and effectiveness of vocational training.It is important while learning at a vocational school to gain not only theoretical but also practical knowledge that after completion of their studies, students could more easily adapt to the labour market.Members of the project are trainers from Klaipeda Tourism, Daugai Technology and Business, Klaipeda Dressmaking and Service Business Schools, Taurage Vocational Training Centre and their authorities, planning educational process. Students get skills and abilities during educational process at school. In order to provide quality education for students in line with labor market needs, it is important that their trainers are competent. During the project, 32 participants, trainers, administrators, would jointly monitor the organization of training in vocational schools in Germany, England, Spain and Italy.Results: Participants will update the pedagogical and psychological knowledge, will improve teaching methods, methods of work with students from disadvantaged families in 4 sending schools.Teachers will go to monitoring visits, exchange the experience and after returning will prepare presentations, discuss with the authorities, social educators and psychologists what methods can be applied in schools according to their institutional needs. Impact on schools: Better quality of vocational training and students' preparation; better quality of training programs, increasing the attractiveness and improvement of the image of schools; the positive impact on teaching staff, improving their competencies; better adaptability of vocational education to labor market requirements; improved cooperation with the social partners in Lithuania and abroad;Impact on pupils: Easily accessible and career-oriented vocational training; competitiveness of acquired specialties in Lithuania and international markets; designed training (learning) environment, based on human values; established interesting and rich socio-cultural environment.Impact on teachers: Created the right conditions to reveal the professionalism, improved competences of trainers and authorities; implemented motivation to promote self-esteem and its strengthening activities, enabling to feel competitive in Lithuanian labor market, increased teachers\u2019 and authori; implemented motivation to promote self-esteem and its strengthening activities, enabling to feel competitive.", "http://www.languagelink.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-LT01-KA102-022943_1"], ["2BU", "London-Nantes: Channeling Business", "Language Link London ltd", 36894.0, "The aim of the project \u201cLondon-Nantes: Channelling Business\u201d is to enable Ursulinen Mechelen 1 pupils studying Business Support and Office Assistance to do internships in London or Nantes respectively.\r\n\r\nAn internship abroad allows pupils to apply their knowledge, skills and attitudes in a \u201creal life\u201d context.

In this sense we think an innovative methodology combined with the implementation of new organizational and academic measures will allow us to cater for our students\u00b4different learning styles and needs at the same time that we integrate and practice all the skills within and outside the classroom. Participants:The participants are  experienced language teachers in Official Language Schools. They have taken part in numerous training activities and one of of them was also the coordinator  of  a Grundtvig Adult Learning Partnership. The fact that one of the teachers is also the headmaster is an asset, because the impact will be stronger.Activities:Regarding the initial preparation the teachers  will  become familiar with the course contents and the bibliography, and they will carry out the initial preparatory and initial assessment tasks. In the case of the job shadowing a mobility agreement will be established between the guest school and the partner institution, regarding benefits,  initial preparation, dissemination of skills and assessment of outcomes.On the other hand, the school administrators will plan the trip and make all the necessary arrangements for the mobilities. In the different meetings with the school managers the participants will share their concerns and prepare materials about their school and observation sheets.The second stage of the project consists in the mobility itself to the countries  where the job shadowing experience and training mobility  will take place. There they will learn about new methodologies and different approaches to education as well as academic school management.  And how to best use them to the students\u00b4advantage, taking into account the different skills and different learning styles.  The Training activity  will  teach the participant how to adapt to the students\u00b4s needs and motivate them to learn through innovative and creative methodological approaches, where the culture of the language will play a key role. In the job shadowing mobility the Head of the school will observe all the aspects involved in running a language school: new academic approaches and organizational measures.Afterwards, the assessment activities will be implemented through reports, meetings  and interviews with the headmaster. The outcome of the training activity will be incorporated into the School Teacher Training Plan , the Extracurricular Activities Programme  , and the didactic programmings . Later it will be disseminated through meetings, creating and disseminating materials, like work documents, setting up blogs or websites, and finally organizing projects with other  institutions through etwnning or KA-2 Strategic Associations. Apart from that study trips to London and Berlin and guidance on how to seek work in those cities and countries will play an important role in the school.Methodology:The preparation and monitoring of the mobility will be based on the ongoing interaction among the participants, the Language School coordinator , the partner school and the representative of the training institution, together with the National Agency. Throughout the mobilities the methodology will be communicative and practical, through cooperative group work, debates, observation, document analysis, presentations and performances. Results and impact:On the one hand, to improve the teaching techniques and methodological strategies in the classroom of all the teaching staff.

Results, long- term effects and benefits of the project:- All participants get the chance to improve their competences and chances on the international labour market.- Companies benefit from training of their human resources.- The local area remains competitive as compared to international standards.- The unemployment among youth can be reduced.7. ECVET - Europass Mobility/CV, Learning agreements  and various Certificates- Learning agreements with all students and signed by all partners- Europass Mobility/CV for the students to document the Mobilty Activity- the students get also further certificates to document the activities by the ECBM and the German-British ChamberII. 2 apprentices will go to Spain to participate in a four-weeks learning and training programme. Up to now we only conducted 2 weeks programmes in our partner institution. It is our intention to send 2 apprentices -minimum- each year to Spain, to get to know our partner institution and to take part in a training programme in companies for 2 weeks. Also our partners want the exchange projects and will send 3 apprenteces to us at our school.III. This year we will start an exchange programme with our partner institution \"Institut de Vic\" which aims exactly at our colleagues of our vocational college or perhaps some neighbouring schools as well. We would like our colleagues to aquire some knowledge about the educational programme especially in the vocational area which is perfomed in Spain and Catalonia. They should get to know our partner institution in Vic as well as the colleagues who are teaching there and the whole institution. We would like them to to build up contacts there. We will start this programme with a small group of 6 teachers, that they will be able to act as future multipliers. We do this according to our mission statement. We do hope that our partners will also get the funding in Spain, that we can welcome our Spanish friends here as well.This is our strategy for internationalisation especially for the application in 2016.

Furthermore, they should be able to act responsibly and confidently at international financial places. During their stay in London the students are supposed to discover the banking centre London with its severe problems as well as learn about British economy and politics.  Visiting the docklands, the Bank of England and the Stock Exchange, for example, our students will get a deeper insight into London.\r\n\r\nThe target group of our project are apprentices of Investment Fund Administration and apprentices in Banking who started their traineeship one year ago.

So the main aims are \r\n- to  mprove language skills and intercultural competence and \r\n- to increase self-confidence in liaising with foreign business partners (clients and suppliers).\r\nBoth  lead to  better employment opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\n- Business Communications/ Negotiating Skills, Telephoning, Communication at Work, Leadership and Management: --> gaining more self-confidence in dealing with business partners by actively using training methods\r\n- Business Communications/ Writing CVs and Letters of Application, Interview Techniques /Social Media: -->gaining knowledge about international requirements regarding applications, importance of networking \r\n- Business Case Studies/ Differences / Corporate Culture --> introduction into operating processes in other countries\r\nBritain in the EU/British Politics/Law/ Marketing/Media. --> increasing intercultural awareness and tolerance \r\nTasks:\r\nWritten exam\r\nPowerPoint Presentation about a business topic\r\nExecutive summary  \r\n\r\nValidation:\r\n- ECBM Certificate of Attendance \r\n- German-British Chamber Certificate  \r\n- Kaufmann/Kauffrau International Qualification  \r\n- Europass\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nThe contents has been developed over the years from experience of the partners and from feedback of the participants. Every year the time table is reviewed and partly altered according to current requirements and also current global developments (e.g. financial crisis)\r\n\r\nPreparation and evaluation:\r\nThere are e fivsessions, in which the participants are informed and learn about the following topics:\r\n1. Contract agreements etc. Erasmus+\r\n2. Preparation Pack of ECBM, validity of certificates, travel arrangements etc.,\r\n3. Preparation of project work, project choice, London as cultural location  / Presentation techniques, layout  and structure of executive summary,\r\n4.  Final organisation (emergency contact details) outlook , dates and deadlines (feedback etc.), current affairs\r\n5. Evaluation (Feedback, questionnaires, discussions etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nResults/Outcomes:\r\n- better employment chances on the international market (increasingly important)\r\n- valid certificates increase competitiveness of participants on the labour market\r\n- higher recognition by big companies/ global players who are located in the area\r\n- increased motivation to achieve higher qualification and degrees (Bachelor and Master degrees). Increasingly important as transparency and comparability of degrees has been entered into a European framework .\r\n- higher flexibility and mobility\r\n- better negotiating skills in dealing with international business partners\r\n- improved organizational and IT skills \r\n- high competence in English as the globalised world\u2019s business language \r\n\r\nThe results of  the past years  show increased self-confidence  regarding personal as well as business skills. Increasingly participants apply for jobs abroad and also take up further qualification opportunities that are offered by the ECBM.  All this qualifies them further on the European market and enhances their general understanding of the necessity to think globally.

Both the economic and pedagogic skills of the teachers at the ECBM concerning the transmission of central aspects of the British economy, culture and politics have convinced us to continue this project for more than ten years now.\r\n\r\nThe decision of offering another project (project 2) has prompted us to choose B.I.G.

We got familiar with this company during a further education course about \u201cLeonardo DaVinci\u201d. B.I.G.

The students, who train to be a bank clerk, industrial clerk or office clerk, are all in their second year of vocational training. During the course the students are able to improve their language skills in English as well as their knowledge in business administration issues.\r\n\r\nAt the college the students attend lessons every working day between 9.30 am and 4.45 pm. The lessons deal with topics which are related to their vocational training in Germany. The lessons are held by specially trained and experienced teachers from the college. In addition to the daily lessons, the participants have to write out an assignment on a special economic or social-economic topic, which is chosen by them individually. This as well as the final presentation at the end of the course, enhances the language skills immensely.\r\n\r\nConcerning project 2, 20 wholesale and retail clerk trainees take part in a two-week internship in various commercial companies. They will get a close insight into the job-related practical experience and get the chance to interchange with their British colleagues. \r\n\r\nNext to the course, the students of both projects are obliged to plan and prepare several group excursions. The group leaders decide on relevant topics and talk them over with the students during the preparation meetings. The topics are then prepared in English by the student teams, so that they can be presented by them in London respectively Bristol and the surrounding area during the group excursions. \r\n\r\nAnother major aim of the project is to enlarge the intercultural, social and individual skills of the students.

They will have already obtained knowledge concerning such matters of commercial correspondence as enquiry, offer, order, delay in payment and notice of defects. Further, they will have learned how to handle different types of forms in the field of foreign trade and will have acquired detailed knowledge in the subjects of business administration, national economy and infonomics. In the latter they will have learned how to use computer programmes like Excel, Word and Powerpoint and will be well trained in word processing.\r\nDue to all these skills acquired, they are qualified for working in international importing and exporting enterprises, shipping companies, international industrial concerns and organisations as well as in hotels and/or language schools.\r\nAt a time when their state of knowledge enables the trainees to deal with responsible tasks in a company or an institution, the internships offer the opportunity to link their theoretical knowledge with practical training. What concerns us primarily is that for teaching purposes didactically reduced case studies become verified in a real environment in order to enhance the students\u2019 chances on the European labour market.\r\nAs this is a full-time vocational school training, the trainees have got few opportunities to work in side jobs to earn their own living. Thus, doing an internship in a foreign country does not only mean financial losses during the time of their stay but also considerable problems in raising the funds for a period abroad. Only if our trainees will be sponsored by the ERASMUS+ programme, we are able to realise our project which is continually carried out and supervised by qualified teachers experienced in this area.\r\nMoreover, this programme constitutes the frame of security, trustworthiness, approval and professional advice and support which is so important to our partners and beneficiaries.\r\nThis year\u2019s project of 8 to 11 weeks will be carried out in companies and institutions based in the UK, France, Spain, Ireland, Cyprus, Malta and Turkey.

At the same time, we have been able to involve more training companies and vocational schools (industrial and business).\r\nProject goals:\r\nOur project aims specifically at enhancing applicants\u2019 job chances through their acquisition of a further qualification. With this main goal, we are confident that participants \u2013 in addition to strengthening their self-competence - will improve their communication skills in a foreign language and will absorb new learning methods (informal and non-formal learning) thus strengthening and broadening their overall professional and political competencies.

Twenty of these applicants are completing their vocational education (horticulture, agriculture and home economics) in a facility for the handicapped and have special needs.\r\nDescription of project activities:\r\nThe project coordinator carries the main responsibility for preparation, operative implementation and evaluation. Specialised institutions and experts are involved when preparatory seminars are carried out. Language courses are in some instances organized by the participants themselves or \u2013 where eligible for funding \u2013 are carried out in the respective training companies or schools. These make a preselection of the applicants based on qualitative criteria. We make the final decision on the choice of the participating students.

All applicants receive our brochure with detailed information about the programme. As needed, we assist in the search for partner companies. The preparatory seminars take place at various locations, depending of the participants. Those travelling alone are given individual support.

We are confident that these main goals will be reflected in broadened political competence in addition to the professional competencies gained. We support workers\u2019 councils in their task of improving the quality of vocational training and to disseminate Erasmus+.\r\nDescription of the anticipated long-term benefits \r\nFor training companies, sending trainees on internships is an integral part of personnel development. Through the stays in a foreign country, participants gain an important broadening of their competencies which greatly enhances their employment chances.

This is most efficient in an authentic surrounding where you can experiece and acquire new skills in a direct way. Above all, trainees who have not had the opportunity of being supported, i.e. especially not through European exchange programmes, should be enabled to profit from this project.\r\n\r\nLearning outcomes:\r\nThe participants are expected to deepen both their general and business knowledge of English during the 3-week-course at the European College of Business and Management (ECBM) in London. With the project-related work they shall be encouraged to work on their own, improve their presentation skills as well as develop team-spirit qualifications which are essential in a modern business world. \r\nMoreover, we want the participants to improve their language competence and gain valuable intercultural experience, build up a healthy self-confidence and develop self-worthiness not only for their professional career. Closely connected we see the project as a door-opener to a positive attitude towards life-long learning and minimizing internal barriers when it comes to work abroad.\r\n\r\nParticipants: Amount and Profile:\r\nThe 20 participants are training to become business management assistants in industry concentrating on the commercial side of the business. They have served at least about half of their traineeship of two and a half respectively three years already. They have gained basic practical experience, a solid knowledge of English, which mainly results from a secondary education, partly higher secondary or A-levels. Their language skills are above average. Basic task-related vocabulary has been acquired at vocational school. There is also a basic knowledge of intercultural communication - partly achieved at vocational school. \r\n\r\nActivities / Implementation:\r\nThe course at the ECBM includes lessons as well as group work on projects (assisted by tutors). The students' tasks also include research activities (field, internet, and  other) and a presentation on a chosen subject which is part of the examination. A written executive summary has to follow the presentation. The cultural aspects include an overview on British and London politics, economy and society in lessons as well as excursions with the ECBM. \r\nAt a personal level the participants will be enabled to experience another culture, life in another household and host family, a completely new surrounding in a world city thus learning to understand, respect and accept other people. \r\nTheir language skills will profit immensely not only from the stay at the college but the contact to and within host families as well as managing daily life. The teachers from vocational school accompanying and monitoring the project will take them on cultural tours, e.g. tours of the city, visit museums, concerts, theatre plays, typical markets or sports events, and a trip to Brighton as an example of British seaside resorts.\r\n\r\nResults / Long-term outcomes:\r\nOn the long run this project will help improve  the participants to develop skills which will enhance performance at the workplace as well as be of personal benefit for the students.

In the courses they get an overview of British business and culture and an introduction to their specific areas of occupation and interest which can be built upon at a later stage. There are also excursions that have close relevance to the course topics, e.g. to London Stock Exchange, MINI plant in Oxford, Bosch in Denham, The Bank of England Museum or The Thames Barrier. During their stay at British guest families and in London they gain insights in British life and culture and  improve their cross-cultural competence and understanding.\r\n\r\nSecond, we sent 6 teachers to the ECBM for one week in order to do a job-shadowing, to improve their language and professional skills and to gather information.

During their training they are employed by companies which train them on the job. On one or two days of the week the young people, who are called apprentices, attend a vocational school. They are eligible to be trained in order to get those skills required for a career in the envisioned business or trade. This implies to acquire English language proficiency on the job. Especially industrial companies, logistics firms and companies in the whole sale trade need employees with these skills. Companies and employers need that type of personell functioning effectively in a crosscultural environment. Our vocational school (bsnu) cannot transfer those skills completely as the curriculum only provides 45 minutes per week to train our students in English language and cross-cultural skills. According to academic studies native speakers of English can teach students, who learn English as a foreign language, more efficiently than  indigenous teachers. This course aims at improving our students\u2019 professional competency as well as British culture and doing business in the United Kingdom. The course is designed for 24 participants. We will only take apprentices who attend our school and work in companies which provide business orientated training in professions like industrial clerks, logistics clerks or wholesale clerks.

Only a small number of students have A-levels. Applying for our Erasmus+ project does not require A-levels. We recommend applying for participating in an Erasmus+ project of our school in the first or second year of their training because going to London in their final year may distract some students from preparing well for their final exams carried out by a chamber of commerce and industry. A group of bsnu teachers and Ms Sarah Iles of ECBM designed a concept and procedures for new Erasmus+ projects. We inform our students about new projects by handing out flyers and leaflets. We also put information about the projects on the bsnu website. Our teachers inform their students in the classrooms about our planned projects. We will send letters to companies which have taken apprentices to provide information about the project. When apprentices apply for participating in our project they must provide a written statement of their company showing they agree that their apprentice will be in London for three weeks during their regular period of vocational training. After evaluating the application forms we will choose the participants. If a company indicates their apprentices require English and cross-cultural skills on the job in an extensive manner, those applicants will be put on a priority list. The advices and recommendations of the remaining companies and of teachers from our school, who teach those applicants, will also be considered when choosing participants. In future we will not provide any English language courses for the participants. They have to use online courses provided by Erasmus+ to improve their English proficiency. However, we will go on providing cross-cultural training and a specific training for the ECBM course in London. We will only send one group of twentyfour students to London per year. According to our plans this will be in May/June 2018. Ms Yu Fengyan and Mr Albrecht Hofmann from our school will accompany the group when travelling to London. They will stay with the group in London for three weeks and will join the group on their journey back to Germany. The accompanying persons will monitor the group and their learning achievements. Ms Sarah Iles and the ECBM lecturers will be in charge of the teaching and motivation of the group while they are trained in London. After three weeks in London the participants can show in a presentation and in a written exam what they will have learned.

It concludes with a certificate of proficiency graded according to the Common European Framework of Reference and will be offered in this form in future. In addition, it serves as a basis for the planning and execution of projects with an alternative concept: two-week placements in cooperation with tried and new partners with the objective of exchanging views and experience of professional practice through company visits and discussion with all of those involved in vocational training. Furthermore, relevant topics can be included flexibly, e.g. current developments in the EU.\r\n\r\nOur contact to Lyc\u00e9e Pierre de Coubertin, Calais, will be reactivated. Rather than the previous three-week twinning with the emphasis on work placement, the future emphasis will be on small groups interacting and discussing.

Sitting in on lessons, company visits as well as extramural activities provide for enhanced intercultural competence and the opportunity for didactic reflection and development.\r\n\r\nThe relationship with Omnia, in Espoo, Finland, should develop along similar lines, whereby English will be paramount. By bringing together compatible professional sectors, greater emphasis will be placed on topics specifically related to the sector in question.\r\n\r\nOur new partnership with LSE in Liverpool provides two further offers meeting our aspirations: for our apprentices language development is the primary objective flanked by company visits with groups formed more on the basis of the level of fluency rather than their training focus. As our English department expands and is strengthened through the Vocational College English Qualification at the Oldenburg Further Education Centre, Liverpool runs a particularly apposite intensive course culminating in the Cambridge Teaching Knowledge Test (TKT). Participants not only consolidate specific vocabulary, but also through teaching their main subject to the Liverpool study group explore, expand and develop didactic approaches. A parallel course offered by the established International Study Programme gives us even greater flexibility to enable our staff to acquire further qualifications.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have offered our apprentices the professional KMK English Language certificate at Level B2.

The aim of this is an increased intercultural and personal competence to help master new challenges in business as well as personal life. Businesses, which are very often internationally orientated, would thus benefit from highly motivated employees who would be more self-assured in their treatment of foreign customers and suppliers. Participation in the project can also lead to enhanced willingness to work abroad inside the EU.\r\nThe project is aimed at students with university entry qualification and those entitled to study at specialist colleges and universities of applied sciences, whose level of proficiency in English is at least B2 (for Great Britain), and good students who graduated from middle school with a sound knowledge of English, which they can use to bridge communication gaps (for Estonia). The participants will be apprentices of various different professions in their second year of training. The focus will be on bank clerks, industrial clerks as well as clerks in administration, but the project will be open to all other professions, like office clerks and automotive clerks. At the time of departure, students in three-year courses will have passed about one half of their training, those in two-year courses (e.g. financial assistants) will have passed about two-thirds of their training.

It is a long-term goal to enhance mobility and to prepare the students for an unknown environment, as it is less and less likely for them to remain in the places where they are being trained. Intercultural competence is becoming increasingly important at school and in the workplace, with colleagues just as with customers. When dealing with them, it is of particular importance to show understanding and empathy, especially for those who come from foreign nations and cultures. Self-organisation of exchange processes is of central pedagogical importance in this project. The participants will have to let themselves in for each other, make decisions together and coordinate their decisions with those of others. Self-organisation is a crucial educational aim which is meant to enable the young people to be resourceful and to take the initiative.

Many of them are doing their traineeship in internationally operating companies. Therefore, they should gain job-related experience abroad as soon as possible. Getting insights into international business processes and using English as the language of business are elements that give these students a professional and personal advantage. Therefore, we are helping our students to be successful on the European labour market. \r\nOur teachers, taking part in the project gain insights in planning and conducting European projects and exchange skills and methods with English-speaking colleagues.\r\n\r\nDeveloping personal skills and competences:\r\n\r\nBesides, spending time abroad is helping the students to overcome fears of foreign things and helps them to gain intercultural competences. Our students live in small villages in rural Upper Bavaria. Spending three weeks in multicultural London will make a huge impression on them. Besides, working and living abroad in host families will contribute to a positive personal development. That will also help to promote tolerance and to eliminate prejudices.\r\nOur teachers also profit from staying abroad and strengthen their insights into the European idea. Intercultural competences can only be communicated if one is convinced of the idea oneself.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the project, concerning the staatliche Berufsschule Pfaffenhofen and its partners:\r\n\r\nThe staatliche Berufsschule Pfaffenhofen wants to extend its internationalisation strategy.

Europe is characterised by its linguistc and cultural diversity. As a continent where three dozen languages are spoken, it is known for the high number of cultures that border on one another. But Europe means more than being able to travel and work without frontiers and customs: Europe is a true vision of society and understanding.\r\n\r\nWithin the framework of globalisation, there is a greater demand than ever for multilingualism. Hardly any company can survive without international links. There is a growing need for international staff who speak foreign languages. As citizens of Europe we must be able to communicate and co-operate across borders and cultures...\r\n\r\nBackground and Participants:\r\nStudents completing a vocational education as Commercial Assistants at the Kolping College of Commerce and Foreign Languages in Heilbronn enjoy a predominantly theoretical education. In order to enhance the quality of their training and to improve the employment prospects of our young students, it is desirable for their education to include a period of practical experience abroad. Within the framework of this project, a total of approximately 25 future commercial assistants from both the first and second years of the course will take part in three-week study trips to Spain or Great Britain during the spring of 2019. At this juncture, they have yet to gain any practical experience in a foreign country.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nThe activities comprise instruction in the foreign language and business administration at partner institutes, company visits, excursions and school projects, as well as cultural events. Participants orient themselves by the GUIDE they themselves have created and, in addition, complete their project \"A DIFFERENT DAILY ROUTINE\". The contents of the trip are organised so as to complement and augment the mostly theoretical education provided by the College.\r\n\r\nAims of the Project:\r\nThe study trips are founded on the three elements of the foreign language and culture, and the world of business, and are designed to achieve goals relevant to the students' education. The knowledge students have acquired of the foreign language in the classroom can be tried out and deepened in another European country. Students are given the opportunity to undertake operational tasks while gaining an insight into the business life of the foreign country and familiarising themselves with its work culture and lifestyle. The encounter with the country's culture takes the form of their daily routine combined with visits to museums and the theatre.\r\n\r\nProcedure and Implementation:\r\nWe remain in continuous contact with our partner institutes, so that we can involve students, parents, teachers and the college as a whole during the course of the year leading up to a study trip. As soon as assurance of support has been granted, the project managers contact our partner institutes in order to co-ordinate the details. Host families are selected by our partner institutes. The project management team deals with the organisation of the trip and the formalities of insurance and legal contracts, also communicating with the parents of the participants on these matters. The students themselves finally draw up the supporting programme as well as their GUIDE as part of their course in project management at the College.\r\nAims and Benefits:\r\nParticipants write reports in which they present their results and how they personally have benefited from the study trip. \r\n\r\nThe results we aspire to achieve are to increase participants' abilities in the foreign language as well as their intercultural competence, and to improve their school marks and education.

The objective of sequa\u2019s mobility programme is the improvement and internationalisation of vocational education within Europe. It supports the mobility of trainees and professionals in vocational education.\r\n\r\nsequa is a non-profit organisation of the German private sector. Shareholders are Germany's top four business membership organisations BDA, BDI, DIHK, and ZDH as well as GIZ. sequa is a globally operating development organisation that has carried out projects and programmes of international cooperation in close collaboration with the German private sector since 1991. Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) and mobility of employees are part of the organisation\u2019s main purposes and thus have  a high priority. sequa\u2019s commitment to support vocational mobility already began in its year of foundation and was further developed throughout the years. From 1991 to 2017 sequa has carried out more than 2,600 mobility measures for apprentices, journeymen, skilled workers, and professionals in the TVET sector. Today, sequa implements the programme as leader of  a consortium of chambers, associations and companies. \r\n\r\nsequa, as the lead applicant, is responsible for the financial monitoring, the coordination and steering of the programme in close cooperation with its partners. The entire consortium is responsible for the implementation of the programme. Roles, responsibilities and quality standards for this cooperation are determined in the \u201cQuality Manual sequa Mobility\u201d which is based on the quality standards for pool projects published by NABIBB. Interested persons may apply either to sequa or to one of the consortium partners. Since 2012 the programme consists of three programme segments.\r\n\r\nThe target group for the programme segments SINDBAD and TRANSDUAL comprises trainees and young professionals. SINDBAD supports study trips of apprentices from all professions; the study trips are mostly group activities of three to four weeks. During their stay in a host company they get the opportunity to increase their professional knowledge and familiarize themselves with the working conditions in other European countries. The programme segment TRANSDUAL addresses trainees in commercial occupations and supports business language and competence training in France, the UK or Spain. The participants attend a seminar of three to four weeks that introduces the basics of the economic and legal system of the host country. \r\n\r\nSINDBAD and TRANSDUAL allow the participants to learn new techniques within their occupations in the host country, to increase their language skills and intercultural competences and thus, improve their competitiveness. Through the development of professional, methodical, and social competencies of the participants the programme segments contribute to the reduction of youth unemployment in Europe\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since 2012 sequa offers a programme segment for professionals in vocational education (e.g. teachers, instructors, trainers) of the consortium partners. move-it (mobility of vocational educational institutions and trainers) enables individual professionals in vocational education to exchange work experiences and techniques with other professionals abroad. The designs of the study trips can vary significantly, according to the needs, and give the participants the opportunity to get insights into European TVET structures, to increase their language and intercultural competencies and to develop their European network. The professionals will use their learning experiences abroad to enhance their teaching and the development of new training concepts. Furthermore, they may motivate their apprentices to become more open to working opportunities abroad, especially in Europe. \r\n\r\nBoth target groups of sequa\u2019s mobility programme are important multipliers in mobility, especially the professionals in vocational education. Open-minded TVET professionals and \u201cmobile\u201d trainees with experience abroad, who think and act with an international mindset, contribute to the intra-European recognition of learning experiences and support the harmonisation of European TVET systems. Furthermore, the mobility programme promotes the European Idea that says Europe is diversity and culture, friendship and togetherness, sustainability and future.

Being one of the first European schools in North Rhine-Westphalia, it has always been aiming at enabling all its students the realization of an internship in other European countries. The educational programme \u201cState-certified Commercial Assistants with Focus on Foreign Languages\u201d had been acting as forerunner and was, thus, able to establish contacts and partnerships with business enterprises and schools in France, Great Britain, Spain, Malta and Cyprus in the past decades which every year provide placements to the applicants. This year, 41 trainees will realize an internship in the countries mentioned above as well as in Poland and Ireland. The internship lasting 8 or 11 weeks, respectively, serves as the practical application of the theoretically acquired knowledge during the vocational training. It takes place in its last year when students already have acquired very good knowledge in foreign languages and MS Office. The participants of the internship project carry out commercial correspondence, translate texts into the German language, create customers\u2019 files, participate in customer acquisition, verify transport documents and carry out tasks of the front or back office in hotels. Five interns of the course of \u201cForeign Language Correspondence Clerks\u201d will realise their 3-weeks-internship in Great Britain  towards the end of their second year of traineeship.

For the first time, two students of the educational programme called \u201cCommercial College\u201d are aiming at a 2-weeks-internship abroad. Within the framework of the college\u2019s strategy of internationalisation, it is planned to establish a pool of partner enterprises, too, in order to offer the possibility of taking part in the internship programme to even more students than those of the courses mentioned above. Without the financial support and the formal framework of the ERASMUS+, students of any of the college\u2019s educational programmes could hardly realise an internship abroad. All participants firstly apply in writing for a scholarship with the respective colleague in charge. \u201cBerufskolleg Suedstadt\u201d has got an EU-Team which is led by a project coordinator. Two other colleagues are responsible for the financial processing and insurance matters. Additionally, in each educational programme there is a colleague who is familiar with its specific circumstances and supervises the trainees. Due to the high number of interns deriving from the \u201cAssistants with Focus on Foreign Languages\u201d, there is a colleague responsible for English-speaking EU-countries, Spain and France each, whereas singular internships in Poland this year and the like are cared for by the project coordinator.

During this evaluation, an opportunity for growth regarding its international orientation was observed.  The increasing importance of international work experience as part of a successful future work profile is widely recognised. Based on this realisation the German Parliament decided in 2013, that the goal is to enable at least 10% of all apprentices to gain international work experience in some form.  The predominantly small and medium sized company landscape in the region of Kempten/Allgaeu, allows for rather limited opportunities for students to gather international experience e.g. in foreign subsidiaries. As a result, the BS II Kempten decided on integrating the \u201cinternational orientation\u201d into its set of targets. Concrete goal is to support more students, in cooperation with their employers, to gather international work experience.\r\n\r\nAfter analysing the demand and defining the strategic goal, available resources to meet the targets were evaluated. As a key result, the main concern is the financial feasibility for the students. As a consequence, this application form was put together. With the financial support of the Erasmus+ programme for the apprentices, the vocational School Kempten II would be enabled to reinforce an international awareness within its organization by  establishing an annual mobility project and therefore support the Bundestagsbeschluss from 2013. By organizing this annual mobility the school  can realize its target of \"international orientation\". \r\n\r\nWhat exactly does that mean? The BS II Kempten is planning to introduce an annual student mobility activity for 22 students from the professions Bank, Industry, Logistics,  Wholesale and IT. Our partnering institution is the European College of Business and Management (ECBM) based in London. The ECBM is the educational academy of the German-British Chamber of industry and commerce. It already proofed to be extremely reliable and experienced, which supports our selection as a partnering institution. \r\n\r\nEvery year the 22 participants of the mobility will take part in an especially designed 3-week \u201cProfessional Development Programme (PDP)\u201d. Besides the in-depth examination of various topics in business, politics and society from a European and international perspective, the programme will touch on multiple functional and cross-functional topics. The housing of the students will be realized in guest families. Benefit of this is twofold; the students will dive deep into the British culture as well as significantly improve their language skills.\r\nWith the participation in the PDP the apprentices have the possibility to receive the KIC (Kaufmann International Certificate). This prestigious international qualification will be achieved by an oral and a written exam, as well as a dissertation. Additional requirement for this certificate is the graduation of the commercial apprenticeship in Germany. Furthermore all students will obtain the \"Europass Mobility\" as a record of the acquired competences. In combination with the \"Europass CV\" (which will already be created by the students in the project application process) these documents constitute the foundation for future application possibilities all over Europe. \r\n\r\nA multilevel application procedure is conducted for the selection of the participants. A specific preparation phase, the mentoring of the students in London and the reflexion phase at the end of the mobility project are further important components. Rounded up is the mobility by the ceremonial award of the \"Europass Mobilit\u00e4t\", where not only the participants but also the school management and administration, the staff and the cooperative companies will be invited. The realisation of the project is accompanied by a project management concept that helps to ensure the success of the project. Especially appropriate evaluation tools should support the continuous improvement process of further Mobilities. \r\n\r\nThe expected impact of the project is multidimensional. The apprentices will not only achieve a substantial increase in different competences, but also experience a leap in their personality development. Taking part in an Erasmus+ Programme improves particularly self-confidence and proactivity in young adults. The mobility is also expected to have an impact on family, friends, school staff and the cooperative companies. By being involved in a mobility project, even if it is just in a passive way, people will be more aware of the importance of the European idea and the peaceful international cooperation.

The involved companies are especially looking forward to the intense training program with the exams for the \"international businessman\" at the end of the project.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of the participants:\r\n\r\nAt each flow there will be 20 apprentices participating from mainly medium-sized wholesaler-companies. Most of them take part in the project at the beginning of their second year at school. Some of them could already participate at exchange-programs in their former schools, but up to now, they had no chance to collect job-related experiences abroad.\r\n\r\nOrganization and implementation:\r\n\r\n1. Preparation:\r\n\r\nIn the preparation we discuss with Sarah Iles (ECBM) the content of the course, adjust them with the curriculum and sign the contract with the ECBM (ECVET). We inform the companies, select the participants, determine the learning agreements (ECVET), organize the flights and the airport-transfer, conclude the insurances and prepare the participants intensively for their stay in London.\r\n\r\n2. Project:\r\nDuring the activity the ECBM will be responsible for transfers, selection of host families, the course-program, excursions and evaluations. The attending teacher will work closely with the teachers of the ECBM and secure the transfers of our students.\r\n \r\n3. Post-processing:\r\n\r\nIn the post-processing the participants will evaluate the project and present their experiences to the other students and prospective participants. So we can ensure to go on with the project and to enrich the lessons in school. They write articles for the annual report at school and the local newspapers. Additionally we will complete their EUROPASS-documents. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is our main aim, to intensify the job-related knowledge and skills on an international way and to increase the linguistic skills of the participants, to encourage their willingness to achieve life-long learning and mobility.\r\n\r\nAccording to the statements of the IHK companies are forced to raise their international activities in case of acquisition and sales.\r\nThe vocational skills of the employees should be prepared for this development.\r\nLinguistic skills in English, the international language of commerce, and knowledge of typical economic structures of an important trading-partner will be a competitive advantage for our wholesalers.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to continue and to intensify our cooperation with the ECBM. Each year shall 20 motivated apprentices take part in this project. For the involved teachers means the close cooperation with the ECBM a possibility to interchange information and ideas on an European level and to receive an insight to the global trading point London \r\nThese experiences and perceptions will be enrich the normal vocational lessons in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe ECBM project is supposed to be a further part of our strategy to internationalize our school.

The students, who train to be a bank clerk, industrial clerk or office clerk, are all in their second year of vocational training. During the course the students are able to improve their language skills in English as well as their knowledge in business administration issues.\r\n\r\nAt the college the students attend lessons every working day between 9.30 am and 4.45 pm. The lessons deal with topics which are related to their vocational training in Germany. The lessons are held by specially trained and experienced teachers from the college. In addition to the daily lessons, the participants have to write out an assignment on a special economic or social-economic topic, which is chosen by them individually. This as well as the final presentation at the end of the course, enhances the language skills immensely.\r\n\r\nConcerning project 2, 20 wholesale and retail clerk trainees take part in a two-week internship in various commercial companies. They will get a close insight into the job-related practical experience and get the chance to interchange with their British colleagues. \r\n\r\nNext to the course, the students of both projects are obliged to plan and prepare several group excursions. The group leaders decide on relevant topics and talk them over with the students during the preparation meetings. The topics are then prepared in English by the student teams, so that they can be presented by them in London respectively Bristol and the surrounding area during the group excursions. \r\n\r\nAnother major aim of the project is to enlarge the intercultural, social and individual skills of the students. They enter a new field with unknown cultural and social requirements, they learn to communicate and to cooperate with students and teachers.

So, the improvement of facilities, faculty and teaching methodology is a must. In the other hand, the students should acquire self-esteem, autonomy and responsibility.\r\n\r\nOur students will improve their academic performance, and they will become the best means to transmit the best practices from the center, and its commitment to European programs, As a result from this, it will improve their employability.

The courses at the ECBM about marketing, sales and business correspondance will round off the programme. \r\n\r\nTo sum up our plans the project will underline and support the internationalisation of our school and of our students and it rounds off our programme of work experiences abroad, international certificates and bilingual lessons.", "http://www.eurocollege.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA116-004432_1"], ["3HU", "Spedition, Gro\u00dfhandel, Industrie, B\u00fcromanagement in Europa", "European College of Business and Management", 144011.0, "We continue to organize and implement our most successful projects, we have been doing since 2012, but we are striving to add more projects with different countries and areas to boost the process of internationalisation at our school and region.\r\nWhat we have been doing so far includes the following projects:\r\n\r\n1. a,This is a learning stay of three weeeks in GB for apprentices at our partner college the \"European College of Business &     Management\". The participants come from all different departments of our college which is a pure business and commercial college.      is not an exchange program. We go there for learning purposes and get certificates of the AHK at the end and the title of \"Kaufmann International\".\r\nThe project is run in two flows:\r\n1st flow: 14.05.17 - 03.06.17\r\n2nd flow: 03.06.18 - 23.06.18\r\n\r\n1st flow: 19.05.19 - 08.06.19\r\n2nd flow: 10.05.20 - 30.05.20\r\n   b,  Aim of the project:\r\n        Participants are expected to improve their professional, linguistic, cultural skills.\r\n\r\n2. There is a learning program with our partner institution in Spain (Vic)  for 16 apprentices which takes place yearly. It is especially for freight forwarding, wholesale and industrial clerks. In the ongoing year the financial European support has already been granted till 2019. The flow will take place for the 5th time.\r\n\r\n3. There are 2 apprentices who are doing an additional 2-weeks placement with Schenker in Barcelona. It supplements the course mentioned in No.2.\r\n\r\n4. In March 2018 we organize a teacher training course for 16 teachers of our school. This is a training programme for our coleagues who are also teaching English at our institution. It will take place in the \"European College of Business & Management\" in London and will last for a week A visit is planned to the MidKent College in Kent and we hope that the colleagues can study  the vocational educational  training and apprenticeship of our neighbour country and ameliorate the knowledge about GB. They should also imprive their linguistic competences and get new ideas for didactic methods. We would like to repeat and implement this program and so we apply again for funding to do another flow in the academic year 2019/2020. We also intend to invite colleagues of other schools as well.\r\n\r\nFor the oncoming year we are planning new projects:\r\n\r\n5.We will go to Northern Ireland to Derry with 16 of our colleagues and we will visit the NorthWest Regional Col. in Derry. We hope that there will develop an exchange programme done with techers as lond as this will be possible under the white elephant of Brexit. Northernirish colleagues are kindly invited to come to our school and also visit companies in our area to get to know and learn more about our dual system.\r\n\r\n6. However, we also intend to create a new program for students of our office management department. They should attend school there as well as attending companies to see and to get to know different styles of vocational learning. We do apply for 2 flows - 1 in each year - for a number of 10 students each year. Up to now office management has always been a group which did not participate in any European programs and we would like to change this and integrate them as well and offer them possibilities to experience other cultures and get to know other traditions. We very much hope that we also will be able to host students from the NWRC to create a real exchange of students.\r\n\r\n7. We were lucky to find another new partner in the Netherlands in Alkmaar, the Horizon College. 9 teachers, 7 from our college BS4 and 2 from our neighbouring college 5 are going to Alkmaar in October to prepare a students\u00b4programme together with our partner colleagues. We intend to work out special modules where we can teach the group coming from 2 different countries a common topic which is valuable for both of them. This could be done in the frame of ECVET.\r\n\r\n8.5 apprentices from sales executive will be going to the netherlands to do a three-weeks internship in the Netherlands. Our institution is already hosting 2 students from the Netherlands to help them finding placements in our companies of freight forwarding. Sending apprentices abroad to fulfil placements is new for our school. We haven\u00b4t done this before as companies in the dual system are always reluctant to release staff to be abroad over a longer period of time. However, times have changed in favour of us and more and more enterprises seem to support a three weeks stay abroad. Our partner in the Netherl. is extremely reliable and we are convinced that our program will be successful and it will be expandable and developable.\r\n\r\nUp to now we were lucky to win and add new partnerships and we experienced a high amount of support in doing this. We have started EU-mobility programs six years ago and are developping slowly into a sort of hub and we will involve other vocational colleges in the region  via our own programs  or by giving them advise how to launch new European mobility programs", "http://www.eurocollege.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA116-004445_1"], ["3HU", "Doing Business in the English-Speaking World", "European College of Business and Management", 35885.0, "The majority of young people in Germany are trained in a scheme which is called \u201edual system\". During their training they are employed by companies which train them on the job. On one or two days of the week the young people, who are apprentices, attend a vocational school. They are eligible to be trained in order to get those skills required for a career in the envisioned business or trade. This implies to acquire English language proficiency on the job. Expecially industrial companies, logistics firms and companies in the whole sale trade need employees with these skills. Companies and employers need that type of personnel\r\nfunctioning effectively in a crosscultural environment. Our vocational school (bsnu) cannot transfer those skills completely as the curriculum only provides 45 minutes per week to train our students in English language and cross-cultural skills. According to academic studies native speakers of English can teach students, who learn English as a foreign language, more efficiently than indigenous teachers. This course aims at improving our students' professional competency as well as British culture and doing business in the United Kingdom. The course is designed for 24 participants. We will only take apprentices who attend our school and work in companies which provide business orientated training in professions like industrial clerks, logistics clerks or wholesale clerks. Sometimes we have applicants from the retail trade or students who are trained in managing warehouses. The majority of our students have an intermediate level of education. Only a small number of students have A-levels. Applying for our Erasmus+ project does not require A-levels. We recommend applying for participating in an Erasmus+ project of our school in the first or second year of their training because going to London in their final year may distract some students from preparing well for their final exams carried out by a German chamber of commerce and industry. A group of bsnu teachers and Ms Sarah lles of ECBM designed a concept and procedures for new Erasmus+ projects. We inform our students about new projects by handing out flyers and leaflets. We also put information about the projects on the bsnu website. Our teachers inform their students in the classrooms about our planned activities. We will send letters to companies which employ and train apprentices to provide information about the project. When apprentices apply for participating in our projects they must provide a written statement of their company showing they agree that their apprentice will be in London for three weeks during their regular period of vocational training. After evaluating the application forms we will choose the participants. lf a company indicates their apprentices require English and cross-cultural skills on the job in an extensive manner, those applicants will be put on a priority list. The advices and recommendations of the remaining companies and of teachers from our school, who teach those applicants, will also be considered when choosing participants. In future we will not provide any English language courses for the participants. They have to use online courses provided by Erasmus+ to improve their English proficiency. However, we will go on providing cross-cultural training and a specific training for the ECBM course in London. We will only send one group of twentyfour students to London per year. A female und a male teacher from our school will accompany the group when travelling to London. They will stay with the group in London for three weeks and will join the students on their journey back to Germany. The accompanying persons will monitor the group and their learning achievements. Ms Sarah lles and the ECBM lecturers will be in charge of the teaching and motivation of the group while the students are trained in London. After three weeks in London the participants can show in a presentation and in a written exam what they have learned. After returning from London to Germany, the participants will have to write an executive summary in English (1000 words) about the topics which they presented as a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation at ECBM. Our school will collect the participants' documents and pass them on to ECBM in London. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately a majority of British people voted that Great Britain should leave the European Union (Brexit). As we focused our international activities on the UK, we assume that after Brexit in a couple of  years there will be no EU-funded mobility projects with the UK as country of destination.

Entrepreneurship meant as a basic skill is the leit motif of our strategic plan and it will be the goal of the whole plan of activities. Other objectives are:\r\n- offering quality and variety to our teaching offer; offering job opportunities; orienteering to career; improving a sense of European and global identity; promoting innovation at school; improving linguistic competences to overcome linguistic and cultural borders; promoting mobility in Europe and in the world and allow success into the more and more fast-moving and demanding job market   \r\n- creating an updated learning environment to enable self-discovery and fulfilment, to create interest and awareness implementing CLIL methodologies; implementing a EU dimension in the school curricola and of the credit transfer system like  ECVET e EUROPASS\r\n- developing competences and skills in using new media in students and staff to fill in the gap between the teachers' and the digital natives' worlds, by creating a common language; facilitating learning with diversified paths, overcoming borders and obstacles.\r\nAccording to the VET Mobility Chart, the number of  beneficiaries will be 60 students attending the 4-5 class (catering, tourism, administration and marketing) and recent graduates of our school. The group includes disables, disadvantaged students and with learning difficulties. First learners will improve their competences in foreign language used abroad and will attend a pedagogic/professional training; after they will do a 4-week work placement to develop their field competences with a focus on fusion food and catering/tourism trends and social marketing. We will take advantage of ErasmusPro to offer 3-month mobilities to 2 recent graduates to give added value, develop job specific skills thus boosting their employability.   \r\nGiven the large number of mobilities, they will be no more restricted to excellence but offered in a systematic way to all students with good behaviour, increasing motivation and promoting school success as planned in our school mission. Our school will gain an international dimension and will convey good practises in the area. \r\nStudents will be accompanied by 1teacher given the large number of minors and disadvantaged students+ 1 extra for fluxes with  students with special needs.  \r\nThe staff mobilities will be 25 (management and school staff) to offer wider opportunities to develop competences, overcome disaffection and spread passion for teaching. The mobilities will be concentrated on jobshadowing, workshops, courses about foreign languages,  new teaching tecHniques, CLIL and exchange of good practises.\r\nOn the return, the students will organise an event to put into practise the new skills gained: the cooking team will prepare fusion dishes, the bar/service team will serve fusion cocktails and arrange new setting up,  the hospitality team will think about a suitable welcoming while the marketing staff will plan a marketing campaign to launch the event on the social media. The guests will be local authorities and representatives of local associations to give visibility to the project. The staff  will spread the new methodologies learnt in their department and in the whole school and will put into practice their new skills in their classes. Everybody will  update learning paths and will spread an international dimension at school, a dynamic, motivating climate to get success and personal fulfilment\r\nAccording to the internationalisation process, the network has been reinforced: we have chosen to keep the partners we trust and that are located in strategic markets  as well as to keep the prestigious cooperation we have with overseas partners, especially due to the project topic. We have added 3 prestigious partners: a 5-star hotel a London icon, a starred restaurant in Copenaghen and a refined restaurant in the heart of London.\r\nIndeed we believe that training should be opened to an international market to mirror the multicultural, global composition of our society. These partners give added value to our project and will let learners widen opportunities and perspectives and will offer unique trainings in destinations that are among the top-world and in luxury accommodation like the 5-star holiday resort in Turks and Caicos and Lagham Hotel.  Besides they will allow job shadowing, exchange of good practise to the staff with high quality schools/companies in the world.
