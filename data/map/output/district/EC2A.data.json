The objectives of IDEA are to understand how the presence of worm infections affect immune responses specific to HIV, TB and malaria. The effects of parasitic worms on the clinical progression of these diseases are also under study.\n\nThe IDEA Central Database was established  which unifies demographic, clinical and parasitological data and allows for centralised analysis. Meta-analysis of data obtained from HIV-TB- and malaria patients' cohorts from different sites is constantly underway.\n\nInnate, or immediate immune response elicited by worm infections has been characterised. The scientists have determined whether the worm-induced innate immune response modulates the innate and adaptive immune response to HIV, TB and malaria antigens. Preliminary results were obtained regarding immunological interplay between helminth infections and HIV- and TB-specific T cell responses.\n\nThe effects of worm infections and anti-worm treatment on incidence, clinical presentation and immune responses against worms, as well as HIV, TB and malaria have been analysed. To determine the effect of worm-infections on vaccine-induced immune responses, the researchers have started vaccine trials for HIV, TB and malaria.\n\nThe IDEA research programme has made a substantial contribution to sustained and integrated research in sub-Saharan Africa.

CRDTs allow unsynchronised concurrent updates, yet ensure data consistency. This revolutionary approach maximises responsiveness and availability; it enables locating data near its users, in decentralised clouds.<br/>Global-scale applications, such as virtual wallets, advertising platforms, social networks, online games, or collaboration networks, require consistency across distributed data items. As networked users, objects, devices, and sensors proliferate, the consistency issue is increasingly acute for the software industry. Current alternatives are both unsatisfactory: either to rely on synchronisation to ensure strong consistency, or to forfeit synchronisation and consistency altogether with ad-hoc eventual consistency. The former approach does not scale beyond a single data centre and is expensive. The latter is extremely difficult to understand, and remains error-prone, even for highly-skilled programmers.<br/>SyncFree avoids both global synchronisation and the complexities of ad-hoc eventual consistency by leveraging the formal properties of CRDTs. CRDTs are designed so that unsynchronised concurrent updates do not conflict and have well-defined semantics. By combining CRDT objects from a standard library of proven datatypes (counters, sets, graphs, sequences, etc.), large-scale distributed programming is simpler and less error-prone.

They built a laboratory prototype solvolysis reactor, identified main process parameters of interest, and set to work to identify the range of parameters leading to the best recovery of desired products.\n\nPreliminary results enabled identification of recovered components as well as testing of their properties to determine whether or not interesting materials were present and if they could be reused. During the second phase of the project, a large-scale prototype reactor was built. Solvolysis trials were initiated using parameters defined in preliminary tests and modified according to need with the new reactor. Scientists successfully recovered mineral fibres to be reused as reinforcement in new composites and small molecules from the organic phase (polymer matrix) to be used by the chemical industry. A life-cycle assessment (LCA) highlighted areas for optimisation to achieve economically feasible industrial upscaling.\n\nEurecomp demonstrated the technical feasibility of using state-of-the-art solvolysis to obtain useful fibres and chemicals from thermoset composite waste.

This is the \"Internationale Kaufmann AHK London\" in cooperation with the \"European College for Business and Management\" in London. The ECBM is the officially accredited college of the German-British Chamber of Industry & Commerce (AHK) in London.\r\n \r\nDuring this course the participants can acquire knowledge and skills on a higher level than they would during their normal apprenticeship. This will result in a better understanding of international trade and behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis Certificate can be obtained by attending and passing a 3-weekly course in London and by successfully passing the final examination of the \"Industrie- und Handelskammer\" or \"Handwerkskammer\" examination in Germany.\r\n\r\nObtaining this cerficate adds substantially to the professional background of the participants and will increase career opportunities and promotion to higher levels.\r\n\r\nThe employers encourage this programme actively by releasing their trainees from work for the duration of the course as they see the additional skills their trainees can obtain and contribute to their workplace. \r\n\r\nDuring their stay in London they will lodge with host families and commute to the ECBM. Here they will experience the real life in the English capital which is determined by permanent changes, a for Germans unfamiliar service orientation, awareness of tradition, politeness to name only a few. These experiences will have a long lasting effect on how they view other cultures.  In addition to that the international surrounding, which they will face in this multicultural city, will expand their experience and their horizon.\r\n\r\nExcursions at the weekends will, show them the other England, the quiet and relaxed life in rural areas. All this should give them a good overview of the English society. \r\n\r\nThe influence on the participants\u00b4 language skills will be considerable and will reduce the fear of using the language both orally or in writing.\r\n\r\nTeacher mobility:\r\n\r\nTeachers will improve their language skills and their understanding of international trade.\r\nThey will experience the impacts of the Brexit to England and its neighbour countries.

A not unimportant side effect is that with the \u201cKaufmann International Certificate (AHK)\u201d another formal certificate, an in Germany acknowledged document, will be reached.\r\n\r\nParticipants Group\r\nThe participants are all in initial vocational training in the dual system, or have completed the dual VET recently successful. The participants are recruited primarily from the professions bank clerks and industrial management assistants. Besides, also achievement-weaker find consideration.\r\n\r\nActivities\r\nIn addition to schooling and language support, find self-regulated learning, working on economic issues with presenting the results as well as excursions to be held in London\u2019s City based companies. The participants are nominated by training companies, which enjoy an excellent reputation for practical vocational training, but who see a clear need to improve the language skills of their trainees and future employees. In addition, a cultural program is offered with mandatory and optional elements.\r\n\r\nThe flows are planned for the following dates:\r\n1. Flow: 29. April - 19. May 2018\r\n2. Flow: 12. May - 8. June 2019\r\n\r\nIntended results and impact\r\nMeasurable results in terms of the development of language competence should be able to be derived by the repeated self-evaluation by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). With the increasing knowledge of the language and foreign experience itself the participants will be prepared to move well in an unknown environment which increases employability as well as their future chances on the labor market. The sending training companies can be sure to find an attractive and up-to-date programme in order to attract more potential job trainees.

At the same time, we have been able to involve more training companies and vocational schools (industrial and business).\r\nProject goals:\r\nOur project aims specifically at enhancing applicants\u2019 job chances through their acquisition of a further qualification. With this main goal, we are confident that participants \u2013 in addition to strengthening their self-competence - will improve their communication skills in a foreign language and will absorb new learning methods (informal and non-formal learning) thus strengthening and broadening their overall professional and political competencies. The intention of our project is to enable applicants to participate in the Erasmus+ Programme who otherwise have no such opportunity through a school or an company\r\nNumber and profiles of participants:\r\nWe have applied for 289 flows for the coming application period, the majority of which for a period of four or more weeks. Most of the participants are in a dual vocational system. Twenty of these applicants are completing their vocational education (horticulture, agriculture and home economics) in a facility for the handicapped and have special needs.\r\nDescription of project activities:\r\nThe project coordinator carries the main responsibility for preparation, operative implementation and evaluation. Specialised institutions and experts are involved when preparatory seminars are carried out. Language courses are in some instances organized by the participants themselves or \u2013 where eligible for funding \u2013 are carried out in the respective training companies or schools. These make a preselection of the applicants based on qualitative criteria. We make the final decision on the choice of the participating students.  Our policy is to leave organising accommodation in the target country and making travel arrangements to the participants themselves. We merely assume an advisory and supportive role. Schools and the training companies are involved in the wrap-up.\r\nProcedures for project realisation:\r\nAll of the participants are required to submit applications to us (motivation essay, CV etc.) and to take part in our preparatory seminars (general information about the project, EU management game). All applicants receive our brochure with detailed information about the programme. As needed, we assist in the search for partner companies. The preparatory seminars take place at various locations, depending of the participants. Those travelling alone are given individual support. During their stay, participants must prepare a weekly report which has to be sent to the project coordinator the following week by e-mail. There is a total of three evaluation questionnaires that must be completed.\r\nDescription of the targeted results and impact\r\nThe main goal of our programme is to enhance applicants\u2019 job chances through a further training qualification, which also empowers them to be tolerant and open when dealing with people from other countries as well as to be able to live and work in other countries. We are confident that these main goals will be reflected in broadened political competence in addition to the professional competencies gained. We support workers\u2019 councils in their task of improving the quality of vocational training and to disseminate Erasmus+.\r\nDescription of the anticipated long-term benefits \r\nFor training companies, sending trainees on internships is an integral part of personnel development. Through the stays in a foreign country, participants gain an important broadening of their competencies which greatly enhances their employment chances. (The majority of the flows are for four weeks or longer.)  Participants with special needs gain increased independence. Through these transfer activities/mobility measures, our organisation is able to deepen and broaden its competencies and is in a position to implement other European programmes also involved with the first steps in vocational training.

The students do an apprenticeship as a management assistant in retail business, in wholesale and foreign trade or office management assistants. In order to increase their business knowledge, intercultural experience and language skills the students attend an Intensive Course (PDP - Professional Development Programmes) that takes 3 weeks. In the courses they get an overview of British business and culture and an introduction to their specific areas of occupation and interest which can be built upon at a later stage. There are also excursions that have close relevance to the course topics, e.g. to London Stock Exchange, MINI plant in Oxford, Bosch in Denham, The Bank of England Museum or The Thames Barrier. During their stay at British guest families and in London they gain insights in British life and culture and  improve their cross-cultural competence and understanding.\r\n\r\nSecond, we sent 6 teachers to the ECBM for one week in order to do a job-shadowing, to improve their language and professional skills and to gather information.

They are eligible to be trained in order to get those skills required for a career in the envisioned business or trade. This implies to acquire English language proficiency on the job. Especially industrial companies, logistics firms and companies in the whole sale trade need employees with these skills. Companies and employers need that type of personell functioning effectively in a crosscultural environment. Our vocational school (bsnu) cannot transfer those skills completely as the curriculum only provides 45 minutes per week to train our students in English language and cross-cultural skills. According to academic studies native speakers of English can teach students, who learn English as a foreign language, more efficiently than  indigenous teachers. This course aims at improving our students\u2019 professional competency as well as British culture and doing business in the United Kingdom. The course is designed for 24 participants. We will only take apprentices who attend our school and work in companies which provide business orientated training in professions like industrial clerks, logistics clerks or wholesale clerks.

Only a small number of students have A-levels. Applying for our Erasmus+ project does not require A-levels. We recommend applying for participating in an Erasmus+ project of our school in the first or second year of their training because going to London in their final year may distract some students from preparing well for their final exams carried out by a chamber of commerce and industry. A group of bsnu teachers and Ms Sarah Iles of ECBM designed a concept and procedures for new Erasmus+ projects. We inform our students about new projects by handing out flyers and leaflets. We also put information about the projects on the bsnu website. Our teachers inform their students in the classrooms about our planned projects. We will send letters to companies which have taken apprentices to provide information about the project. When apprentices apply for participating in our project they must provide a written statement of their company showing they agree that their apprentice will be in London for three weeks during their regular period of vocational training. After evaluating the application forms we will choose the participants. If a company indicates their apprentices require English and cross-cultural skills on the job in an extensive manner, those applicants will be put on a priority list. The advices and recommendations of the remaining companies and of teachers from our school, who teach those applicants, will also be considered when choosing participants.

It concludes with a certificate of proficiency graded according to the Common European Framework of Reference and will be offered in this form in future. In addition, it serves as a basis for the planning and execution of projects with an alternative concept: two-week placements in cooperation with tried and new partners with the objective of exchanging views and experience of professional practice through company visits and discussion with all of those involved in vocational training.

As our English department expands and is strengthened through the Vocational College English Qualification at the Oldenburg Further Education Centre, Liverpool runs a particularly apposite intensive course culminating in the Cambridge Teaching Knowledge Test (TKT). Participants not only consolidate specific vocabulary, but also through teaching their main subject to the Liverpool study group explore, expand and develop didactic approaches. A parallel course offered by the established International Study Programme gives us even greater flexibility to enable our staff to acquire further qualifications.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have offered our apprentices the professional KMK English Language certificate at Level B2.
