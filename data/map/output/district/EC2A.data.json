Rotation is rather slow and coating is not through centrifugal forces. The mould is then cooled and opened and the product removed. Timing is critical. Too much time in the oven means degradation of the materials and too little means inconsistent melting and coalescence.

The objectives of IDEA are to understand how the presence of worm infections affect immune responses specific to HIV, TB and malaria. The effects of parasitic worms on the clinical progression of these diseases are also under study.\n\nThe IDEA Central Database was established  which unifies demographic, clinical and parasitological data and allows for centralised analysis. Meta-analysis of data obtained from HIV-TB- and malaria patients' cohorts from different sites is constantly underway.\n\nInnate, or immediate immune response elicited by worm infections has been characterised. The scientists have determined whether the worm-induced innate immune response modulates the innate and adaptive immune response to HIV, TB and malaria antigens. Preliminary results were obtained regarding immunological interplay between helminth infections and HIV- and TB-specific T cell responses.\n\nThe effects of worm infections and anti-worm treatment on incidence, clinical presentation and immune responses against worms, as well as HIV, TB and malaria have been analysed. To determine the effect of worm-infections on vaccine-induced immune responses, the researchers have started vaccine trials for HIV, TB and malaria.\n\nThe IDEA research programme has made a substantial contribution to sustained and integrated research in sub-Saharan Africa.

CRDTs allow unsynchronised concurrent updates, yet ensure data consistency. This revolutionary approach maximises responsiveness and availability; it enables locating data near its users, in decentralised clouds.<br/>Global-scale applications, such as virtual wallets, advertising platforms, social networks, online games, or collaboration networks, require consistency across distributed data items. As networked users, objects, devices, and sensors proliferate, the consistency issue is increasingly acute for the software industry. Current alternatives are both unsatisfactory: either to rely on synchronisation to ensure strong consistency, or to forfeit synchronisation and consistency altogether with ad-hoc eventual consistency. The former approach does not scale beyond a single data centre and is expensive. The latter is extremely difficult to understand, and remains error-prone, even for highly-skilled programmers.<br/>SyncFree avoids both global synchronisation and the complexities of ad-hoc eventual consistency by leveraging the formal properties of CRDTs. CRDTs are designed so that unsynchronised concurrent updates do not conflict and have well-defined semantics. By combining CRDT objects from a standard library of proven datatypes (counters, sets, graphs, sequences, etc.), large-scale distributed programming is simpler and less error-prone.

Scientists initiated Eurecomp to develop recycling technology to recover from the surface transport industry products of the highest possible commercial value for sustainable surface transport (SST).\n\nThe Eurecomp team identified production waste, end-of-life boats and vehicles to be the main sources of composite waste in Europe. Researchers adapted the physicochemical separation and recovery process called solvolysis. They built a laboratory prototype solvolysis reactor, identified main process parameters of interest, and set to work to identify the range of parameters leading to the best recovery of desired products.\n\nPreliminary results enabled identification of recovered components as well as testing of their properties to determine whether or not interesting materials were present and if they could be reused. During the second phase of the project, a large-scale prototype reactor was built. Solvolysis trials were initiated using parameters defined in preliminary tests and modified according to need with the new reactor. Scientists successfully recovered mineral fibres to be reused as reinforcement in new composites and small molecules from the organic phase (polymer matrix) to be used by the chemical industry. A life-cycle assessment (LCA) highlighted areas for optimisation to achieve economically feasible industrial upscaling.\n\nEurecomp demonstrated the technical feasibility of using state-of-the-art solvolysis to obtain useful fibres and chemicals from thermoset composite waste.

The iCIRRUS C-RAN introduces the use of Ethernet in the fronthaul/midhaul (for radio signal transport), to minimise cost and make available pluggable and in-device monitoring, and intelligent processing to enable self-optimizing network functions which maximise both network resource utilisation and energy efficiency. To exemplify the attractiveness of the proposition, iCIRRUS focusses on D2D communication in the wireless domain, an important work area in current standardisation, where low latency is known to be a significant factor. The latency and jitter in the iCIRRUS Ethernet-based C-RAN will be an important focus of the research work in the project, with current 5G performance targets in mind; for D2D communications, the task will be to minimise control latency and overhead. A major obstacle for C-RANs is the bit-rate of the digitised radio signals that would be required for 5G \u2013 of the order of 100 Gb/s and iCIRRUS will examine the architectural and technological questions surrounding this requirement. Wireless resource management will be investigated, together with mobile device caching and mm-wave D2D mesh networks, to reduce latency as well as load on the infrastructure.
