However situations where difficult flight conditions, system failures or cockpit crew incapacitation lead to peak workload conditions.The amount of information and actions to process may then exceed the crew capacity. Systems alleviating crew workload would improve safety.\n\nACROSS Advanced Cockpit for Reduction of StreSs and workload - will develop new applications and HMI in a cockpit concept for all crew duties from gate to gate.  Human factors, safety and certification will drive this approach. The new system will balance the crew capacity and the demand on crew resource.\n\nACROSS workload gains will be assessed by pilots and experts. A Crew Monitoring environment will monitor physiological and behavioural parameters to assess workload and stress levels of pilots. A new indicator will consolidate flight situation and aircraft status into an indicator of the need for crew resource. If this need becomes higher than available crew resource, cockpit applications and systems will adapt to the new situation :\na) Decision support: cockpit interfaces will adapt to focus crew on needed actions,\nb) Prioritisation: non-critical applications/information will be muted in favor of critical elements,\nc) Progressive automation: crew actions not directly relevant with the situation will be automated,\nd) Decision sharing: in case of persistent crisis situation, an automatic information link with the ground will be established to further assist the crew.\n\nIn extreme situation where both pilots are incapacitated, further steps will be:\na) Full automation: measures to maintain the aircraft on a safe trajectory, then reroute to nearest airport and autoland.\nb) Decision handling: mechanisms allowing ground crew to remotely fly the aircraft.\n\nACROSS groups a large team of key European stakeholders.

This is particularly important since air traffic is growing, requiring the utmost efficiency in operating an aircraft. In this vein, the EU-funded project 'Advanced cockpit for reduction of stress and workload' (http://www.across-fp7.eu (ACROSS)) is working on improving crew performance during high workload periods to upgrade safety.\n\nTo achieve its aims, the project is working on developing and testing new flight deck solutions to better manage peak workload situations during a flight and to reduce pilot stress. It is improving on cutting-edge automation systems to support the flight crew during intense workloads.\n\nACROSS is also working on novel cockpit-based technologies that enable a reduced crew to operate safely in certain conditions. This involves different scenarios such as intentional reduction of crew during long-haul flights, partial crew incapacitation and even full crew incapacitation. For example, in rare instances where a pilot may suffer from physical or psychological issues, this particular solution could be very useful.\n\nAnother important project aim is to identify challenges concerning the implementation of single-pilot operations in the future, which stands to minimise operational costs while maintaining safety standards. In this context, the team is looking at single-pilot operations as a case study that spurs innovation and solutions to raise safety standards.\n\nOverall, the tools and guidelines emerging from the project promise to increase overall safety in air transport, including possibly the avoidance of future incidents and accidents. In addition, the envisioned systems will reinforce the image of a very safe mode of transport. They will also help to reduce crew in the long run to improve cost effectiveness, providing a competitive advantage to airlines and benefiting passengers.\n\nOther benefits include enhanced primacy for the European air transport industry and new opportunities for the aviation equipment manufacturing industry. Once the project is completed, it will represent yet another valiant effort to enhance safety and strengthen Europe's leading position in the sector.", "http://www.across-fp7.eu/", null, "/docs/results/images/2015/153764.jpg", "fp7_106358_984396353"], ["3LE", "OPARUS (Open Architecture for UAV-based Surveillance System) (topic : SEC-2009.3.4.1 Continuity, coverage, performances, secure datalink)", "Tony Henley Consulting Limited", "The goal of this project is to elaborate an open architecture for the operation of unmanned air-to-ground wide area land and sea border surveillance platforms in Europe.

An EU-funded project is investigating new modes of transport based on small aircraft to change the way we travel.", "Today, the European small aircraft industry shows considerable innovation potential. Including a wide variety of enterprises, it has a market position of over 30 % in the global general aviation and utility aircraft market (excluding business jets and light-sport aircraft). Nonetheless, the cost of purchasing, maintaining and operating small aircraft hampers further growth in the near future.\n\nHowever, small air transport (SAT) could be a key enabler of regional development if it is seen as part of a multi-modal European transport system. The 'Small air transport - Roadmap' (http://sat-rdmp.eu/ (SAT-RDMP)) project was launched to respond to the challenge of establishing a new mode of transport to complement the existing air transport system. Specifically, the SAT-RDMP project aimed to enhance the commercial role that small aircraft operating on scheduled or non-scheduled flights can play.\n\nTo unlock the SAT potential, the project team defined a roadmap to develop the technologies needed to meet regulatory, safety, environmental, operational and economic requirements. By bringing relevant industries together, it managed to unite the European small aviation community, which proposed a set of research and technological development activities along the roadmap. Finally, the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking accepted the SAT-RDMP proposal and included SAT in the Clean Sky 2 programme. \n\nWithout the SAT-RDMP initiative, it would be very unlikely that small aviation industry partners could work as closely with each other as they currently do.
