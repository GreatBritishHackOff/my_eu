Since it is a water-based PTO system, the risks of oil leaks in the ocean will also be fully eliminated. The system and components developed will have a broad range of applications, from wave energy, as the main application area, to water desalinization and small hydro power generation, and will therefore benefit a European value chain of SMEs specialised in engineering and green energy generation. To achieve our objectives, we need to develop new scientific knowledge in: design of innovative system components such as a variable speed generator, an adaptative blade turbine, elastomeric structures and the overall hydraulic system; protective coatings for marine environments; modeling the ageing of elastomeric structures; and wireless controlled monitoring of offshore moving equipment. Due to the technical challenges of testing the system, there was a conscious decision to hold the activities of AQUAGEN during a 39 month period. Whilst the SMEs form a supply chain for the manufacture of the ultimate PTO system we have neither the facilities nor the resources to undertake the necessary R&D. The Research for SMEs funding instrument provides the ideal solution, allowing us to outsource the R&D to four RTD Performers \u2013 VP, NTNU, UM and CMG. The Foreground Intellectual Property (FIP) generated in the AQUAGEN project will be owned and exploited by the SMEs, envisaging several market segments and a geographical distribution of non-exclusive licenses for markets outside Europe. If the project meets its targets the SMEs will benefit from sales and licensing of the FIP to several millions of \u20ac's.", 415939.0, 1978828.0, "AQUAGEN", null, null, null, "https://sites.google.com/site/aquageneu/", "http://www.gilkes.com", null, "fp7_97520_963784338"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5AY", "Clusterprojekt f\u00fcr die Luft- und Raumfahrt", "Kendal college", 41738.0, "The cluster project for the aerospace industry has its origins in 2007. About this project and the state school board L\u00fcneburg contact the BBS Rinteln CFA Marcel Sembat in the Haute Normandie with its partner factories in Rouen in 2007 came about. In mutual visits a mutual exchange was agreed which was first successfully performed in 2008 and successfully repeated in the following years , after detailed evaluation.\r\nSubtleties in the organizational process and in the implementation were further optimized every year. The exchange project was then expanded to other locations and companies both in France and in Germany . The number of trainees was further increased . After the positive results we have been felt for the young trainees with applications in the primary labor market decided to have an exchange project with the Lower Saxony Partnerregin Andalusia in southern Spain to pursue . About the Lower Saxony Ministry of Culture of Contact for IES Antonio Salvatore in Palma del Rio , Spain was brokered in 2010 , at which there is a department of aircraft technology. After a preparatory visit a regular exchange of students was recorded and thus the cluster project for the aerospace industry to another European partner be expanded in 2012.\r\nSince 2013 there are contacts to a school with the Aviation Department in Ostend ( Belgium) , and a further Spanish partner in Madrid.\r\nAfter the BBS Rinteln has a total of almost 80 trainees from the field Flugger\u00e4technik who are able to do an internship abroad , also other department of our school have now decided to make their students abroad offers. To this end, contacts have been established to Denmark and the UK.\r\nWe ship trainees from the dual vocational training , usually from the second or third year . For those 18 to 20 years old students , we offer the opportunity to the well-founded and recognized training in Germany to complement an international component . Thus, the technical skills to have the ability in a foreign language environment to work with foreign colleagues have been extended successfully . Proven to enhance the chances of apprentices in the labor market after they were able to gather these experiences abroad. It results in addition to many new impressions and technical procedures and a significant increase in self-confidence and self-esteem.\r\nIn addition to technical skills , we have agreed with our foreign partners, an extensive cultural program , so that students will also get a taste of other cultures and ideas about life . The statement \" The work quite differently than we do and achieve results of their work anyway,\" I have often heard of trainees and also strikes me as a very important result of foreign activities .\r\nThrough constant exchange of visits with a detailed evaluation of the activities and experiences following the internships we have reached a very high standard for training abroad. This also applies to the new partnerships that we want to establish .\r\nSince we have been praised several times in recent years by the national agency with a \"Good Practice Award \" Our project has acquired a very good reputation in Lower Saxony to in Ministry of Culture and also up in industry-related circles . This is reflected in the request for presentations , for example, at events of Lower Saxonie Aviation , the trade association for the aerospace industry in Lower Saxony. I was also invited to meetings of the EACP Skills Hub with the theme  \"Understanding qualification certificates and competences in MRO and manufacturing\" in Europa. Working groups of Germany , Belgium , Spain, Turkey, Italy, were invited and I was asked to cooperate. \r\nThus, there are in addition to the considerable extension of competence of the trainees who always come first, of course, also far-reaching contacts up to all of Europe. So we also have the opportunity to represent our know-how in Europe and to participate in the standardization of training standards for aviation in Europe.", "http://www.kendal.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003570_4"], ["5AY", "Auslandspraktikum f\u00fcr Sch\u00fcler/-innen und Berufsbildungspersonal der Berufsbildenden Schulen", "Kendal college", 121026.0, "The main objective is to give the participants the opportunity to acquire additional skills (knowledge, skills and attitudes) abroad. This not only encourages the personal development of the learners, but also improves their employment opportunities on the (European) labor market, which counteracts the unemployment of many young people. This allows the Elisabeth-Selbert School to support the professional development of young people and to promote the quality of teaching, training and learning.\r\nIn the framework of this project the participants will recognize and evaluate the differences in vocational education and training systems, provide practical skills and supplement them, and initiate sensitization to other cultures, flexibility and self-employment. The work in other training enterprises or social institutions creates the possibility for participants to get to know new and / or other working methods, which they can apply and pass on afterwards. This underpins the workspace of the participants, makes the participants safer and more open to new trends and methods. In particular, catering professionals require local flexibility so that the first steps in the project are crucial for their future professional career.\r\nThe self-understanding of dealing with foreign people, with foreign cultures, which is expected in the services of gastronomy and personal care, can only be promoted by an internship abroad. In the TN of the Healing Disability / Personal Assistance and Care Assistance, an important role is played by the fact that elderly disabled people hardly exist and thus new experiences with these target groups can be mediated.\r\nCompleting or practicing an internship strengthens self-esteem and gives the participants their own personality. In the home country itself, the knowledge and experience gained and the critical examination of different training procedures are passed on. The intercultural aspect will be the focus of the pupils of the Fachschule Sozialp\u00e4dagogik, which is very personal. The language of the host country does not understand and does not speak makes sensitive to the emotional condition of people with similar background. With regard to the parents' work in children's day-care centers with families with an immigration background and the educational work with the children, this understanding creates a cultural openness which can only be positively expressed in the corresponding implementation of pedagogical measures, A contact with children with gestures and facial expressions, with pantomimic signs, creates a sensitivity for observations of behaviors of other people, which can only be experienced in such situations and often can not be mediated in this intensity. This experience creates a great empathy for the participants in the field of social pedagogy in professional fields, where people are very linguistically limited and other ways of communication have to be found.\r\nIn some areas of this project the foreign language skills of the participants can be improved.\r\nThe criteria of the quality assurance of learning abroad abroad will in future be the orientation to learning outcomes and the understanding of the partner institutions (Memorandum of Understanding). This enables us to ensure the recognition of the acquired learning outcomes and competences. This requires that all stakeholders - including the learners - have a concrete idea of \u200b\u200bwhat is learned and how this is to be recorded. Documented in Europass mobility, these learning results can then be validated and calculated in the home country.\r\nThe use of the standardized ECVET instruments (Memorandum of Understandanding / Learning Standards / Europass) facilitates the implementation of quality-assured mobility.\r\nThe desire to expand the circle of participants by already educated educators of the district of Hameln-Pyrmont on the Erasmus exchange to Trontheim, Norway, organized by the ESS for years, lies in the widening of the viewpoints by other concepts of the PISA winners with regard to early childhood education and support systems.", "http://www.kendal.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003853_12"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LA9"}
