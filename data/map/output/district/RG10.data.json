The goal is to enable a 'Virtual Film Factory' in which creative professionals can work together to create and customise programmes from Petabyte-scale digital repositories, using semantic technologies to organise data and drive its processing. By separating metadata from essence, controlling all the image and sound processing operations from the metadata layer, we can maintain the underlying data library unchanged while enabling a new generation of more flexible applications. This will radically reduce the amount of data created: new versions, grades, or language releases only result in additional metadata, not new data files. The system will support a more automated workflow for content distribution from postproduction to the assembly, distribution and playout of multiple variations of programmes in different formats and locations. Outcomes will be:\\tAn infrastructure in which multi-Petabye data stores are managed by persistent metadata in a distributed metadatabase.\\tReal-time interaction with media sequences selected from the data store. When a sequence is changed, by an application, the commands are stored as a new set of metadata. The data remains unchanged in the store, but viewing and listening sequences are rendered 'on the fly. Semantic instruction sets to define associations between sequences of essence, the processes applied, and the uses to which they are put.

The CoSIE project contributes to democratic dimensions and social inclusion through co-creating public services by engaging diverse citizen groups and stakeholders. Utilizing blended data sources (open data, social media) with innovative deployment of ICT (data-analytics, Living Lab, Community reporting) in nine pilots, the project introduces the culture of experiments that encompasses various stakeholders for co-creating service innovations. \nThe CoSIE project has two overarching aims: i) advance the active shaping of service priorities by end users and their informal support networks, ii) engage citizens, especially groups often called \u2018hard to reach\u2019, in the collaborative design of public services. The aims are divided into six objectives: 1) develop practical resources grounded in asset based knowledge to support new ways for public service actors to re-define operational processes, 2) produce and deliver nine real-life pilots to co-create a set of relational public services with various combinations of public sector, civil society and commercial actors, 3) draw together cross-cutting lessons from pilots and utilise innovative visualisation methods to share and validate new ideas and models of good governance, 4) apply innovative approaches appropriate to local contexts and user groups to gather the necessary user insight to co-create services, 5) ensure sustainability by establishing local trainers for animating dialogue and collating user voice, embedded in community networks, 6) mobilise new knowledge from piloting and validating by creating an accessible, user friendly roadmap to co-creation for service providers and their partners.\n\nThe project will be implemented as a joint venture with 24 partners from 10 EU countries.", 77439.0, 4329190.0, "CoSIE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_212384_915581255"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["9JU", "INTERSERVE INVESTMENTS LIMITED", 77396.0, "Fostering inclusive, innovative and reflective European societies (09.04.03.02)", "fts_2017_8645", 2017], ["9QR", "ACCORD TRADE UNION*", 363.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_19958", 2017], ["9QR", "ACCORD TRADE UNION*", 909.0, "Other management expenditure (12.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_33127", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "RG10"}
