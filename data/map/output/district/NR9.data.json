The most commonly available renewable energy sources are hydro, biomass, PV, CSP, Wind, Geothermal & Wave power. Of  these wind is increasingly becoming cost competitive and the cost of wind turbines are dropping as volumes increase. This proposal deals with distributed energy production by small to medium wind turbines in the 10kW-100kW range, used immediately close to the point of power production\nWind energy conversion is a long standing process that has been employed for hundreds of years, but it is complicated and difficult to capture the maximum possible amount of power at any given point in time. The amount of power output from a WECS depends upon the accuracy with which the peak power points are tracked by the MPPT controller of the WECS control system regardless of the generator type.\nFor any wind turbine the maximum point of the power curve occurs at a particular rotor speed for a given wind speed. Even a small variation from this rotor speed will cause a significant decrease in the power extracted from the wind. Rotor speed, for a given wind speed, is dependent upon generator loading as well as the fluctuation in the wind speed. Power extraction strategies assess the wind conditions and then introduce control actions to adjust the turbine\u2019s rotational speed so that it will operate at the turbine\u2019s highest aerodynamic efficiency. Conversion strategies that have not been optimised can lead to significant wasted wind energy.\nThere have been many attempts to achieve maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms but these have not been successfully translated from academic studies to reliable working industrial implementations in our power range. The focus of this project is to produce an industrial solution that works reliably and can be employed without needing expert users.", 9718.0, 1232907.0, "OPTIWIND", "More efficient wind power", "Wind-powered electricity generation is still inefficient. An EU project will improve efficiency, and energy output, with a new algorithm for matching turbine speed to given wind conditions.", "EU-28 Member States are legally obliged to incorporate a percentage of renewable energy into their power consumption before 2020. Several options are available, of which wind power is the most cost effective in spite of persistent inefficiencies.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'Optimum power extraction of wind energy by small to medium scale wind turbines' (http://www.opti-wind.eu (OPTIWIND)) aimed to address wind energy conversion (WEC). WEC relates to the electrical power output from a given wind speed. The process depends on the accuracy with which peak power points are tracked by a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller. Such controllers assess wind conditions and adjust the turbine speed to convert the maximum wind energy to turbine rotation. Sub-optimal conversion results in wasted wind energy.\n\nNone of the many previously attempted MPPT algorithms have been successfully translated to reliable industrial operation. The seven-member OPTIWIND consortium aims to produce an effective solution and without needing expert users. The three-year project will conclude in January 2015.\n\nTo date, the project partners have coordinated to determine the best course of action. The discussion has yielded specifications, hardware standards, software and physical interface requirements, and a detailed study of algorithm types and capabilities.\n\nThe project should result in a practical MPPT algorithm that will translate to more energy-efficient and cost-effective wind turbines, meaning opportunities for business and greener power for Europe.", null, "http://www.windcrop.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/146916.jpg", "fp7_105695_953531050"], ["5BZ", "Integrated Weed Management: PRActical Implementation and Solutions for Europe", "Anglia Farmers Limited", "IWMPRAISE aims to support the implementation of Integrated Weed Management (IWM).

The aim is to give the students the needed knowledge to succeed in the labor market  and increase the quality of the school\u2019s trainings. \r\n\r\nContinuing the international strategy from last years an important purpose of the project is still the development of the general vocational methods, to involve the methodological elements, required by the challanges in the modern age, in the pedagological culture of the school. During the mobilities the participating collegues get to know the pedagological practices and vocational training methods which could be used in every field and level. One of our most important aim is to collect positive examples for the work of dual-system VET, observe the different implementation techniques in different institutions and also get to know the way and methods, best practices of dealing with a multicultural and colourful community in the school, handling the conflicts inside the VET schools comming from these differences between students.\r\n\r\nWe have chosen the destination countries based on their added value for our pedagological aims. Portugal is the home of dual vocational training, in Turkey education provides high quality reintegration in the vocational education for underpriviliged children while dealing with the difficulties of religious, ethnic and national variety.\r\n\r\nThe student's activities were developed to support every professional field of our school, and to provide the best technological way of production with the most respectful traditions. This makes our students to achieve high standard levels during their professional mobilities and it helps them to keep motivation also on a different level during their study period. Through better motivation they can develope their own personal, social and professional competencies and they will be able to adapt to the life of work and life long learning. \r\nTThis year we identified all the learning outcomes of the different mobilites, what kind of skills and competences can a student achieve during a mobilty period. In the same time we identified those skills what the teachers can develop during a mobility program, and the effects of the implementation. The ECVET method is the biggest development from last year and we try to mesure not just the formal, but the informal and the non-formal learning outcomes in same time. This gives a bigger role to the accompagning teachers and also for thoose who will validate the different units in the national education system, but they will see the effects also.\r\nWe agreed with all partners in the learning units and before the program we will make the memorandum of understanding and the learning agreements what we are planning to renew and develop each year.", "http://www.eastonotley.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-HU01-KA102-035160_1"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["5BZ", "ANGLIA FARMERS LIMITED", 14526.0, "Securing sufficient supplies of safe and high quality food and other bio-based products (05.09.03.01)", "fts_2017_4817", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "NR9"}
