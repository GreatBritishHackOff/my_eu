The most commonly available renewable energy sources are hydro, biomass, PV, CSP, Wind, Geothermal & Wave power. Of  these wind is increasingly becoming cost competitive and the cost of wind turbines are dropping as volumes increase. This proposal deals with distributed energy production by small to medium wind turbines in the 10kW-100kW range, used immediately close to the point of power production\nWind energy conversion is a long standing process that has been employed for hundreds of years, but it is complicated and difficult to capture the maximum possible amount of power at any given point in time. The amount of power output from a WECS depends upon the accuracy with which the peak power points are tracked by the MPPT controller of the WECS control system regardless of the generator type.\nFor any wind turbine the maximum point of the power curve occurs at a particular rotor speed for a given wind speed. Even a small variation from this rotor speed will cause a significant decrease in the power extracted from the wind. Rotor speed, for a given wind speed, is dependent upon generator loading as well as the fluctuation in the wind speed. Power extraction strategies assess the wind conditions and then introduce control actions to adjust the turbine\u2019s rotational speed so that it will operate at the turbine\u2019s highest aerodynamic efficiency. Conversion strategies that have not been optimised can lead to significant wasted wind energy.\nThere have been many attempts to achieve maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms but these have not been successfully translated from academic studies to reliable working industrial implementations in our power range. The focus of this project is to produce an industrial solution that works reliably and can be employed without needing expert users.", 9718.0, 1232907.0, "OPTIWIND", "More efficient wind power", "Wind-powered electricity generation is still inefficient. An EU project will improve efficiency, and energy output, with a new algorithm for matching turbine speed to given wind conditions.", "EU-28 Member States are legally obliged to incorporate a percentage of renewable energy into their power consumption before 2020. Several options are available, of which wind power is the most cost effective in spite of persistent inefficiencies.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'Optimum power extraction of wind energy by small to medium scale wind turbines' (http://www.opti-wind.eu (OPTIWIND)) aimed to address wind energy conversion (WEC). WEC relates to the electrical power output from a given wind speed. The process depends on the accuracy with which peak power points are tracked by a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller. Such controllers assess wind conditions and adjust the turbine speed to convert the maximum wind energy to turbine rotation. Sub-optimal conversion results in wasted wind energy.\n\nNone of the many previously attempted MPPT algorithms have been successfully translated to reliable industrial operation. The seven-member OPTIWIND consortium aims to produce an effective solution and without needing expert users. The three-year project will conclude in January 2015.\n\nTo date, the project partners have coordinated to determine the best course of action. The discussion has yielded specifications, hardware standards, software and physical interface requirements, and a detailed study of algorithm types and capabilities.\n\nThe project should result in a practical MPPT algorithm that will translate to more energy-efficient and cost-effective wind turbines, meaning opportunities for business and greener power for Europe.", null, "http://www.windcrop.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/146916.jpg", "fp7_105695_953531050"], ["5BZ", "Integrated Weed Management: PRActical Implementation and Solutions for Europe", "Anglia Farmers Limited", "IWMPRAISE aims to support the implementation of Integrated Weed Management (IWM). IWMPRAISE will demonstrate that adoption of IWM supports more sustainable cropping systems both agronomically and environmentally, which are resilient to external impacts without jeopardising profitability or the steady supply of food, feed and biomaterials. IWMPRAISE aims to develop, test and assess management strategies delivered across whole cropping systems for four contrasting management scenarios representing typical crops in Europe. The specific objectives are to 1) quantify and address current socio-economic and agronomic barriers to the uptake of IWM 2) develop and optimise novel alternative weed control methods and create a \u2018tool box\u2019 of validated IWM methods 3) design, demonstrate and assess the performance and environmental and economic sustainability of IWM strategies and 4) make results available to end users. The development of IWM strategies are supported by WPs delivering practical knowledge and tools as well as knowledge and tools for assessing and disseminating the strategies, ensuring a vertical integration of the project. One WP is devoted to to the complex interaction between soil tillage, weed management and soil fertility. IWMPRAISE provides advances beyond the state-of-the-art within several areas ensuring that the overall goal of the project, to provide practical solutions to the end users, will be fulfilled. IWMPRAISE combines activities centred around R & D providing the tools for developing IWM strategies with activities that adopt the \u201cinteraction innovation model\u201d involving end users and other actors in a partnership with public research institutes and private SMEs adopting a truly multi-actor approach.
