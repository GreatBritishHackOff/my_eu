It is our job as educators to prepare pupils to modern-day society as much as we can. Our school\u2019s mission (translated from Dutch) is \u00ab great in learning and living \u00bb. We are continually making an introspection as to whether we are embracing the new developments in our education and whether we do this in a progressive manner. The parents of our students acknowledge this mission. To us, it\u2019s clear that ICT-developments make way for the renewal of our teaching. We strive to create a contemporary and challenging learning environment. That is why we\u2019re aiming at growing into a digital school of the 21st century. \r\n\r\nAlong with this ambition, we at the same time would like to find out how ICT can support our inclusion students. We would like to explore ways in which we can optimize helping students with learning disorders or other special needs. Moreover, it will be a challenge to make infrastructural adjustments to our existing classrooms but also incorporate modern facilities in the design of the new building yet to be constructed. That way we can organize our teaching according to contemporary and modern standards.\r\n\r\nICT will steadily occupy an increasingly prominent position in our teaching practice. On the one hand, we are stimulated by the fact that a huge number of teachers and students experience success in using ICT in the classroom. On the other hand, we observe that the media literacy and ICT competencies of our teachers show some room for improvement. The strategic planning exercise that our school did in 2015-16, taught us, amongst others, that students as well as teachers and stakeholders found that the focus on ICT use in a classroom context would improve our education\u2019s efficiency. Therefore, our main strategic priority for the years to come is the integrated use of digital learning tools in a classroom context, aiming at a higher learning efficiency among students and at a better preparation for life and learning in a digital world. That is, needless to say, also our goal in this KA1-project.\r\n\r\nEvery teacher has had a personal iPad at his/her disposal since December 2016. The introduction for pupils, on the other hand, will happen gradually from September 2017. \r\n\r\nOur teachers need examples of best practice and an advanced and specialised training. Our leadership team and staff coordinate the iPad\u2019s introduction and implementation in the classroom. It is our aim to get inspired by the schools that already have the know-how available.\r\n\r\nBy following an in-service training course and by carrying out job shadowing on various locations around Europe, we can offer a solution to our needs. 12 teachers and 3 school board members will participate in a structured course. 12 teachers, 2 board members, 1 staff member and 2 ICT coordinators will carry out job shadowing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat way, we can provide teachers who gradually and thoughtfully integrate ICT in their classes. We are convinced that this can make learning more fun and profitable, which automatically will lead to higher qualification and/or chances of success. Furthermore, experience shows that the collaboration with other European schools and colleagues will continue after this project as well and that we will continue learning from each other.", "http://www.deferrers.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-BE02-KA101-046764_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DE13"}
