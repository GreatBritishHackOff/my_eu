The approach uses an immersive game that introduces young people to a stealth learning setting. The course is focused on preparing youth workers for implementing ERA (European Roleplay Approach).\r\nAt the same time the project partners see the project as a way to try out spreading the role-playing methods through a training course (since they have never done it before) and benefit from exchanging experiences between different countries. \r\nThe partners are very active in creating and developing game approaches for young people and have run three youth exchange events in which they used ERA and focused on intercultural learning. The overwhelming success and high demand have encouraged the partners to explore the learning through role-playing approach further.\r\nThe approach is used as a game that runs over several hours. Youths create heroes who attempt to accomplish tasks in an exciting setting, often set in the cultural background of a certain country. For instance, in the youth events we have tried a Norse mythology background, a Greek mythology background, and a Sami mythology background. Since different heroes have different skills and knowledge, cooperation is the key to overcoming the obstacles and successfully completing the game. Youth workers usually have the role of preparing the adventure in advance and take on the role of game directors during the event. They  describe the adventure as a story in which the players, working in teams, can decide what their heroes do and say, so that they influence the direction of the storyline. The game can be played both inside and outside, making it possible for the teams to go on long walks and play in nature. The game does not involve computers, and it is designed on purpose to get youths away from computers and engage in social dialogue.\r\nIn this event the focus will lie on the Arthurian Legends and the value system. The game world will be a world of valiant knights who keep the country safe from harm which is a great setting to explore values of society and create conflicts through the game which touch on the personal value systems of youths. For instance, the question of honour can be raised when honour becomes the source of conflicts.", "http://www.seaxandsorcery.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-DE04-KA105-015439_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "RM18"}
