To achieve this, EPAD will also provide the analytical infrastructure to make correct observations regarding an intervention\u2019s value as an agent for secondary prevention. All this must exist in the right ethical, legal and social context. It must also be sustainable by being of value to numerous partners and stakeholders in the long term. The EPAD Consortium has been carefully designed to achieve the aim of secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nCurrent and recent drug development programmes in AD have been limited through the collection of heterogeneous samples of patients with advanced brain disease and an inability to measure effectively an index of disease course modification.\nRecruiting participants from clinics and the community for AD prevention trials with limited clinical background is both a risky and cost-inefficient strategy. Creating a disease register of people consented to enter secondary prevention trials delivers a degree of readiness that ensures better knowledge of a participants suitability and a more rapid throughput of screening for the trials.

Chronic bacterial pulmonary infection leading to an irreversible decline in lung structure and function is the main cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with CF, with more than 95% of deaths due to respiratory failure. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is the most frequently isolated pathogen, chronically infecting up to 80% of adult patients. When this occurs patients require lifelong inhaled antibiotic therapy, which although onerous to take, has been fundamental in increasing life expectancy by suppressing infection, reducing exacerbations and preserving lung function in CF patients chronically infected with Pa. Studies employing enhanced culture techniques and culture-independent molecular approaches have recently shown that the lungs of CF patients harbour diverse polymicrobial communities, the \u201cmicrobiome\u201d. Other Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria (GNnF), including Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and bacteria from the genera Burkholderia, Achromobacter, Acinetobacter, Ralstonia and Pandoraea may be present and contribute to disease. Moreover, Burkholderia cenocepacia is associated with rapid deterioration of lung function and poor clinical outcome.  \n\nEstimates for the prevalence of non-CF bronchiectasis (BE) range from 4 per 100 000 in young adults to nearly 300 per 100,000 in persons 75 years and older in developed countries.

Chronic infection with Pa affects 12\u201327% of adults with BE and is associated with an increased exacerbation frequency, an accelerated decline in lung function, hospital admissions and increased mortality. There is a direct relationship between bacterial load, airway inflammation and risk of exacerbation supporting the use of long-term administration of inhaled antibiotics in BE. \n\nCurrently, a limited number of inhaled antimicrobials are available for use in CF with no antibiotics approved to treat lung infection in patients with BE. As median predicted survival of CF birth cohorts is now greater than 40 years, adherence to consensus treatment guidelines requires that chronically infected patients are treated for decades with inhaled antimicrobials. Furthermore, bacteria causing respiratory infection are becoming progressively more resistant to conventional antibiotics with up to 45% of CF patients colonised with multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens.

I propose to image the activity of genetically-defined types of neurons in layers 2/3 and 4, during and after induction of long-term plasticity by repetitive presentation of a given visual stimulus.

How does experience alter the functional properties of synapses and dendritic integration in excitatory neurons?\n3. How does experience alter synaptic inputs and dendritic integration in inhibitory neurons?\n4.

Disease resistance and production efficiency are genetically improved through detailed phenotyping and advanced genomic technologies. The economic impact and producers\u2019 perceptions will be assessed for the recommendations for each of the species. 14 well-recognised RTD participants in Europe on aquaculture breeding will collaborate in a five year comprehensive research project with 7 SMEs, 4 large industries and 1 NGO throughout Europe that are in the lead of the development of their species\u2019 breeding programmes or are vectors between industry and RTD. A mixture of low and high-tech technological advances depending on current capacities of the species will be developed to move each species\u2019 breeding program to the next level. This step-change advance will facilitate balanced and sustainable breeding programmes applying a wide set of traits, breeding tools and technologies.

Existing motion synthesis algorithms are severely limited in their ability to cope with real-world objects such as flexible objects or objects with many degrees of freedom. The high dimensionality of the state and action space of such objects defies existing methods for perception, control and planning and leads to poor generalisability of solutions in such domains. These limitations are a core obstacle of current robotic research.We propose to solve these problems by learning and exploiting appropriate topological representations and testing them on challenging domains of flexible, multi-object manipulation and close contact robot control and computer animation. Topological representations describe motion in terms of more abstract, more appropriate, and better generalizing features: for instance, an embracing motion can better be described, controlled and planned in coordinates quantifying the `wrappedness' of arms or fingers around the object (as opposed to joint angle coordinates). Such topological representations exist on different levels of abstraction and reduce the dimensionality of the state and action spaces. This proposal investigates existing topological metrics (similar to the mentioned `wrappedness') and uses data driven methods to discover new mappings that capture key invariances. Given topological representations, we will develop methods for sensing, control and planning using on these representations.This proposal, for the first time, aims to achieve this at all the three levels of sensing, representation and action generation -- by developing novel object-action representations for sensing based on manipulation manifolds and refining metamorphic manipulator design in a complete cycle.

In HARP, we plan to bring distributed multi-antenna wireless access to reality by combining two powerful emerging technologies: 1) remote radio heads (RRHs), which allow for widely geographically distributed access via radio-over-fibre connections to a central base station; and 2) electronically steerable passive array radiators (ESPARs), which provide multi-antenna-like functionality with a single active RF chain only.

Long-term differences in ability coupled with screening frictions are proposed as the main reason for mismatch, for mobility, and for the presence of unemployment.\n\nThe proposal is based on novel empirical observations on occupational mobility.

This happens even within firms, and after excluding managerial positions.\n\nMost work on selection assumes that low-earners leave. This data suggest a novel angle: Workers have a long-term type that affects productivity in their current and in new occupations. They might accumulate human capital, but also their baseline ability is imperfectly known. Unexpectedly low performers (low-wage workers) have to leave towards less demanding tasks, while high performers change to more demanding tasks. This consistently accounts for the observed selection patterns.\n\nWhen workers know more about their ability than new firms, this also explains unemployment: firms spend efforts on screening, and impose costs on workers to induce them to self-select.

In this context they created a public virus bank that included European, Asian and American isolates encompassing both virus genotypes.\n\nPartners sequenced and characterised a number of PRRSV strains with different genotypes and subtypes. For diagnosis, the majority of available PRRSV kits were validated using particular virus subtypes most common in Europe. However, these kits may not be as sensitive for detecting other virus subtypes, emphasising the need for continuously monitoring PRRSV genetic diversity and evaluating diagnostic tests. Ultimately, results revealed that a combination of techniques including serological analysis could prove to be more effective for PRRSV detection.\n\nA currently available vaccine generated against subtype 1 was found to offer partial protection against the highly pathogenic PRRSV subtypes of Eastern Europe. Significant effort was devoted to the development of new vaccines capable of boosting PRRSV-specific humoral immunity and reducing virus load in piglets.\n\nTo further facilitate the design of novel vaccines, scientists performed virulence analysis and identified two implicated genes, which could be targeted to attenuate the virus. In addition, they investigated the pathogenesis of congenital infection and measures that could prevent infection of foetuses. To this end, they found one attenuated vaccine capable of protecting piglets against lethal challenge.\n\nOverall, the activities of the PORRSCON project have alerted authorities about PRRSV transmission through international animal trade.

As a result, HPC software developers are also experts in parallel performance analysis and performance optimisation. The Embedded systems sector on the other hand excels in its management of energy usage because they are often constrained by fixed power and energy budgets. The strengths of one sector are the relative weakness of the other: power management and power efficiency in HPC are in their infancy, but they are becoming increasingly important with HPC systems requiring more and more power; and while continuing to be constrained by energy and power budgets, recent advances in low-power multi-core processors have widened the choice of hardware architectures for Embedded systems and are increasingly forcing Embedded programmers to use parallel computing techniques that are more familiar to HPC programmers.<br/>ADEPT will investigate the implications of parallelism in programming models and algorithms, as well as choice of hardware, on energy and power consumption.

Vaccine potential of these parasite surface antigens is often supported by epidemiological data, and by the ability to induce specific antibodies or potential protective responses in animals and later, in humans. Individual groups have developed assays within the context of the vaccine discovery efforts, with identification of measurable processes for parasite growth and virulence to test specific antigens. In-house assays are strain, stage and even process specific and the ability to compare results between different candidates is further limited by diverse methodologies and assay components such as parasites, cells and reagents. The absence of some level of harmonization of practices also makes interpreting the meaning and relevance of vaccine research outcomes complex. Lack of an enabling environment for comparability of research results generated in different labs could unfortunately lead to scepticism of the results that in turn generate uncertainty about the efficacy of the vaccines and rationale of the development pathway. To compare the relative merits of different candidate vaccines and approaches in a credible and informed manner, efforts must be made to create this enabling environment by supporting the development of a baseline level of standardization around key assays that can be utilized a) in the evaluation of malaria vaccines, and b) throughout the Development process.

In vertebrates, chromosomal regions with low gene-density, and that are less transcribed, are located close to the nuclear periphery. Correlations have also been made between the transcriptional state of some genes and their location near the nuclear periphery. For example, the proneural Mash1 gene relocates away from the nuclear periphery when it is activated during neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Recently, the host laboratory demonstrated that the nuclear periphery plays a direct role in gene repression by experimentally relocating genomic loci to the nuclear envelope. A crucial issue is whether this nuclear reorganisation is important for correct differentiation and development. To do this I will impair the relocation of Mash1 in ES cells by tethering it to the nuclear envelope with the lacO/lacI-lap2b system set up in the host laboratory. The consequences of this anchoring on Mash1 transcription and neural cell differentiation will be assessed. I also propose to investigate the mechanism of Mash1 relocation. First I will determine whether the nuclear position of Mash1 influences its chromatin state, by establishing the histone modifications of the locus, when tethered or not. Then I will address whether nuclear reorganisation is an active or passive process. In live cells, I will track the position of the lacO tagged Mash1 visualized with lacI fused to GFP, during neural differentiation. Finally, I will determine the endogenous pathways that retain specific loci at the nuclear periphery. I will perform two high-throughput screens on a human cell line established in the lab where a peripheral locus is visualized by laco/lacI-GFP.

Considering the rapidly ageing European population and the resulting increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases, there is an urgent need to address the risk presented by nanoparticles towards neurodegenerative diseases. It is believed that nanoparticles can pass through the blood-brain barrier. Once in the brain, nanoparticles have two potential major effects. They can induce oxidative activity (production of Reactive Oxygen Species), and can induce anomalous protein aggregation behaviour (fibrillation). There are multiple disease targets for the nanoparticles, including all of the known fibrillation diseases (e.g. Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases).

We will then model the thermo-mechanical behaviour of these vessels.\nDifferent applications will be considered: automotive application, stationary application, transportable cylinders, bundles and tube trailers. A risk analysis will be conducted for each application leading to the definition of optimised safety strategies.\nThe main outputs of the project will be recommendations for Regulation Codes and Standards regarding the qualification of high-pressure composite storage and sizing of its protections.\nThe FireComp project brings together partners from diverse expertise: a GCH (Gaseous Compressed Hydrogen) technology integrator as a coordinator (AIR LIQUIDE), a pressure vessel supplier (HEXAGON), a leading actor in international Standards, Codes and Regulations development (HSL), experts in industrial risks (INERIS), experts in thermal radiation and mechanical behaviour of the composite (CNRS (Pprime & LEMTA), LMS Samtech), experts in thermal degradation and combustion of composites, numerical simulation (Edinburgh University and LMS Samtech) and an expert in European R&D collaborative project management (ALMA).", 169350.0, 2777783.0, "FIRECOMP", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ed.ac.uk", null, "fp7_109427_999974941"], ["9YL", "Spatial Analysis of Rural Development Measures", "The University of Edinburgh", "The aim of the SPARD project is to develop a modelling tool that will help policy-makers to understand the causal relationships between rural development measures and their results in a spatial dimension.

The consortium was established and based on existing collaborations from established initiatives through the FP5 project BioHab.\n\nThere are four major products arising from EBONE. Firstly, the European Habitat Classification developed as general habitat categories (GHCs) for cost effective in situ habitat monitoring for the EU Habitats Directive reporting and Aichi targets, for example.  Secondly, providing a consistent stratification of the terrestrial parts of the globe in 125 strata, the Global Environmental Stratification will allow cost efficient global biodiversity observation.\n\nThe EBONE project data  has helped populate a habitat database so European habitat and species data from new field observations can be merged with existing surveys (such as the Swedish NILS survey and the British Countryside survey) for better and cost-effective European reporting. Lastly, remote sensing approaches such as 'Interferometry Detection and Ranging' LiDAR can be tested and used for local habitat mapping and testing of phenology indicators.\n\nEBONE mapping is three times faster than traditional vegetation mapping methods used before; this allows researchers and agencies reduce to costs considerably. Good correlation of GHCs with species composition is attainable, but not yet with species richness. By using GHCs, EBONE researchers were able to get a good correlation between several remote sensing (RS) categories and in situ habitat data.\n\nThe Global Environmental Stratification has been developed as one of the GEO deliverables and it is already applied in the Digital Observatory for Protected Areas (DOPA) and in the Himalayas for setting up an environmental monitoring system in the border region of India, Nepal and China.

In the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, chromatin exists in an unusual configuration with apparently widely dispersed open chromatin fibres. Following implantation at the epiblast stage, several hundreds of genes relocate to the nuclear periphery, concomitant with the formation of large domains of heterochromatin there.

Using a biosynthetic approach of force-targeting CENH3 in Drosophila to non-centromeric DNA, we were able to induce centromere function and demonstrate that CENH3 is sufficient to determine centromere identity.

One of the major difficulties is that often the proteins involved are extremely flexible and readily change shape, which greatly complicates efforts to find small molecule ligands of matching shape. In this project, we aim to exploit protein flexibility to create new opportunities for drug discovery.\n\nInteractions between a given pair of proteins commonly requires one or both partners to transiently form pockets that allow selective binding. Therefore, most protein interfaces likely possess many more binding pockets than those apparent in the static picture of a protein structure revealed by crystallographic experiments. We propose to identify these 'hidden' pockets using computational methods. Thus, we will develop and validate molecular simulation methodologies to detect hidden pockets at protein interfaces and assess their small molecule 'druggability' using docking calculations and binding site scoring functions. Such capacity would greatly strengthen the reliability of in silico drug design. We will perform virtual screens to find small molecule ligands binding to hidden pockets in medicinally important proteins such as FcgammaRIIA or PCNA.

Blister-based laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) is a relatively new femtosecond laser ablation technique that is mild enough to accommodate such samples.\n\nA material is transferred to a metal substrate and irradiated from behind by a short laser pulse, causing a blister to form. Rapid movement of the metal substrate facilitates efficient material transfer and effective isolation. Scientists improved on a matrix-free blister-based LIFT technique, producing an apparatus for gas-phase analysis of small particles with EU support of the project DECIMA (Detection and characterization of individual micro- and nanoparticles).\n\nIn particular, DECIMA developed a new LIFT technique to introduce nanoparticles into high vacuum for ionisation and analysis. Particle transfer efficiency as high as 90\u00a0% has been realised and the ejected particles form a very narrow particle beam for well-controlled placement. The average particle velocity is about 50\u00a0m/s, slow enough to allow investigation of particle composition and morphology with depth resolution. Scientists integrated the LIFT technology with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS), of both positive and negative ions.\n\nResearchers fully characterised the operation of the new apparatus using atomic force microscopy and theoretical studies to optimise laser characteristics and prevent sample materials damage. The technology is simple to realise and compatible with any sample, including carbon nanostructures, aerosol particles and biological objects. It was successfully used to transfer fullerene C60 molecules from a metal-coated substrate into the extraction region for TOFMS. Further, it effectively isolates the transferred materials from other ablation materials and minimises laser heating so that the particles are delivered to the analytical instrumentation unaltered.\n\nDECIMA progress will be important in getting the nanoparticle detection and characterisation set-up closer to proof-of-principle in the laboratory and eventual prototype development.

As environmental light and temperature cues are major regulators of carotenoids, increased knowledge of these signaling pathways will assist future crop improvement programs. This project aims to combine modeling with experimentation to determine the molecular mechanisms through which light and temperature modulate carotenogenesis, providing novel avenues for efforts to improve photosynthesis in the face of environmental change. A major driving force for carotenoid production is the transcriptional control of Phytoene synthase (PSY). The phytochrome photoreceptors promote PSY expression, while the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) act as transcriptional repressors. This antagonistic module provides a simple but robust system to modulate carotenoid biosynthesis. The Giberellin regulated DELLA proteins also participate in the light control of carotenogenesis by impairing PIF1 capacity to bind to the PSY promoter. However, in the light, not only de-repressing effects, but active induction of PSY takes place, hinting at the existence of positive regulators of the pathway. Preliminary evidence points at LONG HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) for this role. Many phytochrome dependent responses are strongly influenced by temperature, suggesting a convergence of signaling at the molecular level.

It is argued that impairments in the mechanisms of implicit learning could mediate selective weaknesses in other cognitive processes such as reading and numeracy. The present project puts this argument under test in a series of behavioral and neurobiological studies of implicit learning in typical and atypical young populations, namely children with dyslexia and dyscalculia.

Several dedicated gravitational lensing experiements have recently begun throughout Europe, to exploit rapid developments in telescope technology on the ground and in space. These include the VST/KIDS and Pan-Starrs surveys, as well as ESA's proposed DUNE satellite.

Dark energy, on the other hand, is pushing the Universe apart, increasing the rate with which the cosmos expands. Scientists believe that dark energy could make up about 70 % of the Universe while known particles make up just 5 %.\n\nWhat dark matter and dark energy actually has remained a mystery until today, despite many potential explanations suggested for both. Scientists working on the EU-funded 'Understanding the dark universe with 3D weak gravitational lensing' (DARKMATTERDARKENERGY) project have used the most successful technique yet developed to investigate this dark sector: gravitational lensing. \n\nDark matter does not interact with electromagnetic force operating between charged particles and therefore, does not emit or reflect light. However, it seems to play the most important role in shaping the Universe on large scales, interacting with the force of gravity. The curvature of time-space near gravitating mass, including dark matter, deflects passing rays of light, thereby distorting the images of background galaxies.\n\nMeasurements of the distribution of dark matter seen by gravitational lensing in 65 galaxy clusters were compared with the distribution of gas determined from X-ray emission and scattering of photons from the cosmic microwave background. This comparison led to unexpected findings, such as the luminosity-temperature relationship remaining constant for the past 5 million years in the clusters of varying mass.\n\nEven more puzzling were the findings from the analysis of collision between galaxy clusters. In observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chadra X-ray Observatory in space and the ESO Very Large Observatory on the ground, the DARKMATTERDARKENERGY team found four collisions.

The mechanically interlocked nature of the rotaxane ensures processivity during the machine\u2019s operation. Although biology uses threaded molecular architectures to transfer chemical information during sequence-specific oligomer and polymer assembly (proteins, oligo- and polysaccharides, DNA and RNA), such effects are unprecedented in artificial systems.

These in\u00a0silico tools could predict a cell's response to stimuli such as hormones as well as the outcome of various genetic or pharmacological perturbations.\n\nTo develop these models, UNICELLSYS partners generated a large set of proteomics and metabolomics data of yeast grown under different conditions. Yeast was analysed at the single-cell level to account for cell-to-cell variation. The focus was on various signalling pathways (protein kinase\u00a0A, MAPK, mTOR, Hog-mediated osmotic stress pathway). Particular emphasis was also placed on how proteins within these pathways interact using the yeast two-hybrid system and bioinformatics analysis.\n\nSignificant effort went into integrating the different signalling pathways into a large-scale molecular dynamic model that could predict cellular behaviour given specific stimuli or growth perturbations. Cellular biochemistry was modelled through the development of an open-source software package called ManyCell. Besides delineating mechanisms implicated in signal transduction, metabolism and growth, this dynamic modelling generated invaluable insight into the ability of unicellular organisms to adapt to altered environmental conditions.\n\nOverall, the ability to predict the response of biological extrinsic or intrinsic perturbations is emerging as the new way of understanding how different cellular processes are interconnected.

It is as valid as 'the data proves without doubt that global warming is not real', provided that it did.\n\nOn the other hand, the condition of today's academics is commonly described by the expression 'publish or perish'. Their careers are increasingly evaluated based on the sheer number of papers listed in their CVs and the number of citations received. Therefore, to secure funding and jobs scientists need to publish continuously. And papers are likely to be accepted by journals and later cited based on the results they report.\n\nThe 'Objective science' researchers asked scientists directly where they have committed research misconduct. Two percent of respondents admitted to have fabricated, falsified or 'cooked' data or results at least once - serious misconduct by any standards. The percentage was significantly higher when they were asked about the behaviour of colleagues. Considering that this survey asked sensitive questions, this may be a conservative estimate of the prevalence of scientific misconduct.\n\nTo further support the hypothesis that competitive academic environments increases the bias against 'negative' results, data from the National Science Foundation were analysed. When examining the relationship between the percentage of paper reporting 'positive' results with institute productivity and expenditures in R&D, a distinct trend was observed.\n\nMost ground-breaking scientific research is conducted within a small number of elite institutions.

This EU network, which brings together basic scientists and academic clinicians, will make use of novel animal models and expertly phenotyped patient cohorts to identify key mechanisms common to multiple SVDs and determine how these mechanisms contribute to individual SVDs. We will: i) identify common molecular, cellular, and physiological mechanisms that compromise the function of microvessels in different SVDs; ii) determine how these common mechanistic defects intersect to drive brain damage; and iii) validate the relevance of mechanisms through interventions in experimental systems (isolated microvessels and in vivo) and in patients (exploratory proof of concept trials).

Intrinsic and extrinsic factors may have played a role: mammals have many specialised features such as enlarged brains with a novel structure (the neocortex) that imparts heightened memory and senses, but they also were presented with the freedom to diversify after the dinosaurs went extinct at the end-Cretaceous (66 million years ago). This raises a major question that the BEMADE project will address: did large brains and keen senses help mammals survive the apocalypse that killed the dinosaurs, or did they appear later as mammals began to fill niches left empty by dinosaurs? As the rise of mammals is a textbook example of an evolutionary radiation, resolving this dilemma will give critical new insight into what drives diversification over deep time. Until now, little has been known about the brains of mammals evolving during the ~10 million years after the extinction (the Paleocene), due to the rarity of fossils and the difficulty of reconstructing the brain in extinct species.

Automatic control is a well-established engineering discipline to build \u201ccontrollers\u201d to steer the dynamic behaviour of a physical system in a desired fashion. By building upon control engineering for physical systems and by exploiting the unique features of living organisms, this project will identify generally applicable approaches to design closed-loop feedback controllers for biological systems. To handle biological complexity, the project will explore three strategies of increasing difficulty \u201cexternal\u201d controllers, \u201cembedded\u201d controllers and \u201cmulti-cellular\u201d controllers. External controllers will be implemented in a computer acting on cells using small molecules via microfluidics devices. Embedded controllers will be made from biological parts and integrated within individual cells to steer their behaviour. Multicellular controllers envisage two cell populations, one made up of cells with embedded controllers (controller cells) and the other will be the controlled population (target cells). In addition, a rapid prototyping platform will enable to speed up the design-build-test cycles by means of optimal experimental design, microfluidics and cell-free systems.

Therefore, (1) we aim to develop a micro-heater configuration which can heat any type of materials, e.g., silicate, oxide, and H2O. We plan to achieve the P-T condition of P = 200 GPa and T = 4000 K. Then (2) we will conduct high-pressure melting experiments on H2O ice. The melting temperature of H2O ice under pressure places important constraints on the structure of Ice Giants such as Uranus and Neptune. Previously reported melting temperatures of H2O show large discrepancies, one of the major reasons for which is that most of those studies were based on the laser heating with large temperature uncertainties. Our new IHDAC will offer incontrovertible melting data from homogeneous and stable heating, and therefore it has a great potential to solve the long-standing controversy of the existing melting temperatures. Our new IHDAC will be a conventional technique for the researches on the planetary interior for the next decade.", 171349.0, 171349.0, "NEWDIA4Planet", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ed.ac.uk", null, "h2020_209415_999974941"], ["9YL", "Can histone code-like switches govern the multifunctionality of RNA-binding proteins?", "The University of Edinburgh", "Post-transcriptional control of human gene expression is conferred by >1000 mRNA-binding proteins (RNA-BPs), which determine the utilisation and fate of mRNAs, with the aetiology of a wide-range of disorders (e.g. neurological, inflammatory, and neoplastic) being due to their dysregulation. \nMultifunctionality is a feature of RNA-BPs and understanding how this is coordinated and regulated is pivotal to delineating the molecular circuitry of post-transcriptional gene regulatory networks, to understand why they go wrong and how they may be manipulated. Poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) are central multifunctional regulators of mRNA fate, controlling multiple aspects of mRNA translation, stability and quality via interacting with functionally diverse protein partners. Consequently, their deficiency impacts physiological processes such as gametogenesis, metabolism and learning/memory, although mechanistic bases of these phenotypes are unclear, highlighting the importance of understanding their functions and regulation.\nA key gap in our knowledge is how PABP protein interactions, and therefore functions, are coordinated since many of its partners bind the same \u201cPABC domain\u201d site, through a shared \u201cPAM2\u201d motif. However, our recent findings lead to a novel hypothesis, which I will address, namely that the post-translational modification (PTM) status (acetylation or dimethylation) of a functionally important PABC residue, K606, determines PAM2-partner binding specificity and PABP multifunctionality.

Specifically, I will use a fish, the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), to test the sexual antagonism (SA) hypothesis of sex chromosome evolution, which is plausible, but lacks direct evidence. SA mutations (that benefit one sex but lower fitness of the other) are proposed to arise in a partially sex-linked (pseudo-autosomal region, or PAR) gene, and establish polymorphisms. To reduce the conflict between the sexes, suppressed recombination between X and Y chromosomes then evolves (unless sex-specific expression evolves first). The guppy is ideal for studying this hypothesis because SA polymorphisms are well documented: male coloration phenotypes make males attractive to females, but also make them conspicuous to predators (while females gain no compensating benefit). Moreover, guppies have a recombination-suppressed sex-linked region that carries multiple coloration genes, yet is thought to have evolved recently. However, no non-Y-linked coloration factor has yet been mapped, and the genetics is complicated by modifers making some XX individuals male, and by male-specific expression of some phenotypes. I will map coloration genes and identify PAR genes using DNA-based markers to take account of these problems. I will test for the predicted lower coloration allele frequencies in natural populations with high versus low predation rates, and do population genetic analyses to test for closer linkage under high predation.

We aim to explore genetic determinants of the epigenome based on our over-arching hypothesis that chromatin structure is influenced by the interaction of DNA binding proteins with short, frequent base sequence motifs. Prototypes for this scenario are proteins that bind to the two base pair sequence CpG. These proteins accumulate at CpG islands (CGIs), which are platforms for gene regulation, where they recruit multi-protein complexes that lay down epigenetic marks.

In both mouse and human there are two principle monocyte subsets, termed 'classical' and 'non-classical'. The classical monocyte subset is a key driver of atherosclerosis, whereas evidence suggests that the non-classical monocyte subset plays a protective role in disease. However, directly testing the role of non-classical (Ly6Clow) monocytes in disease has not been possible due to a lack of experimental models.

This work identified a small region of the genome, termed an enhancer, that controls expression of the key transcription factor Nr4a1 in Ly6Clow monocytes. Deleting this enhancer produced a mouse that lacks Ly6Clow monocytes but is otherwise normal, unlike existing methods for Nr4a1 deletion. MONOCLE will exploit this novel mouse model to test the role of Ly6Clow monocytes in atherosclerosis, and to gain new insight into mechanisms regulating non-classical monocyte development.

This degenerate genome view accords with the nearly-neutral theory\u2019s prediction that selection will be weaker when populations are small. But is this all there is to it? I shall investigate two new interrelated perspectives on genome evolution. First, I suggest that to mitigate errors, owing to our high error rates, our genome can be under stronger, not weaker, selection. Second, that errors might be a source of evolutionary novelty. Error mitigation, my team has shown, often involves selection on seemingly innocuous mutations such as synonymous changes. Remarkably, we discovered that selection to ensure error-proof splicing is possibly more prevalent on synonymous mutations when populations are small, making seemingly innocuous mutations stronger candidates for human diseases. I shall provide the first test of the new error-proofing perspective through comparative genomic analysis on synonymous site evolution. To investigate error as a source of novelty I shall consider whether expression piggy-backing (expression of a gene affecting its neighbors) forces rewiring of gene networks. Importantly, I shall translate our new understanding to enable better diagnostics and improved therapeutics. I shall develop a much-needed computer package to identify candidate disease-causing synonymous changes. In addition, knowing how synonymous sites modulate splicing will allow me to design better intronless transgenes. Transgenes must also be inserted in genomic regions immune to piggy-backing.

Unlike vertebrates that use specialized immune cells to detect non-self, each individual plant cell is thought to be capable of launching an effective immune response. Plant immune responses are largely orchestrated by the immune hormone, salicylic acid (SA), which accumulates upon infection and establishes both local and broad-spectrum systemic immunity. SA induces the reprogramming of thousands of genes to prioritize immune responses over normal cellular growth functions. Consequently, commercial SA mimics have been developed and applied as crop protection agents worldwide. Nonetheless, how SA reprograms the transcriptome remains poorly understood yet is critical for the design of improved crop protection strategies that avoid plant growth and yield penalties. \nSA-induced transcription reprogramming is largely mediated by NPR1, a master coactivator of gene expression. We recently reported that direct perception of SA by a Cullin3-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) in the nucleus regulates the transcriptional activity of NPR1 by targeting it for degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Our latest data suggest that ubiquitination by CRL3 and other ubiquitin chain modifying enzymes may be processive and establishes a transcriptional timer for NPR1 activity. This proposal aims to understand the flexibility and necessity of this transcriptional ubiquitin timer in meeting cellular demands for dynamic gene expression during SA-mediated plant immune responses.

These case studies have been carefully chosen to provide globally significant, but contrasting examples of contests over the implications of claims to conscience. If claims of conscience are often associated with a specifically liberal and Christian tradition, mid-twentieth century Britain can be said to stand at the centre of that tradition. Sri Lanka represents a particularly fraught post-colonial South Asian counterpoint, wracked by nationalist violence, and influenced by ethical traditions associated with forms of Hinduism and Buddhism.
