However, there are two factors that will increasingly affect future protective coatings developments: VOC emissions and health/safety issues. Firstly there is a strong mandate to apply VOC emissions legislation to protective coatings (and in particular extend the Paint Products Directive  to include them). Secondly REACH, together with increasing effects of chemicals on humans supported through medical literature, may prevent the use of some coating materials.\nOur vision for BARRIER-PLUS is to develop one component waterborne barrier coatings that are competitive in performance to two component coatings. One component waterborne coatings have a number of advantages over two component coatings and solventborne systems: low VOC emissions; low fire risk; lower insurance issues; no exposure to isocyanates, epoxy resins or amines; no waste or poor film performance arising from pot life problems. Our approach is to build upon recent research in the organic/inorganic nanocomposites field to create enhanced film barrier properties.\nAlthough this project is focused on the protection of steel, the technology developed will have application in the protection of other substrates, eg concrete, brickwork and stonework.", 67010.0, 2013634.0, "BARRIER PLUS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.leighspaints.com", null, "fp7_111430_953444235"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["6NW", "French language and cultural links", "SS Osmund and Andrew's R.C.

Pupils have enjoyed these experiences and meeting people from other cultures, improving their learning and understanding of the wider world.  This mobility project consists of members of teaching staff attending an intense training course in France.  French is the language taught throughout our school and so the aim of this is to develop and encourage new skills, knowledge and understanding of language learning within a real context. This will help us at the same time to develop a deeper sense of citizenship within the European Union,  create links with France and prepare us for the new statutory primary languages curriculum for September 2014.    We want to send four members of staff to improve language competence, develop language teaching skills, collect resources and to build relationships with France.  We will make a link with a partner school so that more people can be actively involved in the link with France  through technologies such as the website, blog and Skype.  The participants will then share learning and cultural experiences with the rest of the school staff and community in order to involve more members of staff, pupils and parents in moving our school forward in language capability with a European dimension.  The impact of the training back in our school will be closely monitored and assessed by Senior Leaders and MFL subject Coordinator to ensure that the objectives set have been achieved and that progress is being made.  We aim to raise the profile of language learning and encourage positive attitudes amongst all staff. We will update our school development plan and language policy to reflect our new aims and provision for pupils. Our engagement with eTwinning will support us in working together with other teachers to share ideas and exchange good practice.  We want pupils to have a leading role in developing our partnership with France and Europe.  We intend to motivate pupils beyond the normal classroom and give them responsibility and ownership of a project which extends into the real world.  We want to give them a sense of purpose for learning a foreign language.  The project will ensure that it is accessible to all pupils regardless of ability or special learning needs.

Not to use just immediately after the course but to ensure the children get a well rounded, engaging experience of Spain and its language throughout their time here at Castle Hill. After all, the more the children can relate to a subject, the better immersed they become in that subject, the better their learning journey will be.The only way to sustain the children\u2019s engagement in the language is if they have access to these invaluable authentic experiences. The fact that some of these children know you\u2019ve been to the actual country they are learning the language of is amazing, because they can instantly access facts, ask questions and have them confidently answered, again anchoring their learning to something tangible.There are many positive reasons to be given the opportunity to go to Spain, but the fundamental reason for why we would be willing to undertake this CPD is the invaluable effect and long term impact it will have on the children\u2019s learning of the language. In a time when fewer students are choosing to study languages at GCSE, A Level and degree level, it is imperative to capture their eagerness for learning, now. The benefits for learning any language, not least the second most spoken language in the world, are endless.As part of our recent OFSTED inspection the school had to complete an HMCI Commentary regarding foreign language provision in the school. During feedback they suggested ways we could further develop our language provision by; - introducing it into Key Stage 1 and EYFS, - building a bank of resources aimed at their level to build their knowledge and confidence within this. - making links with partner secondary schools that our children will attend, to further develop our own language provision and - creating links with other primary schools. Doing this course will enable us to achieve these goals. The impact this course will result in is to create a fun, rich, well resourced, authentic and engaging environment for our children to learn Spanish.
