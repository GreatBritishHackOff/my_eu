The English partner organisation Work Placement UK (WPUK) supervises the group, organises the work placements, the language course and the host families. A teacher accompanies the group and will be inBrighton together with the trainees all the time. There will be minor teenagers taking part in the mobility, too.  The trainees have learnt English for at least six years at school and their minimum degree is the German version of GCSE. Some have higher degrees up to A-levels.   \r\n\r\nThe mobility consists of two flows, one in autumn 2017 and one in autumn 2018, each with 12 trainees with a duration of 18 days each time. The trainees are going to work at their work placements for 10 days and attend a language course at a certified language school for two days. They should work with authentic English documents and be encouraged and trained in oral and written communication skills. These are also goals in the curriculum and the training regulations. The trainees should achieve competences in cooperating with colleagues and clients of different culutural backgrounds. That goal should also be achieved by their stay in British host families. \r\n\r\nOne main goal is to encourage them to tolerance and open-mindedness towards other cultures. The mobility is supposed to boost their English language skills, their expertise and interdisciplinary skills as well as their social competences to help them to facilitate their future careers within a European business market. It should also help them to become politically mature, responsible, self-assured, tolerant and open minded citizens of the European Union. The internationally oriented Franconian businesses require confident behavior even in the context of the globalized market and conversations in foreign languages.  \r\n\r\nThe mobility is going to be well prepared. The trainees are going to attend courses on their cultural awareness and language skills. A continuous monitoring process as well as a continuous evaluation of the outcome concerning the learners\u2019 language skills and expertise is going to complete the project. Both will be executed by WPUK and the teachers. Another goal is to widen the horizon and open-mindedness of the trainees. This is going to be achieved by a cultural program. The project is going to be published in the local press (newspapers and radio) and online. We are going to have a blog and there are going to be presentations in front of politicians and employers.

Despite the great achievements in the past, many young people and pupils have mixed feelings about pushing the integration in Europe to the next level. An essential reason for that sceptical attitude is that the pupils cannot collect any positive, individual experiences on private or on a professional level e.g. working or living abroad, because there is a lack of opportunities for them due to the high costs which come along with such a practical experience.  The only chance to support the idea of a merging Europe, continuing the integration process in the future, is to secure that the ideas of the European Union will be supported by a convinced major part of our young citizens. \r\n\r\nOur school is observing this nuisance for a while and we would like to do our part to change this, making Europe to a practical shared perception for our apprentices. Therefor, we officially apply to the Mobility Program of the European Union to give our trainees the chance to participate and experience the advantages and achievements in Europe on their own. The vocational \"School for Business and Information Technology\"  is a public institution from the city of W\u00fcrzburg. We have the plan to offer our pupils and teachers the opportunity to participate in a practical training as an optional module in their apprenticeship. We expect that the pupils will benefit from the participation in the Mobility Program in several areas, as an individual reaching a higher quality in their education and qualification and as an apprentice on a private level (self development). These are the main points (for potential participants) to apply as a school to the funding program in 2017. However, we are doing this application for the first time, and we will apply in this round 30 eligible internships which will take place in a work experience in London for 3 weeks. Our apprentices have a very diversified level of education, (from Certificate of Secondary Education to  General Qualification for University Entrance). They are learning their jobs in a full time school in the following professions:\r\n\r\n- IT management assistant\r\n- qualified IT specialist\r\n- businessman for office management\r\n- certified businessman assistant\r\n\r\nParticipating in the Erasmus+ program shall influence sustainable our apprentices, showing several positive effects. Due to the shortage of space, these points are given in headwords. \r\n\r\n- stimulate the curiosity for foreign cultures and civilizations\r\n- expand language abilities, fluently and spoken to a higher skill level\r\n- receiving the Europass certificate (\"mobility pass\" and \"language pass\") as a participant\r\n- boosting self independence of the participants in private while adopting to an unknown workplace and living in a host family for 3 weeks\r\n- increasing the willingness to show a higher labour mobility in the future\r\n- supporting the personal acquisition of knowledge about new or unfamiliar business processes on a long term basis \r\n- bringing new ideas from their internship abroad into their domestic apprenticeship during the 3rd year of their training, realising a transfer of their knowledge\r\n- inspire our pupils to create a positive attitude to the idea of a continuing integration in Europe\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also hope for positive long term effects for our teachers. These points aren't the main focus in this application and they cannot be reached within one experience, because they are often linked with the long term goals of our school. Those points are listed in headwords below:\r\n\r\n- securing and increasing the professional skills of our teachers\r\n- our long term goal is to achieve a cooperation in which teachers can collect practical experiences in job shadowing or in a trainingship in a british company \r\n- a long term relationship and cooperation with colleagues and companies on an international level, increasing the quality of school education\r\n- a professional cooperation between school and companies to create a forward looking european job profile in our offered apprenticeships\r\n\r\nAs a school institution we hope for the following positive effects, working together with our co-operation partners.

Globalisation and internationally operating companies have a great demand for qualified students whose command of English is fluent enough to cope with international challenges. Naturally these young people and their teachers and trainers need to build on their basic language skills by getting the chance to use English in a practical context during the training process. It is here where our project can contribute most. Trainees who have not yet had the opportunity to participate in European exchange programmes in particular will benefit from our project.\r\n\r\nWhen in 2004/2005 English was introduced as a compulsory subject in vocational business schools for students in retail sales and office administration, this was the starting point for our school to tailor a special language learning programme at the ECBM in London for this target group alongside their normal English lessons. Initially an exchange programme was designed in the form of a three week college course to meet these students\u00b4 needs by focussing on practical English usage and intercultural competence at the same time. However, as our students strive for work experience it very soon became clear that workplacements abroad would be of even greater use to them. So the altered training programme that has been established since enables the participating students to do internships as well as college training. Our project \u201cWorkplacements in the UK\u201d offers a three week stay abroad to 20 students of our school who are currently in their vocational training. Students of all departments can apply, as long as they demonstrate a basic knowledge of English and show motivation. The same qualifications are required of members of staff who want to take part in the programme.\r\n\r\nDuring their three week stay in Brighton (UK) participants are expected to develop their communication and language skills both in general and in their special professional field. In a kick-off seminar in the first three days of their stay the participants receive individual training sessions purposefully designed to meet their individual needs. This will enable them to cope with their two weeks employment in the various English businesses, which will be organized for them well in advance. To add to their intercultural competence, students will be accommodated with English host families and thus will experience every day English life throughout their stay. On the last day of the programme there is an opportunity for reflection and evaluation. Along with the Europass, all participants will get a certificate of attendance from our organizing partner Workplacements UK, and a qualifying employer\u00b4s reference from their individual work places.\r\n\r\nTaking part in this project helps young people to develop their personality, to increase their self-confidence and to broaden their occupational horizons as the programme requires great flexibility and the readiness to handle an unfamiliar environment. Thus the ability to adapt to the constantly changing challenges of the working world is improved. Furthermore we hope the project will encourage students\u00b4 interest in further education and qualifications while still in training and in the long term to encourage them to seek employment abroad.\r\nEnabling our staff to participate in the project is a genuine part of our school\u00b4s continuing personnel development. In the course of our policy of developing an international focus this programme will eventually lead to an even wider opening of the \u201cBeruflichen Schulen Wittelsbacher Land\u201d to the outside \u201cworking\u201d world. Practical work experience abroad for our training personnel will help to implement the European focus in our lessons and to encourage this ethos in our students, who live in a Europe which is growing closer day by day. In this context the opportunities that are offered by the Workplacement-Project are ones that will enable our students and staff to meet the challenges of the 21st century.", "http://www.workplacementsuk.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003679_1"], ["7LR", "Flexibilisierung der Auszubildenden f\u00fcr den internationalen Arbeitsmarkt", "Work Placements UK Ltd", 55569.0, "Parties involved\r\nBerufliche Schulen Alt\u00f6tting is a vocational school providing initial training in Bavaria.

Our aim is to internationalize all of the study fields and also usually underrepresented minorities. The central point of our international co-operation strategy is a high quality and equal student and expert exchange activity. During the year 2016 Education Centre Brahe joined to the Education Export Finland \u2013 program. Education Export Finland brings together private companies, vocational institutions, and higher education establishments in Finland, to help export their education expertise. \r\n\r\nThe persons who are in charge of the international relationships have a long time experience in sending students and experts abroad and also receiving them from foreign countries. The beneficiaries are the students and experts in every field of the multi-disciplinary vocational institutes. The central point of our international co-operation strategy is a high quality and equal student and expert exchange activity. Every student interested in studying abroad is offered the possibility to do so either using our foreign partners or through student\u2019s own foreign connections. They are also offered supporting or special internationality studies. There are also immigrants and students with special needs who get benefits. The aim is that every student and the whole staff can get international experience either through on-the-job learning periods abroad or/and with exchange students and experts in their home school. Scholarships are primarily targeted at second and third grade students who have already gained enough vocational competence and accordingly also have self-assurance for participating in on-the-job learning abroad period. Exchange activities are partly financed by the Education Centre Brahe itself. Each exchange student is designated two mentors; one in the sending and another in the target country. Participating foreign partners are mainly familiar as a result of cooperating in different international exchange projects for many years. There are also new schools and companies that broaden the possibilities of doing on-the-job learning periods in variety of study fields. Students\u2019 placements abroad are identified and recognized as a part of their studies. Teachers\u2019 and staff\u2019s exchanges develop their vocational competence and working-life co-operation skills.\r\n\r\nThe manager of the joint municipal authority will head and supervise the developing and implementing of the international co-operation according to the current strategy. The international co-operation is also assessed and updated yearly by co-ordinators and other practical workers related to it. The main aim is to create equal possibilities for different persons to attend international exchange programs. Further aims are to improve students\u00b4 digital skills and their use of mobile technology. In addition, one aim is also to map out the subjects of work safety and sustainable development. When training abroad, students\u2019 language competence and the knowledge of the other cultures will increase. It is quite likely too that training abroad adds students\u2019 interest to work abroad in the future. As a result of international exchange, students\u2019 vocational skills will increase and the development of the key competences of the lifelong learning are supported. Exchange periods are composed of taking into consideration student\u2019s needs and ECVET principles in co-operation with target organizations. Such large investments as the nuclear power plant, the wind farms, and mining processes have been started in the Raahe region. They have influence on the need of labor force and the educational focus of the area. Along these projects, multinational companies will operate in the Raahe region and these companies will employ students who will graduated from our vocational schools. It is then, important that all students have possibilities to acquire knowledge of foreign cultures and experience working life with foreign employees during their studies.", "http://www.workplacementsuk.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA116-034464_6"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SG12"}
