They are present all over the European Union; we can find the same tendencies of bad health choices, depression and addictions in every country. European priorities include all of these issues, both the EU 2020 Strategy and the Erasmus + Programme emphasizes the importance of promoting healthy and active lifestyles that lead to positive change on many levels: people become healthier, less likely to show signs of depression thus, they become more active citizens.\r\nThe project partners all agree that it is essential to address the issues leading to unhealthy lives at a young age. Practical experiences have long-lasting effects: participants gain positive memories, and hands-on experience with the making of healthy choices. This is why partner organizations have decided to cooperate on a Youth Exchange that promotes outdoor activities in an entertaining and interactive way that catches the interest of the youth.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are the following:\r\n-Give participants a lifelong experience that inspires a healthy lifestyle.\r\n-To show participants the advantages and positive effects of outdoor activities.\r\n-To change participants' attitudes towards sports and other social activities.\r\n-To inspire socially active lifestyle among the youth.\r\n-To lower the obesity rates among the youth.\r\n-To tackle the problem of addictions among the youth (alcohol or drug abuse, internet or game addictions, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe overall aim of this project is to change the youth's passive mentality to a more healthy and active attitude that contributes to social inclusion, active citizenship and lowered drop-out and unemployment rates on a European level.\r\n\r\nThe project involves 65 participants who are young people between 16 and 25 coming from various regions of the EU characterized by high rates of health issues (obesity, addictions, etc.). These young people have a strong need for a change of lifestyle to counteract the impacts of their surroundings. They need to have a good example of how healthy life choices are made. In order to lead successful and healthy lives, they have to understand which attitudes are correct, and how to adapt these new lifestyles.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on promoting healthy lifestyle to participants, through introducing them to various outdoor activities: each delegation is responsible of showing and teaching a new, creative and entertaining outdoor activity to the others that inspires active lifestyles. These activities include the Danish 'Rundbolt', Frisbee, P\u00e9tanque, etc. and an International Leisure Day together with every student of Lollands Produktionsskole, with a great tournament and a celebration.\r\n\r\nThe envisaged results of the project are healthy, active and inspired young 'health ambassadors' who will go on to spread the healthy lifestyle among their own networks of friends, family, etc. The youth becomes an active European citizen, and it is eager to inspire and motivate their surroundings as well.", "http://www.themytrust.org", null, "erasmus_2014-3-DK01-KA105-004017_4"], ["4QA", "Civilization Island", "Medway Youth trust", 27544.0, "Context and Background \r\nWithin Europe many young people find themselves in a situation of marginalisation as a result of having \u2018fewer opportunities\u2019. These fewer opportunities can vary drastically depending on the situation and context of the young people, including financial, social, cultural and geographical constraints. However regardless of the cause of marginalisation, the final result is inequality, segregation and lack of cohesion resulting in a fragmented and weak society.\r\n\r\nYoung people with fewer opportunities have unique needs with regards to developing their \u2018soft skills\u2019 and transversal competences such as social and communicative skills, teamwork skills, citizenship, interpersonal responsibility, empowerment and self-awareness. The best method to develop these essential soft skills and transversal competences amongst marginalised young people is through creative and innovative non formal education activities that put the learner in the driving seat, and in a situation that they are outside their comfort zone and have to navigate collectively to a positive outcome.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this mobility project is to develop social and civic competences amongst young people with fewer opportunities enabling them to participate fully in European Society.\r\n\r\nProject Objectives\r\n- Foster a sense of self-awareness, self-esteem and empowerment amongst young people with fewer opportunities;\r\n- Foster a sense of inter-responsibility towards society amongst young people with fewer opportunities;\r\n- Promote an understanding of democratic structure and values among young people with fewer opportunities;\r\n- Promote a sense of active citizenship amongst young people with fewer opportunities\r\n- Promote an awareness of European values, cooperation and cohesion amongst young people with fewer opportunities \r\n- Give young people with fewer opportunities a chance to meet and socialize with other nationalities and cultures which are different from their own\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of the participants\r\nThe participants are 55 young people from Denmark, Turkey, Romania, Italy and Poland.

There will daily be a challenge to take the participants out of their comfort zone which will stregthen their coorporation and cohesion.
