The project aims at improving the attractiveness of the construction\u2019s trades through European mobility making it a sustainable component of lifelong learning.\r\n\r\nWith its enlarged partnership composed by 26 training centers, this project strengthen the engagement of the CCCA-BTP network in European mobility. The enhancement of the mobility actions is not only due to the dimension of the partnership, but also to the new collaborations and reciprocity arising between French training centers and Europeans ones. \r\n\r\nThis project involves two types of public:\r\n\r\nTRAINEES:\r\n1. Apprentices preparing a 'Brevet Professionnel' (Professional Certificate, European Qualification Level 4) with a European component: masonry, electricity, roofing, or painting, HVAC/Heating, Ventilation and Air-conditioning Installations. \r\n2. Apprentices in public works sector sections (EU qualification level 4 and 3) to increase their employability: the transnational mobility is a real added value for the workers of the public works sector, given the interdisciplinary nature of the dockyards and the international size of this sector's companies.\r\n3. Apprentices putting in place other type of mobility actions willing to respect the quality criteria imposed by this project.\r\n\r\nCOMPANY TUTORS: \r\n1. Actions targeting a stronger involvement of company tutors in preparing and carrying out European training paths for their trainees.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the project are: \r\n- Employability and personal fulfillment of the learner, but also to offer him a concrete experience of European citizenship.\r\n- Valorization of the CFA, through the proof of the quality of their training, of their ability to conduct a transnational project.\r\n- Develop synergies within the CFA with these exchanges and their participation in the project involving apprentices, trainers and managers.\r\n- Valorization of the sending and host partners (both companies and training centers).\r\n- Improve recognition of mobility's outcomes, through a systematic approach focused on the competences, and their assessment.\r\n- Implementation of the ECVET approach. All apprentices are concerned with the on-site assessment of learning outcomes and its validation.\r\n\r\nThe main estimated impact is a professional added value. Moreover, the objective is that mobility would be a lever on the motivation and commitment of apprentices in order to undertake careers in the construction trades. In addition, through this experience, young people become aware of the value of the training which they receive, as they face a different cultural and professional context. Finally, through this immersion, young people understand more the need of learning another language. \r\n\r\nThe expected impacts on the apprentices are: \r\n- Personal fulfillment and development: Personal opening another operation, development of autonomy and maturity, self-recognition; \r\n- Active citizenship: evolution of personal representations of Europe: through these projects, Europe gets closer to citizens who are often quite distant from it; \r\n- Social inclusion and employment: professional skills, employability, language immersion, greater interdisciplinary. \r\n\r\nThese 3 elements overlap the components of the key competencies listed in the Regulation [EU] No 1288/2013 establishing the Erasmus + program. Company tutors, the first two elements are quite relevant; however a stronger relationship with company in designing training path is the main aspect of this exchange of practices and experiences.\r\n\r\nThe management scheme is that CCCA-BTP provides coordination, animation, administrative support and pedagogical coherence of the whole project. The CFAs build partnership relations with host organizations; provide logistical and pedagogical organization while monitoring of participants. Mobility Teams are dedicated to this in the CFAs, and an ad hoc steering committee within the CCCA-BTP which deals also with the ECEVT implementation.\r\n\r\nThe project will involve 762 apprentices (9 trades and 2 levels of certification) and 25 company tutor.", "http://www.warrington.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-035778_2"], ["8QA", "2015-1-FI01-KA109-009209", "WARRINGTON COLLEGIATE", 127316.0, "November 2016 CIMO run the \"System Check\" for Sataedu's internationalization activities. According to the report of the check, management and processes of Sataedu's internationalization activities are high quality, and the planning of the mobilities is very proactive. In addition, internationalization is seen in very wide scope in Sataedu, where many different actions support each other. Behind all this can be found management's strong commitment to the internationalization.  Sataedu's new strategy will be put to the market during this spring 2017, at which time also internationalization's importance will rise higher than before. The action plan of the international activites will be updated after the strategy publication, in autumn 2017.\r\n\r\nSATAMOVE 4 mobilities continue SATAMOVE 2 and SATAMOVE 3 projects' good practices. Our goal is still to improve students' graduation and to increase their possibilities to get employed in Finland and in Europe, by executing high quality, min. 5 weeks' internship with such a partners, who are familiar with our internship's content and way of assessment,  throughout our Learning Agreement.\r\n\r\n5-10 weeks' internship consist of the orientation period of the recieving organisation, tutoring action during the whole period, work practise, continuing self evaluation by means of blog writing, intermediate- and final evaluation by means of work place tutor and the culture visits by the partner organisation.\r\n\r\nOur participating students are 18 years old, motivated and target oriented young adults. During the next school year, following study fields will participate in this project with next amount of students: Hair & Beauty 8, Audio-Visual 8, Car Mechanic 8, Logistics 2, Electricity 8, Shoemaker 4, Construction 2, Tourism 2, Hotel- and Catering 8, Business 2, Photograph 4, Animation 4, Graphic Design 4,  Social and Health Care 8, Craft and Skills 2. In total 74 mobilities. \r\n\r\nRegarding our 14 days' expert mobilities, 4 mobilities are from Social  Health care sector to Germany and 2 mobilities to from education technology to Spain and Germany. \r\nSince our organization was reformed in the beginning of 2017, we are eager to find new know-how to our executive board members. For that reason we are cooperating with organizations similar to FI AMKE, AoC in UK and MBORaad in the Netherlands. Both organizations are familiar with Sataedu  throughout E+ KA2 project and EUproVET. Those two organizations have more than 100 VET providers as their members, so we are sure that our topics will be met during the periods.\r\nThe subjects during the period are pedagogical and organization management, quality management, HR and finance management. Periods are planned so that 3 persons will move to AoC targets and during the other mobility period 2 persons to MBORaad.", "http://www.warrington.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA116-034419_16"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["8WA", "RTV", "HOLLINS PARK HOSPITAL LEARNING DISABILITY"], ["8WA", "RTV", "HOLLINS PARK HOSPITAL OLDER PERSONS"], ["8DB", "RWW", "ST MARY'S HOSPITAL"], ["8WA", "RY2", "HOLLINS PARK HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WA2"}
