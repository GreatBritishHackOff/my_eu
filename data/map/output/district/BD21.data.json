The proposed system will extract heat from the autoclave to match existing cooling rates that are specified by material manufacturers. The heat will be stored in a specially designed thermal store at the highest enthalpy possible to maximise opportunities for re-use. We aim to reduce initial energy use in the autoclave by at least 25% through reduction of the autoclave headspace and recover 50% of the energy wasted at the end of the autoclave processing stage for re-use in other energy intensive heating processes such as the post cure process. In addition, we aim to recover compressed air (with its intrinsic compression energy and heat from the autoclave) and heat from the air compressors that create the 7 to 10 bar pressure and integrate this with the system.\n\nOur proposed technology would have a major impact on end-users and the environment. In summary we could achieve energy savings of 639,000 kWhr per system p.a; equating to \u20ac66,000 in end-user increased gross profit potential per system p.a. and would reduce CO2 emissions by 318 Tonnes p.a.", 99093.0, 1192696.0, "ENRSYS", "Recovering energy from autoclaves", "Engineers are advancing a system to recover energy from industrial autoclaves. The system is expected to provide cost savings and environmental benefits.", "Autoclaves are used in manufacturing to cure composite materials at high temperatures and pressures. There are currently over 2\u00a0000 active industrial autoclaves in the world, and, after each curing cycle, excess heat and pressure is simply released into the environment.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Integrated thermal energy reduction, recovery  &  re-use in autoclave based composites processing' (http://www.enrsys.eu (ENRSYS)) project is advancing a prototype system to recover that excess energy for reuse.\n\nInitially, researchers identified the major sources of recoverable energy. This included heat energy released from cooling autoclave water and fan motors, and kinetic energy from the release of air pressure.\n\nThey also generated a large body of knowledge related to the efficiency, system constraints and operation of composite curing systems. This work forms part of the research needed to inform the design of a prototype that could be integrated into a real-world operational environment.\n\nENRSYS estimates indicate that yearly savings of between EUR\u00a040\u00a0000 and 80\u00a0000 could be obtained by implementing the energy-recovery system in development.

To date it has developed (ahead of schedule) a new transdermal toxin and a new Pest Control Device using an aerosol to deliver the toxin.\nWith the EU ban on warfarins due to take effect in 2014 we believe that this project is not just viable but essential to offer the EU a product that is effective, safe and environmentally friendly. Rats and mice carry over 60 diseases that can be transmitted to man and cause damage to crops,buildings and infrastructure which costs billions of euros a year.The ever increasing rat population needs to be controlled. Rats have developed a tolerance to currently used warfarins, our product addresses this problem as one shot=one kill. Although toxic to rats our product is safe for humans and other species, resulting in a safe pest control system with a lower environmental toxic load and a lower carbon footprint than other methods.\nThe aim of PiedpiperDA is to fill the gap between the development of the new technology and bring it to market.

The increase of the capacity to perform nano-safety assessment will be realised by innovative instrumentation developments for HTP and high content analysis (HCA) approaches. Toxicogenomics on chip is also one embedded objective. Our interdisciplinary approach focuses on tools to maximise the read-across and to assess applicable endpoints for advanced risk assessment of nanomaterials (NM). The main goal is thus to establish individual chip-based microfluidic tools as devices for (nano)toxicity screening which can be combined as an on-line HTP platform. Seven different chip-based sensor elements will be developed and hierarchically combined via a flow system to characterise toxicity pathways of NM. The HISENTS platform allows the grouping and identifying of NM. Parallel to the screening, the pathway and interaction of NM in biological organisms will be simulated using the physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. Using the different sensor modules from the molecular to cell to organ level, HISENTS can input quantitative parameters into the PBPK model resulting in an effective pathway analysis for NM and other critical compounds. The developed platform is crucial for realistic nano-safety assessment and will also find extensive application in pharmaceutical screening due to the flexible modifications of the HTP platform. The specific objective is the development of a multimodular HTP platform as new a screening tool for enhancing the efficiency of hazard profiling.
