It will achieve this through a comprehensive and experienced European partnership covering all key actors across the food supply chain, including regulatory, business, NGOs and knowledge institutes, all with strong links to consumer organisations. FUSIONS will establish a tiered European multi-stakeholder Platform to generate a shared vision and strategy to prevent food loss and reduce food waste across the supply chain through social innovation: new ideas (products, services and models) that simultaneously meet social needs (more effectively than alternatives) and create new social relationships or collaborations.\n\nThe overall aim of the project is to contribute significantly to the harmonisation of food waste monitoring, feasibility of social innovative measures for optimised food use in the food chain and the development of a Common Food Waste Policy for EU27. Utilising the policy and behavioural change recommendations from the delivery of the key objectives, the FUSIONS European multi-stakeholder platform will enable, encourage, engage and support key actors across Europe in delivering a 50% reduction in food waste and a 20% reduction in the food chains resource inputs by 2020.", 333515.0, 3991903.0, "FUSIONS", "Drastically reducing Europe's food waste", "An estimated one third of global food production is not consumed.

Researchers suggested methods for standardising the ways in which food waste data are collected, analysed and utilised across the EU. They identified the drivers and causes of food waste and mechanisms for reducing it.\n\nResearchers also assessed the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of food waste, and reviewed EU and national legislation influencing socially innovative measures to reduce food waste in the supply chain.\n\nA European multi-stakeholder platform was set up comprising more than 185 members from leading European organisations. The platform is being supported by a series of meetings in different regions aimed at exchanging ideas and making recommendations for food waste reduction.\n\nProject members mapped and analysed existing legislation and policies that impact food waste in Member States, and evaluated current food waste trends. A report on how to stimulate social innovation through policy measures has been drafted.\n\nThrough the delivery of seven feasibility studies, FUSIONS demonstrates the impact of social innovation in preventing food waste, their up-scaling potential, and connection to the policy and governmental measures that are enabling change. In 2015 FUSIONS engaged with networks of social innovation entrepreneurs to encourage replication and to facilitate new business development.\n\nFUSIONS outcomes are responding to the major resource efficiency challenges introduced by food waste.

They do not corrode; have a longer predicted service life, leading to less frequent replacement; they are less expensive to install due to their light weight and flexibility; and have significantly lower leakage rates due to having an all-welded system. However, their more widespread use is being restricted by the lack of a reliable non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method for the welded joints. Pipeline leakage does not only cause high repair costs but can also result in disastrous environmental consequences and even in loss of life. This project will develop phased array ultrasonic NDE procedures for butt fusion and electrofusion joints in PE pipes of diameters up to 1m and also for pipes in other plastics materials, including PVC, ABS, PP and PVDF. In addition, the project will also develop an automated inspection system that will be able to inspect pipe-to-pipe and pipe-to-fitting (elbows, bends, reducers, tees, etc) butt and socket joints in various plastic pipe materials and diameters between 90 and 1000mm. The development will be made by manufacturing welded joints containing known flaws. The NDE data will be analysed to determine the limits of flaw detection for each technique. In parallel, the significance of flaw size and quantity will be established in relation to service requirements. This will be achieved by long-term mechanical testing of joints containing known flaws, and comparison with results for welds containing no flaws.

Until now, testing the joints in PE pipes required weld removal for mechanical testing or visual inspection.\n\nThe EU-funded project http://www.testpep.eu/ (TESTPEP) developed an automated phased-array ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation (NDE) system. This enables the volumetric analysis of welds in PE pipes, either during production or retrospectively. The team successfully optimised all the main system components and characterised ultrasound propagation for both medium density and high density PE pipe materials.\n\nProcedures were then developed to insert planar flaws and particulate contamination into both butt fusion and electrofusion welds. Following this, numerous welds with variable flaws were manufactured to develop inspection procedures and flaw acceptance criteria, based on both short-term and long-term mechanical performance.\n\nResearchers designed and manufactured novel phased-array probes and different probe holders and attachment mechanisms for the modular scanning system. These are capable of inspecting welds in PE pipes of diameters ranging from 180 to 710 millimetres.\n\nAutomated software analyses the inspection data, generating a map of the weld and comparing results with acceptance criteria. The complete prototype phased array ultrasonic inspection system has been assessed in the laboratory, during manufacturing and in the field. In the assessment trials, the system successfully detected all major flaw types of interest to the European plastics pipes industry.\n\nTESTPEPs ultrasound-based NDE technology for welds in plastic piping fills a critical industry need for standardised flaw detection and acceptance criteria. Information about the project including brochures, magazine articles, conference papers and videos can be found in over 25 publications on the project\u2019s website.
