Its objective is to articulate in more detail the aspirations of the Social Investment Programme, to provide a means for assessing the social costs and benefits of various ways of providing long-term care for the frail elderly, and to present examples of approaches that do indeed, facilitate provision in a way that social benefits are achieved. More specifically, SPRINT will: identify the current landscape of organisation and resourcing of LTC in Europe in order to understand the place in the discussion that social investment currently has and how the principles of social investment used to improve provision in a fashion that is welfare enhancing; investigate how the different resourcing and delivery forms of LTC create social and economic returns, outcomes and social impact and to determine their success factors; evaluate the fiscal and social costs and benefits of various national approaches to LTC delivery; establish a common vocabulary for social investing and for the financing mechanisms of long-term care; identify the most appropriate frameworks for the definition and analysis of social impact of LTC programmes; define the principles for incorporating social considerations in funding decisions of LTC policies and to analyse their relationship with the social innovations addressing the challenges of demographic ageing and of inequities in access to care; develop appropriate instruments, such as the Feasibility Framework Tool, the assessment scales, thresholds and the Impact Map, which will ensure successful implementation of investment in LTC by public authorities, social insurance funds and private investors; create a model of investment in the care sector, emphasizing in social innovations that will be correlated with the broad economic policies;  and propose reforms at policy levels.", 133158.0, 1571859.0, "SPRINT", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_196887_968548008"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["3DX", "Lead Partner Management Costs", "East Lothian Council", "Strategic Intervention management, administration and compliance.", "ESF", 94585.17, 236462.91, "esf_scotland_173"], ["3DX", "Pipeline to employment - East Lothian", "East Lothian Council", "The pipeline approach will offer a package of tailored support depending on the needs of the individual.
