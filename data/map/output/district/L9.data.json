Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is the reference standard for the diagnosis of CAD and allows immediate therapy. However, only 40% of patients undergoing ICA actually have obstructive CAD and ICA has relatively rare but considerable risks. Coronary computed tomography (CT) is the most accurate diagnostic test for CAD currently available. CT may become the most effective strategy to reduce the ca. 2 million annual negative ICAs in Europe by enabling early and safe discharge of the majority of patients with an intermediate risk of CAD.\nTo evaluate this, we propose the DISCHARGE project that will be implemented by a multinational European consortium. The core of the project is the DISCHARGE pragmatic randomised controlled trial. The primary hypothesis will be that CT is superior to ICA for major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke) after a maximum follow-up of 4 years in a selected broad population of stable chest pain patients with intermediate pretest likelihood of CAD. The trial will include 25 clinical sites from 16 European countries ensuring broad geographical representation. Comparative effectiveness research of complementing work packages include gender-related analysis, systematic review of evidence, cost-effectiveness analysis, and health-related quality of life. DISCHARGE has the capability to influence current standards and guidelines as well as coverage decisions and will raise awareness among patients, health care providers, and decision-makers in Europe about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of coronary CT angiography.", 108296.0, 6307636.0, "DISCHARGE", null, null, null, "http://www.dischargetrial.eu", "http://www.aintreehospitals.nhs.uk", null, "fp7_110447_952657759"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["1NL", "RBN", "WALTON HOSPITAL RICE LANE"], ["7AL", "RBN", "UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL AINTREE"], ["1NL", "REM", "WALTON HOSPITAL"], ["7AL", "REM", "UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL AINTREE"], ["7AL", "RET", "AINTREE HOSPITALS - OPD"], ["7AL", "RJE", "AINTREE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL NHS FOUNDATION TRUST"], ["7AL", "RQ6", "UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL AINTREE"], ["7AL", "RTV", "AINTREE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL"], ["1EP", "RW4", "CLOCK VIEW HOSPITAL"], ["7AL", "RW4", "MERSEY CARE NHS TRUST AT AINTREE HOSPITAL"], ["7LJ", "RWW", "WALTON HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "L9"}
