These activities reinforce pride in cultural roots, encourage a sense of place and belonging as well as aiding in the development of social, technical and creative skills. Creative programming enables and allows us to explore aspects of our cultural heritage and aspects of our changing identities. \r\n\r\nAll partners in this project strongly believe that creativity is a strong tool to activate and empower youth, to (informally) teach them how to communicate with others, including those with different cultural backgrounds and ultimately how to contribute to the development of an equal and diverse society. These are strong statements, but we carry with us the experience of several years in the field of youth and creativity and we know how creative projects can change the minds of youth in a positive way and we know how it can open new future opportunities. This is the main reason we will continue to bring youth from several deprived neighborhoods in different European cities together, on location in Amsterdam Nieuw-West\r\n \r\nIn earlier years the focal point of these exchange projects was working towards a carnival parade, to celebrate diversity. The Erasmus+ participants joined local people in this parade. We managed to involve the hard to reach local target groups better every year, but we sensed that we could enrich the program and the experience for the Erasmus+ participants and to give them even more influence and tasks in setting up and executing the activities. For that reason we also started to collaborate closely with the Shokkin Group (affiliated partner).\r\n\r\nSo Celebrate Creativity - more than previous projects - focuses on social inclusion of vulnerable youth through meeting, sharing, co-organizing and giving community- workshops. We focus both on international youth, who can meet in the framework of the exchange we organize and the local youth that will benefit from working with international peers.  It will expand the horizons of both the international as well as the local participants and it will encourage intercultural communication on different levels. \r\n\r\nWe take creativity in the broadest sense and do not limit ourselves to a specific discipline. The youth joining the project bring in their own creative skills, passion and energy. As they are the core of the exchange, they will completely determine the content of the activities. The partners and the project coordinator just offer the framework, including contacts with organizations working with local youth. \r\n\r\nWe want to address the following issues and needs:\r\n\u2022 Inclusion of local youth in the project through workshops\r\n\u2022 Developing the participant\u2019s abilities to work on an intercultural project.\r\n\u2022 Producing creative outputs that celebrate European diversity and active citizenship.\r\n\u2022 Developing group work skills.\r\n\u2022 Developing the project management skills.\r\n\r\nWe set ourselves the following objectives by the following means:\r\n\r\n-To give the participants (more) life skills: by exploring and sharing skills through creative workshops, and celebrate creativity and diversity, through collaborative performance work; \r\n-Open up the minds of the youth participants: by exploring and celebrating the diversity of young people\u2019s histories, traditions and cultures through creativity; \r\n-To develop and strenghten the partner organizations in their creative work in their communities: by exploring the processes used to build and present creative work that celebrates European cultural diversity and impacts on ideas of European citizenship; \r\n-to improve the skills of the participants of working collectively in an intercultural environment;  \r\n- to develop their social, personal and group work skills: by giving them the opportunity to work in mixed nations and mixed gender groups;\r\n- to develop their ability to act as an active citizen in their own community: by giving them the experience of having taken part in peer led skills sharing workshops in local community contexts.", "http://www.brouhaha.uk.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL02-KA105-001609_3"], ["1YR", "Roots & Routes Experience 2017: Heroes!", "BROUHAHA INTERNATIONAL", 23674.0, "ROOTS & ROUTES Experience 2017 is an international exchange program with 30 participants from Lithuania, Romania, Germany, France, UK and The Netherlands. The project will run from July 9, 2017 untill July 23, 2017 held in Rotterdam. During these two weeks, participants will receive an intensive full time workshop program which is based on the concepts of learning by doing and peer education.\r\n\r\nIn 2017 we will work with the theme: Heroes. Heroes play an exemplary role, this is something people need, so they can learn from others. Europe also needs heroes and positive role models to create more cohesion and less division. The participants will be asked to choose their own hero. The underlying story connects participants and gives a direct cause to start talking to each other. It is important to think, especially in this era of negativity, exclusion, prejudice, discrimination who our heroes are and what we can contribute ourselves to the world. We give the participants food for thought, also once back at home. Political philosopher Gerard Drosterij will spark the conversation with and between the participants.\r\n\r\nDuring the Experience, participants will together work on a final performance . In June, a preparation meeting will take place with the coaches, motivators and part of the participants. They will further develop the theme and brainstorm about the final product. The R & R Experience in July consists of a workshop period of two weeks, with creation sessions and workshops / masterclasses. The participants choose 1 main disciplines: music, spoken word, dance and media. We will invite masters and role models who will inspire participants and will tell a personal story about their heroes. We also organize workshops in 'presenting yourself', 'Impact of Media', 'what can you contribute themselves to the world\u2019 etc.\r\n\r\nAim & Results \r\nThe aim of R & R Experience is to make a connection between the world of young people and the international context in which they live; the vision on this differs from country to country. Personal contact between young people from different countries is the best way to make them aware of it and start a dialogue between them. By connecting a social theme to artistic content R & R aims at stimulating and inspiring European youth to form an opinion and to express themselves. The international dimension allows their artistic-cultural but also their social-political horizon to widen. At least 30 young people from 6 countries and appr. 5 coaches and 10 guest teachers contribute to this project, resulting in a jointly-created final performance by the youngsters.\r\n\r\nImpact \r\nFrom our extensive experience with international exchanges, we know that it has a considerable impact on social, personal, social and artistic & intercultural development of participants. Participants often talk about a life-changing experience. We illustrate a few important effects: The participants during the Experience learn to share their opinions or ideas in front of a group and feel that their opinion matters. Many gain friendships and build their professional network. Participants learn a lot from the coaches but more importantly, also from their peers. Some participants during the Experience meet people from other countries for the first time and gain more experience in working with people from different cultural backgrounds. Reflecting on and discussing a relevant social theme is also for many participants something they have not done before (in this way). With the Experience we create a safe space in which participants discover who they are and what they stand for, surrounded by peers and role models. At the same time we encourage \u2018thinking-out-of-the-box' that bring participants into contact with people, views, cultures, flavors etc which they otherwise would not easily encounter. Via our method youth increase their self-confidence and learn to reflect on their own abilities.", "http://www.brouhaha.uk.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL02-KA105-001615_4"], ["1YR", "Same Love, Same Rights \u2013 Young Arts for LGBTI+ Equality", "BROUHAHA INTERNATIONAL", 62277.0, "The project \u201cSame Love, Same Rights \u2013 Young Arts for LGBTI+ Equality\u201d (SLSR+) will develop and implement experimental artistic and medial approaches to empower young people with diverse sexual orientations and gender-self-definitions to reach other young people with strong messages promoting LGBTTIQ+ and gender equality and combating LGBTTIQ+/gender-based discrimination.\r\n \r\nRecent research has shown that gender inequality, anti-LGBTTIQ+ discrimination and hate crime still persist all over Europe, rooted in heteronormative discourses and rigid gender concepts. Biased hetero-normative world-views and rigid gender roles are often already internalized by children and harden with increasing age. To combat and prevent sexual orientation or gender based discrimination, cultural surroundings of young people need to be addressed. \r\n\r\nThe SLSR project will work with the cultural context of many young people in present-day Europe: Urban Cultures, having strong influence on young people\u2019s understanding of the world, their language and behaviour.

So great is the uncertainty about the political direction of travel in Europe that on a daily basis we continue to see a rolling back of personal freedoms, a threat to democratic values and human rights. We now see the mainstreaming of far-right, anti-immigration anti-Islam homophobic extremists, validating hate speech and encouraging discrimination and hatred against people with \u2018protected characteristics\u2019. \r\n\r\nHow do we respond to the challenges facing young people with 'protected characteristics' ? Our response is to challenge the direction of political travel, through firstly developing and delivering an arts engagement mobility experience that brings people together from different backgrounds and perspectives to explore create and present collaborative work at large-scale cultural events which encourages people to celebrate the richness and diversity of a multicultural multi-faith contemporary European society. \r\n\r\nWhat we want to carry out: The main aim of the youth exchange is  to develop collaborative performing arts work that  promotes, develops and conveys the key message of \u2018Our diversity shapes our Creativity\u2019 as well as presenting collaborative work that offers a counter narrative to migration and immigration. Through collaborative workshops supported by professional artists and within peer led sessions our project will see creative work carried out that assist in developing key skills and competencies, enabling young people to successfully develop carnival arts work that offers audiences different views on what is happing in Europe in order to expose some of the myths being presented as 'real news' (for example issues around migration and immigration). \r\n\r\nCollaborative performance work will be presented within our annual festival events in Dublin with the projects messages reaching hundreds of people as well as workshop sessions delivered within cultural and community venues across Dublin.
