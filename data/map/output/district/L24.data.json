The process is assisted by solar radiation, nutrients and sea water microalgae. This approach is based on the technology developed by the Partner Biofuel Systems (BFS) to produce bio-oil. In order to develop such technology, several innovative approaches are proposed:\n- New algae strains production optimization and CO2 energetic balance improvement.\n-Optimization of photo-bioreactors\n- Study and adaptation of separation of algae components based on hybrid technologies.\n- Production of algae derived chemicals for surfactants applications and amino acids for food applications\n- Production of bio-based resins from algae based fatty acids and bio-oil aromatic moieties.\nSimilar studies have been carried out at laboratory level to obtain a broad range of algae derived chemicals, however BISIGODOS\u2019 project aims to work at semi-industrial scale using the BFS industrial photo-bioreactors facilities.

To be both, applicable and competitive, the novel solution will have to respond to specific needs, namely:\n\n(1) High energy efficiency and density;\n(2) Small size and low weight;\n(3) High reliability;\n(4) Compliance with existing standards and regulation; and\n(5) High cost-efficiency.\n\nAny energy storage system will have to first demonstrate its ability to store energy efficiently, within specific power, lifetime and safety specifications and eventually be available at a cost that is ultimately affordable by the nano/microsatellite sector, which is highly cost-sensitive.\n\nWorldwide nanosatellite sector is continuously growing and three main aspects are driving the development: miniaturization, standardization and cost. However Europe has seriously fallen behind competitors from the US and Asia, with regard to R&D in the field of energy storage, which is one of the crucial components for improving and widening small satellites performance and applications.\n\nWith its approach, MONBASA is bridging the gap between R&D and market, with the desired future impact being that the provision of tailored energy solutions becomes a European discipline and business. By bringing together a cross-sector consortium that comprises actors from the areas of energy R&D, processing technologies and space applications, the exact needs of the space industry will be considered for innovative energy storage solutions at low TRL levels. This will not only significantly increase future market uptake of a novel solution that so far is in the state of basic research, but it will foster urgently needed intense knowledge exchange between non-space and space actors for jointly developing novel solutions for a field of expectedly strong growth.", 153345.0, 1093339.0, "MONBASA", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_200831_935938063"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9HZ", "Living SustainAbility", "European Playwork Association", 23052.0, "With this project we are adressing active citizenship, not in terms of the political involvement of young people, moreover we are focusing on a citizens\u2019 participation within the sustainable development framework. \r\n\r\nWith time, we have gotten used to hearing the term sustainability very often in different contexts and cases, by people with different backgrouds, that somehow we take it for granted, without even understanding the real meaning of the word.

The activities put the focus on participants' own contributions: preparation of an interactive workshop on the theme \"Diversity/ Human Rights\" as well as a presentation of their own community, organisation and their group on a poster and video. An Inter-cultural Evening invites the groups to cook and share their favourite dishes and perform a dance/song/sketch etc. The foundation for learning processes is a safe, trusting and respectful environment, encouraging young people to discover, discuss, work and play.\r\n\r\nIn this context the expected results of our International youth exchange are: a new discovery and more profound  knowledge of Human Rights, linked to the understanding of the relevance for the daily life of the participants; awareness of the necessity to defend and promote Human Rights; a dignified celebration of their Diversity; inclusion of - or better invitation for - young people with fewer opportunities to experience youth mobility and European solidarity.\r\n\r\nThe impacts of the exchange for young people are new insights and confident understanding of thematic aspects like Human Rights, Diversity, Equality, the reflexion of own prejudices, learning new skills and gaining competences, experiencing and valuing of multicultural friendship.\r\n\r\nThe participating organisations benefit from the new experiences and methods in non-formal and inter-cultural work, increasing their intercultural competences, language and communication skills.

The project fosters youth empowerment, intercultural dialogue and international networking in partner groups, supports their democratic and participative community development by creating conditions for young people to raise their voice for their rights. \r\nIn this context the objectives of our International Training Course in Hamburg are for the youth workers: to enhance their media literacy and their understanding of how to encourage the participation of their young people to nourish their civil societies, by widening their practical media skills and bringing the new competence into the following Youth Exchange.\r\nThe objectives of our Youth Exchange in Portugal are: to encourage the participants to become pro-active, critical and use their social, intercultural and media skills, key competences in non-formal education and citizenship, strengthening youth participation in their communities and to work with young people to develop awareness for equal rights and respecting diversity. \r\nThe Participants in the Training are youth workers, working face to face with disadvantaged young people in deprived communites from Programm- and Partner countries. \r\nThe Participants in the APV and Youth Exchange are young people aged between 16 and 25 years, coming from communities with fewer opportunities in 7 European cities: from Roma / Gitana comunities in M\u00e1laga and Kop\u010dany in Bratislava, Maribor in Slovenia; from Page Moss/Walton/Speke in Liverpool, Tavola Tonda in Palermo, St. Pauli in Hamburg, hosted by the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o de Interajuda- Eco-estilistas, active in the socially deprived bairros: Malvinas-C\u00e2mara de Lobos and Chelas, Lisbon.
