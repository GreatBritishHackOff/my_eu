The mobility allows the students to improve their linguistics competences, as well as their professional and personal development. They will achieve the maturity and the autonomy that only an abroad period can provide.\r\nAll of them will be recognized in the Europass Mobility document. In addition, students will learn about the healthcare system in other countries.\r\nParticipants will be selected based on their academic record, language level and other transversal competences.\r\n\r\nThe main activities are as follows: \r\n- July 2017: 3 mobilities in United Kingdom, in France and in Italy, for students in administrative services.\r\n- March-May 2018: 1 mobility in Malta, 2 in United Kingdom, 2 in France and 2 in Italy for VET students in nursing or social care. \r\n\r\nThis project not only will have an impact for the participants, but for every student in EFA Torrealedua, for the staff and public in general, thanks to the maximum spreading through the webpage (www.torrealedua.com), talks, regional newspaper and so on.\r\n\r\nBecause EFA Torrealedua is a rural school, the students are afraid to participate in a mobility programme. With the spread we expect to increase the number of mobilities in the future, to open up the student's mind, making them aware of the importance of acquiring linguistic skills,\u2026\r\nDifferent activities will take place to evaluate the project, as surveys to participants, students and teachers, both before and after the mobility. The results will allow us to study the influence of the Erasmus project in our school.\r\nWith this project we expect to increase the EFA Torrealedua prestige and we would like to become a reference centre in European projects  in the future.", "http://www.lbtuk.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-035658_6"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["4SJ", "Kingmoor Park Central Carlisle", "Kingmoor Park Properties Limited", "This project involves the development of 2.08 hectares of development land at Kingmoor Park, Carlisle to provide 5,058 m\u00b2 (54,444 ft\u00b2) of speculative business workspace.
