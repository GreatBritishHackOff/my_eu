To achieve this, EPAD will also provide the analytical infrastructure to make correct observations regarding an intervention\u2019s value as an agent for secondary prevention. All this must exist in the right ethical, legal and social context. It must also be sustainable by being of value to numerous partners and stakeholders in the long term. The EPAD Consortium has been carefully designed to achieve the aim of secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nCurrent and recent drug development programmes in AD have been limited through the collection of heterogeneous samples of patients with advanced brain disease and an inability to measure effectively an index of disease course modification.\nRecruiting participants from clinics and the community for AD prevention trials with limited clinical background is both a risky and cost-inefficient strategy. Creating a disease register of people consented to enter secondary prevention trials delivers a degree of readiness that ensures better knowledge of a participants suitability and a more rapid throughput of screening for the trials. The EPAD Consortium has the necessary reach and influence from its partners to develop such a \u2018readiness\u2019 cohort.\nBy delivering an earlier, risk stratified population with run-in data in the EPAD Cohort across both clinical and biological domains; we can ensure a more homogenous population for study. We can also track changes in disease status as the basis for deciding on an intervention or combination of interventions likelihood of success in larger Phase 3 confirmatory trials.\nMost of the scientific community still consider A\uf062 dysregulation as central to AD so targeting this pathological process is a rational first step in what will be a standing trial.

However, assessing the expected future value of the medicines when used in \u201creal world\u201d clinical practice requires additional information next to traditional (pre-authorisation) clinical trials.  Regulatory, HTA agencies and other healthcare decision makers have to make decisions on authorisation and access under conditions of uncertainty.  Currently, data packages which aim to minimise uncertainty on safety and efficacy may leave significant uncertainty in assessments of real world effectiveness of new medicines.  This results in further research commitments required post-authorisation (PASS, PAES, Reimbursement with Evidence Generation), and wide variability in access to medicines between countries. \nThe subsequent uncertainty relating to the reimbursement, and thus market implementation of new medication once approved by regulatory authorities, is negatively affecting the value of the drug development pipeline. The costly clinical developments to get to market approval, no longer seem to be a guarantee for market entry. This new risk presents a serious additional hurdle for drug developers that already face pipeline attrition. It also affects the speed and level of patient access, and therefore the extent to which patients and society might benefit from new medicines. \nIn recent years there has been considerable attention paid to the post-authorisation evaluation of treatments in real world clinical practice: study design and analytical methodology for assessing relative effectiveness; and use of registries and electronic healthcare data.  It may be possible to improve the value of information available at initial market authorisation by incorporating these techniques into pre-authorisation drug development.  HTA bodies, regulators, will become able to make better-informed decisions, and developers of new medicines will be able to direct development efforts to areas where value is most likely to be delivered to patients and health care systems, improving the efficiency of the whole medicine development chain. \nHowever, the adoption of real world / relative effectiveness objectives in a pre-authorisation development strategy has many operational, methodological, regulatory, and ethical issues and Pharmaceutical R&D organisations need more certainty as to: the impact of development choices on the regulatory review process; the value of different programmes to HTA bodies and other decision makers; the best balance of pre-launch and post-launch effectiveness research and the coordination of various post-authorisation commitments.

The aim is to demonstrate an impact on health markers such as blood pressure, but also how RCTs should be undertaken for food compounds. Prior to these studies, the compounds/foods being tested in the trials were developed and fully characterised. In vitro models for determining bioavailability, absorption and metabolism of the tested compounds have been developed and assessed. Metabolites of the bioactive compounds from these models, plus some that have already been synthesised during the project, will be assessed for their mechanisms of action in vitro. Models and protocols for establishing their effects, such as oxidative stress and platelet activity, have also been set-up and tested.\n\nhttp://ebasis.eurofir.org (eBASIS), a unique database that contains critically evaluated published data on the content and biological effects of bioactive constituents in plant based foods has been extended to incorporate data on meats, specifically bioactive peptides.

This project will concentrate on Schizophrenia (SZ), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), and Major Depression (MD), as these disorders share part of their symptomatology, in particular social withdrawal and certain cognitive deficits, such as deficits in attention, working memory and sensory processing. By applying innovative technologies (e.g. EEG, cognitive tasks, (f)MRI, smartphone monitoring, and (epi-)genetics) to deep phenotype a clinical cohort of SZ and AD patients combined with a wider analysis of existing clinical data sets from major European and global disease cohorts that also include MD, we will define a set of quantifiable biological parameters best able to cluster and differentiate SZ, AD, and MD patients that do, or do not, exhibit social withdrawal. First, by mining large European SZ, AD and MD cohort datasets with already available social and cognitive proxy measures, and, second, by obtaining objective measures of social exploration levels (using a novel smartphone application), phenotypic relationships with social and cognitive measures will be further tested. For instance we might predict that socially withdrawn individuals may have lower cognitive functioning and poorer clinical course compared to those who are more socially engaged. The two approaches will then come together via selected individuals with low or high social withdrawal who have also been assessed in the deep phenotyping study using integrated behavioural, cognitive, attentional, sensory processing, EEG, and MRI data.\nIn phase I of the project (years 1-3), the clinical deep phenotyping study will provide a proof-of-concept analysis for this quantitative biological approach and will concentrate on SZ and AD patients. To identify shared genetic factors potentially related to the social withdrawal symptom and cognitive deficits observed in these disorders, a cross-disorder genome-wide genetic analysis will be performed in the largest world-wide available samples of SZ, AD, and MD patients. Genetic associations from the global cohorts will be evaluated for their relevance for social withdrawal and cognitive deficits in subsamples with relevant (proxy) phenotypes in large and available European cohorts that have genetic data and clinical proxy data on social withdrawal, sensory processing, attention and working memory available. Data integration of genetic and epigenetic studies through an innovative molecular landscaping approach will lead to the identification of new biological substrates and candidate genes underlying these phenotypic domains.

Our ambition is to involve all three multiplex circuits in this live-broadcast premiere event, as well as the independent cinemas that will screen on release, allowing audiences across both territories unprecedented access to a day-and-date film.

By experimenting with a high-profile, critically-acclaimed and commercially appealing film such as Tale of Tales, which we are confident can reach a wider audience than any day-and-date release so far, we will be able to demonstrate to the European film industry a business model for successful innovation with regards to multiplatform releasing, which is undoubtedly the future of independent film distribution.", null, "CURZON FILM WORLD LIMITED", "creative_570308-CREA-1-2015-1-UK-MED-VOD_coordinator"], ["5LR", "CURZON HOME CINEMA", "CURZON CINEMAS LIMITED", 284128.0, "Curzon\u2019s unique proposition offers customers the opportunity to watch quality films when and where they want to, both in one of our Public Cinemas and/or on the same day in their own Home Cinemas.
