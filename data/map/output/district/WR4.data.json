Very recently, the European rail industry has started showing signs of recovery after a long period of steady decline. The technological advances in train design during the last few decades have led to the manufacturing of faster and more comfortable trains making rail transport a more attractive option for passengers in comparison to other means of transportation. The need for the society to employ greener transportation policies is expected to further enhance the role of rail transport in the global economy. Today rail networks across Europe are getting busier with trains travelling at higher speeds, carrying more passengers and heavier axle loads than ever before. The combination of these factors has put considerable pressure on the existing infrastructure, leading to increased demands in inspection and maintenance of rail assets. The expenditure for inspection and maintenance has thus, grown steadily over the last few years without however being followed by a significant improvement of the industry\u2019s safety records. A large proportion of all equipment related accidents in the rail industry is due to failed train wheels and axles. The continuous increase in train operating speeds means that catastrophic failure of a wheel or axle may result in very serious derailments, such as the one that took place in Eschede, Germany in 1998, causing loss of life, injuries, severe disruption in the operation of the network, damage to the tracks, unnecessary costs, and loss of confidence in rail transport by the general public. SAFERAIL seeks to minimise wheelset failures by developing and successfully implementing a novel on-line system for the inspection of wheels and axles of moving trains, and a combined ultrasonic-electromagnetic system for faster and more reliable inspection of the quality of new and old wheelsets during their production and maintenance.", 72749.0, 3875910.0, "SAFERAIL", "Reinventing the wheel", "Train wheels and wheel sets must be at their most reliable if Europe is to reduce fatal accidents and ensure the rail sector's viability. A new project is working on new safety technology in this respect.", "With advances in rail technology, concerns for the environment and the rising importance of efficient public transport, the rail industry in Europe is seeing a turnaround. Faster and more comfortable trains are making rail transport a more attractive option as they are now capable of carrying more passengers and heavier axle loads than ever before. This puts considerable pressure on the existing infrastructure, leading to increased inspection and maintenance of rail assets. While inspection and maintenance costs have grown steadily in recent years, no significant improvement of the industry's safety records has been observed.\n\nMany rail accidents are due to failed train wheels and axles, where derailment can have catastrophic results at high speeds. The EU-funded 'Development of novel inspection systems for railway wheelsets' (Saferail) project is developing and successfully implementing a novel online system to inspect wheels and axles of moving trains and upgrade safety standards. It is proposing a combined ultrasonic-electromagnetic system for faster and more reliable inspection of new and old wheel sets during their production and maintenance.\n\nIn recent years, rail accidents in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have highlighted the need for better safety measures. In 1996, a freight train accident occurred due to an axle failure in Rickerscote, UK; it resulted in the death of one person and injury of several others. The 1998 accident in Eschede, Germany, initiated by a single failed wheel, caused the death of more than 100 passengers and 88 severe injuries. More recently, the S-Bahn derailment at Kaulsdorf, Germany in 2009 was brought about by a wheel set failure. As rail networks become busier and train speeds increase, the number of incidents linked to failed train wheel sets is expected to grow. Yet minimising wheel set failures also helps reduce maintenance costs, representing an important consideration for both train and light rail vehicle operators.\n\nCurrent available online systems detect severe wheel set defects just before they result in a catastrophic failure. Consequently, severe surface-breaking or deep internal defects are not being properly detected until the defective wheel set is taken out of service for inspection and maintenance.\n\nIn other words, the current technology deployed cannot inspect wheel sets with maximum reliability. The Saferail project is very close to developing the necessary technology for reliable and accurate inspection of wheel sets online, as well as during their production and maintenance. This technology will improve reliability and punctuality, and more importantly, decrease the number of fatal rail accidents on the tracks.", null, "http://www.vtg-rail.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2011-04/45852.jpg", "fp7_89883_998711031"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["9NE", "Worcestershire Business Central \u2013 Growth Hub", "Herefordshire and Worcestershire Chamber of Commerce", "The project is the delivery of a business support service by Worcestershire Business Central, the Worcestershire Growth Hub,  which will focus on Worcestershire\u2019s \u2018scale up\u2019 i.e. high growth businesses focussing on, but not exclusive to, the priority sectors identified within the Worcestershire Strategic Economic Plan of Agritech, Defence and Security  (including Cyber) Advanced Manufacturing and Growth.
