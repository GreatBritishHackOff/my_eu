Understanding how complex mental functions originate from electrical and chemical processes in brain cells requires a comprehensive and integrated multi-level analysis focused on neuronal assemblies and microcircuits, where myriads of intricately connected neurons with different properties act together. We shall use the coordinator\u2019s recent discovery of entorhinal grid cells \u2013 a key cell type in the network for spatial representation and navigation \u2013 as a model for neuronal computation in non-sensory cortical microcircuits. The crystal-like structure of the firing fields of grid cells provides an entirely new route to access the neuronal interactions responsible for pattern formation in the brain. Using a forceful combination of computational modelling and novel electrophysiological, optical and molecular research tools never applied for circuit analyses in the brain before, we shall establish the mechanisms by which microcircuits in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex encode, maintain and update representations of location as animals move from one place to another. Insights into the underlying computations have considerable translation potential. Understanding the algorithms for spatial navigation may change the way we manage a number of diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which commonly begins in the entorhinal cortex and has topographical disorientation as one of its most reliable symptoms, and it may provide European industry with radically innovative concepts for the design of artificial navigating agents.", 232470.0, 6828320.0, "SPACEBRAIN", null, null, null, "http://www.ntnu.no/cbm/spacebrain", "http://www.axona.com", null, "fp7_88154_999684911"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7ET", "CARAVANA DE SUE\u00d1OS: COOPERACI\u00d3N FAMILIA- ESCUELA", "St Luke's School", 4320.0, "Greater accountability from our school towards the cultural, linguistic and social diversity will cause increased  opportunities for professional development, motivation and satisfaction with the daily work of the teaching staff, creating a more modern, dynamic and professional environment, committed and prepared to integrate best practices and innovative methods in their daily routine, providing meaningful learning situations for students, improving relations with these and their FAMILIES and increasing on the other hand, the ability to participate in international partnerships and  present and future collaborative projects that support the promotion of collaborative activities and mobility for teachers and / or students.\r\nWe aim to improve the quality of our teaching work by developing required teaching skills  especially in terms of communication , conflict resolution , leadership , use of information and communication technologies, planning and organization of project work and learning situations , inter - cultural awareness , entrepreneurship, sense of initiative , collaboration, and knowledge of foreign languages , expanding the knowledge of practices, policies and educational systems in different European countries , causing a greater commitment to active participation of our students , their families , and teachers in the learning process through project work and learning situations that promote the integration of students with special educational needs in daily activities and routines in the class group , and promoting foreign language learning and inter -disciplinary and collaborative  work .\r\nSelected teachers from our school will take part in a job shadowing activity  held at the Lithuanian and British school partners where integrating European projects and collaborative work is already established at very early age,  where they will have opportunities to develop and improve their professional skills, knowledge of foreign languages  and increase their cultural awareness and European values.\r\nThe teachers taking part in these mobilities will provide the school with  new tools and improved skills to meet the new future challenges, disseminating them  throughout the school and the school community, and other schools through information and communication technologies,  and by participation in seminars, eTwinning, CLIL teaching platform in The Canary Islands and other available means.\r\nI\r\nNew methods learned during the mobilities will be integrated into the curriculum of the subjects they teach,  the participating teachers will support other teachers interested in doing the same.

The school also has provision for pupils on the Autistic spectrum in addition to their learning difficulties. pupils . As appropriate to their needs they have access to speech therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and counseling services. The proportion of pupils from low social economic families and those who are looked after by the authority is above the UK national average.\r\n\r\nThe intake of pupils in the school has changed significantly over the last 6 years this has resulted in the need for the school to undertake a change in the curriculum and to audit the teaching approaches, the organisation, and pedagogy to identify the needs of the pupils as they progress through the school and to meet their needs as adults.\r\nThis process has involved all major stakeholders including Governors, teachers, pupils and parents plus other visiting professionals (Speech and Language and Occupational therapists, Autism Advisers etc)\r\nOne of the key outcomes is to make the curriculum more practical and relevant to the students.\r\nThe opportunity to share and to explore how other 'Good practice' Special needs schools and mainstream schools with resourced SEN units across Europe have developed their curriculum and its impact on meeting the needs of their SEN students was a major factor in applying for this KA1 grant. It will facilitate this important research through staff work shadowing placements and attendance at the relevant courses\r\nProject Objectives\r\nTo explore how the schools involved in this KA1 project have developed their curriculum for SEN pupils\r\nTo investigate good practice in these schools and how they can be adapted and included in the curricula offer of St Luke's, to improve our practice.\r\nTo research the management and leadership strategies of the partner schools and share our methodology and compare how this impacts on the outcomes and progress of all our respective pupils.\r\nTo strengthen our approach to practical based learning especially focusing on how these schools use the Outdoors for learning opportunities.\r\nTo exchange and investigate how these schools use ICT to best meet the special educational needs of their pupils\r\nTo explore and integrate the use of ICT tools for the development of the project (eTwinning in particular)\r\nTo exchange experiences with European colleagues \r\nTo improve the teaching and learning skills and competences of teachers, including the middle and leadership teams.\r\nTo access and for selected staff to develop their 'outdoor learning and leadership skills and competences by attending appropriate training \r\n\r\nBy participating in this project the expected impact on staff involved including those back in school who have not taken part in the mobilites or the face to face courses will :\r\nInclude improved knowledge of the special education provision in partner countries \r\nImproved teaching skills and competences acquired either by direct observation or by learning from the feedback and subsequent training from the project participants.  \r\nHave direct impact on the professional development of ALL staff.   The school leaders will have developed further leadership and management skills from the research and discussions with partner school colleagues and attendance at the leader ship course.  \r\nLead to changes in the school organisation, staffing structures, curriculum design or delivery that may well arise from involvement in this project.\r\n\r\nWe hope the impact on pupils will be improved learning outcomes and greater rates of pupil progress will result from the good practices observed as these are introduced in the school. We hope that there will be an exchange of good practice and that the hosts schools will also benefit from our involvement in the project.\r\n\r\nWe hope that the schools involved in this project will continue to work together beyond the completion of this project, researching best methods for teaching pupils with diverse special needs and all become centres of excellence in their respective countries.", "http://www.stlukes.herts.sch.uk", "St Luke's School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036336_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "AL3"}
