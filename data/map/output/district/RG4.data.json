NANOREM\u2019s ambitious objectives are:\n1) Identification of the most appropriate nanoremediation technological approaches to achieve a step change in practical remediation performance. Development of lower cost production techniques and production at commercially relevant scales, also for large scale applications. 2) Determination of the mobility and migration potential of nanoparticles in the subsurface, and their potential to cause harm, focusing on the NP types most likely to be adopted into practical use in the EU.\n3) Development of a comprehensive tool box for field scale observation of nanoremediation performance and determination of the fate of NPs in the subsurface, including analytical methods, field measurement devices, decision support and numerical tools.\n4) Dissemination and dialogue with key stakeholder interests to ensure that research, development and demonstration meets end-user and regulatory requirements and information and knowledge is shared widely across the EU.\n5) Provide applications at representative scales including field sites to validate cost, performance, and fate and transport findings.\nThe NANOREM consortium is multidisciplinary, cross-sectoral and transnational. It includes 28 partners from 12 countries organized in 11 work packages. The consortium includes 18 of the leading nanoremediation research groups in the EU, 10 industry and service providers (8 SMEs) and one organisation with policy and regulatory interest.", 402612.0, 11192716.0, "NANOREM", "Nanotechnology for land remediation", "EU scientists are looking into ways of using nanotechnology to remediate land contaminated by agricultural or industrial waste.", "Recent estimates suggest that there are as many as 2.5 million human-contaminated sites in Europe alone. To achieve the EU's goals of cleaning these up by 2050, more drastic solutions than those currently available need to be researched.\n\nTo address this, the EU-funded http://www.nanorem.eu (NANOREM) project aims to develop and test nanotechnological tools to remediate contaminated land in Europe. NANOREM began by reviewing similar projects around the world, identifying 70 other projects at pilot or commercial scale.\n\nProject members created a number of different nanoparticles, including nano zero valent iron (nZVI) and non-zero valent iron (non ZVI) nanoparticles. These particles can be used to remediate land or water bodies contaminated with industrial waste. The nanoparticles have been through a range of tests to standardise their use in the field.\n\nNANOREM also developed a range of other tests and methods needed for field testing nanoparticle remediation strategies. Finally, the nanoparticles were confirmed to be harmless to terrestrial and aquatic organisms that would be exposed to them.\n\nResearchers are now setting up three large-scale field trials, including artificially contaminating areas for remediation. Once these sites have been established, NANOREM will begin trials to see whether the nanoparticle technology can be used for decontamination at other sites.\n\nIf successful, NANOREM will pave the way to a new era of land remediation through new knowledge and methods.", "http://www.nanorem.eu/", "http://www.r3environmental.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-07/159275.jpg", "fp7_106322_991335733"], ["8NN", "Holistic Management of Brownfield Regeneration", "R3 Environmental Technology Limited", "HOMBRE seeks to achieve a paradigm shift in sustainable brownfield land management practice.
