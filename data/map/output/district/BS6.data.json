A large, robust and consistent evidence base indicates that coordinated, high impact and comprehensive approaches are the most effective way to reduce smoking initiation, prevalence and intensity. Despite this, policy makers and public health procurers often lack the data and financial justification to make the case for investment in tackling the scourge of tobacco. The CER project \u201cEQUIPT\u201d brings together expertise from multiple disciplines and aims to provide health care policy makers with bespoke information about the economic and wider returns that investing in evidence-based tobacco control including smoking cessation agendas can generate. Learning from a very recent UK experience, EQUIPT will co-create and test a \u201creturn on investment\u201d (ROI) tool, designed for use by tobacco control advocates, policy makers and public health procurers. The first stage of the project will develop the existing ROI tool for use in four EU Member States \u2013 Germany, Spain, Hungary and the Netherlands. Following this, it will test the transferability of the ROI methods to other EU countries (including lower-income Member States) with a view to guiding comprehensive tobacco control policies. The innovation of this project is its focus beyond simply estimating the cost-effectiveness of individual interventions: instead it will evaluate comprehensive tobacco control in an approach that mirrors real practice, where various interventions are delivered concurrently. In combination with a structured dissemination plan involving key stakeholders, this will improve investment in effective tobacco control and cessation services, in turn reducing the incidence of major chronic diseases and improving quality of life at the population level. The resulting cost-saving across the EU has the potential to be enormous.", 54967.0, 2000052.0, "EQUIPT", null, null, null, "http://equipt.eu/", null, null, "fp7_110172_951151252"], ["5AP", "Monitoring public opinion on Nanotechnology in Europe", "Jonathan William Turney", "NANOPINION will provide a multi-tasking and enlivening online science-technology-social media-based platform for learning, information, outreach, dialogue and monitoring for young people, general public and consumer opinion on NT, realising the need for enhanced communication and dialogue between science and society for successful technology development and societal acceptance. A central dialogue arena of both physical and virtual aspects will be created to establish a dynamic outreach and dialogue model that will address the public in the high street via street knowledge and opinion labs, and other target groups in a variety of interactions in live events, online project portal, and web 2.0 tools. Controversial issues will be discussed on range of channels in order to establish a trustworthy and informed dialogue with the public. The engagements will be monitored continuously, and citizens opinions of NT will be gathered and traced using validated online and offline tools, thus providing clear direction and challenges driven by the citizens opinion regarding communication, NT fields, regulation, governance, research, social implications and education of NT. Past FP6/7 projects will be extensively used as prime knowledge, information and education resources for the project.\nNANOPINION will contribute to awareness and interest raising in the realm of NT, by engaging all age groups in the wider public in informing and discussion surrounding NT.

Simultaneously, the subject is controversially discussed. More reflections on risks and benefits involving wider groups of society are needed. Opinions of citizens and customers have to be collected, especially of those, who are not necessarily interested in science and technology.\n\nThe 'Monitoring public opinion on nanotechnology in Europe' (http://www.nanopinion.eu (NANOPINION)) project is an EU-funded initiative established to foster public communication and dialogue about nanotechnologies. The 19-member consortium is running from May 2012 to October 2014, during which time it will have received over EUR 2\u00a0million in EU funding. \n\nProject partners have worked to provide an online information resource on nanotechnologies. Through this medium, the project also fostered public debates and dialogue, and collected data about public opinion. Specific objectives cover integrating all relevant stakeholders into a single arena, establishing a dialogue about nanotechnologies and monitoring the results of project activities.\n\nNANOPINION began with assessing relevant current and previous communication activities and materials to extract useful content. The outcomes include a categorised list of all previous European nanotechnology projects and the information they produced. Such information populated the project's web resource, and includes materials, guides, activities and video content. The project also developed new materials, including a game and specialised online modules. The above information was made available in 17 languages. \n\nThe project developed a report that mapped nanotechnologies onto various national/regional school curricula. Sixteen teachers from 15 countries were selected and trained to be dissemination coordinators in their home countries. NANOPINION also developed plans to coordinate publications and other dissemination activities, including video resources and news media supplements. \n\nIncreased public awareness of and interest in nanotechnologies will be the project's legacy.

Relying on interoperability standards and harmonization process, GENESIS helps to constitute complex information networks, by combining benefits of various information systems with a collaborative systems approach. The proposed generic solution allows easy deployment and customization to thematic needs on a wide range of applications, at regional, national or Europe levels for various thematic fields. The main benefits of GENESIS solution are two-fold :-to improve and facilitate actors daily practices in relation with the management of environmental data; -to perform an essential step in the deployment of the Single Information Space for the environment in Europe. The GENESIS solution will be validated through dedicated scenarios addressing thematic fields of Air Quality, Water Quality and their impact on Health. For the final benefits and information of European citizens, the needs of Environment and Health stakeholders are covered through fundamental services like : -environment monitoring,<br/>-multi-criteria finding of the information; -visualization and combination of static or near-real-time information; -fusion of various sources of environmental data; -correlation between environmental with health data; -support of decision making processes; -support of the risk management and response to crisis; -near-real-time information of citizens. The GENESIS generic solution is open and sustainable as based on de facto and emerging standards (OGC, OASIS, INSPIRE,...). Moreover, the GENESIS project development integrates current state of the art and innovative researches of major EC or ESA projects.
