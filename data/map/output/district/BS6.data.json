A large, robust and consistent evidence base indicates that coordinated, high impact and comprehensive approaches are the most effective way to reduce smoking initiation, prevalence and intensity. Despite this, policy makers and public health procurers often lack the data and financial justification to make the case for investment in tackling the scourge of tobacco. The CER project \u201cEQUIPT\u201d brings together expertise from multiple disciplines and aims to provide health care policy makers with bespoke information about the economic and wider returns that investing in evidence-based tobacco control including smoking cessation agendas can generate. Learning from a very recent UK experience, EQUIPT will co-create and test a \u201creturn on investment\u201d (ROI) tool, designed for use by tobacco control advocates, policy makers and public health procurers. The first stage of the project will develop the existing ROI tool for use in four EU Member States \u2013 Germany, Spain, Hungary and the Netherlands. Following this, it will test the transferability of the ROI methods to other EU countries (including lower-income Member States) with a view to guiding comprehensive tobacco control policies. The innovation of this project is its focus beyond simply estimating the cost-effectiveness of individual interventions: instead it will evaluate comprehensive tobacco control in an approach that mirrors real practice, where various interventions are delivered concurrently. In combination with a structured dissemination plan involving key stakeholders, this will improve investment in effective tobacco control and cessation services, in turn reducing the incidence of major chronic diseases and improving quality of life at the population level.

The students, who train to be a bank clerk, industrial clerk or office clerk, are all in their second year of vocational training.

The lessons deal with topics which are related to their vocational training in Germany. The lessons are held by specially trained and experienced teachers from the college. In addition to the daily lessons, the participants have to write out an assignment on a special economic or social-economic topic, which is chosen by them individually. This as well as the final presentation at the end of the course, enhances the language skills immensely.\r\n\r\nConcerning project 2, 20 wholesale and retail clerk trainees take part in a two-week internship in various commercial companies. They will get a close insight into the job-related practical experience and get the chance to interchange with their British colleagues. \r\n\r\nNext to the course, the students of both projects are obliged to plan and prepare several group excursions.

The topics are then prepared in English by the student teams, so that they can be presented by them in London respectively Bristol and the surrounding area during the group excursions. \r\n\r\nAnother major aim of the project is to enlarge the intercultural, social and individual skills of the students.

In addition to the preparation participants receive in Germany, they are also provided with a cultural and work-related introduction once they are at thei destination. Participants complete industrial internships in small and medium-sized enterprises in the destination country, gaining an insight into the following areas: Marketing, PR and publicity, administration, accounting, logistics and warehouse organization. In all internships, participants are given the opportunity to interact with customers allowing for targeted use and improvement of their language skills. Participants also have the chance to take part in cultural activities outside of the internship.
