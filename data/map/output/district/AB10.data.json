After three decades during which microprocessor speeds increased almost 4000 times, we are starting to hit long-predicted physical limits on the speed of a single processor. Recent computers instead use two, four or even twelve processor cores working together ``in parallel', giving peak performance that is equivalent to a 5GHz, 10GHz or even 30GHz single processor, but at a fraction of the projected energy usage. There have even been experimental 48-core ``single cloud computer' chips giving peak performance that would exceed that of a 100GHz single processor. The effective exploitation of such high performance is essential to support modern demands for computing power in the home, in industry and in the economy at large. Combining this with low energy usage is crucial if the performance is to be delivered at a reasonable financial and environmental cost.<br/>Future designs will harness even greater numbers of processor cores, perhaps in the thousands or millions, and perhaps with widely varying speeds and capabilities. These will be combined with advanced graphics processor units and other specialist units to give further performance and energy gains.  In this way we will be able to meet society's future needs for computing power.<br/>While there are already significant challenges in building computers, such as those described above, from heterogeneous processor and other computing units, there are even greater challenges in building parallel software that can use them effectively. In order to do this, we must produce software that is easy to write but that still allows the hardware to be used effectively.<br/>The key innovation of the ParaPhrase project is exactly to produce such software that is easy to write using the hardware more effectively with the goal of speeding up processing by at least one order of magnitude over sequential execution on real near-term multicore architectures for the use cases and systems that will be considered in the project.<br/>ParaPhrase will build on a (multi-level) model of parallelism, where implementations of parallel programs are expressed in terms of interacting components. By expressing parallelism in terms of high-level parallel patterns that have alternative parallel implementations, we will be able to redeploy/refactor parallel components to dynamically match the available hardware resources.<br/>One large scale company (MELLANOX), one SME (ERLANG SOLUTIONS) and an Austrian software competence centre  (SCCH) with strong links to industry will exploit the project results in a commercial context.

Variations in salinity will incur offsets in oil and gas volume data from subsea multiphase flow meters (MPFMs), and may also indicate water breakthroughs, in which the wells starts to produce injected sea water. Both these effects bring about considerable losses for the operator. The number of subsea installations is steadily increasing and the problem is therefore felt in the industry. The only method today for checking salinity in individual well streams involves ROV intervention, a hugely expensive operation. The Idea is to develop a sample and analysis system for installation upstream from MPFMs on subsea manifolds. Integrated in the flow line, the system will sample the multiphase production from the well, allow the fluid to separate into its single phases by electrostatic coealescing and measure the salinity of the water fraction. By monitoring the salinity, the MPFM may be regularly calibrated and the offset is removed. Salinity measurements will also enable early detection of water breakthrough, where wells start to produce injected sea water instead of oil. The system will: - Improve accuracy of MPFMs by removing errors caused by variations in salinity - Enable early detection of water breakthrough through detection of said variation in salinity - Verify MPFM data by volume fraction estimation in sample separation tank SalinityScan will involve extensive development work in several research areas, including oil separation technology, ultrasound level gauging, control electronics, mechanical design and subsea instrumentation.

The majority of MPFMs use technology that is heavily influenced by variations in salinity. However, variations in technology can result in inaccurate flow rate data, resulting in poor well management and less-effective processing of the multi-phase flow.\n\nWith EU funding, the SALINITYSCAN project developed a system for the semi-continuous monitoring of salinity in well streams. The purpose was to remove volume measurement error and detect water breakthrough. The latter occurs when the well begins to produce sea water that was previously injected into the well to increase pressure. It can also result from water penetrating the oil-carrying layer in the reservoir. \n\nThe system is based on the development of an analysis chamber equipped with level measurement and salinity sensors for analysing the separated multi-phase fluid. Project partners also designed an extensive control system that provides the end user with an easy way of ensuring increased flow and better exploitation of the well.  \n\nSensors needed to have a high degree of reliability and safety as well as the ability to operate with a variety of multi-phase fluids in a harsh environment. These conditions involve extremes of pressure and temperature. Because of these demanding conditions, project partners developed and tested many different types of level measurement sensors.\n\nSALINITYSCAN data was used to update the flow meter calibration parameters, thereby compensating for any changes caused by variations in salinity. The semi-continuous monitoring of salinity makes it easier to detect water breakthroughs. The technology can also be used as a tool for measuring salinity in order to determine the need to inject chemicals to inhibit hydrate formation.\n\nCombining the SALINITYSCAN system with an MPFM unit will provide many benefits, including increased revenue as a result of correct data from flow meters.

Queries are becoming even more broad and complex essentially due to context of the search process (e.g. the system, user, language, the word and action meaning, socio-psychological dimensions, interface and interaction methods). Over the past three decades, the research in IAR had led to various search engine models, such as vector space and probabilistic models. Unfortunately there has been no comprehensive investigation at the theoretical level for effectively integrating elements of context to create advanced search technology. The key issue preventing such research is a lack of a unified theoretical framework to seamlessly integrate the dimensions of context into the search engine models and into the evaluation protocols. This proposal is hinged on the belief that the dimensions of context can be naturally integrated into a generic and fundamental framework. To address the challenges of the dimensions of context in IAR this proposal shows a new vision of the IAR paradigm based on Quantum Theory (QT). This proposal starts from Van Rijsbergen\u2019s seminal book. QT allows to measure relevance and context via projection, and probability of relevance via the trace, to logically reason through lattice of document structures and links, to change context via unitary operators, to handle correlations dependencies as density operators, to represent composite, entangled documents and features for which classical correlations cannot straightforwardly be used.

The result is an innovation that increases safety, flexibility, efficiency and efficacy of maritime cable laying operations.\nThe innovation applies to the maritime cable laying sector, since technology and the market expressed the need for underwater physical interconnections for energy and power networks in sea environments. This requirement is considered to be one of the greatest challenges for a reliable and effective use of world resources.\nThe solution has several advantages compared to currently available PRD because the MODULAR INNODRIVE provides:\n\u2022\tIncreased efficiency-flexibility\n\u2022\tTime and costs reduction\n\u2022\tSafer operations\nINNOVO Ltd. intends to implement a feasibility study in Phase 1 aimed to achieve the following goals:\n\u2022\tDevelop the MODULAR INNODRIVE through additional technical adjustments of INNOVO\u2019s 600 mT PRD (the highest product capacity available into the market) to fulfil the modular requirements. This will further position the company at the forefront of maritime cable laying technology. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and business strategies for production are additional issues that need to be tackled. INNOVO has the opportunity to develop the proposed solution with its well established industrial partner, CONCRANE S.r.l., an offshore crane manufacturer since more than 60 years, whose headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located in Trieste, Italy.\n\u2022\tDevelop a marketing and sales strategy in Europe with the following goals:\no\tMarket analysis\no\tBusiness development\no\tRisk assessment analysis\no\tIdentification of customers' best solutions", 37036.0, 52909.0, "MODULAR INNODRIVE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_198890_934394987"], ["1FY", "New Bus ReFuelling for European Hydrogen Bus Depots", "Aberdeen City Council*", "The overall aim of NewBusFuel is to resolve a significant knowledge gap around the technologies and engineering solutions required for the refuelling of a large number of buses at a single bus depot.

These partners will work with 12 bus operators in Europe, each of whom have demonstrated political support for the deployment of hydrogen bus fleets.\nIn each location engineering studies will be produced, by collaborative design teams involving bus operators and industrial HRS experts, each defining the optimal design, hydrogen supply route, commercial arrangements and the practicalities for a hydrogen station capable of providing fuel to a fleet of fuel cell buses (75-260 buses).\nPublic reports will be prepared based on an analysis across the studies, with an aim to provide design guidelines to bus operators considering deploying hydrogen buses, as well as to demonstrate the range of depot fuelling solutions which exist (and their economics) to a wider audience.\nThese results will be disseminated widely to provide confidence to the whole bus sector that this potential barrier to commercialisation of hydrogen bus technology has been overcome.", 22187.0, 1943649.0, "NewBusFuel", null, null, null, null, "http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk", null, "h2020_197930_984742352"], ["7QB", "Risk Based Consenting of Offshore Renewable Energy Projects", "The Robert Gordon University", "The consenting of offshore renewable energy is often cited as one of the main non-technical barriers to the development of this sector. A significant aspect of this is the uncertainty inherent in the potential environmental impacts of novel technology. To ensure consents are compliant with EU and national legislation, such as the Environmental Impact Assessment and Habitats Directive, costly and time consuming surveys are required even for required even for perceived lower risk technologies in sites which may not be of highest environmental sensitivity. It is therefore the aim of the RiCORE project to establish a risk-based approach to consenting where the level of survey requirement is based on the environmental sensitivity of the site, the risk profile of the technology and the scale of the proposed project. RiCORE will study the legal framework in place in the partner Member States to ensure the framework developed will be applicable for roll out across these Member States and further afield.\n \nThe next stage of the RiCORE project is to consider the practices, methodologies and implementation of pre-consent surveys, post-consent and post-deployment monitoring. This will allow a feedback loop to inform the development of the risk-based framework for the environmental aspects of consent and provide best practice. The project will achieve these aims by engaging with the relevant stakeholders including the regulators, industry and EIA practitioners, through a series of expert workshops and developing their outcomes into guidance.\n \nThe impact of the project will be to improve, in line with the requirements of the Renewable Energy Directive specifically Article 13 (1), consenting processes to ensure cost efficient delivery of the necessary surveys, clear and transparent reasoning for work undertaken, improving knowledge sharing and reducing the non-technical barriers to the development of the Offshore Renewable Energy sector so it can deliver the clean, secure energy", 269169.0, 1032163.0, "RiCORE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.rgu.ac.uk", null, "h2020_194433_999837589"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1AB", "SI Management & Coordination", "Aberdeen City Council", "Strategic Intervention management, administration and compliance.", "ESF", 106135.8, 265339.5, "esf_scotland_158"], ["1AB", "Delivery", "Aberdeen City Council", "The operation will provide a pipeline identifying the most vulnerable and most in need of support with keyworker support, skills development, work-based training and placements.", "ESF", 750031.0, 1875078.0, "esf_scotland_159"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["7QB", "THE ROBERT GORDON UNIVERSITY", 42363.0, "Contribution to Erasmus+ (22.02.04.02)", "fts_2016_20766", 2016], ["1FY", "ABERDEEN CITY COUNCIL*", 19891.0, "Information outlets (16.03.01.03)", "fts_2016_67049", 2016], ["1FY", "ABERDEEN CITY COUNCIL*", 16137.0, "Information outlets (16.03.01.03)", "fts_2017_67943", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "AB10"}
