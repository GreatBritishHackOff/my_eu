This possibility began with training in Customer Service before we extended this first to include Administration  and later Commerce, before our 4th project in Commerce, oriented towards the English-speaking and today those who speak Spanish.\r\nIn the interval, when a teacher involved in Erasmus+ projects has left our School, the recruitment of a replacement has always been the opportunity for the staff to renew its commitment to this aspect of school-life, and for 2016/17 a Business/Commerce teacher has integrated the staff and will be accredited to teach the two disciplines in both French and English.\r\nWe have found this Erasmus+ experience particularly rewarding for pupils: it develops self-reliance, the students are more confident, and as a result they become more open to others: their environment is spontaneous, and they are constantly solicited. In today's disturbed national & international contexts which favour division and where students \"find their marks\" only with difficulty, activities in relation to Erasmus+ have taken on real meaning, given that knowledge of others leads to understanding. In the present case, prejudices are abandoned in this period of apprenticeship, which has a regulating effect on inequality and fraternity.\r\nWe are well aware of our students' need for a better understanding of the Europeans around them, and also the growing importance of professional opportunities for young people in this part of the world.\r\nSo the aims of those participating are on the one hand to improve their language skills and the ability to relate to others, and on the other hand to be open to other ways of life so as to be able to absorb cultures that are different from their own.\r\nMost of our young people come from differing, mainly modest sociocultural backgrounds, and the majority have had a fragile education by the time they join our High School; this translates into students who have incomplete apprenticeships and a lack of confidence in themselves.\r\nIn the academic year 2016/17, 13 students in their second year of study for their professional diploma \"Bac Pro ARCU / GA\" will profit from the Erasmus+ experience in Belfast, while 4 students taking our \"Bac Pro Commerce\" course will be staying in Seville for 4 weeks in March.

Remarks made by the National Agency in their report are carefully analysed, and the whole is representative of the systematic reflexion given to projects before we modify, adjust and develop future ones.\r\nFor our students, this experience goes beyond simply crossing borders: it is a real challenge to be met, and our students take pride in this. The confidence they have acquired is reinvested in a growth phase that leads to success (often in the form of further, postgraduate education), giving value to their professional studies in high school and resulting in recognition by their peers. It is an experience that allows these students to count on a \"Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel\" diploma with European honours, namely EUROPRO and EUROPASS, two distinctions that are also synonymous with quality in the eyes of the businesses that they join later.\r\nErasmus+ project experience continues to prove that this is an undeniable bridge from professional to higher education due to the fact that the confidence acquired by these young people opens perspectives of a future that they thought to be out of reach. It also testifies to their adaptability when faced with the requirements of the world of employment.\r\nToday the St. Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise school is recognized for the seriousness of its commitments to European projects.

The key areas that were identified as requiring further training were the areas of strategic policy making, international funding, land surveying and mapping. Therefore special focus in finding hosts in these areas was carried out.  In the meantime, work on a tender for an in depth skills analysis and training needs  which will feed into a long term training needs analysis commenced.\r\n\r\n(3) Disseminating information about Transnational Mobility: The PA issued a call for an expression of interest amongst employees for ERASMUS placements on 14th June 2016. Staff were requested to indicate their interest in participating in such projects and their training needs. This exercise clearly indicated that there is high interest amongst PA employees in undergoing ERAMSUS Placements.  This call was complemented by an information seminar held on 21st June 2016. During the seminar information about mobility activities was provided by the Erasmsus+ Core Group to PA staff, including details of preparatory and follow up work and the undertaking of a work placement with an emphasis on training needs assessment and the setting up of a tailor made work programme. An important aspect of such seminar was testimonials from PA staff that had already experienced such transnational mobility placements, highlighting the benefits of such placements.  The Erasmsus+ Core Group also indicated all the support that it will be providing during the work placements. The Authority will be preparing a checklist covering all aspects that need to be prepared from the participants side, so as to guide the participants about all the requirements. \r\n\r\n(4) Carrying out the Work Placements: Following the identification of the key areas where placements are a priority, discussions with the relevant managers will follow up to devise work programmes which are structurally embedded and linked to the training needs of its staff and its operational objectives. A call will be issued internally within the Authority.  A panel will be set up to carry out interviews  and once participants are identified following the procedure above, the Erasmsus+ Core Group will match the placements with the chosen candidates and then start working on a detailed and tailor-made work programme together with the host, the participant and the respective Line Manager. \r\n\r\n(5) Dissemination of Knowledge Obtained: In 2016 two placements were carried out and the knowledge obtained was disseminated. It is planned that this dissemination will also take place following the placements which will take place in 2017.  In the meantime a press release was issued to disseminate information about these placements externally.\r\n\r\n(6) Post mobility Follow up: Post mobility follow up will be held through one to one sessions with the participants to to gather initial feedback on the overall experience and to assess and validate that the knowledge, skills and competences identified in the beginning of the process have been acquired. In addition, an assessment of both the informal and non-formal learning will take place, including the identification of learning outcomes which were not originally planned but still achieved during the mobility projects. \r\n\r\nFor the upcoming placements, a status report was referred to PA Management outlining the hosts identified and the interest expressed by PA staff, together with the identified training needs and suggestions for the 2017 placements. PA Management agreed with the proposed 2017 placements and committed in topping up funds as may be required. It is planned to have 10 placements in 2017 instead of the 5 planned in the strategy, in view of the increase in potential hosts and the interest amongst PA employees.  The main objective of these placements is to strengthen the skills of staff working on Mapping, Land Surveying, Strategic Planning and International Funding. With respect to mapping and landsurveying, focus is required on the areas of Photogrammetry and Data capture. On Strategic Planning, staff requires more exposure on the development of planning policies and plans, including maritime spatial planning. In addition, the staff working on international funding requires hands on experience on the development of EU Funded Projects.
