The goal is to enable a 'Virtual Film Factory' in which creative professionals can work together to create and customise programmes from Petabyte-scale digital repositories, using semantic technologies to organise data and drive its processing. By separating metadata from essence, controlling all the image and sound processing operations from the metadata layer, we can maintain the underlying data library unchanged while enabling a new generation of more flexible applications. This will radically reduce the amount of data created: new versions, grades, or language releases only result in additional metadata, not new data files. The system will support a more automated workflow for content distribution from postproduction to the assembly, distribution and playout of multiple variations of programmes in different formats and locations. Outcomes will be:\\tAn infrastructure in which multi-Petabye data stores are managed by persistent metadata in a distributed metadatabase.\\tReal-time interaction with media sequences selected from the data store. When a sequence is changed, by an application, the commands are stored as a new set of metadata. The data remains unchanged in the store, but viewing and listening sequences are rendered 'on the fly.

Meeting the demand will need advances on the state of the art in a wide range of areas, including the combination of 2D and 3D methods; depth and lighting capture; surround video; real-time depth-based processing and compositing; real-time high resolution rendering; and new approaches to manipulating CG objects and video in a virtual environment.The ability to assemble, try out, play with and even improvise virtual productions will have profound creative consequences for the media industry, performance groups and creative artists.

They have learnt the skills to plan a strategic audience engagement campaign focusing on targeted audiences that need to see the film in order to create change at political, legal, corporate or public level.In order to achieve this, the participants have learnt what we mean by creating change, how to create a solid and realistic budget, how to raise funds from traditional and non-traditional funders, how to establish and build relationships with partners who can provide access to expertise, networks, legal advice, etc, as well as how to build the strongest team who can deliver the campaign goals and communicate the film campaign's message to audiences.An Impact Producer is also able to deliver the campaign, collect data and deliver an evaluation report to funders and other interested parties to demonstrate what real impact the film has made on civil society. To get an idea of what an Impact Report looks like please visit the library section of the Impact Field Guide: http://impactguide.org/library.As more and more filmmakers have the ambition to create impact with their work and their success has created more interest and excitement in the unique role films can play in social or environmental change, there is a real need for Impact Producers to take these films from completion to impact.The goal of the Lab is to set good practices and to recognize the role and importance of an Impact Producer in the field.
