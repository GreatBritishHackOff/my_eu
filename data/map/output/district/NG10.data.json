This will be supported by the development, production and testing of mixed powder combinations for coatings suitability.\n\nThe proposed system will combine LMD, robotic and CNC positioning, modelling, 3D scanning techniques and sensors to give a \u2018turn-key\u2019 solution to the deposition of multiple materials for quality controlled FGM coatings and 3D features onto original manufactured components and repair surfaces. The solution will offer a knowledge driven manufacturing process with significant production benefits; automation, self-management and reduced material usage and waste.\n\nThe integrated system will be assessed for its cost effectiveness, in terms of manufacturing efficiency and consumption of raw materials, but also its application flexibility for exploitation into industry sectors not represented in the consortium. This will be addressed by developing the following topics:\n\n\u2022\tAutomation - Intelligible software interface for automated manufacturing by LMD.\n\u2022\tProduction efficiency - Integrated process incorporating component referencing, in-line monitoring, closed loop control and NDT inspection.\n\u2022\tMaterials \u2013 Intuitive database of material combinations with selection focused on coatings performance.\n\u2022\tQualification - Demonstrator parts from industry (mining, automotive, power generation, tooling, industrial drives) validated by AMCOR end-users. Development of QA/QC deposition procedures.\n\nTo achieve these key objectives, the consortium consists of 16 organisations who are recognised leaders in various industrial sectors and in the development of LMD processes. We propose to develop the integrated AMCOR system over a period of 36 months with an overall budget of \u20ac4.7Million (\u20ac3Million EC contribut", 106378.0, 3815246.0, "AMCOR", "Industrial application of functionally graded coatings", "One of the most advanced materials compositions for coating machinery to extend its service life has made big waves in labs, yet industrial application is limited. Scientists are developing the industrial process line needed to make it available to manufacturers.", "Coatings can protect against corrosion or fatigue and multifunctional coatings can do both in a single composite, but there is something potentially even better in laboratories around the world. Imagine a multifunctional coating whose properties vary in space, providing exactly the protection needed where it is needed.\n\nFunctionally graded materials (FGMs) do just that with properties that gradually change through the depth or volume of the material. The EU-funded project 'Additive manufacturing for wear and corrosion applications' (http://www.amcor-project.eu/index.jsp (AMCOR)) is developing a flexible automated process for reliable FGM deposition in an industrial setting.\n\nAMCOR is focused on FGMs combining the superior wear resistance of metals with the large operational temperature range of ceramics. Metal-to-ceramic FGMs have typically demonstrated intermediate phase formation leading to poor wetting, inferior mechanical properties, and often cracking or disbanding.\n\nScientists are increasing knowledge of structure and function to develop the deposition process with real-time process monitoring and control that will deliver reliable high-performing coatings every time. Work will involve adaptations to existing laser metal deposition (LMD) systems, a numerical control machine and a robotic system at partner facilities.\n\nInvestigators have addressed some of the high-risk issues first, including development of new technologies to support the LMD systems in achieving current project objectives. An important achievement was integration of a 3D scanning system with a six-axis robot arm, supplied by individual partners.\n\nThe LMD process is under development at partner facilities and many materials have been screened both before and after processing, leading to selection of promising candidates for continued development. Finally, important improvements have been made to partner SKM's offline robot programming system (SKM DCAM). They will be critical to deposition of more than one powder on complex shapes in a graded way for FGMs.\n\nAMCOR's robotic deposition system for production of corrosion- and wear-resistant machinery exploiting FGMs will make an important contribution to achieving the EU vision for Factories of the Future. The advanced manufacturing technologies should enhance application of LMD and FGMs to many market sectors for major impact on the EU economy as well.
