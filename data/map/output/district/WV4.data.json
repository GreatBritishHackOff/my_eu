Capitalising on the major impact of ECHORD, the successor project ECHORD\\\\ (or E\\\\), will create new opportunities for European robotics researchers to work directly with SME/start-ups and new users/customers to create innovative markets.<br/>E\\\\ will continue ECHORD's two pillars, 'experiments' and 'structured dialogue', taking advantage of experience and investment in the infrastructure. But E\\\\ will add another unique dimension: not only will we encourage ReIO and RoM to work together, but robot system customers and users will be involved \u2013 connecting the suppliers directly with the market. To this end, there are two innovative new pillars: the Pre-Commercial-Procurement Pilots (PCPP) and the Knowledge and Innovation Centers (KIC). The PCPP will enable public procurers to become demanding buyers of new R&D. The complete PCP process will encompass robotics R&D for the first time, resulting in, demonstrable prototypes that can be evaluated together with the process at the end. The KICs are open experimental facilities that will that allow new robot customers and users to interact with roboticists with no entrance barrier and at very low cost so that new communities can form \u2013 and radically new ideas can take shape. E\\\\'s scientific work is structured in scenarios and research foci, directly derived from the SRA. They help steer the coordination between the experiments, KICs and PCPP to avoid unnecessary parallel work.<br/>E\\\\'s implementation concept combines a team of excellent institutions with top-level researchers and the proven IT-backed processes. This will include highly effective quality management and monitoring.<br/>E\\\\' impact strategy is geared towards integration of stakeholder cooperation, SMEs, start-up sup-port and creating new markets \u2013 ideally producing the next disruptive technologies.", 16730.0, 21874746.0, "ECHORD Plus Plus", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_108515_926979822"], ["6BL", "Development and demonstration of compact, multi-source heat eXchanger technologies for renewable energy applications", "Advanced Chemical Etching Limited", "Europe's refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump industry has an annual turnover of \u20ac30 billion and employs around 200,000 people.

Led by these associations the HeatXchange consortium consists of European SME associations, SME end users and some of Europe\u2019s leading research associations. Together, we are proposing to develop new platform technologies that are relevant to our industries and their markets across Europe. The HeatXchange project will provide European manufacturers with alternative designs and manufacturing routes that will assist them expand their product range and to effectively compete with non-European competition. This will be achieved through the development and demonstration of a novel heat exchanger technology and manufacturing process that will enable increased market penetration of European-made air source type heat pump systems. The new platform technology will improve the efficiency and reduce the size of the evaporator, whilst enabling the integration of secondary or even tertiary energy sources. Overall these advanced will enable significant increases in Seasonal Performance Factors (SPF) which will improve the return on investment for consumers and hence attractiveness of EU air based heat pump systems. During the project this technology will be disseminated amongst our 1,000 members within the industry and showcased at events and conferences.

SMEs represent 99% of the EU manufacturing sector equating to over 2.5 million companies. As manufacturing is resource intensive both in terms of raw materials and energy consumption, despite rising costs (energy and raw materials) SMEs are under increasing threat to remain competitive against non-EU based companies.\n\nThe aim of the ICARUS project is to create an absorption power generation technology for low temperature (60-120oC) heat. This will enable us to create a waste-heat power generation system for industrial (chemical, cement etc.) applications that can achieve an efficiency of up to 20% for electricity to be generated from industrial waste heat (<120oC) without affecting industrial processes. By doing this, the absorption power generation system created will offer greatly improved environmental performance due to improved efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions at a cost that is affordable to the end-user. This will lead to significant economic and societal benefits to manufacturers.

In addition, they identified a suitable expander that generates the electricity as the working fluid passes through it.\n\nThe heat from the waste heat stream is transferred to an absorption system. An absorption power generation system achieving the cost and power requirements for low-temperature heat recovery would be a real breakthrough in the industries. The developed system enables electricity to be generated from industrial waste heat without affecting industrial processes, with conversion efficiency up to 20\u00a0%.\n\nProject work laid the groundwork for follow-up projects to design innovative technology such as a 20-kW organic Rankine cycle system for commercial use.

This innovation requires minimal changes to the conventional processes for cement, replacing the calciner in the Preheater-Calciner Tower. For lime there is no product contamination from the combustion gas. The technology can be used with alternative fuels and other capture technologies to achieve negative CO2 emissions. The project will also enable research into novel building materials with a reduced CO2 footprint, as well the upgrade of low value limestone fines and dust to high value lime applications.\n\nThe high potential of the project is complemented by high deliverability. The requested grant will secure \u20ac8.8m of in-kind funding and support from the LEILAC consortium members, which include world leading engineering, cement, lime and R&D organisations. \n\nTo accelerate further development, LEILAC will deliver a techno-economic roadmap, and comprehensive knowledge sharing activities including a visitor centre at the pilot site near Brussels.
