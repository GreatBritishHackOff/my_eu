The most common cause of UI is called the Overactive bladder syndrome (OABS) of which the underlying complex bio-molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Many distinct tissues (nervous system, urothelium, interstitial cells, smooth muscle cells) contribute to OABS but their specific roles remain unknown. As a result, no effective non-invasive therapy without side effects is available or can be developed without a profound integration of multiple scientific disciplines. The TRUST ITN proposes an interdisciplinary research training network of 8 European university institutes and 3 enterprises, with a wide variety of complementary expertise in UI and OABS. The network covers all required disciplines from anatomy, urology, neuroscience, pathology, pharmacology, biomedical engineering, clinical science, bioinformatics to diagnostic- and drug development, that must be applied on cellular-, organ- and whole body levels. Currently most researchers are not trained to deal with such a great variety of disciplines, and are thus insufficiently prepared to cope with the modern and increasingly urgent challenges of urology research. In the TRUST project 10 early stage researchers and 5 experienced researchers will receive training from different leading European research institutes on multiple complementary disciplines that will empower them to explore the and unravel the mechanisms underlying OABS and to develop novel diagnostic, prevention and treatment strategies.

They looked at how to develop and test a new production model involving different small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that can work together as microfactories under one network. The new business model was conceived to provide trust, choice and service to consumers and suppliers, meeting the needs and requirements of both.\n\nIn this spirit, SERVIVE revealed that the three most promising market niches are knitwear, sportswear and women's business wear. It then defined customisation options and developed several product configuration paradigms for different project partners to meet their needs. Work also involved integrating customer support functions, style advice for customers and virtual try-on capabilities that involved 3D representation.\n\nTo help launch this vision, SERVIVE built an http://community.servive.eu (online portal and community) that lets consumers buy mass-customised clothing items from different suppliers. The platform enables them to build their own profile and virtual twin, with the capability to show configured products to friends as well.\n\nConsumers are set to benefit significantly from the flexibility of buying customised clothes online as the market for produced-on-demand apparel grows exponentially.

It concludes with a certificate of proficiency graded according to the Common European Framework of Reference and will be offered in this form in future. In addition, it serves as a basis for the planning and execution of projects with an alternative concept: two-week placements in cooperation with tried and new partners with the objective of exchanging views and experience of professional practice through company visits and discussion with all of those involved in vocational training. Furthermore, relevant topics can be included flexibly, e.g. current developments in the EU.\r\n\r\nOur contact to Lyc\u00e9e Pierre de Coubertin, Calais, will be reactivated. Rather than the previous three-week twinning with the emphasis on work placement, the future emphasis will be on small groups interacting and discussing. For trainees and teaching staff alike this should enable an international exchange of outlooks \u2013 not necessarily in English alone. Sitting in on lessons, company visits as well as extramural activities provide for enhanced intercultural competence and the opportunity for didactic reflection and development.\r\n\r\nThe relationship with Omnia, in Espoo, Finland, should develop along similar lines, whereby English will be paramount. By bringing together compatible professional sectors, greater emphasis will be placed on topics specifically related to the sector in question.\r\n\r\nOur new partnership with LSE in Liverpool provides two further offers meeting our aspirations: for our apprentices language development is the primary objective flanked by company visits with groups formed more on the basis of the level of fluency rather than their training focus. As our English department expands and is strengthened through the Vocational College English Qualification at the Oldenburg Further Education Centre, Liverpool runs a particularly apposite intensive course culminating in the Cambridge Teaching Knowledge Test (TKT). Participants not only consolidate specific vocabulary, but also through teaching their main subject to the Liverpool study group explore, expand and develop didactic approaches. A parallel course offered by the established International Study Programme gives us even greater flexibility to enable our staff to acquire further qualifications.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have offered our apprentices the professional KMK English Language certificate at Level B2. The successful initiation of the Europakaufmann qualification in cooperation with five other internationally engaged Bremen vocational colleges has attracted 47 participants in 2017. Along with concentration on the theme of International Commerce, the English KMK Certificate Level B1, qualification in a further foreign language at minimum Level A1 and the ECDL, a three-week work placement abroad with intercultural interaction is also required. For this we have the partners Liverpool and ECBM with their great experience. The europass will be issued for this.\r\n\r\nSending staff to support participants has definitely enhanced the success and quality of our Mobility projects to date and further strengthened the Internationalisation awareness of accompanying staff. Our expanding concept for Mobility involves intensifying the participation of staff in project activities.

The professional practice includes students from all the sectors and professions and we are proud to be able to include students with disabilities and special needs in the mobilities.\r\nThis project will not only enable mobilities of the students but also the professional development through mobility for 8 vocational teachers. All the professional developments are related to the field of vocational courses and will take place in reputable partners with Erasmus + VET Mobility Charter and world known university. The professional development of our teachers will be done through participation in the educational process of the receiving institutions and through attending specialised courses related to field of study of teachers and their jobs in our school. The plans of teachers\u2019 professional development are attached to this application.\r\nThe mobility of students and teachers implements the principle of excellence stated in our Internationalisation Strategy. \u201cThrough international activities Vocational School endeavours:\r\n- to enable students to gain professional and personal knowledge, skills and competences which will enable them to be equally competitive in the European and global labour markets.\r\n- to enable teachers and expert associates to gain insight into education systems of other countries and to have the opportunity of permanent education in acquiring new technologies and applying them in teaching.\u201d\r\nThe project application was done according to the interest expressed in a poll conducted among the future participants and according to the needs determined by the Erasmus+ project team. \r\nSince education in our school lasts mainly for three years, majority of the students that go on mobilities are minors. Furthermore the greatest number of mobilities will take place in business organisations. The students\u2019 mobilities include students with disabilities and special needs students and business companies can only receive a few of them at one time. Those are the reasons why it is necessary to send accompanying teachers with our students to their mobilities. We attempt to reduce the number of accompanying teachers or the length of stay for them. Still, we do not want to jeopardise the quality of the mobility.  \r\nBecause of the structure of our students to whom the mobility is almost always  the first time being abroad and the fear of parents for their children not being able to take care of themselves without adults, I believe that the number of accompanying teachers are necessary and justified.", "http://www.arts.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-HR01-KA116-035154_10"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["7EY", "Fashion & Technology Emerging Futures", "University of the Arts London; London College of Fashion (UAL;LCF)", "The project will promote collaboration between fashion and tech SMEs in London; to capitalise on the fashion and tech eco-system emerging in the capital, to drive growth through promoting cross sector collaboration and develop innovative products and services (e.g. new fashion and lifestyle product innovation, digital marketing and retail solutions, digital supply chain tools).
