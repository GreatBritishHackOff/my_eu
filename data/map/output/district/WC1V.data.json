The most common cause of UI is called the Overactive bladder syndrome (OABS) of which the underlying complex bio-molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Many distinct tissues (nervous system, urothelium, interstitial cells, smooth muscle cells) contribute to OABS but their specific roles remain unknown. As a result, no effective non-invasive therapy without side effects is available or can be developed without a profound integration of multiple scientific disciplines. The TRUST ITN proposes an interdisciplinary research training network of 8 European university institutes and 3 enterprises, with a wide variety of complementary expertise in UI and OABS. The network covers all required disciplines from anatomy, urology, neuroscience, pathology, pharmacology, biomedical engineering, clinical science, bioinformatics to diagnostic- and drug development, that must be applied on cellular-, organ- and whole body levels. Currently most researchers are not trained to deal with such a great variety of disciplines, and are thus insufficiently prepared to cope with the modern and increasingly urgent challenges of urology research. In the TRUST project 10 early stage researchers and 5 experienced researchers will receive training from different leading European research institutes on multiple complementary disciplines that will empower them to explore the and unravel the mechanisms underlying OABS and to develop novel diagnostic, prevention and treatment strategies. Moreover, the integrated research training programme will transfer practical skills, knowledge and experiences to stimulate successful medical (commercial) exploitation of these results.

Now, a new initiative to implement mass customising of fashion and apparel in Europe may revolutionise the sector and make it more competitive.

They looked at how to develop and test a new production model involving different small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that can work together as microfactories under one network. The new business model was conceived to provide trust, choice and service to consumers and suppliers, meeting the needs and requirements of both.\n\nIn this spirit, SERVIVE revealed that the three most promising market niches are knitwear, sportswear and women's business wear. It then defined customisation options and developed several product configuration paradigms for different project partners to meet their needs. Work also involved integrating customer support functions, style advice for customers and virtual try-on capabilities that involved 3D representation.\n\nTo help launch this vision, SERVIVE built an http://community.servive.eu (online portal and community) that lets consumers buy mass-customised clothing items from different suppliers. The platform enables them to build their own profile and virtual twin, with the capability to show configured products to friends as well.\n\nConsumers are set to benefit significantly from the flexibility of buying customised clothes online as the market for produced-on-demand apparel grows exponentially. Retailers and designers from the single owner or employee to a chain of fashion stores are also set to benefit from this new online model.\n\nSERVIVE outcomes could potentially open up new niche markets and attract a wide variety of online consumers from the fashion-conscious student to the affluent housewife.
