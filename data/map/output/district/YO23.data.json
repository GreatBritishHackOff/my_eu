Obesity is a key economic and healthcare challenge for Europe. Effective interventions and commercial programmes for weight loss are widely available, but most people re-gain their lost weight. Currently few comprehensive solutions exist to help Europeans manage weight loss maintenance (WLM).\nCurrent research suggests the most promising evidence-based behaviour change techniques for WLM are self-monitoring, goal setting, action control, building self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation. Recent research also suggests that stress management and emotion regulation skills are key enablers of relapse prevention and weight-regain.\n\nInformation technology offers attractive tools for teaching and supporting these techniques, some of which are currently delivered through resource-intensive face-to-face therapies. ICT-delivery includes networked-wireless tracking technologies, weighing-scales and activity sensors, online tools and smart-phone apps, multi-media resources and internet-based support. A broad choice of tools is most likely to be acceptable to users, who can pick and choose their own preferred technologies. \nThe NoHoW project tests whether ICT-based delivery of the most promising evidence-based behavior change techniques is effective for WLM. We will carry out a large-scale international 3-centre trial of information technology tools that implement the most up-to-date behavioural science research. This trial will establish the effectiveness of these ICT tools in supporting WLM, linked to studies of European consumer needs and behaviour.\n\nImpact: The project will directly feed results into development of new products and services from the UK\u2019s largest commercial weight-loss provider, Slimming World providing immediate benefit to 500,000\\ consumers.

We believe that enhancing VET-learners' competence and vocational skills will help them to better  understand and compete in an international market. Other important objectives for the participants are improving linguistic competence, focusing in particular on English for specific purposes (vocational English), and raising cultural awareness through a comparison and discussion of skills requirements, curricula, methods and assessments, sharing know-how, and thus reflecting on and improving our own practice. We also facilitate varied cultural activities during the mobility. Furthermore, we aim to encourage a reduction in absence and an increase in motivation by setting criteria for the selection process. Finally, we hope to recruit more students to the above mentioned vocational programmes, which is of both regional and national interest.\r\n\r\nThe participating VET-learners will prepare for the mobilty by committing to an introductory course focusing on learning objectives, expectations and individual goals, linguistic and cultural competence. The mobility itself will be a two-week work placement and vocational training at Askham Bryan College for a selected group of 9 Vg2-students each year, from our courses in agriculture, animal management, groundsmanship and landscaping, equine studies, and energy and environment studies. The participating students will have individual learning agreements specifically tailored to meet their needs, and will be closely monitored by both accompanying staff from Hvam and teachers/trainers from Askham Bryan College.\r\n\r\nThe expected/desired results of the CPLVE project are for the participants to acquire knowledge of  innovative methods, practices and standards used in agriculture, groundsmanship and landscaping, equine studies, or energy and environment studies in the UK, that they develop and improve their practical skills , and that they are able to compare, contrast and discuss differences and similarities between our two countries. Other expected results are particpants' improved linguistic competence, with a focus on vocational English, an improved ability to adapt to different working environments and requirements, and to discuss and reflect on professional and cultural differences and similarities. Finally, we expect to see results in terms of reduced absence and increased motivation for each individual participant.\r\n\r\nWe believe that providing VET-learners with updated skills and knowledge to meet an increasingly international workplace, and to be able to reflect on the differences and similiarities in requirements, methods, practices and standards, will have long term benefits for both the individual learner, the profession and society in general. We also believe that facilitating discussions and cooperation between Hvam's accompanying teachers and ABC's teachers/monitors will be of mutual benefit to both Askham Bryan College and Hvam, both in the short and long term as they will be required to share information with their respective colleagues at home. We also expect to see an increased interest in international cooperation projects on a local, regional and national level.", "http://www.askham-bryan.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NO01-KA102-033915_1"], ["2BB", "Erasmus pluss mobilitet yrkesfag 2017 til 2018", "York College", 170540.0, "In addition to HO, EF, TIP and DH, Rud would like in this project to develop our cooperation with YC and CCN within the areas of DH-hairdressing and HO-children and young people. We see the UK as being the forefront as far as trends and fashion in hair and beauty, and also in relation to the cooperation between colleges and work placement schemes for apprentices. In particular Rud wishes to acquire a better understanding of differing educational approaches both in kindergarten and youth clubs. In the UK children start school at the age of 5 \u2013 how does this influence approaches to education at YC and CCN compared to Norway? The development of relationships amongst the children and young people themselves is also a central theme, considering how often different cultures are involved. What can we learn from YC and CCN in relation to this, how much are the children and young people encouraged to participate themselves, and how, is bullying dealt with? In addition we would also like to prepare the ground for cooperating with UtNord in the areas of TIP and EF. Utnord has developed new technologies in these study areas, as well as new and revised Microsoft courses. We wish to participate in this technological development. \r\nRud vgs is applying for Erasmus+ funding for 2 students from EF, 8 from HO/BUA, 4 from DH, 2 \u2013 for the whole Vg2 year. The same applies to HO, DH and TIP. We are also applying for funds for twelve students for a period of two weeks during the academic year for HO, DH EF and TIP. In addition we are hoping that funds will cover the cost of two teachers in the same subjects who will take part in the lessons together with the students and be involved in further planning. We also ask for funds for two teacher who are expert in Adobe programs and camouflage technique from YC. A number of teachers involved are members of apprenticeship organisations. \r\nRud wants to offer educational programs for students who have completed Vg1 (first year) within the HO, EF, DH and TIP program subjects. The students are made aware of this offer already at education fairs for lower secondary students and in their first semester at Vg1. The entrance criteria include sending in an application and an interview. This goes for both shorter and longer exchange periods. The students\u2019 motivation, attendance and grades will also be taken into consideration in choosing exchange candidates.\r\n\r\nAt YC and CCN students are given specific subject related work practice as well as theoretical assignments. The teachers at Rud and YC  and CCN have cooperated in planning educational modules so that teachers from Rud will be able to be present during parts of the subject modules. This allows both the sending and the receiving school one the opportunity to develop teaching methods that provide the groundwork for stronger bonds between our two schools. After passing all modules the students will take an interdisciplinary test. Teachers from both Norway and England will be present. The teachers have developed a much improved understanding of vocational thinking though this international cooperation. This forms the basis for entrepreneurial and innovative skills in the respective subject areas. We will also enable both our long- and short-term exchange students to be awarded a Europass  and MoU and letters of intent will be signed. \r\nIn addition to English and Norwegian teachers and guidance counsellors partaking in educational activities, there will be cultural activities together with the students, such as concerts and excursions to cities and local sights. \r\nSocial media are used for communication purposes and as part of the marketing of the exchange program. The use of digital tools is an important element in all educational programs. \r\nStudents on the exchange program have now acquired, for example, the ability to use digital tools in new situations. The interest in sitting in on classes and in this way gaining a greater understanding both of the subject and the learning processes involved has increased. We also see increased levels of self-confidence, and the students say they have a better understanding of the English language. Our position in the jobs market, in competition with others, has been strengthened. Exchange opportunities for vocational students has resulted in greater interest and activity at education fairs. \r\nRud are experiencing an increased interest in this exchange program and amongst parents and students who inquire about exchange programs in conjunction with vocational subjects. Teachers show a greater understanding of the educational aspects now available for vocational students as a result of international cooperation. We hope to expand our offer to encompass other vocational programs so that enabling more students to take part of their education abroad.

Hordaland is a region in growth, having reached half a million inhabitants it is now one of the fastest growing counties in Norway. \r\n\r\nRelevant skills and competences are becoming increasingly important, and the labour market and businesses call for more well-performing educational and training systems. In order to meet these needs, and ensure the competitiveness of the region, Hordaland will continually have to acquire new knowledge and methods. Hordaland should contribute in making its inhabitants become global citizens, with awareness and knowledge of Europe and the world. Global competences and intercultural understanding can contribute to further development of civil society.\r\n\r\nInternational cooperation is an integral part of HCC\u2019s strategy for regional development (International Strategy 2013-2016). As the challenges the region is faced with are not only valid for Hordaland, HCC sees international cooperation as a tool in finding possible solutions to challenges that are either common for many, or that are transregional/ transnational.\r\n\r\nHCC aims at using Erasmus+ VET Mobility 2017-19 as a strategic tool in developing the region. The programme will be an important contribution in meeting both the challenge of restructuring, as well as creating closer cooperation between education and training and the labour market. Further, the programme will be important in improving language and intercultural competences.\r\n\r\nHCC continuously aims at increasing participation among our partners. In this application, we have maintained approximately the same number of VET pupils as previous years, but have had an increase in participation among our Apprenticeship Training Offices/Establishments.  \r\n\r\nBy including participation in the Erasmus+ programme as a tool in the Competence Development Plan 2016-20 (CDP), we aim to strengthen professional skills and intercultural competences among VET teachers. Including job shadowing abroad into the CDP, contributes to the quality of the projects as well as long-term competence development. We also make an effort to include staff mobility to the mobilities for apprentices. Allowing mentors to take part in work placements together with their apprentice will not only improve the quality of training, but also increase the impact of the mobility. \r\n\r\nThis project emphasise developing cross-sectoral group mobilities. Sustainable development demands international cooperation across different sectors, governmental levels, and disciplines. Close links between businesses and education is of great importance in developing competences and networks, promoting innovation, adapting to the green shift, and securing that education reflects the needs in the market. Mobilising the inter-municipality councils of Hordaland has been a priority in this application, as they are central players when it comes to facilitating cooperation between municipalities, commerce and education. One example of a project involving these councils is the project exchanging best practice with the wool industry in Shetlands, coordinated by Region Nordhordland. The project involves several key local stakeholders within the wool industry, VET, and municipalities of the region.\r\n\r\nThe mobility projects in this application involve systematic work to ensure the quality of preparation and implementation. Quality management and preparation are important for the desired effects and impact of the projects, such as attitudes, shared responsibility, reflection, enhanced cultural awareness as well as more active and positive participation in a multicultural Norwegian and international society and work force. \r\n\r\nHCC is applying for 64 mobility projects, which count 192 pupils and 24 apprentices from 15 different upper secondary schools and 7 training offices, and 58 accompanying persons. HCC is also applying for 28 mobility projects, which count 201 staff from various businesses, municipalities, VET schools and other regional developers. The disciplines represented in this application includes health care/social work, restaurant/hotel, industrial technology, design/crafts, electricity/electronics, and Ict. In addition, the mobility projects will cover themes such as textile industry, welfare technology, innovation, renewable energy, adaptation of curricula/teaching methods and development of new workshops, and cooperation between VET and businesses.\r\n\r\nAs a school owner, HCC is responsible for the safety and wellbeing of the pupils participating in the mobility projects. The majority of the pupils are under the age of 18, and it is important that they be accompanied while traveling to and from their host countries. The accompanying persons will assist the pupils while traveling and make sure the pupils settle in at both their place of accommodation and the work place.", "http://www.askham-bryan.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NO01-KA116-034004_20"]]}}, "outwardCode": "YO23"}
