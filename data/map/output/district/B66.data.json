Secondly, it will describe security measures and process improvements to maintain or augment the efficient and secure operation of postal services to address the identified threats.\n\nAfter making an inventory of security gaps these will be developed into generic postal security models which will be integrated into a Postal  Security Target Operating Model, which will enable postal operators, customs and other relevant actors to understand how to securely exchange information related not only to security but also to the optimisation of postal flows. To support the Postal Security Target Operating Model, a Postal Security Platform will be developed that will help extending the current MEDICI effort, and will exploit developments made in FP7 projects on e-Freight and secure supply chains.

KGYAT\u2019s proprietary RVCR (Rotary Variable Compression Ratio) engine technology combines into one high-tech powertrain the specific output and performance advantages of rotary motors and the thermal efficiency gains from VCRs. This enables the RVCR engine to eliminate the complexities in conventional crank mechanism-based VCRs and offer the advantages of; multiple fuel flexibility, efficiency gains by 30%, lower emissions, and reduced cost, making it the world\u2019s first commercially viable VCR engine. This disruptive, highly efficient fuel-flexible RVCR engine will enable a smooth transition from 20th century fossil fuel dependency to 21st century green fuels without disrupting the existing fossil-fuel based economic structures.\nRVCR has been prototyped within a laboratory environment, however KGYAT is now looking to gain funding to: demonstrate and validate the performance of a 75kW RVCR engine on a test bed for product qualification; and industrialisation of the RVCR engine with an engine manufacturer, including a design for manufacturing and assembly and the optimisation of costs, demonstrating viability of high volume production. \nDue to RVCR\u2019s robustness and efficiency it is a perfect solution to reduce emissions and fuel consumption of passenger cars.'", null, 58581.0, "RVCR", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_205871_927315636"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B66"}
