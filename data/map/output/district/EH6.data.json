This internship abroad will give an international dimension to the participants\u2019 CV, a genuine added value when they are looking for a job in the near future. Within two years nearly 200 students aged 17-19 will go in 5 European countries. These students will be selected on their motivation to invest themselves in their formation.

We have decided to share our foreign partners and receiving companies, this a real asset because it will create an efficient partnership network and give a greater legitimacy to our consortium on the academic and european scene.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the working program have been agreed on by all the schools and they are committed to respect the phases of the project: selection and common preparation of the participants, mobility and internship and finally evaluation and sharing of the impacts and results.
