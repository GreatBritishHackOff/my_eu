Innovation is a complex issue, requiring both special expertise and a large amount of knowledge. I.e., domain knowledge (on the industry sector) but also knowledge on technology, business models, finances, markets, etc. Innovation is not an easily job for a single enterprise, then really a challenge for a networked virtual enterprise. The BIVEE project intends to develop a rich framework, i.e., a software environment that includes business principles,  models, and best practices, to promote innovation in virtual enterprise environments. Effective innovation needs to be aware of what is going on inside the VE, at the production level, and at the same time outside it, where a plethora of elements move fast and often unexpectedly (i.e., markets, technology, finances, competitors, etc.). In BIVEE we introduced the notions of Value Production and Business Innovation space that shape the BIVEE framework, including the knowledge repository that collects all the required elements, inside and outside the VE. The knowledge repository is the key asset of the Mission Control Room, that monitors and manages the VE production, and the Virtual Innovation Factory that produces innovation and manages its introduction in the VE. The workplan of BIVEE emphasizes the impact achievement. To this end it has been based on two different trial applications (in furniture and high tech equipments, respectively), both organised in two major trial phases: Phase1 for monitoring the course of production before the introduction of BIVEE environment and Phase2 where the VE achievements are assessed having the BIVEE environment in place. The two trial cases are quite different, to prove the flexibility and adoptability of BIVEE. To achieve the objective goals we organised a strong industry-driven consortium, having 7 industrial and 2 research partners.", 78199.0, 3491464.0, "BIVEE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_100275_971292429"], ["4WY", "Ambulatory Magneto-Enhancement of Transdermal High Yield Silver Therapy", "Barric Limited", "There are approximately 2 million people  who suffer from chronic wounds such as venous leg ulcers in Europe at the present time. These wounds typically take between 12 and 24 weeks to heal, but 30% take over two years. This represents a cost to the European healthcare services of at least \u20ac8 billion  a year in treatment. Two thirds of cases are released immediately for treatment in the community, and it is common for 40% of community nurses\u2019 time to be taken up by the management, dressing and care of this type of wound.  In addition to the above, one of the reasons behind the phenomenon of antibiotic resistant bacteria is the widespread use of medication when there is no clinical infection. If low level silver ion dressings could be used in prophylaxis instead of antibiotics there would be an additional saving in terms of the cost of treating patients who contract antibiotic resistant infections. More importantly the incidence of antibiotic resistance will be lower.  Current wound treatments are either expensive, inadequate or dangerous. Our idea provides a way of enhancing the effectiveness of silver-containing dressings used in the treatment of ulcers by creating a pulsed electromagnetic field at the wound site by the incorporation of a pulsed electromagnetic element in a low silver dressing. The pulsed electromagnetic field increases the concentration of silver ions available to the wound bed margin.   The device is designed to be worn by patients in their every-day lives without the need to attend a medical facility for treatment. The system consists of two distinct components \u2013 an electronic pulse generator and an electromagnetic component contained in a disposable surgical dressing which is impregnated with silver-containing nanoparticles.", 99301.0, 906682.0, "AMETHYST", null, null, null, null, "http://www.barric.co.uk", null, "fp7_107635_994869637"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1PX", "G\u00e4rtnerisches Praktikum im europ\u00e4ischen Ausland", "Howard Nurseries Ltd", 68365.0, "The project \u201eHorticultural Internships Abroad\u201c enables students from the College of Horticulture and Garden Design to gain experience in the direction of a specific profession such as garden design, landscape design, or market gardening in a European-wide context.  The internships are an integral part of the education.  Internships abroad require financial support in order to give as many students as possible this opportunity.\r\nThe students work in a broad spectrum of companies, from planning agencies, design companies, and forestry schools, to gardens for vegetables and flowers.  They thereby not only test the knowledge they amassed while at school, but they also learn the first steps in beginning a career, which may not be widespread in Austria, such as specialized perennial nurseries, planning agencies, that also execute plans, nursery facilities, etc.  By working abroad in a country with a foreign language, the students can deepen their understanding of the English language.  This should also awaken an interest to think outside the national border, when the students choose a future place of work or study.  In the first phase of the project, a total of 16 students will be placed in 7 European countries:  two in Great Britain, 4 in Ireland, one in Italy, two in the Netherlands, two in Portugal, one in Spain and 2 in Germany.  5 students specialize in the market gardening program, while the other 11 focus on garden and landscape design.  That is more than half of the entire student population in that class year.\r\nIn the second phase of the project, we expect an even larger number of students, because the internship program can be promoted right from the beginning.\r\nWith our advice and support, the students look for internships themselves.  We provide the students with the appropriate information and insurance.  All the participants can contact us, the advisors, at any time via email or cellphone.  The interns are required to keep a journal for the duration of their internship.  This is necessary for the positive completion of the internship.\r\nThe internships can be considered a success if the students integrate their work abroad into their plans for the future as a matter of course.\r\nIn the long-term, we are working on building an informal network of companies and institutions, which will share our commitment to the internship education of the students and offer young people the chance to broaden their horizons.", "http://www.howardnurseries.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-AT01-KA102-039004_4"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1BN", "THE CAPITAL CONSULTANCY AND TRAINING COMPANY LIMITED", 4579.0, "Other management expenditure (01.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_47426", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "IP22"}
