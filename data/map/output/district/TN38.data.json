This bacterium has become a worldwide concern since it causes listeriosis, an infection which can kill vulnerable people such as the elderly, pregnant women and people suffering from immuno-compromising diseases.Moreover, the Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards of the EFSA warned recently that this microorganism was on the rise.The number of human cases of the disease increased by 8.6% in the EU, reaching 1,583 cases in 2006.  Techniques available nowadays for the detection of Listeria present some major limitations very low recovery rates of the microorganism due to the formation of biofilms;extensive treatment times (pre-enrichment step needed in most of the cases);and limited sensitivity of the measurement techniques.  The objective of BIOLISME is to develop a system to monitor the contamination levels in industrial food producing-plants in a more fast, safe and efficient manner than current tools.This objective will be reached through the study of different types of Listeria contamination; the design of new sampling techniques; the optimisation of the samples\u2019 treatments;and the development of a biosensor-based detection system.

They were used to monitor the contamination levels in industrial food-processing plants in a faster, safer and more efficient way than current tools.\n\nProject partners simulated the contamination conditions on surfaces in contact with food and how food industries deal with it. They also investigated the inoculation of L. monocytogenes free-living cells and the formation of L. monocytogenes biofilms, with particular focus on strains isolated from real food samples. The influence of various parameters such as materials, temperatures and presence of other food-borne pathogens was also studied.\n\nScientists also built a sampling system based on compressed air technology that detached and collected L. monocytogenes cells from surfaces in food-processing environments. In addition, a detection system based on biosensor technology was developed that incorporated recent developments in immunotechnology and optics to create a faster and more sensitive system for detecting L. monocytogenes.\n\nThe work conducted by BIOLISME will help quality control in industry by introducing a faster, in situ Listeria monocytogenes detection system that will enable companies to carry out effective food safety and/or cleaning regimes in a shorter period of time.
