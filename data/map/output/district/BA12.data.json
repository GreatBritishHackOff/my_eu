However management of both food allergy (by patients and health practitioners) and allergens (by industry) is thwarted by lack of evidence to either prevent food allergy developing or protect adequately those who are already allergic. iFAAM will develop evidence-based approaches and tools for MANAGEMENT of ALLERGENS in FOOD and integrate knowledge derived from their application and new knowledge from intervention studies into FOOD ALLERGY MANAGEMENT plans and dietary advice. The resulting holistic strategies will reduce the burden of food allergies in Europe and beyond, whilst enabling the European food industry to compete in the global market place.\nOur approach will build on e-Health concepts to allow full exploitation of complex data obtained from the work in this proposal and previous and ongoing studies, maximising sharing and linkage of data, by developing an informatics platform \u201cAllerg-e-lab\u201d. This will enable us to\n(1)\tExtend and integrate existing cohorts from observation and intervention studies to provide evidence as to how maternal diet and infant feeding practices (including weaning) modulate the patterns and prevalence of allergies across Europe\n(2)\tEstablish risk factors for the development of severe reactions to food and identify associated biomarkers\n(3)\tDevelop a clinically-validated tiered risk assessment and evidence-based risk management approach for food allergens for allergens in the food chain\n(4)\tDevelop clinically-relevant multi-analyte methods of analysis suited to allergen management across the food chain\n\nStakeholders will be integrated into iFAAM to deliver harmonised integrated approaches, including RISK ASSESSORS AND MANAGERS managing population risk, the FOOD INDUSTRY who manage allergens to ensure consumer safety, HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS to provide food allergy management plans and dietary advice and ALLERGIC CONSUMERS to manage individual risk.", 159849.0, 9969512.0, "IFAAM", "Food allergy management", "In Europe alone, around 20 million people suffer from some form of food allergy. EU-funded researchers are developing evidence-based strategies to optimise food allergy management and minimise risk.", "Food allergies are incurable and the only option available is to avoid the ingredient to which we are sensitive. Allergy symptoms range from mild to anaphylaxis, highlighting the need for determining safe levels of allergen contamination in food.\n\nThe multidisciplinary 'Integrated approaches to food allergen and allergy risk management' (http://www.inflammation-repair.manchester.ac.uk/iFAAM/ (IFAAM)) project will develop evidence-based guidelines to effectively manage food allergies using the informatics platform Allerg-e-lab for complex data analysis.\n\nIFAAM will deliver harmonised integrated approaches through the inclusion of stakeholders such as risk assessors and managers, the food industry, health care practitioners and allergic consumers.\n\nThe EuroPrevall birth cohort worked on understanding the incidence of food allergies in newborns and children. IFAAM members developed questionnaires and clinical protocols to follow up on this cohort and harmonised protocols for diagnosing food allergy. Already, ethical approval has been obtained in five study centres.\n\nStudies on allergen properties, risk factors, candidate biomarkers for severity, proton pump inhibitor interventions and role of mast cells are ongoing. Researchers compared EuroPrevall data with other databases to obtain threshold data on foods such as celery and hazelnut.\n\nPilot studies on allergic reactions were implemented in the Allerg-e-lab environment. The panel of food ingredients for testing includes milk powder, egg white powder, and walnut, hazelnut and peanut flours.\n\nThrough mass spectrometry-based methods, multi-analyte analysis for food allergens was carried out. As a result, the team identified candidate peptide targets and developed novel allergen extraction protocols along with proteolytic digestion protocols. Currently, the immunoglobulin\u00a0E reactivity of the above ingredients is being evaluated in patients.\n\nProject outcomes will be invaluable in the current scenario of increasing incidence of allergies even in infants. Besides better diagnostic tools, research results will aid in developing effective pan-European food safety regulations to minimise consumer risk. Such measures will also boost the competitiveness of the European food industry.

The project also aims to develop knowledge for students and staff to develop knowledge concerning global work that has been raised in the curriculum for higher education and goals to attain in the Natural Resources Programme. Through our experience we know that projects such as these students do develop their ability to discuss subjects from different view points. This will help the students in making a positive progress in their studies.\r\nThe duration for this application is two years. Realgymnasiet has four different courses, these are; animal care, horse care, dog training and nature guide/tourism. This project would give 12 students and one accompanying person, per year, the possibility to go abroad in year 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nThe project will be run by personnel at school who will designate a coordinator in charge. The project will be divided into five phases; planning/application, preparation, implementation, follow-up/evaluation and spreading.\r\nThe emphasis of the result is mainly for the participant who has through the project enhanced his/her employment capacity by an enriched network in their professional field, personal development, a cultural perspective and so on. Also the school will benefit from the results through the spreading phase.\r\nLong term we hope that this project will help us in having good relationships with our partners and in developing he global perspective on our education now and in the future. We also hope that this project will have a positive outcome on unemployment among young people by shaping young adults that are sought after within our field and an increased cultural understanding in our society", "http://www.longleat.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-SE01-KA102-012141_4"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BA12"}
