Since NOx increases with OPR, combustion technologies have to be further developed, at the same time, to at least compensate for this effect. The project will attain and exceed the ACARE targets for 2020 and will be going beyond the CO2 reductions to be achieved by on-going FP6 and FP7 programmes including Clean Sky:\n1.) CO2: minus 50% per passenger kilometre by 2020, with an engine contribution of 15 to 20%, 2.) NOx: minus 80% by 2020 and 3.) Reduce other emissions: soot, CO, UHC, SOx, particulates.\nThe major technical subjects to be addressed by the project are:\n1.) Innovative compressor for the ultra-high pressure ratio cycle (OPR 70) and associated thermal management technologies, 2.) Combustor-turbine interaction for higher turbine efficiency & ultra-high OPR cycles, 3.) Low NOx combustion systems for ultra-high OPR cycles, 4.) Advanced structures to enable high OPR engines & integration with heat exchangers, 5.) Reduced cooling requirements and stiffer structures for turbo-machinery efficiency, 6.) HP/IP compressor stability control.\nThe first four subjects will enable the engine industry to extend their design space beyond the overall pressure ratio of 50, which is the practical limit in the latest engines. Rig testing is required to validate the respective designs as well as the simulation tools to be developed.  The last two subjects have already been researched on the last two subjects by NEWAC. The technology developed in NEWAC (mainly component and / or breadboard validation in a laboratory environment) will be driven further in LEMCOTEC for UHPR core engines. These technologies will be validated at a higher readiness level of up to TRL 5 (component and / or breadboard validation in a relevant environment) for ultra-high OPR core-engines.", 118448.0, 54932328.0, "LEMCOTEC", "Lowering aero-engine emissions", "The EU is committed to the development of more efficient aero-engines for green and sustainable air transport.

EU-funded scientists working on the project 'Low emissions core-engine technologies' (http://www.lemcotec.eu/ (LEMCOTEC)) plan to meet or exceed these targets.\n\nThe path to success lies in increasing the overall pressure ratio (OPR) of the engine up to 70 for substantial improvement in core engine thermal efficiency.\n\nResearch is focused on four key technical innovations in four major areas.\n\nThese are the compressor itself, combustor\u2013turbine interaction, lean combustion systems for low NOx emissions, and advanced ultra-high OPR engine structures and associated thermal management technologies.\n\nDuring the first project period, scientists defined the whole engine specifications for aircraft equipped with a regional turbofan, a medium-range open rotor and a long-range turbofan engine. They extended this analysis to include four future core engines projected for 2030\u20132050.\n\nResearchers then selected promising ultra-high OPR compressor concepts. Tests are under way and subject to continuous update with the support of computational fluid dynamics modelling. Lean combustion technologies exploiting a lean mixture of fuel and air (a low fuel-to-air ratio) enable significant reductions in emissions. They rely on advanced fuel control and fuel injection technologies.Scientists analysed advanced fuel injection system concepts and specified the architectures for the fuel control systems. \n\nPreliminary designs for all three combustors have now been completed and researchers are working on designing the combustion chamber, cooling systems and external aerodynamics. Advanced structures and thermal management systems are in various stages of design, manufacture and testing.\n\n\nLEMCOTEC technologies promise to achieve very high OPR and thus increase core engine thermal efficiency.

EcoJet targets the development of an engine based on an innovative radial jet turbine with an integrated electric generator. The technology has a uniquely robust design and uses very few advanced components, which makes it inexpensive and simple to manufacture. As existing micro turbine technology, it is multi-fuel enabled; has a high power to weight ratio, low emissions; no vibration and noise. As a core novelty and differentiator, the EcoJet design simultaneously enables environmentally superior performance and cost-effective uptake of micro CHP compared to conventional reciprocating engine generators. The concept addresses S&T barriers related to materials selection and assessment and to the production of the monorotor and heat exchanger. The EcoJet solution has a range of unique selling propositions to a very large group of potential end-users \u2013 manufacturers of micro CHP systems and, ultimately, households \u2013 which, in addition to economic benefits, can contribute to the mitigation of environmental problems due to a reduction in energy consumption and emissions.\nThe SME consortium has the capacity to produce and market the new solution, but lacks the financial resources as well as the research expertise that enable the required technological development.

Eight interconnected turbine and compressor experiments will be performed in the project, in combination with numerical modelling of vibrating blades and the related unsteady aerodynamics. Cascade experiments will be employed to study unsteady aerodynamic properties in detail.
