It will also be most beneficial as our school works in line with successfully implementing the Scottish Government language policy of 1 + 2. .  During this residential course, being in a continuous presence of teachers with French practice from morning until evening with the added opportunity to meet with local people, have lively discussions and debates, friendly meals in the company of the teachers - all these will help to root our learning of French in real life and to make us progress in the language. We will gain a valuable cultural experience which we would otherwise only be able to read about and look at photographs and pictures. This will encourage us to speak French in a range of situations and grow in confidence while doing so. This can then be transfered into the classroom situation as we speak to our pupils in the French language with confidence. As we return from this immersion course feeling more confident and able to transfer our enthusiasm to our pupils, they  will be in turn become more confident and able to enjoy speaking,reading, writing, talking and listening in French. \r\nObjectives: \r\nTo gain resources, materials and methods of teaching French. To explore various methods of teaching French. to develop a cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary France. To improve our competence and performance in French.\r\nParticipants:\r\n2 members of staff. Mrs Nicol (Principal Teacher) being at a beginners level in French and Mrs Murphy (Classroom Teacher) being at a competent level in French.\r\nImpact: \r\nWe envisage pupils using ICT to communicate with other schools in the U.K and abroad, and we envisage finding a partner school/schools in France/Europe to encourage: reading, writing, talking and listening in French or another European language.  The pupils will be provided with opportunities and support to communicate with other schools in the UK and in France. For example: pen-pals, mini-projects, home learning activities, communications via social media .  The French immersion course will give us motivation and confidence, based on a unique concept involving total immersion in French culture and language.\r\nDescription of Activities:\r\nA time frame will be established to facilitate activities prior to the immersion course including meetings to prepare teachers, meetings between the course provider and the school and meetings to obtain the relevant paperwork, course programme, course aims and objectives. Time will be allocated to use the online tool with guidelines and key phrases for preparation in advance. French language learning will be continued by Mrs Nicol and background reading will take place and we will attend the information event organised the LA/cluster group. Following the immersion course, we will participate in a recall day to enable us to measure the impact of the training and the Head Teacher will monitor the progress and impact of the training. We will share our resources and knowledge gained from the course with colleagues and members of staff from our partner school, Walston Primary School and the members of the learning community. We can share our resources, experiences, knowledge and skills gained from the course on social media, the school website, blogs , an exhibition in our school and in our local newspaper. We will communicate results to colleagues and parents/local community through presentations and/or workshops.\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project:\r\nProfessional learning will be recorded during the training in a learning logbook and resources will be gathered on USB keys. Professional dialogue will take place with colleagues, teachers, locals and course providers. Explore various methods of teaching French and finding partners schools in France can be investigated and the relevant inquiries can be made. \r\n\r\n\r\nLonger term benefits:\r\nA positive view teaching and learning in French. The development of resources, ideas,teaching methods and professional dialogue to be used for quality teaching and learning in French. Teacher's training in French and methodology will be vital to embed French into the everyday life of our school. Create a European dimension through the increased European links raised awareness.
