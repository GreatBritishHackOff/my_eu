The target group has prior experience of the execution and accompaniment of learning experiences abroad and should, through taking part, be given a clearer idea of the insights their trainees are able to gain by participating in the project. Over a period of ten days, a group of 42 teachers will receive inter-cultural and linguistic training in the UK; pay visits to educational institutions in the area; and take part in cultural activities. As a result of this experience, teachers should be able to strengthen the understanding of the importance of inter-cultural competence in vocational training on a regional level, and function as experts in the execution of learning experiences abroad.
