The evaluation of the success of the project will be realised through the validation of real scale  demonstrators and prototypes integrating the new above mentioned technologies.\n\nThanks to the project the following improvements are expected: 20% reduction in energy consumption is expected compared with current systems, zero particle emission in the atmosphere and the transformation of heat in usable energies, the reduction of at least 50% in the generation of residues through innovating recovery system of residues and reusability of the 100% of the generated CO. These developments, will allow to the generation of new furnaces with greater energetic efficiency and a minimal environmental footprint.\n\nIn addition these new technologies will allow reaching efficient operating conditions: reduction of times of fusion, minor power consumption in zones of maintenance and energy storage.\nOn th emonger term, the project will grealty contribute to increase the competitiveness of the  Foundry, Glass, Cement and Ceramic industries often economically unfavoured by new environmental regulations on the European Industry.\n\nThe obtained results will be of direct applications in the mentioned industries and can be indirectly applied to other sectors like automotive, aeronautics, railway industries. The four mentioned target industries actually contirbute to produce components for vehicles (engine aluminium block), construction (cement for buildings), ceramic bricks, floor tiles, porcelain, urban furnitures,, food industry (cabbage-cutters, beaters) and electronics: housing, connectors, electrical sector, cables, subjections of electrical laying.", 19113.0, 11048590.0, "EDEFU", "Eco-friendly and efficient industrial furnaces", "Industrial furnaces use a lot of energy and produce hazardous emissions creating regulatory problems for many industries. EU-funded scientists are bringing them up-to-date with novel heating and thermal management technology.", "Intense heat is required to process many different materials, including aluminium, glass, ceramics and cement. These materials are used in vehicles, buildings, appliances and electronics, making an important contribution to the European economy.\n\nThe furnaces typically used are in need of modernised materials and designs to meet today's standards of reduced energy consumption, emissions and waste generation. A large European consortium plans to deliver real-scale demonstrators thanks to EU-funding of the project 'New designs of ecological furnaces' (EDEFU). The project will investigate three novel heating systems, innovative insulating materials and new recovery systems to minimise heat loss and gas emissions and increase productivity.\n\nThree heating technologies are being explored. Plasma torch has high energy rate. Hence it can be used to melt metal in shorter time, increasing productivity and product quality. Electrical resistance and microwave heating can also reduce energy consumption. Researchers have obtained preliminary results on energy efficiency, environmental impact and economics of all three systems.\n\nScientists are also investigating the use of novel materials to reduce heat loss through furnace walls. Through the use of nanoparticles and nanofibres, the team plans to enhance insulation with thinner walls leading to more compact and energy efficient systems. Specialised designs have been developed using two materials selected by the consortium.\n\nFinally, the team is developing innovative ways to recover heat and reduce emissions. Phase change materials (PCMs) that absorb or release heat during melting or freezing are ideal for thermal management. The use of focused heating sources, such as lasers, to break chemical bonds creates particles and residues that can then be recovered. To this end, the consortium compiled data on state-of-the-art PCMs and energy and particle recovery systems leading to the development of a new furnace cleaning system.\n\nEDEFU is establishing the knowledge base necessary for a demonstration of modernised industrial furnaces in the second reporting period with low energy consumption and emissions as well as enhanced thermal efficiency. Enhanced designs will strengthen the competitive position of several industries struggling with stringent environmental regulations.", "http://www.edefu.eu", "http://www.carbolite.com", "/docs/results/images/2013-06/55060.jpg", "fp7_97000_989185922"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8WB", "Course for Adventure Related Vocational Educators", "Lindley Education Trust Limited", 86503.0, "The Course for Adventure Related Vocational Educators (CARVE) provides staff and learners from the outdoor education and outdoor adventure sector in Ireland with work placement opportunities in the outdoor industry in UK, France, Spain, Greece and the British Virgin Islands.  \r\n\r\nOur CARVE program developed from several work placement programs we delivered for the sector under the Leonardo Da Vinci aspect of the lifelong learning program. Our goal as an organisation is to develop European VET work placement programs for staff and learners/graduates, from the Irish Outdoor Education and Adventure sector that make lifelong learning and mobility within the sector a reality for our learners.  We promote equity; social cohesion and active citizenship by enabling our participants acquire and develop new skills and competencies needed for their employability. Our placements foster further learning, active citizenship and intercultural dialogue. \r\n\r\nWithin the CARVE program there are a number of placements for staff currently working in the sector and recent graduates from vocational training programs that qualified them as outdoor activity instructors. Over the coming year our placements for staff are aimed at providing them with the skills, knowledge and competencies required to improve the standards of the sector in Ireland. \r\n\r\nOur first Erasmus + staff placement in Sept/Oct 2014 is a two week placement with Action Outdoors in Chamonix aimed at providing staff with the knowledge, skills and competencies to effectively build and manage a group adventure experience in the Alps. Our second placement is for current diving instructors to spend 60 days in British Virgin Islands. The placement provides these staff with the opportunity to shadow and work alongside dive instructors with Sail Caribbean (autumn 2014 & spring 2015). We are also sending 3 wind/kite surfing instructors to work with Club Mistral in the Gran Canaries in autumn 2014 and another 3 in spring 2015 for 60 days.  Our placements for learners or recent graduates provides 4 recent graduates with work placements with Club Mistral in May/June 2015 for 60 days in Spain and Greece. We also have one recent graduate travelling to the UK to work with Lindley Education Trust May/June 2015 and 4 recent graduates travelling out to work with Sail Caribbean in May/June 2015 for 60 days.  This is a total of 25 placements, for participants from a large number of organisations in Ireland, in 5 different countries throughout Europe and its territories.  \r\n\r\nWe are seeking through our placements to improve the level of key competences and skills within the Active Leisure/ Outdoor Education and Adventure industry, with particular regard to their relevance for the labour market and participant\u2019s contribution to a cohesive society.  We will be providing the sector with increased opportunities for learning mobility and through strengthened cooperation between the world of education and training and the world of work. We foster quality improvements, innovation excellence and internationalisation at the level of education and training institutions, in particular through enhanced transnational cooperation between education and training providers and other stakeholders. We enhance the international dimension of education and training, in particular through cooperation between programme and partner-country institutions in the field of VET through the promotion of mobility.

LET has 50 years\u2019 experience of supporting personal development through challenging and inspiring outdoor activities, including climbing, caving, kayaking and bushcraft, delivered in a safe, supportive environment and led by professional instructors. LET\u2019s work is delivered from two residential centres in the Peak District, and, increasingly, through outreach projects in disadvantaged urban areas. LET is committed to inclusion and is able to adapt many of its activities to support those with additional needs. The organisation also has a bursary fund to enable the participation of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, and to support groups that need a higher instructor to client ratio.Objectives:This project aims to \u2022 provide an immersive experience of the outdoor learning sector\u2022 support employability through facilitating the development of the skills, experience and attributes needed to work in the outdoor learning sector \u2022 support the development of range of task-specific skills, informal learning, reflective processes and personal development.  \u2022 support the development of English language skills in a range of real life contexts\u2022 support cultural exchange and understanding and help build ongoing links with organisations across Europe to facilitate exchange of ideas and best practice\u2022 raise awareness of European volunteer opportunities with the young people that LET works with, many of whom are from disadvantaged communities\u2022 increase the number of outdoor activity projects taking part in EVS and other international exchange  programmes.Volunteer Profile:The current project seeks to support one volunteer, an 18-year-old woman from Germany who proactively contacted LET as the receiving organisation and IJGD as the sending organisation. Following an outward bound course, plus voluntary work supervising outdoor activities for children, the volunteer decided she wishes to pursue a career in outdoor education.LET is keen to host more Erasmus and EVS placements in the future, and potentially to act as a sending organisation for some of the many young people they work withActivities and Methodology:Through this project, the volunteer will get involved with all aspects of LET\u2019s work. She will work alongside our instructors and experience all aspects of working in the delivery of outdoor education.  The volunteer will initially observe sessions; as her confidence, competence and experience increases she will have opportunities to lead certain sessions, under supervision, and, potentially, to lead low risk activities by herself. She will have the opportunity to complete LET\u2019s in-house training programme for on-site activities, plus attend relevant National Governing Body training courses for adventurous outdoor activities. She will also learn how to facilitate learning, develop a range of practical guided reflection and reviewing techniques, and gain valuable experience of different learning styles. Whilst these skills and techniques are used in the outdoor education setting they are highly transferable, and highly sought after, in many other industries.LET also works in an outreach capacity with young people in a very deprived area of Greater Manchester. The volunteer will have opportunities to get involved with this programme, supporting the delivery of sessions and hosting discussion with participants.Refection and review are a key part of the programme and the volunteer will be supported in setting and reviewing objectives, and also in identifying the areas of LET\u2019s work in which she is most interested. She will be assigned a Mentor with whom she will have regular review sessions.Results and Impact:The expected impact for the volunteer are the development the competences, values, skills and ability to work with a diverse range of young people in an outdoor education setting, including those with additional needs and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. The benefits for LET include having a fresh perspective on current practices and procedures - the volunteer will be asked to give feedback and suggest improvements. LET will also be able to forge links with European partners to support information exchange and future volunteer placements.Longer term benefit:Dissemination of the programme results will, we hope, encourage more young people to enroll on EVS and Erasmus+ programmes and experience the huge range of benefits these bring. Since registering on the EYP database, LET has been inundated with requests from potential volunteers. By sharing the results of the current programme amongst the outdoor learning sector, LET aims to encourage more outdoor learning organisations to offer EVS and Erasmus+ placements, helping to meet the demand and share the benefits.", "http://www.lindleyeducationaltrust.org", "CHANGE AGENTS UK CHARITY", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA105-023704_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "S33"}
