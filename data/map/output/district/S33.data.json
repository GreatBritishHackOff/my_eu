The evaluation of the success of the project will be realised through the validation of real scale  demonstrators and prototypes integrating the new above mentioned technologies.\n\nThanks to the project the following improvements are expected: 20% reduction in energy consumption is expected compared with current systems, zero particle emission in the atmosphere and the transformation of heat in usable energies, the reduction of at least 50% in the generation of residues through innovating recovery system of residues and reusability of the 100% of the generated CO. These developments, will allow to the generation of new furnaces with greater energetic efficiency and a minimal environmental footprint.\n\nIn addition these new technologies will allow reaching efficient operating conditions: reduction of times of fusion, minor power consumption in zones of maintenance and energy storage.\nOn th emonger term, the project will grealty contribute to increase the competitiveness of the  Foundry, Glass, Cement and Ceramic industries often economically unfavoured by new environmental regulations on the European Industry.\n\nThe obtained results will be of direct applications in the mentioned industries and can be indirectly applied to other sectors like automotive, aeronautics, railway industries. The four mentioned target industries actually contirbute to produce components for vehicles (engine aluminium block), construction (cement for buildings), ceramic bricks, floor tiles, porcelain, urban furnitures,, food industry (cabbage-cutters, beaters) and electronics: housing, connectors, electrical sector, cables, subjections of electrical laying.", 19113.0, 11048590.0, "EDEFU", "Eco-friendly and efficient industrial furnaces", "Industrial furnaces use a lot of energy and produce hazardous emissions creating regulatory problems for many industries. EU-funded scientists are bringing them up-to-date with novel heating and thermal management technology.", "Intense heat is required to process many different materials, including aluminium, glass, ceramics and cement. These materials are used in vehicles, buildings, appliances and electronics, making an important contribution to the European economy.\n\nThe furnaces typically used are in need of modernised materials and designs to meet today's standards of reduced energy consumption, emissions and waste generation. A large European consortium plans to deliver real-scale demonstrators thanks to EU-funding of the project 'New designs of ecological furnaces' (EDEFU). The project will investigate three novel heating systems, innovative insulating materials and new recovery systems to minimise heat loss and gas emissions and increase productivity.\n\nThree heating technologies are being explored. Plasma torch has high energy rate. Hence it can be used to melt metal in shorter time, increasing productivity and product quality. Electrical resistance and microwave heating can also reduce energy consumption. Researchers have obtained preliminary results on energy efficiency, environmental impact and economics of all three systems.\n\nScientists are also investigating the use of novel materials to reduce heat loss through furnace walls. Through the use of nanoparticles and nanofibres, the team plans to enhance insulation with thinner walls leading to more compact and energy efficient systems. Specialised designs have been developed using two materials selected by the consortium.\n\nFinally, the team is developing innovative ways to recover heat and reduce emissions. Phase change materials (PCMs) that absorb or release heat during melting or freezing are ideal for thermal management. The use of focused heating sources, such as lasers, to break chemical bonds creates particles and residues that can then be recovered. To this end, the consortium compiled data on state-of-the-art PCMs and energy and particle recovery systems leading to the development of a new furnace cleaning system.\n\nEDEFU is establishing the knowledge base necessary for a demonstration of modernised industrial furnaces in the second reporting period with low energy consumption and emissions as well as enhanced thermal efficiency. Enhanced designs will strengthen the competitive position of several industries struggling with stringent environmental regulations.", "http://www.edefu.eu", "http://www.carbolite.com", "/docs/results/images/2013-06/55060.jpg", "fp7_97000_989185922"]]}}, "outwardCode": "S33"}
