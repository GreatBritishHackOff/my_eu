The new system will offer unrivalled flexibility in terms of materials, including the ability to switch between powder and wire feed-stock within a single part. Moreover the process can be fitted to a diverse range of platform to produce parts from 2cm to 20m in length. The capability of the OPENHYBRID approach will be validated through the production of industrial demonstrators from the power generation, automotive and mining equipment sectors.", 603381.0, 5799191.0, "OpenHybrid", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_205504_934575504"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DE12"}
