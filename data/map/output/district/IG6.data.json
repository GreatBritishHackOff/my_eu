These apprentices are between 15 to 19 years old and come for most of them from rural territories. They prepare respectively a CAPA (French Professional Exam equivalent of National Vocational Qualification) or \"Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel\" (equivalent of General National Vocational Qualification, intermediate) in human service, trade, farming, farm machinery, horse production, landscaping, horticultural production.\r\nThe aim is to reinforce the professional (discover and analyse new workplaces and professional practices), linguistic (show an interest again in learning a European language), cultural and personal skills. \r\nMore precisely, the beneficiaries will strengthen their personal development, their autonomy, facilitate their socialization, the \u201cleaving-together\u201d and their self-confidence in order to find a job more easily.\r\n27 adults (staff members of the MFR, board members and tutors or internship supervisors) will attend a 1-week internship in a European country in order to discover new european educational, pedagogical, professional, management practices and to strengthen partnerships and adapt pedagogical practices to the needs of tomorrow\u2019s world.\r\n\r\nTo insure the success of the project, the involvement of all the participants and partners is essential at all stages of the mobility.\r\nThe young people and the adults involved in the project take part in setting up the logistical and practical aspects and are evaluated at the end of their professional training by means of different tools like the mobility Europass.\r\nThe MFR manage the cooperation aspects with the European partners (negotiate the activities during the professional training ; organize the follow-up in the host country and the assessment of the trainees). They prepare pedagogically, linguistically and culturally the beneficiaries\u2019 stay and regularly inform the beneficiaries and their families.  They eventually spread and disseminate the results of the mobility projects when the young participants are back.\r\nThe steering and technical committees are the interface between the MFR and the regional CFA. They make sure that the project works well and ensure its continuous improvement. They also controls the quality of the mobility aspect at all stages until the end of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they come back, the MFR will make the results widely available and communicate them to all stakeholders involved in the project (young beneficiaries, families, staff and board members, tutors, French or European local partners) organizing events, meetings, open doors, through social networks and media. \r\n\r\nThe success of the mobility projects is ensured by the implementation of a project management methodology as follows :\r\n- Human resources allocated at a local and regional level (referring person to mobility project, steering and technical committees, mobility advisors). All tasks are shared:\r\n- Working meetings planned throughout the mobility project\r\n- Regular contacts with European partners are planned\r\n- Setting up of a Dissemination plan \r\n- Tools are created and/or shared\r\n\r\nThe expected impacts on the participants are the reinforcement of their skills for a better professional integration (or professionalization), better ability to undertake, learn other languages, increase of open-mindedness and European citizenship.\r\nThe expected impacts on the organizations (MFR Federation, MFR European partners) are the increase of the number of incoming and outgoing mobility, partnership continuation, strengthening of the quality of the mobility projects and development of innovative practices.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, the potential benefits are the recognition of the Auvergne Rh\u00f4ne Alpes\u2019s MFR network at different level : sectoral, local, regional, national and international, the strengthening of their territorial integration and their international dimension.", "http://wwwbarnado.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036427_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "IG6"}
