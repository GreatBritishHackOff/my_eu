The name of the project refers not only to crossing international borders but also to experimenting and learning about different music genres, from classical music to pop-rock music and local and national specialities, even to  music technology and composing.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStudent Mobility Activity consists of three week study periods, that include personal tuition in one\u2019s own major subject (musical instrument), on-the-job-learning in orchestra, ensemble or band activities and one or more public performances, either as a member of the aforementioned formations and/or as a soloist. The students also have opportunities to experiment new music genres and instruments, depending on the specialities offered in each of the different host schools. Those students who choose to visit Glasgow Kelvin College will be offered, instead of personal instrumental lessons, tuition in music technology and marketing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStaff Mobility Activity consist of one 7-day seminar (travel days included). The principals for this activity were mutually agreed upon in a network meeting in Madrid, in October 2013. The key issues for the week\u2019s program will include learning about curricula, teaching methodologies and evaluation criteria in the networking schools and their home countries. Learning about ECVET and how to apply it in our networking schools and mutual projects will be one of the major topics. Key note speakers will lead the participants to the different discussions. Each seminar guest will have an active role in the program, e.g. they can take turns as the key note speaker. Opportunities for job-shadowing and performing in a concert will be offered to all participants as well. The detailed program for this mobility activity will be drawn up in a network meeting to be held in Warsaw in October or November 2014. That is also the time to decide about the host institution.  \r\n\r\nAs each networking school will send 1 to 2 staff members to this seminar, it is expected to have 10 \u2013 18  participants. They can represent teaching and administration staff alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Finland, MWF has a national network of three conservatories. Administered by Lahti Conservatory, the other two partners are  Helsinki and Joensuu Conservatories. These three schools have in total some 190 students in vocational training and intend to send 30 students to Music without Frontiers exchange during the two year project term.  We are applying to send 6 representatives to the seminar. Our partner schools locate in Spain, Scotland, Poland, Portugal, Estonia and the Czech Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the impacts of the project we wish to provide all participants personal growth in their professional skills and also as independent citizens to interact with people from other countries, whether within EU or outside its borders. For our organizations we expect to maintain our good relations and to further develop our  international networking abilities. Thereto, as long term benefits, we wish to gain strong potential to further develop our teaching and evaluation methods. We sincerely hope that MWF Staff Seminar will facilitate the introduction of ECVET in all involved countries. More longterm benefits of Music without Frontiers  Project will be discovered in the future when we can find an increasing number of  foreign musicians playing or teaching in different institutions around Europe and welcoming  visitors to their own institutions with warm hospitality.", "http://www.glasgowkelvin.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FI01-KA102-000090_5"], ["4TD", "Music Without Frontiers/Fashioning the Future", "Glasgow Kelvin College", 74694.0, "CONTEXT/BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThis project is carefully planned mobility programme for 24 music students, 16 fashion students and 8 members of staff at Glasgow Kelvin College.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nStudents will participate in a work placement abroad.  The project will provide music students from the various colleges with an opportunity to work in partnership to learn skills in specific musical styles and organise and perform at concerts in the respective schools.  This will assist students to develop a number of skills in relation to music, partnership working, team work and event management.  The project will therefore provide valuable additional employability related skills gained in an international context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will encourage fashion students to explore the cultural inspiration from the partner schools and use this as a source of design inspiration and development.  It will culminate in the design, production and presentation of fashion goods at various fashion shows which will take place in each of the partner colleges.  This is linked to industry practices where a design team is given a brief from a client to interpret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFashion staff will take part in a variety of teaching and learning related activities over a period of seven days to extend and develop their professional practice.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic student mobility\r\n\r\nTo develop professional abilities\r\n\r\nTo develop an understanding of other cultures and also the business and work environment in other countries.\r\n\r\nTo develop on the job learning opportunities, skills and experience\r\n\r\nTo develop professional competences in their chosen music subject area and learn new skills in relation to other musical styles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFashion student mobility\r\n\r\nTo develop cultural awareness by exploring the cultural influences of the partner city school.\r\n\r\nTo develop a common design brief, interpret design ideas, develop patterns and produce garments and accessories.\r\n\r\nTo develop new production and technical skills to create garments and accessories.\r\n\r\nTo market the Fashion Show and exhibition using new technologies \r\n\r\nTo explore new ways of marketing the project outcome\r\n\r\nTo present the fashion goods at a fashion show\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFashion student mobility\r\n\r\nTo develop new vocational production and technical skills to address the technical challenges identified \r\n\r\nDevelop innovative approaches to sustainability of resources within manufacturing \r\n\r\nDevelop personal continuing professional development\r\n\r\nTo learn how to use additional industry software packages\r\n\r\nTo develop partnership working in an international setting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes are:\r\n\r\nStudents will be able gain vocationally based outcomes, develop social, employability and language skills. \r\n\r\nStaff members who have developed additional skills within their subject expertise\r\n\r\nStaff will develop new teaching methods developed as a result of \u201csharing of good practice\u201d\r\n\r\nDevelopment of partnership working in an international setting\r\n\r\nImproved understanding of educational systems and qualification frameworks within another European country.\r\n\r\nPositive exchange of information and work methods\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTENTIAL LONG TERM BENEFITS\r\n\r\nThe project will provide participants to gain experience in the music industry in a different cultural setting, with different cultural norms and procedures.

Our inner city area of Glasgow is one of the most deprived areas of the United Kingdom and young people have few opportunities to get out of the city, let alone experience spending quality time with young people from other countries, learning about other cultures and seeing what is best about other places and lifestyles. RYA is a forward looking, ambitious organisation who has a real passion for doing the best it can for these young people.  \r\nDuring the summer of 2015 we sent our first group of young people to go on an international youth exchange to Austria and the benefits gained by the young people and our organisation have been numerous and impressive. The step up to hosting an international youth exchange is a natural progression and links to our organisational planning following attendance on numerous \"fact finding\" Youth in Action and Erasmus Plus programmes. The objectives of the project are; to offer a chance to young people with fewer opportunities aged 13 - 15 years from a diverse group of EU countries to come together to form new friendships; to learn about different peoples and cultures; to understand the benefits of healthy lifestyle, sport and exercise; to understand the part the EU plays in their lives and what part they may play in the future of the EU; to plan ahead to continue and improve upon the initial exchange experience and to grow the bonds between the respective organisations. These objectives link to those of the Erasmus + programme and specifically KA1 Youth Mobility by concentrating on young people with fewer opportunities highlighting social inclusion, by promoting active European citizenship through volunteering in particular, by embedding intercultural dialogue throughout the whole process and by \"internationalising\" an organisation that can only benefit and go from strength to strength as well as supporting priorities around healthy behaviours and healthy lifestyle.The exchange will be for 50 young people supported by 15 group leaders and support staff.  A lack of opportunities in general is the biggest problem facing the young people we and our partners work with, and becoming more international is part of the solution, so we are giving young people an opportunity to understand this and a motivation to start a \"European journey\" in their lives. The activity programme will be kept simple in order for the participants to get the maximum feeling of achievement and benefit from the exchange. The main elements of the activity are:\r\n1. Welcome, introductions and icebreakers, to allow participants to relax and get to know each other.\r\n2. Team and confidence building through various outdoor problem solving exercises\r\n3. A Glasgow City Challenge to take the team and confidence building process further as well as giving the chance to discover Glasgow\r\n4. Information session on Erasmus+ and Youthpass. Practice of Youthpass\r\n5. Information session and discussion on healthy living and lifestyle\r\n6. Various outdoor activity sessions to enjoy exercise and appreciate the natural environment \r\n7. Interactive discussions / presentations and quiz on \"my Home, my Europe\" (youth issues and similarities especially in the context of Europe, and my place in Europe)\r\n8. Sport and problem solving challenges to encourage interaction and dialogue\r\n9. Intercultural and social evenings\r\n10. Daily learning review and Youthpass sessions\r\n11. Forward planning for future events\r\n12. Final evaluation and Youthpass session\r\n\r\nThe methodology will be interactive which means that participants will have an active role in all sessions. They will work together mainly in mixed teams to enhance the opportunity for intercultural learning. All activities  require team work and co-operation between participants, both in national groups and mixed groups. Participants will be encouraged to take responsibility for their own learning outcomes through the exchange. By the end of the exchange, they will have developed a sense of shared European identity, a respect for cultural differences and an understanding of healthy lifestyle and living. The project will give participants a greater self confidence and belief in what they are able to achieve. It will expose them to possibilities of a life beyond their current circumstances. It will raise aspiration and encourage possibilities of more healthy living,through non formal education methods. It will increase understanding of the European project and their place within it.

The pupils are studying administrative management and have a European option to assess for their exam. They are preparing a BTEC first in Jean Baptiste Brochier vocational high school.\r\nWe already have partners companies in Glasgow through a partnership with Glasgow city council, Glasgow Kelvin College and Glasgow Old People's Welfare Association.\r\nWe need to fulfill the following goals :\r\n- to improve the current and professional English vocabulary,\r\n- to develop the pupils' autonomy and responsibilities,\r\n- to awaken them to another  European culture,\r\n- to help them develop their self-confidence and their self-esteem,\r\n- to acquire a better cultural and professional mind,\r\n- to favour higher education in which the knowledge of the English language is essential,\r\n- to make them become  more effective European citizens,\r\n- and finally,to make them contemplate a professional future in a European country.\r\nThe participants are preparing a BTEC first in administrative management with a European option. To pass their Euro option they have to be assessed orally by 2 teachers : an English teacher and a management teacher. They need to be able to develop a professional activity in English and obtain a minimum of 10/20. \r\nMoreover, they have an English exam too, as every other pupils preparing a BTEC first, but, they must have 12/20 to validate the Euro option. So, they really need to improve their English level as much as possible. The European option will be a great value on their diploma to help them being accepted in higher education courses and to find a job.\r\nOur pupils will be registered to the 'mobility unit option'. It is a new option created in 2015 by the French eduction board to give more importance to the pupils' placements abroad. It gives them the opportunity to have their placement assessment appearing on their diplomas as a positive mark. It is assessed through an oral exam in French relating their experience abroad on a professional and cultural point of view. At the same time they will take a EUROPRO exam in English.\r\nThe preparatory activities for this placement period will try to achieve the goals below : \r\n- cultural knowledge of the country,\r\n- social-economic aspects of the professional world of the country,\r\n-improvement in the current and professional vocabulary.\r\nFor the school year 2016-2017, we asked for an English speaking language assistant to our regional fund to help us achieve our linguistic and cultural goals. We succeeded in having this person. We asked for the same fund for next year.\r\nMany people from our school are part of this project and work in collaboration, both on the administrative and teaching sides (head of school and depute, financial manager, nurse, teachers). Pupils' parents and tutors from the companies are also part of the project.\r\n\r\nThe preparatory activities :\r\nSince their first year in this schedule, our pupils have more hours in English to get ready for this project and to succeed in obtaining their Euro option. They are also trained in the management course through oral communication linked to their professional field (oral presentation and role plays in English\u2026). English is a compulsory subject for every pupil preparing a BTEC first. And the exam is an oral presentation about a topic chosen by the pupil. They need to train, so the placement will be a perfect training, plus a perfect topic to talk about.\r\nOn a cultural and linguistic side, the pupils participated in the European langages day last October. During this day, they experienced many activities about the European history and culture as well as using the European languages.\r\nTo make our pupils aware about the European citizenship we have a partnership with 'La Maison de l'Europe', an association promoting Europe through different means. We choose to have our pupils participate in their European citizenship challenge. For their tenth edition, one pupil from the Euro section ranked second  this year and made us very proud of her. Every year we have some pupils from the Euro section being on one of the three first ranks.\r\nOur expectations for the future :\r\nWe hope to motivate pupils to integrate our European section in the future years. Indeed, it is still new and pupils don't really know what it is. It stays too abstract for them. \r\nIf our current pupils can go on a work placement abroad, they could talk about it to the future pupils wishing to study administrative management and promote the European section when they participate in different students or professional fairs, or at our school when we organize our open day event.", "http://www.glasgowkelvin.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036897_1"], ["2BS", "LARP - Fantasy and adventure in Swedish nature #3", "Royston Youth Action", 49896.0, "H\u00e4stekasen Farm Association is in the process to found a self sustainable eco-community and learning centre.

(56 participants) (8 countries) (12 days)\r\n\r\nThese activities will merge into and support each other.\r\n\r\nWe have become more convinced about the strength in Edu-Larp (fantasy, acting, storytelling) as an non-formal learning method. How it affects: team building, motivation, intercultural understanding and personal development. We created a lot of self confidence and strong emotions in previous YE.\r\nThis project has also proven to strengthen and widen our network quite radically, it has an impact and more and more people want to hear about it. It has also proven to have a local impact. We have made many new contacts due to this project. Also this project has a budget that is mainly spent locally and thus empowering the countryside and what we call \"ruralisation\".\r\n\r\nLarp means, \"live action role playing game\", in this case we create a fantasy \"Lord of the rings world\". This will be prepared in workshops such as:  Acting, Scout skills, Safety, Sewing, Building shelters, Rythm and music, Mythology of the world,  Simple handicraft, Moving in nature, Reflection time.\r\n\r\nThe Short EVS will arrive earlier preparing for the Youth exchange focusing on practical building and nature/camping skills.\r\nThe Job Shadow will be part of the whole project (arriving before the main activities) focusing on studying/evaluating quality management, and also working on possible future projects.\r\n\r\nWe will according to the Nordic larp tradition focus on inclusion. A tradition of \"seeing\" each other, reacting to each others initiatives within the game. An attitude that can spread into our social interactions also outside the acting part of the activities.\r\n\r\nEvery activity  will be linked to many of the key competences through the youth pass. One added competence to be explored is imagination. Not as a passive consumer of pop-culture, but as co-creator in a group. Bringing shared experience of historical events and fictional characters into real life. After the workshops the participants are both actors and audience in a spectacle that goes on for days - day and night. An adventure in Swedish nature in a fantasy world based on Viking fairy tales.  Imagination is a skill that can be trained and that is not only linked to entertainment or culture - it is a part of creative abstract scientific thinking.\r\n\r\nWe are very excited about this project. There is an unknown factor we look forward to explore together with the youth. This is about creating a \"social game\" based on imagination where \"anything can happen\". The soft factors are: nature, weather and the participants personalities. \r\n\r\nWe believe youth need to be adventurous, even to the border of chaos. It is our role as adults to create safe venues for youth to be able to release energy and lust.  As youth leaders we need to explore new attracting ways of channeling hyperactivity, depression, frustration and teenage hormones - into something constructive  and positive.\r\n\r\nThe social skills that we want to explore is:\r\n- Self awareness.\r\n- Functioning in a multi cultural group.\r\n- Methods of decision making (discussion and votes).\r\n- Methods of learning, practical as well as social methods.\r\n- Leadership skills.\r\n- Storytelling, writing and verbal skills.\r\n\r\nWe would like to stress the activities concept of inclusion beyond language. Youth of the world share this imaginary world of fantasy (mostly known for \"The lord of the rings\"). Sharing interest and using imagination to create a world together is very powerful. The level of non formal learning will be high. On the surface we are playing a social game, where the participants together control the outcome - while we are developing the skills mentioned above.\r\nSo we will mix many groups, many cultures, many ages, many nationalities, many languages and with the power of imagination we will unify them in a fairy tale tale adventure in Swedish nature. \r\n\r\nWe would like to develop the concept to its full potential and this time spend more focus on the participants \"ownership\" of the activities and on dissemination.\r\n\r\nSince we joined the Erasmus program in 2012, our association have tried to challenge ourselves by choosing new approaches to our main theme - using natures resources in a sustainable way.", "http://www.roystonyouthaction.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-3-SE02-KA105-001957_9"], ["2HL", "Equal Love", "Toonspeak Young People's Theatre", 28644.0, "This project is an international youth exchange of 8 international partners from Italy, Spain, Slovenia, Poland, Ireland, UK, Austria and Germany.

In 2016 the number of dropouts in Aix-Marseille Academy ranked second in France and the number of people with \u201cvulnerabilities in economic, family and cultural terms\u201d is the highest in France - 45% of the population. Within the age group of 15-24 years old the Academy has a dropout rate of 28.8% in comparison to 25.4% for France. (CEREQ)\r\nWithin this dropout rate, the highest number comes from vocational high schools. An effective way to limit early school leaving and contribute to the Erasmus + 2020 objectives is to create a dynamic environment in vocational high schools. This will allow students from disadvantaged socio-cultural backgrounds, often coming from migrant families or rural areas with fewer mobility opportunities to do their work experience in a European country.\r\nDue to the severity of the issue as described above, along with our previous successes, we the steering committee (DAREIC, GIP FCIP and the PACA Region) wish to support 42 vocational high schools in the implementation of work experiences in Europe for 902 less privileged students studying for the Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel during a 24 month period (689 Erasmus mobility grants and 213 Region co financing).\r\nThe main objective is to give them the opportunity to live an experience that will be an essential added value for their socio-professional integration. In practical terms, reinforced assistance will be offered by using specialized structures in supporting the mobility of young people having fewer opportunities through non-formal educational methods. We will work with the Eurocircle association.\r\nWhen they return to France, the participants of the project will pass on their experience, enhancing the project within the school.  They will thus act as spokesmen for European mobility, inspiring the desire and motivation to their peers. Pupils will use European certificates (Europass CV) and will receive a Europass Mobility and Mobility credits.\r\nGIP FCIP, the project initiator, will facilitate administrative and financial procedures in partnership with the schools financial management services. The DAREIC will coordinate the preparation, mentoring, implementation and enhancement of mobility activities of each school working together with the PACA Region. The consortium members will put into effect various activities and will be a source of inspiration via a mentoring scheme and the establishment of a collaborative platform named M@gist\u00e8re.\r\nExperiences and skills gained by expert teams will help mentor new educational teams. This project will facilitate the sharing of knowledge, good practice and collaboration with the aim of improving the quality of international mobility across the consortium partners.\r\nThe DAREIC would also like to create a network of local businesses that would improve the quality of the work placements. The local businesses would work with us to identify businesses in Europe thanks to their subsidiaries or customers. The Region is a stakeholder in the creation of this network with a progressive involvement over the long term. \r\nThe objective of this project is to provide these young people with the opportunity to experiment mobility in order to widen their future employment horizons. This could be achieved through the dissemination of information, personalized pre-departure coaching and by making the most of the experience gained thus creating the conditions for success within schools.\r\nGIP-FCIP, DAREIC and Region will work as a steering committee that will evaluate and measure the impact of the project, in order to develop a strategy to improve practices as well as the quality of mobility and capitalize on acquired experiences. \r\nThe impacts of this project are numerous. This experience will be a structured step in the personal and professional development of these young people and a tool to clarify their professional career plan. Locally, this project will help improve the image of vocational training courses making them more attractive. More broadly, it will have positive impacts in terms of economic development and social cohesion in the region as this multi disciplinary consortium will share, discuss and reflect ideas to tackle the priority educational objective, develop the coordination of participants, and exchange practices in the development of public policies around youth mobility in the PACA region.", "http://www.glasgowkelvin.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-046763_6"], ["4TD", "Employability Skills in Business", "Glasgow Kelvin College", 20575.0, "CONTEXT/BACKGROUND\r\nThis project will provide a valuable opportunity for 8 students from Glasgow Kelvin College to participate in a transnational mobility at B9 Vocational Business School, Nuremberg.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nStudent mobility objectives are as follows \u2013 \r\n\r\n-  To develop knowledge and understanding of taught Business theories and concepts within a live project environment.\r\n-  To develop the business and work environment in other countries.\r\n-  To develop on the job learning opportunities, skills and experience.\r\n-  To develop professional competences in their subject areas and learn new skills.\r\n-  To develop additional skills in marketing business, project management and IT.\r\n-  To promote and foster cultural exchange\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\nParticipants will be 8 students studying Business Studies at Glasgow Kelvin College.

Salpaus\u2019 strategic development programs for 2020 are designed to strengthen partnerships and networks with working life, implement changes in pedagogy and learning solutions, as well as created a solid economic foundation. As part of this strategy process is to define, a united operating culture.\r\n\r\nThe aim of Salpaus is to build a community-based culture. Salpaus is to develop organizational culture within the following areas: participation of students, strengthening of co-operation between education and professional groups, and strengthening communication between of leadership and work. Strategic development programs and areas for growth within the organizational culture are drawn up annually; these also guide the planning and implementation of Salpaus' international activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Salpaus Further Education was awarded the Erasmus+ Mobility Charter for Vocational Training (VET Mobility Charter). Based on the feedback from this accreditation and the Strategic Programs of Salpaus, the following priorities for the development of international operations have been selected: student participation, The standardization of international activities of different education fields and sectors and co-operation between the contact teachers, home-based internationalization, as well as in Spring 2018 planning an international part degree program for individual study paths.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the internal communication and marketing of Salpaus, our aim is to share international experiences with the use of social media. The goal is for the students to become the content creators of \"internationalsalpaus\" -Instagram and Facebook's \"Salpaus international participants\" accounts. The aim is to bring international experiences closer to all students and staff representatives. We have been striving for clearer and more open communication and it is still the goal. An active team has been gathered from eager students to develop more student oriented international activities.\r\n\r\nThe Salpaus Further Education is an international educational institution with ongoing internal and working life related development of international relationships. All our study fields have equal opportunities for studies and on-the-job learning abroad. Salpaus is developing international activities continuously. Development is increasingly focusing on student orientation which is one of our strategic goals. Involvement of students in the development of international affairs, together with the Salpaus staff, will be incorporated into our activities. Salpaus invest in home-based internationalization, for example, students are actively involved in presenting our organization to foreign guests. Through home-based internationalization, we also develop the skills of students who do not wish to be involved in an international study path or do not travel abroad.\r\n\r\nMonthly meetings with the contact teachers include the development, marketing and inspiration of students towards international activities. This activity is supported by planning meetings with different education managers in the various study fields. The regular group meetings of the contact teachers also support their networking and the sharing of good practice in different professional disciplines.\r\n\r\nInternational mobility at Salpaus is at a good level. The student mobility periods are mainly one or two months. Last year, 115 students completed a mobility period abroad most of which ranged from 2 to 15 weeks in either an on-the-job learning situation or in a study institute. The most popular target countries have been Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and other European countries. In addition, periods of study have been carried out in Asia and elsewhere outside Europe with project funding or by the institution's own funding. Numerous international projects are currently in progress within Salpaus, these are developing, among others, new areas of expertise and international learning environments. Students and staff also participate in international projects seminars and events abroad. \r\n\r\nStaff mobility has been well achieved. We have established good partnerships with foreign institutes, which gives us more opportunities to develop international know-how both for students and staff. Co-operation with international partners is close and coordinated, together it is agreed in advance the number of international exchanges, their duration, dates, activities and goals. Foreign exchange students and staff arriving to our institute have the opportunity to share their internationalize know-how within our institution.\r\n\r\nInternational mobility is expected to grow slightly as the development of international activity is more systematic and preparation for this has been done within the study fields, which aim to have increased students' international interest.", "http://www.glasgowkelvin.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FI01-KA116-046746_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "G21"}
