They are preparing a BTEC first in Jean Baptiste Brochier vocational high school.\r\nWe already have partners companies in Glasgow through a partnership with Glasgow city council, Glasgow Kelvin College and Glasgow Old People's Welfare Association.\r\nWe need to fulfill the following goals :\r\n- to improve the current and professional English vocabulary,\r\n- to develop the pupils' autonomy and responsibilities,\r\n- to awaken them to another  European culture,\r\n- to help them develop their self-confidence and their self-esteem,\r\n- to acquire a better cultural and professional mind,\r\n- to favour higher education in which the knowledge of the English language is essential,\r\n- to make them become  more effective European citizens,\r\n- and finally,to make them contemplate a professional future in a European country.\r\nThe participants are preparing a BTEC first in administrative management with a European option. To pass their Euro option they have to be assessed orally by 2 teachers : an English teacher and a management teacher. They need to be able to develop a professional activity in English and obtain a minimum of 10/20. \r\nMoreover, they have an English exam too, as every other pupils preparing a BTEC first, but, they must have 12/20 to validate the Euro option. So, they really need to improve their English level as much as possible. The European option will be a great value on their diploma to help them being accepted in higher education courses and to find a job.\r\nOur pupils will be registered to the 'mobility unit option'. It is a new option created in 2015 by the French eduction board to give more importance to the pupils' placements abroad. It gives them the opportunity to have their placement assessment appearing on their diplomas as a positive mark. It is assessed through an oral exam in French relating their experience abroad on a professional and cultural point of view. At the same time they will take a EUROPRO exam in English.\r\nThe preparatory activities for this placement period will try to achieve the goals below : \r\n- cultural knowledge of the country,\r\n- social-economic aspects of the professional world of the country,\r\n-improvement in the current and professional vocabulary.\r\nFor the school year 2016-2017, we asked for an English speaking language assistant to our regional fund to help us achieve our linguistic and cultural goals. We succeeded in having this person. We asked for the same fund for next year.\r\nMany people from our school are part of this project and work in collaboration, both on the administrative and teaching sides (head of school and depute, financial manager, nurse, teachers). Pupils' parents and tutors from the companies are also part of the project.\r\n\r\nThe preparatory activities :\r\nSince their first year in this schedule, our pupils have more hours in English to get ready for this project and to succeed in obtaining their Euro option. They are also trained in the management course through oral communication linked to their professional field (oral presentation and role plays in English\u2026). English is a compulsory subject for every pupil preparing a BTEC first. And the exam is an oral presentation about a topic chosen by the pupil. They need to train, so the placement will be a perfect training, plus a perfect topic to talk about.\r\nOn a cultural and linguistic side, the pupils participated in the European langages day last October. During this day, they experienced many activities about the European history and culture as well as using the European languages.\r\nTo make our pupils aware about the European citizenship we have a partnership with 'La Maison de l'Europe', an association promoting Europe through different means. We choose to have our pupils participate in their European citizenship challenge. For their tenth edition, one pupil from the Euro section ranked second  this year and made us very proud of her.

It has also proven to have a local impact. We have made many new contacts due to this project.

A tradition of \"seeing\" each other, reacting to each others initiatives within the game. An attitude that can spread into our social interactions also outside the acting part of the activities.\r\n\r\nEvery activity  will be linked to many of the key competences through the youth pass. One added competence to be explored is imagination. Not as a passive consumer of pop-culture, but as co-creator in a group. Bringing shared experience of historical events and fictional characters into real life. After the workshops the participants are both actors and audience in a spectacle that goes on for days - day and night. An adventure in Swedish nature in a fantasy world based on Viking fairy tales.  Imagination is a skill that can be trained and that is not only linked to entertainment or culture - it is a part of creative abstract scientific thinking.\r\n\r\nWe are very excited about this project. There is an unknown factor we look forward to explore together with the youth. This is about creating a \"social game\" based on imagination where \"anything can happen\". The soft factors are: nature, weather and the participants personalities. \r\n\r\nWe believe youth need to be adventurous, even to the border of chaos. It is our role as adults to create safe venues for youth to be able to release energy and lust.  As youth leaders we need to explore new attracting ways of channeling hyperactivity, depression, frustration and teenage hormones - into something constructive  and positive.\r\n\r\nThe social skills that we want to explore is:\r\n- Self awareness.\r\n- Functioning in a multi cultural group.\r\n- Methods of decision making (discussion and votes).\r\n- Methods of learning, practical as well as social methods.\r\n- Leadership skills.\r\n- Storytelling, writing and verbal skills.\r\n\r\nWe would like to stress the activities concept of inclusion beyond language. Youth of the world share this imaginary world of fantasy (mostly known for \"The lord of the rings\"). Sharing interest and using imagination to create a world together is very powerful. The level of non formal learning will be high. On the surface we are playing a social game, where the participants together control the outcome - while we are developing the skills mentioned above.\r\nSo we will mix many groups, many cultures, many ages, many nationalities, many languages and with the power of imagination we will unify them in a fairy tale tale adventure in Swedish nature. \r\n\r\nWe would like to develop the concept to its full potential and this time spend more focus on the participants \"ownership\" of the activities and on dissemination.\r\n\r\nSince we joined the Erasmus program in 2012, our association have tried to challenge ourselves by choosing new approaches to our main theme - using natures resources in a sustainable way.", "http://www.roystonyouthaction.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-3-SE02-KA105-001957_9"], ["2HL", "Equal Love", "Toonspeak Young People's Theatre", 28644.0, "This project is an international youth exchange of 8 international partners from Italy, Spain, Slovenia, Poland, Ireland, UK, Austria and Germany.

Welcome, introductions and icebreakers, to allow participants to relax and get to know each other.\r\n2. Team and confidence building through various outdoor problem solving exercises\r\n3. A Glasgow City Challenge to take the team and confidence building process further as well as giving the chance to discover Glasgow\r\n4. Information session on Erasmus+ and Youthpass. Practice of Youthpass\r\n5. Information session and discussion on healthy living and lifestyle\r\n6. Various outdoor activity sessions to enjoy exercise and appreciate the natural environment \r\n7. Interactive discussions / presentations and quiz on \"my Home, my Europe\" (youth issues and similarities especially in the context of Europe, and my place in Europe)\r\n8. Sport and problem solving challenges to encourage interaction and dialogue\r\n9. Intercultural and social evenings\r\n10. Fun language learning activities\r\n11. Daily learning review and Youthpass sessions\r\n12. Forward planning for future events\r\n13. Final evaluation and Youthpass session\r\n\r\nThere will be a total of 50 young people from marginalised backgrounds participating assisted by a further 10 group leaders, plus 5 trainers and administrators, making a total of 65. Partners are from Scotland (UK) Austria, Belgium, Estonia and Finland.\r\n\r\nThe methodology will be interactive which means that young people will have an active role in all sessions. They will work together mainly in mixed teams to enhance the opportunity for intercultural learning.  Participants will be encouraged to take responsibility for their own learning outcomes through the exchange. By the end of the exchange, they will have developed a sense of shared European identity, a respect for cultural differences and an understanding of healthy lifestyle and living. The project is expected to have a great impact at local, national and international level promoting Glasgow and Scotland as a place to visit, thrive, learn and enjoy. Results will be widely disseminated and evaluated thoroughly.", "http://www.roystonyouthaction.co.uk", "Royston Youth Action", "erasmus_2017-3-UK01-KA105-046449_coordinator"], ["4TD", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "Glasgow Kelvin College", 32544.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.glasgowkelvin.ac.uk", "Glasgow Kelvin College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035467_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "G21"}
