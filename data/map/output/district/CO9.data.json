Most augmented reality systems require the use of a Head Mount Display (HMD) to project a virtual image in the user's eyes. To date, no HMD featuring good field of view, good resolution and small dimensions has been developed. This has been one of the major bottlenecks to create an augmented reality market. Although, several interesting concepts emerged during the last years (Google Glass project is a recent example), all of those rely on a display decoupled from the optical system. This creates constrains on the mechanical configuration of the eyewear which increases volume and mass. Moreover, those systems have difficulties to cope with corrective vision requirements of a significant part of the users. The proposed project brings forth a completely disruptive solution using an innovative optical design where the display and the optical system are merged together in a single lens. This opens a new paradigm in the design of a HMD. First: it decreases the mass and the volume of the system. Second: it allows very large field of view. Third: it makes possible fashion and variable designs without any severe geometrical constrain. Fourth: it allows integrating correction optics inside the HMD lens. Fifth: it creates the possibility to use the traditional eyewear market to leverage the augmented reality market (similar design, similar distribution configuration, similar customization). The proposed design uses the most advanced technologies in optics, holography and OLED displays and integrates them in a single piece. This Lensplay (lens and display in one single physical element) will open up complete new ways for humans to interact with information computers. It will be a breakthrough that will ultimately change the world sees itself.", 135864.0, 1271723.0, "HIDO", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_111165_950625900"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["2DL", "RDE", "HALSTEAD HOSPITAL"], ["2DL", "RQ8", "HALSTEAD HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CO9"}
