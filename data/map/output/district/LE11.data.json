On the other hand, in\u00a0vivo diagnostics encompass techniques that assess health status directly in the patient.\n\nThe M6 project's ultimate aim is to take medical diagnostics out of research and hospital labs, and bring them to the patient's bedside, where information on possible health risks could be provided in real time. Additionally, the reduction in the size of critical components of diagnostic devices to the micrometre range promises significant savings in time and permits the use of completely different functional principles.\n\nIn particular, miniaturised bio-analytical tools ( such as lab-on-a-chip systems ( meet the requirements that project partners defined for micro devices intended for use in near-patient medical diagnostics. The health monitoring technology being developed in the M6 project is based on an existing imaging platform for non-invasive blood flow assessment and automated testing with immune particle assays.\n\nThe M6 project also provides a virtual platform for postgraduate training. The goal of the training programme to inspire the interest of young scientists as well as linkages between experienced researchers that will lead to the establishment of joint research degrees.

The research prioritisation was planned to address all aspects of the complex problem. The output is a concrete roadmap, and improved networking among stakeholders.\n\nIn the first year, the team reviewed 25 reports about social trends and likely road safety scenarios. The result was an information base identifying gaps and white-spots in the research, the key findings of which were discussed in two workshops. New safety ideas identified during the second PROS workshop were added to the information base. The project also requested input from coordinators of other Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) projects, associate partners and other stakeholders in relation to research needs.\n\nThe list of identified topics contained 52 items, grouped into themes: human, vehicle, infrastructure and traffic safety assessment. A questionnaire survey was given to 31 organisations representing the European road safety research community, asking them to prioritise the list of research topics. The resultant ranking was provided to the European Commission as input for Horizon\u00a02020. \n\nPROS also created a roadmap of the expected research schedule and sequence, and sketched the primary aims of each proposed activity. The process used to obtain the roadmap was itself an important project deliverable. \n\nFinally, the 12-member consortium created a plan for dissemination, specifying the target audience and the required tools. During the first year, the team delivered nine presentations about the work, either at conferences or other meetings.\n\nPROS developed a list of priority research topics for road safety, which will help optimise the allocation of funding to complete the research. The result of such investment will be reduced human suffering and economic losses from road accidents.", null, "http://www.lboro.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/146120.jpg", "fp7_104868_999990752"], ["3TU", "eUropean naturalistic Driving and Riding for Infrastructure & Vehicle safety and Environment", "Loughborough University", "Road transport is indispensable for the exchange of goods and persons, but at the same time has severe negative consequences, among others related to road safety and environment.

The main deliverables will be the improvement of biomechanical behaviour of existing dummies associated to new measurements sensors, as well as dummies and child human numerical models, with improved test procedures, which will allow solving the issues for improvement of children protection.

It is therefore not surprising that there is a lack of child biomechanical data, and that existing regulations, test procedures and standards related to children are based on scaled-down adult data.\n\nIn light of these and other shortcomings, CASPER focused on improving child protection through the development of innovative tools for child restraint system (CRS) manufacturers to better develop and test their products. Project researchers also analysed the reasons for and consequences of CRS misuse, and the conditions of transportation of children.\n\nMobilising a significant body of Europe's scientific and business experts in the field of passive safety related to children, CASPER's 15 partners from 7 countries set out to use existing data related to injuries of children and to fill in the gaps where possible. Project results point to a number of serious issues in the transport of children, not least of which is the actual use of restraint systems by caretakers.\n\nParticularly important project successes include the development and validation of an abdominal sensor for child dummies and, on the basis of physical accident reconstructions, an updated set of injury criteria for children.

Results are directly relevant to characterising solubility controls that influence maximum groundwater concentration and associated calculated doses. Investigations included the study of dynamic isotope exchanges and spectroscopic studies on radionuclide incorporation. The latter evaluated aspects of reversibility or irreversibility that relate to the amounts of free radioisotopes able to diffuse into groundwater or soil.\n\nSorption/desorption to and from the surface of materials is typically reversible, whereas incorporation into the solid phase is considered irreversible. There are some exceptions and one important one has been the irreversibility of sorption/desorption of caesium into pure illite. In contrast, SKIN showed that, in the case of interstratified illite, the process is reversible.\n\nThis could be because the interstratification blocks diffusion into the bulk or that the experimental conditions do not approximate the very slow, long-term diffusion processes. Current geochemical sorption/desorption models are not yet able to describe such long-term evolutions.\n\nA very important contribution of the project is thus the comparison of three existing models and the development of a new model of irreversible trace mineral uptake. Understanding the temporal evolution of solubility and sorption is critical to safety assessments.\n\nSKIN has developed a scientific methodology to quantify the degree of irreversible incorporation of radionuclides in mineral phases following initial surface adsorption. This will help qualify the degree of conservatism in safety assessments, and support the safe and widespread uptake of clean and cost-effective nuclear power.", "http://www.emn.fr/z-subatech/skin/index.php/Main_Page", "http://www.lboro.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/150253.jpg", "fp7_97427_999990752"], ["3TU", "Field Operational Tests of Aftermarket and Nomadic Devices in Vehicles -International cooperation aspects", "Loughborough University", "The objectives of TeleFOT are to assess the impacts of functions provided by aftermarket and nomadic devices in vehicles and raise wide awareness of their traffic safety potential.

This modified scenario has been based on a particular periodic orbit that drives the re-collision process.\n\nAnother task has been to study dynamics within the transition state for the hydrogen exchange reaction. As the energy increases, the dynamics within the transition state become increasingly chaotic.

The elements to this puzzle are researched in the frame of 14 PhD projects with individual areas of focus, such as (a) climatic degradation factors, (b) system analytics, (c) material (polymer) parameters, (d) service life & energy models, (e) linking production to performance and (f) performance enhancement by improved O&M. Commercial and test samples will be produced and tested in the distributed measurement campaign during this project. They will be exposed to state-of-the-art and to-be-developed stress cycles to allow a validated link of degradation to stresses, production methods, materials and methods of deployment. Accelerated and lower cost test cycles for the assessment of innovative materials and module developments will be delivered. The project is integrated both in terms of research as well as training. This inter-sectoral approach provides excellent theoretical and technical background as well as immersion in different business sectors and career mentoring, allowing ESRs to build up a sustainable professional network across Europe.

In this way, EILEEN project addresses some aspects considered as priorities by the EC, such as entrepreneurial education, and recognition/validation of competences acquired in informal settings. \r\n\r\nEILEEN project proposes a comprehensive approach which foresees the involvement of professionals working in European enterprises and young unemployed: both groups will be trained on how to cope with cultural diversity in the workplace. \r\n\r\nA European course will be organized for at least 18 multipliers in European enterprises who will subsequently apply their new competences and skills in terms of enhancing and validating intercultural competences in their enterprises in the pilot phase.\r\n\r\nTraining courses for a significant number of young unemployed (72-90 participants) will be also organized at national level in the countries involved in the project.

Finally, the employers will keep in contact with potential future skilled employees.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the traineeships, all the different competences acquired by both groups during the training and piloting stages (intercultural, entrepreneurial and mentoring competences) will be validated and documented through the innovative LEVEL5 methodology, developed by the network REVEAL with members from 22 European countries to promote, visualise and validate informal and non-formal learning. LEVEL5 will be interconnected via innovative ICT enhanced technologies with EQF and EUROPASS validation and certification systems.\r\n\r\nFinally, the EILEEN approach can become a comprehensive European concept to promote diversity and intercultural awareness in working places.

Lifelong guidance has been receiving increasing attention at both European and national levels. Two Resolutions of the Education Council (in 2004 and 2008) have highlighted the need for strong guidance services throughout the lifespan to equip citizens with the skills to manage their learning and careers and to lead the transitions between and within education/training and work.\r\n\r\nThe Resolutions drew attention to four priority areas: 1. the development of career management skills (CMS); 2. accessibility of services; 3. quality assurance and evidence base for policy and systems development; 4. co-ordination of services. \r\n\r\nMember States were invited to take action to modernise and strengthen their guidance policies and systems, but in many countries CMS frameworks has not been yet developed. Also previous EU projects provided evidences of this differences of approaches and remarked a great need of a shared framework and related training materials and resources, to improve learning and decision making skills, but also entrepreneurship, at any age.\r\n\r\nThis project is named LEADER to underline the need of people to learn this strategic skills for managing and driving their own careers in a more and more changeable world. Following the report of ELGPN (2012) \u201cLifelong Guidance Policy Development: A European Resource Kit\u201d, is based on some crucial questions on CMS:\r\n\r\n1. What are the competences that citizens of all ages need in order to effectively manage their career in a lifelong perspective? 2. How can such competences be organised within a framework that is meaningful in their substance and in developmental terms? 3. How can such competences be taught in educational and other contexts, in ways that, while effectively catering for all citizens, are also sensitive to different life development challenges, and the specific concerns of groups and individuals with diverse social, economic, cultural and other needs? 4. How can different providers work together to offer CMS programmes more effectively, in ways that make the best use of their specialised knowledge of the worlds of education, training, and employment? 5. Which pedagogical strategies and resources are most effective in enabling the mastery of career management competences, and how can such mastery be assessed and accredited in ways that support career development across different life stages?\r\n\r\nThe implementation of this projects aims at the following actions:\r\n\r\n1 - identify and develop teaching and learning approaches, methods and resources that effectively support the development of CMS as transversal key competences ;\r\n\r\n2 - develop assessment and evaluation methods and practices that improve the quality of learning of Career Management Skills\r\n\r\n3 - identify and develop the integration of the European dimension in teaching and learning CMS.\r\n\r\nThis project also aims at providing the whole professional comunity of career guidance practitioners with useful tools to implement CMS, even with a coherent and consistent use of mod\r\n\r\nStarting from some positive experiences already tested from the consortium, this project aims at improving the quality in the learning and guidance processes, developing key skills of practitioners and experimenting innovative tools and methodologies with the use of new technologies.

Longer working lives raises key challenges both for employers and for prospective older workers.\r\nIn 2011 CEDEFOP asserted that \u201cGuidance and counselling is crucial for longer and more satisfying careers by supporting ageing people in terms of learning, career development and employability\u201d. \r\nThe concepts and practices of career counselling are today transforming from the traditional way of comparing working life and job requirements to an individuals\u2019 skills and dispositions, towards a focus on developing and enhancing the individual\u2019s relationship with working life as a whole and in the context of their life course.\r\nSASSI-Working On addresses the challenge of 'working on' by developing and testing age-sensitive and \u2018working-life\u2019 approaches to career review and guidance. It will do this within the context of Continuing VET (C-VET) and meeting the needs of older people (aged 50+) who have to or want to keep \u2018Working On\u2019 into their 60s, 70s+. It does this through an innovative train-the-trainer format which aims to extend and enhance access to age-sensitive careers advice, skills updating and work experience opportunities for older people. We will do this by:\r\n\uf0a7 Providing C-VET professionals, HR Managers and career coaches (direct target group) with action-orientated methods and useful skills on how to develop Career Pathways for longer working lives\r\n\uf0a7 Promoting Career Revitalisation Pathways, including the participation of seniors (50+) in learning and work-experiences in order to maintain their workability and sustain motivation/productivity\r\n\uf0a7 Developing practical online tools and products to support the delivery of these approaches\r\n\uf0a7 Encouraging workplace mobility for older workers, \u2018unretirees\u2019 and job seekers through short-term secondment, sabbaticals and volunteering activities\r\n\uf0a7 Championing the value of trainers and older people gaining work experiences in other countries in order to improve intercultural understanding, language skills and engender more active participation in European society.\r\n\r\nThe professional competence of C-VET providers, HR Managers, and career coaches will be enhanced by the attitudes, knowledge, and skills necessary to apply the innovative \u201cSASSI-Working On\u201d approach. In most development processes action-oriented and productive methods are most effective in developing new competences.  Therefore, learning will be cascaded and applied through Learning Projects.

Graduate SPIRIT stems from a strong desire of the participating GS for Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) to have more adequate instruments for stimulating, organising and managing Triple-I training (understood as a \"international cross-fertilization between disciplines and sectors\") in the dimensions of 1) PhD researchers, 2) supervising teaching staff, 3) doctoral curricula and 4) organisational procedures. \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe partners in Graduate SPIRIT have committed to developing innovative and sustainable solutions to these four sets of challenges posed by Triple-I training at the four dimensions mentioned: of PhD researchers, supervising and teaching staff, curriculum and organisation. They aim to:\r\n\u2022 Provide a systematic Inventory of current policies, procedures and practices to promote interdisciplinarity and diversity in the participating GS. \r\n\u2022 Identify a full range of best practices for more detailed description and analysis, and combine them into a \u2018Blueprint\u2019 for successful interdisciplinary and diverse GS.\r\n\u2022 Develop and test innovative instruments Triple-I training in course and curriculum design, leading to an \u2018Innovation menu\u2019 from which individual GS can pick and combine according to their needs.\r\n\u2022 Engagement of a wide range of GS and policy makers in and outside the EU by opening and sharing results, using dedicated interactive instruments for data- and knowledge sharing.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants;\r\nThe SPIRIT consortium consists of nine national GS of the SSH who together reflect the European diversity of these Graduate Schools; they comprise a mix of new and established GS varying in size from big to medium and small, and differing in terms of their funding and organisational structure. They cover a wide set of European countries, and bring in networks outside Europe as well, from both developing and developed countries. In addition, the SPIRIT consortium works with the US Council of Graduate Schools as a partner to source expertise from. \r\n\r\nActivities\r\nThe activities undertaken to realize the goals of Graduate SPIRIT consist of collecting information through desk research, questionnaires, interviews and focus groups (Inventory); transforming this information into sustainable tools for managing Triple-I training ( Blueprint); developing, implementing and evaluating innovations with regards to the Triple-I training of and by PhD researchers, staff, curricula and organisation (Innovation Menu); sharing these tools and innovations with the project partners and a wider network of stakeholders through engagement activities and targeted dissemination (Engagement).  \r\n\r\nProject methodology\r\nErasmus University coordinates the project through a Critical Path Method, a step-by-step project management technique for which a detailed Gantt forms the backbone. Each individual project partner shares a coordinating role with another project partner for specific activities, thus dividing work and responsibility equally. The project leader monitors progress and quality of the different activities and reports every four months at a dedicated team meetings. A detailed strategy for handling project risks is in place. \r\n\r\nResults and impact \r\nThe project uses a Chain of Impact Model to realize maximum results and impact. The Blueprint and Innovation Menu constitute the key results of SPIRIT. They will be directly beneficial to: better training and supervision provisions for PhD researchers; a wider intellectual and skill set and a greater sensitivity of staff to the interdisciplinary and diverse classroom; to more consistent and comparable interdisciplinary curricula; to a better facilitation and organisational anchoring of these GS in the mother organisation. Through a detailed, systematic engagement and dissemination plan, the impact of the project will extend to other graduate schools in other countries, to university networks and to EU and international policy bodies and will provide a crucial contribution to further policies. \r\n\r\nLong term benefits\r\nThe project will be an essential contribution to the current discussions, developments and policies around doctoral training in the EU, US and Latin America.

Evidence shows that students\u2019 learning is often of a procedural nature: students do not develop in-depth conceptual understandings through which they can relate mathematics to other disciplines and the world around them.  Traditional forms of teaching reinforce this status quo.  We seek to improve teaching through inquiry-based approaches that allow students to achieve a more conceptually-based understanding of mathematics, more appropriate for  solving problems in engineering, science, and in the labour market. \r\n\r\nThis should be achieved through\r\n\u2022 clear principles of inquiry-based teaching-learning and associated models of practice;\r\n\u2022 teaching innovation in which lecturers engage in inquiry into their teaching practice and learn from critical reflection and feedback;\r\n\u2022 observation and analysis of teaching events to provide evidence of outcomes for students;\r\n\u2022 design of mathematical units and inquiry-based tasks for use by lecturers and their students in face to face or blended learning settings;\r\n\u2022 induction workshops and other meetings to professionalize lecturers to apply and promote inquiry-based teaching and learning in face to face and blended learning settings;\r\n\u2022 synthesis of models of inquiry-based practice that can be used to promote students\u2019 conceptual of mathematics in STEM education.\r\n\r\nIn all partner universities, project participants teach mathematics or statistics and seek to innovate in their practice.

Some have experience of providing workshops and seminars to induct new lecturers into effective teaching practices. Some are familiar with inquiry-based practices, having used them in their own developmental activity with their students.  All partners are passionately committed to innovation and creativity in enhancing teaching practices for the benefit of students who learn mathematics conceptually, relationally and applicably.\r\n \r\nWe will draw on our experiences and commitment to\r\na) Communicate sound inquiry-based principles of teaching and learning of mathematics;\r\nb) Develop our own teaching, and that of our colleagues, through communities of inquiry in local settings;\r\nc) Design inquiry-based tasks and mathematical units using digital media for blended learning in providing resources for mathematics teaching and learning;\r\nd) Design induction workshops and seminars introducing lecturers to inquiry-based practices in teaching and learning;\r\ne) Extend the model of inquiry-based learning to modelling activities which enable students to engage with real problems in industry and science.\r\nf) Design evaluator procedures and integrate evaluation into the activity itself, in order to gain a realistic view of what the project is achieving.\r\n\r\nThe methodology will be developmental and inquiry-based.

It will also improve basic skills in pupils as they communicate with each other using a variety of multi media tools. Fairy stories has been chosen as a medium for language learning as all schools use stories as a part of normal teaching, ensuring the project will be easily and fully incorporated in each schools curriculum. There are nine partners,  from Sweden, Czech Republic, Turkey, Greece, England, Portugal, Germany, Croatia and Spain, All the partner schools involved in the project have expertise in different teaching and learning areas and have skills which will be shared with other teachers over the course of three years. The methodology that will be applied in the project is to combine 3 different methods that each in its own way will improve language learning and promote inclusion and integration. By implementing them in a rationale order the methods will interact and amplify the childrens learning process.All participating teachers will learn:1. \"Talk for writing\". This method helps children to internalise the pattern of language required and so develop and improve reading skills. The method enables children to imitate the key language they need for a particular topic orally before they try reading and analysing it. 2. Drama as a way to work with inclusion. \u201cWalking through a story\u201d. 3. \u201cThe reading class\u201d is a method to improve reading comprehension. Here 4 basic strategies are used to comprehend a text; RT (Reciprocal Teaching), TSI (Transactional Strategies Instruction) och QtA (Questioning the Author). To understand a text, the idea is that the reader predict, task questions, sort out uncertainties and to sum up. Each participating school will implement the first method in the classroom in their native language. Strategies and results will be discussed in the project group before moving on to the next method. The new method will build on the already implemented one and in so complement and develop it further. After the third method has been implemented and tried out, the same three methods will be used in the classroom but now in the schools second language.

Pupils will make cartoons /e books and videos of themselves drawing telling and performing stories and share them with students from other countries using Skype and  E Twinning. They will plan, share and compare their work with pupils from different countries. The project will use existing methods which are backed up by research to work with language learning and inclusion. By developing them further and incorporate them in a bigger system, we will develop a model for how to improve language learning in our schools for children with different needs.

Pupils will get to know the structure of the story very well using actions in addition to words. They then begin to tell the story in a foreign language, using the same actions to help them.  Older pupils then transfer the story to print and film all to be shared on e twinning web site. Pupils share their work and perform with each other.After learning to retell many fairy stories, pupils will then innovate and write their own stories, sharing on film, in performances and in print,  with other pupils and parents.
