Recent crises such as BSE, swine fever, foot and mouth disease and avian influenza, and the activities of consumer and animal welfare organisations have raised public awareness that animal production is more than just an industry and that many other issues have to be considered. In this project, we focus on the fact that farm animal welfare has become an issue of increasing public significance and concern. Recent surveys indicated that European citizens show a strong commitment to animal welfare and many consumers express a willingness to pay a premium price for a product emanating from a welfare-friendly production system (Eurobarometer, 2007). But their expressed willingness often fails to result in purchase. Consumers\u2019 apparent reluctance to actually buy these products in the shop may at least partly reflect a lack of transparency in the market for animal products, (consumers are unable to recognise animal friendly products), as well as the limited assortment of such products. Clearly, it is extremely important for the industry, both from a corporate social responsibility and a market point of view, to re-build and maintain consumer trust related to how food-producing animals are housed and handled across Europe. This requirement demands the development of credible, reliable and transparent welfare assessment systems as well as product information and certification schemes to support communication to the consumer about the ways in which the animal food products are produced. The present project addresses the above needs by developing a Stakeholder Platform (European Animal Welfare Platform; EAWP) that will facilitate the exchange of knowledge, experience and expertise in order to effectively support the implementation of scientifically based welfare assessment and information systems, improvement strategies, market initiatives, research and development and policy formulation in the area of farm animal welfare.

The project brought together many different stakeholders in the supply chain, namely producers, processors, retailers, animal welfare organisations and academic experts.\n\nBuilding on previous EU initiatives in the field, the team supported welfare assessment and improvement strategies, in line with research and development (R&D) priorities in the field. It identified key welfare issues in beef and dairy cattle, pigs, poultry and fish. The partners then produced a total of 58 strategic approach documents (SADs). Each SAD focuses on a specific welfare problem and documents the likely causes and consequences, the relevant legislation, and existing best practices. It also sets short and long-term goals for welfare and economic improvement as well as prioritising future R&D. Thus, many important recommendations emerged from the project and these were prioritised for each product group.\n\nThe overall results were communicated via the project's website, as well as through press releases, newsletters and conference presentations.\n\nIn effect, the project built a powerful platform to facilitate the exchange of resources and expertise on the topic.

Luckily, most coming teachers are enthusiastic. We want them to educate themselves and feel happy and loyal part of our institution \r\nThe school is oriented to foreign languages, ICT and environmental education. Our pupils have achieved many successes in various competitions, including English and German language competitions. Many students continue in bilingual secondary schools. However, we still have to work hard to develop quality of education, bring new methods and more entertaining activities into classrooms. \r\nWe have participated in some European projects, such as eTwinning Schoolovision, European Languages Day, ENO Tree Day. We cooperate with our twin school in the Czech Republic.

Along with that we also want to widen knowledge about European, British, and specifically English and Scottish culture and life. Teachers should be able to promote and support European values, such as peace, cooperation, human rights, tolerance and solidarity.

They are all teachers and also have other important roles in the school. \r\n- Seven participants will attend Pilgrims courses in Canterbury. We have only the best experiences from 2015 Pilgrims summer courses, when three teachers brought new enthusiasm and many interesting activities to school. We are still in touch with some Pilgrims teachers and collegues from Sweden, Poland, Hungary, Estonia, Germany...  \r\n- They will study at one or  two weeks courses, in compliance with their needs and our school needs:  \r\nMethodology & English Language for Primary Teachers \r\nMethodology & English Language for Secondary Teachers\r\nEnglish Language Improvement Course\r\nSpecial Needs and Inclusive Learning\r\nDrama Techniques for Creative English Teaching\r\nPractical uses of Mobile Technologies in the Language Classroom\r\nBritish Life, Language & Culture.\r\n- One teacher will participate in Teacher Training in Inlingua Edinburgh. The course consists of two main components (Teacher Training and Spoken Performance) plus an extensive Scottish culture programme.\r\n- Studying English in an English-speaking country and intensive contact with teachers from around the world will surely bring efficiency to our teachers' communication skills and widen their intercultural knowledge.

The effort to create a pedagogically and professionally erudite team of teachers interested in lifelong learning is the basis of a good school. Teachers who lack  such attributes are unable to guarantee  high quality in education and upbringing even if all the other conditions are provided.

Particular activites are - leadership courses in Finland reflecting Finnish educational role model system, language courses, course about 21st century ways of thinking, or - as it's crucial for us as an English bilingual school - course about the state of British society, namely about political correntness, gender and multicultural society, even the course Becoming Teacher Trainer - all of these are pieces of the whole that will improve strategic development of our school, support of international partnerships, curricular changes, comparative approaches in teaching Slovak language and Literature, or in non-formal education (fresh ideas in school media - radio, magazine, even drama). Long-term effects will become reality when our graduates will meet their partners in real life situations - they will be well-balanced complex personalities with developed IQ and EQ.

These management courses are full-time schooling. Sometimes also graduates of dual system qualifications who don\u2019t find any employment after their graduation take part in this project. For example social insurance clerks, IT clerks, office clerks, bank clerks, retail clerks, notary clerks and clerks in public administration. Besides the students and graduates of the mentioned professions the target group also consists of the teaching staff of Friedrich-List-Schule. The different skill enhancements should be realized in this project.\r\nA central target of our project is the better employability on the labour market. This employability however is not given with the majority of the participants before this project. Especially the graduates of full-time schooling courses i.e. graduates of the commercial assistance qualifications have great difficulties in finding a job because they lack work experience, important linguistic and social competences.\r\nThe planned project is suited for the further education demands of the participants and thus enables them to find a job.\r\nOur main target, the good employability of participants on the first labour market is achieved by the acquisition of international competences, foreign language experiences, intercultural knowledge and experiences in the international world of work. Therefore the participants in general do a 26- week internship related with their job in a European destination country.\r\nThey acquire linguistic, intercultural, personal and social skills as well as competences referring to their job without those they would hardly find an adequate job. The requirement of our target group is the further education concerning languages, personality and job specific to increase the employability on the local, national and international labour market. By means of this project the participants achieve a considerable additional value related to their job and personality and after their return it\u2019s a lot easier for them to get a job on the first labour market. \r\nThe Hessian Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs officially authorized the sending organization to make it possible that also graduates from other Hessian vocational colleges which are not in a position to carry out such projects to take part in those projects. To promote the demand for further education above all the mobility of young graduates coming from the structure weak regions in East-North and Mid-Hesse is another vital target of the project since in these regions there are only few jobs available catering for the individual commercial qualifications the students have. \r\nThe students will do a 6-week commercial work placement at the end of their first year of studies in a European target country. The participants will increase their motivation and will start their second year of studies highly enthusiastically. The benefit will be that they got the experience to be able to stay and live in a foreign country. Most of the time they are fond of their experiences and proud of themselves. Due to these positive experiences made they again apply for another work placement  at the end of their studies.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is also to cover the different individual demands of skill enhancement of our teachers. To prepare our school for new challenges and to increase the European dimension and international orientation of our school.\r\nWith regard to our first target group the graduates of the above mentioned commercial professions , we are planning to send a total of 52 participants from all over Hesse in 2 flows that means in August 2017 and in August 2018, each time till February of the following year.\r\nWith reference to the group of students in their first year of studies we are planning with a total of 40 participants, all students are from our school.
