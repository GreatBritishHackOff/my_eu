Recent crises such as BSE, swine fever, foot and mouth disease and avian influenza, and the activities of consumer and animal welfare organisations have raised public awareness that animal production is more than just an industry and that many other issues have to be considered. In this project, we focus on the fact that farm animal welfare has become an issue of increasing public significance and concern. Recent surveys indicated that European citizens show a strong commitment to animal welfare and many consumers express a willingness to pay a premium price for a product emanating from a welfare-friendly production system (Eurobarometer, 2007). But their expressed willingness often fails to result in purchase. Consumers\u2019 apparent reluctance to actually buy these products in the shop may at least partly reflect a lack of transparency in the market for animal products, (consumers are unable to recognise animal friendly products), as well as the limited assortment of such products. Clearly, it is extremely important for the industry, both from a corporate social responsibility and a market point of view, to re-build and maintain consumer trust related to how food-producing animals are housed and handled across Europe. This requirement demands the development of credible, reliable and transparent welfare assessment systems as well as product information and certification schemes to support communication to the consumer about the ways in which the animal food products are produced. The present project addresses the above needs by developing a Stakeholder Platform (European Animal Welfare Platform; EAWP) that will facilitate the exchange of knowledge, experience and expertise in order to effectively support the implementation of scientifically based welfare assessment and information systems, improvement strategies, market initiatives, research and development and policy formulation in the area of farm animal welfare.

The project brought together many different stakeholders in the supply chain, namely producers, processors, retailers, animal welfare organisations and academic experts.\n\nBuilding on previous EU initiatives in the field, the team supported welfare assessment and improvement strategies, in line with research and development (R&D) priorities in the field. It identified key welfare issues in beef and dairy cattle, pigs, poultry and fish. The partners then produced a total of 58 strategic approach documents (SADs). Each SAD focuses on a specific welfare problem and documents the likely causes and consequences, the relevant legislation, and existing best practices. It also sets short and long-term goals for welfare and economic improvement as well as prioritising future R&D. Thus, many important recommendations emerged from the project and these were prioritised for each product group.\n\nThe overall results were communicated via the project's website, as well as through press releases, newsletters and conference presentations.\n\nIn effect, the project built a powerful platform to facilitate the exchange of resources and expertise on the topic.

Additionally new partners have been searched for (Norway, Latvia, United Kingdom, and Greece) taking into consideration our institutional profile, economical and social differences and similarities. Our aim was to gain new experience and ideas.\r\n\r\nTo implement the project the following activities are planned to be done: visiting classes in school in the chosen institutes based on previously assembled thematic observational viewpoints; filling in questionnaires; making interviews; taking part in thematic professional courses.

They can follow an internship for a maximum of 2 weeks because of their work. Students are instructed to improve the conditions of life for clients in various institutions in Estonia. The second goal is to offer improvements of skills and working methods to the Estonian health care workers, regarding clients with severe behavioral problems. Students learn to advise the local workers. The third objective is the creation of a professional network between the four health care institutions so that the transfer of knowledge and skills is embedded.\r\n\r\nNursing- 30 students - Spain\r\n\r\nSpain offers an interesting internship for nursing students because of the high technical instrumental level and they can perform on a higher level than in the Netherlands.

The whole idea beyond this concept is to help teachers/trainers grow and provide the environment in which it is possible to happen. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Learn & Lead strategy has been developing since 2000 when a language school Harmony in Trnava, Slovakia was set up by Jana Chynoradska, a Professional Teacher of English Language and Literature, currently a co-owner of Harmony language school and a holder of an academic title of \u201ePaedDr\u201c. in English pedagogy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJana,  current Principal Manager,  has been always interested in helping teachers grow and develop their full potential. As the result of her endeavour she started cooperation with Jim Wright, the Principal Manager at Pilgrims Teacher-Training, Canterbury in the UK in 2007.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir two companies along with a French partner, David Sherry, the owner of GLS language school and a co-founder of the canSPEAK network in France, started to develop the concept of the Learn & Lead in 2010 via the Grundtvig funding from the local agencies. In 2013 the Learn & Lead continued its development with Pavel Siroky, the owner of a training institution RCV from the Czech Republic and Phillippe Abadie, the co-owner of a CNTC language school in France. At the moment the Learn and Lead for Parents is being developed in the learning partnership programme funded by the Grundtvig agencies with the expected outcome to work out the \"Parent as a Leader\" program. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResulting from this the organisational need is to strengthen staff training in order to be ready and qualified to deliver the Learn and Lead professional language programs (e.g. Parent as a Leader, Multiple Intelligencies, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeading by example seems to be a very important and highly desired way in our adult-training. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives of the BeLLL project are the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR HARMONY: \r\n\r\n-to internationalize, modernize and professionalize\r\n\r\n-build networks of international contacts\r\n\r\n-actively participate in society and develop a sense of European citizenship and identity\r\n\r\n-increase the capacities, attractiveness and international dimension\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR STAFF\r\n\r\n- to develop new competencies, to be able to adopt to change within the organisation and grow as a professional\r\n\r\n- support the staff in the acquisition of competences with a view to improving their personal development\r\n\r\n- support the professional development of the staff\r\n\r\n- enhance notably language competences\r\n\r\n- raise awareness of other cultures and countries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the number and profile of the participants, there are expected to be 20 participants (15 trainers, 3 managers and 2 admin staff) with mobilities in three countries (France, UK, Germany) participating in structured courses, coaching and job shadowing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe activities will foster the development of each participant in the key areas defined prior to the mobility, be evaluated after the arrival and as well as 3 months after the arrival.

Therefore we have chosen our partner institutes from English-speaking and German-speaking areas.\r\nOur language school has been present in the field of adult education since 1992 and in the course of the recent five years we have paid more and more attention to the needs of the adult students aged 45+. While analysing the dominant tendencies emerging in the sector of independent language schools, it has become clear for us that in addition to the age groups of secondary school students and young adults, the number of senior adult students aged 45+ is higher and higher year by year. Since in each member country of the European Union, including Hungary, there are new job-market related and demographic trends, it is the mutual interest of both the individual language learners aged 45+ and the language teaching institute involved in adult education, that bigger and bigger emphasis should be placed on the needs of senior students.

The main goal of our institute is to provide students of all ages from youth trough adults with adequate foreign language skills that enable them to adequately compete in today\u2019s international business arena.  In order to stay current our strategy includes the implementation of innovative methods for providing these skills.   Considering the ever changing and competitive nature of international business our organization needs to constantly modify its strategy in order to meet these new challenges.\r\n\r\n2.  It has therefore become imperative that our teaching staff be offered opportunities for honing their expertise.  This includes updating their knowledge of new teaching methods, new trends and curriculum development in order that the high quality of our educational process can be maintained.  \r\n\r\n3.It has also become evident that our organization needs to establish a cooperative atmosphere with foreign educational institutions.  The implementation of international activities such as the attendance of foreign courses in education, cooperative projects, teacher exchange programs and the sharing of individual goals of foreign educational systems would help our organization develop and apply long term modernization and internationalization policies.\r\n\r\n4. Obtaining practical skills for teaching foreign languages has become an absolute necessity for teachers.  These skills include elocution, communication, authentication, confidence building and the teaching of colloquial English without the associated stress.  We seek innovative programs in order to accommodate individual target groups for the purpose of achieving increased effectiveness in acquiring language, social, intercultural and managerial skills. These programs require expertise in creative thinking, innovation, leadership, motivation and conflict resolution as prerequisites.   It has become necessary to constantly improve entrepreneurial business skills and impart these into the curriculums in order that students can become more competitive in the world of business.  Teachers are therefore required to implement their improvements, (gained through ICT) and apply didactics of e-learning etc. during their teaching sessions.\r\n\r\n5. Based on these requirements our organization plans on embracing the international mobility of our pedagogical staff.  They are qualified and certified English teachers experienced in teaching children, youths and adults.  They are self motivated to constantly develop their professional expertise.  The project therefore consists of preparation, implementation and follow up activities.  The main thrust, implementation, will consist of 6 courses each lasting14 days.  A total of six teachers will attend six courses.  These courses are designed to help teachers expand their own language and pedagogical skills, self awareness, their role in the educational process, improved motivation, effectiveness and development skills are also addressed.  Exposure of their skills in English speaking countries will foster the exchange of information, increase intercultural consciousness, strengthen their own linguistic skills and will help then recognize the cultural aspects of the UK.\r\n\r\n6. This is the new path for educators to follow.  Thanks to new creative methods, tools, new educational systems and the implementation of ICT this is now possible.  These innovative and improved skills will positively impact future projects.  These results can only have a positive effect on the participants.  Their improved language skills will increase their employability and support their career growth as well as instilling motivation and the self satisfaction of having widened their horizons.", "http://www.pilgrims.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-SK01-KA104-000229_1"], ["0EY", "Fast Forward on Innovation and Quality", "The Education & Training Company Limited", 15151.0, "On the one hand, the \"Fast Forward on Innovation and Quality\" project is meant to contribute directly to Babel Center's developmental strategy as provider of foreign language teaching services to adults.  On the other hand, it contributes to the organization's strategic objective to become an innovation center as far as working with adults is concerned locally, nationally and internationally.\r\n\r\nBabel Center was set up 9 years ago by a group of young teachers who believe in lifelong learning and have always looked for ways to best answer the adults' need of learning a foreign language in the easiest and most enjoyable way possible. In time the team of teachers has grown, as well as the number of languages taught (at the moment there are 10). The needs of the adult learners have also changed together with the new technologies and increasing opportunities of using a foreign language. At this stage, the challenge for the organization is to find creative ways to respond to the needs of the adult learners, to keep them interested in the whole range of foreign languages, i. e. to build up a system that assures high quality of the courses delivered and keeps teachers motivated to develop professionally and innovate.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge for the organization is to positions itself within the international context of foreign language teaching. In 2010-2012 we ran our first Learning Partnership project within the Grundtvig Program. Having had the chance to collaborate with other 8 institutions, most of them foreign language teaching centers, has proved the importance of learning in an international context, and has also indicated ways in which the Babel team can contribute through its expertise to creating a European know-how in this field. During the last 2 years, the confidence in the teachers' expertise has grown as a result of the excellent feedback they have received for presentations and workshops delivered at local, national and international conferences and seminars. In this sense, establishing international contacts and access to the best resources of expertise in 2014-2015 can mean a leap forward towards the the higher goal of bringing Romanian added value to the European level by means of future partnership projects, as well as by a high quality offer of Erasmus+ trainings in the field of teaching foreign languages.\r\n\r\nThe project \"Fast Forward on Innovation and Quality\" fulfills its objectives by organizing 9 European mobilities which involves the participation on 13 members of the organization. Special attention has been given that all levels of the organization are offered the opportunity of international mobility, from Junior trainers to the management team taking into consideration their motivation and area of interest/ expertise, as well as their ability to disseminate information on a local, national and international level.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the project are coordinated by a support team, consisting of people with experience in international collaborations and project management. The project involves a stage of preparing the mobilities, of 9 actions taking place throughout 2014-2015, of organizing dissemination activities in various frameworks (in the organization, in Edu-Cafe - the Resource Center for Teachers, national and international conferences, The Romanian Institute for Adult Teaching) and assessment.\r\n\r\nThe 9 actions represent participation at training sessions for developing creative methodologies in language teaching and for creating learning communities (Creative Methodology, The Creative Classroom, Building Positive Group Dynamics), using new technologies and adapting them to future requirements (Future Learning - Using Ipads and Tablets, Education for Tomorrow) and for developing high quality systems (Teach. Learn, Quality, Finnish Lessons for European Schools), and finally for developing linguistic, cultural and methodological competences in teaching the Roman languages, i. e. French and Italian.\r\n\r\nThe results of taking part at these mobilities will be a set of individual competences connected to latest knowledge, which are extremely important abilities for the 21st century trainer and for the management of an innovative school.  On top of that, increased self-confidence and inter-cultural openness within the European context will boost participants' motivation to exchange views in various dissemination activities and in future projects possibly generated within the networking done during these mobilities.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of the project, including the way the present application has been written, the proposed approach is one of partnership and responsibility of all parties involved.

In addition to this objective, it also aims to improve the level of ICT competence of our teachers and reduce the rates of absenteeism focusing on a better performance of our students.\r\n\r\nThe three EOI have a total of more than 10,850 students and 80 teachers. The number of teachers who have shown interest in participating in the project were 31 with a diversification of languages (English, German, French, Chinese, Spanish for foreigners). These teachers are highly motivated by their work, have a medium to high level in terms of their ICT skills and have shown an interest for such projects allowing them to open their minds to new methodological experiences to improve their work in day to day classes.\r\n\r\nThe activities planned consist in observation activities in other centres in Ireland, UK, Germany and Spain. Through these visits what we are trying to achieve is the observation of good teaching practices that help us to improve one of the chief concerns of language teachers and students who enrol in our centres: improving our students\u2019 skill of speaking. This skill is the most difficult to teach and learn. Language teachers need to be constantly up to date regarding the strategies, tasks and activities for teaching this skill. We also want to know what activities these centres do in relation to the implementation of ICT in language teaching. This will allow us to improve, to expand and improve our own experiences.\r\n\r\nTraining activities in the countries of the language taught have also been designed. These activities are courses organized by institutions with a long tradition in teaching these courses for teachers. Teachers who attend these courses will refresh their language skills just by immersing in the country of the language taught, in addition they will acquire new skills and resources for the teaching of language teaching.\r\n\r\nThe result we intend to accomplish with these two types of activities is that our way of teaching improves so as to offer our students better tools and activities to achieve a higher command in the skill of speaking.\r\n\r\nThe project is accompanied by a series of activities involving all teachers in the project. These activities include attending workshops, meetings and training courses, using a virtual space to share materials and resources and employing different tools available on the web for the dissemination of the project further out, to share our experience inside and outside our schools.\r\n\r\nAs directors of the three centres, we firmly believe that such activities are necessary in the type of centres we lead and the fact of participating through a consortium is beneficial for all the teachers involved in the project as it provides us with the opportunity to share materials and resources, and offers us the possibility of collaborating and share experiences among teachers, something which is essential in school life in general.

We were four enthusiastic teachers who wanted to offer the best to their students, to be up-to-date in pedagogy, to choose teachers and create a very positive and enthusiastic team of colleagues who love teaching and constantly working on their own development. We have found one of the secrets of school progress-doubts, questioning and applying what we have learned- new methods of teaching centered on doing and participating, creating new projects where teacher is not \" the mother bird\" feeding their off-spring with knowledge. Teacher is a mediator, helper, participant and active part of every project and class. Our  almost 25-year history has proved that we set off in the right direction. We have developed a new form of education through special projects- Integrated Project Education (IPE) which we worked out and offered in several seminars to the teacher community in Slovakia. We organized and invited Slovak teachers to the seminars of IPE where they could learn about the method  and they could see the students' work and presentations.\r\nWe have cooperated in several international projects with other schools in many European countries through Comenius projects in the years 1993-2010. We believe that in communication with partners we can develop ourselves, students and whole school.\r\nNow it is time to move on and therefore we introduced CLIL education in our school. We would like to do it professionally, compare our knowledge and include our young teachers into their self-study and development in new approaches in teaching. We decided after personal interviews and recommendations of language department at our school to send four applicants to these courses.\r\n\r\nEva Jahelkov\u00e1, our former graduate who has returned to our school as a teacher of Chemistry and Science, is an enthusiastic young teacher with very good knowledge and interests in new ways of teaching.\r\n\r\nAndrea G\u00e1lov\u00e1, an experienced teacher who works with students on social and historic issues, very good communicator and mediator.\r\n\r\nViliam Kereke\u0161, a professional teacher of Geography and a personality who has always promoted \"hands-in\"education by organizing excursions, discussions with travelers and explorers.\r\n\r\nKatar\u00edna Ku\u010derov\u00e1, an English language teacher for advanced students.

As we teach English and German languages compulsory with a lot of classes per week ( 6 classes) we have to be able to offer more and more to our students, as they are now entering our school with quite good command of English. Teaching other subjects in English can give them a better chance to study foreign sources, to study abroad and later in their life to get good jobs. \r\nWe can see also benefits of crossing  the barriers between cultures, understanding other students, their lifestyle, culture, religion and beliefs so they will be equiped to avoid manipulation and extremism. The higher quality education means less prejudice towards nations in the European Union and the whole world.\r\nTo put all these ideas in real life we need enthusiactic teachers who take their work not simply as a job but as a mission with far-reaching consequences.

The Secondary school offers vocational education in addition to general education - gimnasium. Our school work follows a long-term strategy, which provides highly qualified students for the labor market, either at home or in the wider European area. To get highly qualified students, among other things, we take care of the implementation of various international activities. For a consistent and high-quality implementation of international activities, which involves our students, we need to ensure well-trained teachers and provide opportunities for their constant training development and upgrading of their competencies. We prefer quality over quantity, that is why four teachers have been included in the international educational space in the current school year, and in the future one, three more teachers from the programme for the general education we will be integrated. Two of the teachers are language teachers and the other one is the teacher of Physics. All three teachers are interculturally oriented, successful in their work and dedicated, but with each generation of students, both the school and the teachers are faced with new challenges. The current project has brought new methods and materials for teaching languages, but the introduction of these new methods and materials has brought new challenges. The purpose of this project is to expand international cooperation in three directions:\r\n1. Training in the field of stress and visualization,\r\n2. Teaching abroad\r\n3. Training in preparation and management of international projects.\r\n\r\nThree completely different domains have been chosen for the following reasons:\r\n1. We find that more and more students and teachers are faced with various stressful situations that make their work difficult and create unnecessary conflicts. Both students and teachers are therefore more stressed and less successful at their work than they would have been otherwise.\r\n2. If we want to follow the long-term goal of establishing individual mobilities at the level of general education, it is not enough to know your partners, but it is necessary to know the organization of the partner school abroad, the distribution and content of its curricula, their methods of work and the programme content.\r\n3. According to the growing tendency for international involvement and participation of students (domestic and foreign), as well as the school environment, we are confronted with the fact that it will be necessary to expand the work in the field of international content and make is possible with a new competent employee and skills.\r\n\r\nFor each area that represents a new challenge for us, we have found a suitable education area or training abroad and consequently decided to submit this project.\r\n\r\nWe believe that from the first training, besides free knowledge for the school, we will get a teacher who will transfer the knowledge of visualization to the teachers and students (direct use). At the same time, the teacher will be able to show her fellow teachers how to avoid and prevent stressful situations and unnecessary conflicts.\r\nThe second \"training\" - roaming will send to the teaching staff a strong message: \"I can teach in English, even though I'm not a language teacher\". For the participating teacher, the training will strengthen his self-affirmation and raise his self-esteem. And for the school, we will get examples of good practice in the field of science and accurate information about the organization and content of the host school to be able to start the first project in the field of science, and in this way encourage students (at the moment very few students choose to study sciences in comparison to previous years) to continue their education in sciences.\r\nThe third training is directed primarily long-term, but in the next school year we want to start with educating a new teacher for the  future work in the international area.\r\n\r\nThe long-term objectives of the project/s:\r\n- An increase in international activities - the integration of a large number of students and teachers in international mobility - by 2020 we plan 20% involved students a year and 15% of teachers.\r\n- To encourage the learning of foreign languages, acceptance of different cultures and to increase interests in science content - by 2020 we expect 40% of the students in general education to choose, in addition to two foreign languages, a third one as an optional subject, and 10% more students will choose the subjects of natural sciences for final examination (since this indicates the continuation of studies in the natural sciences).\r\n\r\nBelieving that the project will go on smoothly and in accordance with the planning, the coordinator will be responsible for the project management, contract obligations and schedule.

It enables working adults to take the \"Fachhochschulreife\" and the \"Abitur\" (equivalent to A-levels or baccalaureat or Matura). For many of our scholars this is not only an essential opportunity to clearly improve their career perspective  but also for social participation and integration. About 70% of our scholars have a so-called migration background, whereby the majority originates from (Eastern) Europe. By applying for this EU-grant our school would like to support ten English language teachers who wish to advance their foreign language, intercultural and  IT competences and are prepared to utilize them to the betterment of the school. Moreover, by attending teacher training courses with international participation abroad (Canterbury, England), at a school accredited by the British Council (\"Pilgrims\") which is renowned for high quality courses and a mix of teachers attending from all over Europe, we hope to get new contacts for our school. In addition to the participation in training events new contacts with teachers from other European countries can be made with the aim of creating a (digital) school partnership, from which our students could directly benefit. Increased training needs arise from the specific curricular requirements in the face of a very diverse student body, made up of adults of different ages, different backgrounds, educational background and professional orientation. In particular the subject English plays a key role in our school not only due to its relevance to the career prospects of the scholars, but also because it opens up prospects to the scholars in a globalized world. To match up to the task, teachers must be additionally trained not only in their traditional department but also to make use of opportunities to use new media for teaching. With the introduction of partially internet-based learning (\"Abitur online\") and by reducing face-to-face teaching times to new groups of students, the \"Abendgymnasium Stuttgart\" would like to respond to the changing conditions in the workplace that demands an increasing time and spacial flexibility of many employees which made school attendance impossible in the past. The planned training activities in the field of computer-aided learning and cultural studies (three one or two week courses within the next two years) at a recognized English training institution should enable the participating colleagues to get new impulses for (computer-/ internet-based) instruction and to create new teaching material designed for our specific needs, whereby these colleagues will be supported linguistically and contentiously by native speakers.

Our previous experience with a Comenius project tells us that it is the best way to boost students' interest and motivation to communicate correctly in foreign languages, and also, in their mother tongue.  The formative actions that we intend to develop in this project are strongly connected to this main objective.  In language updating courses, two teachers will adquire the necessary command and self-confidence in order to increase the quality in their classrooms; in addition, more relevant and significant learning will take place using authentic materials in the correct contexts.  Teachers will be able to offer a greater variety of language functions and real situations to their students.  On the other hand, the course on new teaching tools and methods will be the key to improve motivation and attention to diversity; one of our teachers will be responsible for spreading these new teaching tools to the rest of language teachers.  Finally, our plan is to strengthen our european dimension participating in a structured study visit in which one teacher wil be able to experience  seminars, workshops, school visits, lesson observation sessions, study of the Irish education system and cultural and professional exchanges with teacher from different European countries.  The teacher responsible for this activity will be the bilingual CLIL project coordinator in our school since one of her duties is the promotion of international projects.

Teachers committed to this project must comply with some implementation and dissemination requirements once the movilities are finished.

Presenting a certificate of assistance will be necessary, but being familiar and keeping Europass and PEL updated will be mandatory just as well.  The use of these documents must be spread among the rest of teachers and students of all levels and disciplines.\r\nGenerally speaking, we hope to get results such as the increase of quality in foreign language teaching, improvement in the treatment of diversity and the creation of professional contacts in order to prepare future strategic associations and the development of European Language Portfolio, Language Integrated Curriculum and the Language General Plan in our school.\r\nFinally, the long-term benefits that we can expect as a result of this project are: significant improvement of general communicative competence for all our students and, as a direct consequence, improvement in the academic outcome of all subjects; efective development of  strategic asociations with other European countries, increase in satisfaction rates of students and parents and increase in our school's prestige.", "http://www.pilgrims.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA101-014931_1"], ["0EY", "Kulturelle und methodische Weiterbildung f\u00fcr den Sprachunterricht", "The Education & Training Company Limited", 45420.0, "Background of the project\r\nOur language courses are primarily aimed at employees as well as senior citizens.

In our Business English courses, young professionals extend their knowledge of English mainly for business purposes. Other learners want to keep up their contacts to friends and relatives in Europe and around the world.\r\nThese target groups attend our evening courses.

Long-term memberships of our customers guarantee them a successful learning outcome as well as the continuity of our school.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of the participants\r\nWe are planning to dispatch 19 language teachers, who will act as propagators and share their newly obtained knowledge with others in our language school. Overall, we work with about 55 freelance trainers who could benefit from this dissemination. Our language teachers are academically educated experts, native speakers with different vocational and educational backgrounds and trainers who have been educated for school teaching. But teaching adults requires special knowledge of the target groups, the obstacles to learning and preferred ways of learning. It should also reflect current English spoken by common people in everyday situations. Therefore we deem a systematic didactic and methodological training dealing with these aspects necessary.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of activities\r\nThis year\u2019s projected dispatch of our teachers is part of a long-term initiative to improve the language teaching at our school. The teachers will take part in two courses from Pilgrims\u2019 summer university. The courses \u2018Creative Methodology for the Classroom\u2019 and \u2018British Life, Language and Culture\u2019 will enable them to get a targeted didactic and methodological training, to apply the newly obtained methods in workgroups and to broaden their linguistic and cultural competences.\r\nApart from the regular classes, there is a wide range of events in the evening, in which the participants can learn more about particular aspects of learning and teaching foreign languages.\r\nBy sharing terraced houses with others, our teachers will have the opportunity to make contact with colleagues from all over Europe.\r\n\r\nCarrying out the project\r\nThrough lesson observations, we have chosen language teachers who can take part in the teacher trainings and act as disseminators of the newly acquired competences.

Many of our partners have expressed desire and interest to choose our organization for their future mobility exchanges and therefore we would like to start training and education our staff members in the key competences, necessary for developing host activities in the EU context.The training programmes and structured courses we chose will:-  help our staff to improve their skills and competencies in key areas such as communication in English in European contexts, cognitive and critical thinking strategies, collaborative strategies, planning and evaluation- help our staff to gain and use new, innovative methods and approaches, especially designed according to different age and interest groups they address at their work; - contribute to the quality of our staff\u2019s teaching and to the development of staff - help our administration, teaching and training staff to develop professional competencies and to organise and co-ordinate cross-curricular activities by using an inquiry-based learning process in a local community.These activities should make it possible to experience a number of key aspects which should meet the training needs of teachers and staff in our institution and will contribute to the development of staff\u2019s knowledge, skills and attitudes as decision-makers in the design, management and implementation of quality curriculum-making and international projects and help our organization towards developing ai international curriculum which would enable us to become a host organization for teachers and students from all over Europe.We will choose 6 participants who are members of our administrative and teaching staff and who are in any way involved in international projects. Participants in the chosen training programmes are expected to develop their language skills in English by engaging in cooperative group work, by carrying out interviews to local people, by participating in seminars and hands-on workshops, by trying out new methods in practice, in the field, on computers and various workshops.   Sessions will promote interaction among participants in the whole programme and every effort will be made to provide a collaborative learning environment. An interactive communicative approach is applied, which provides participants with experiential learning. Participants develop their fluency through discussion about current affairs and topics of general interest.We want to do this project because we wish to send the members of our staff to international and highly qualitative courses and programmes for the professional development of their competences, incorporating a European dimension of education in all its activities and promoting the exchange of ideas and best teaching practices as fundamental pillars of its methodological approach.Our plan is to become not only a sending but also a host organization for international exchanges and trainings. This can only be achieved by making the overall curriculum and teaching staff in our educational programme more innovative and internationally orientated. With the transfer of the knowledge gained by the training participants onto other members of our teaching and administrative staff, we will be able to form a curriculum and educational programme", "http://www.edinburghschoolofenglish.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-SI01-KA104-021350_1"], ["0EY", "Kvalitn\u00e9 jazykov\u00e9  vzdel\u00e1vanie - slu\u017eba pre mesto a regi\u00f3n", "The Education & Training Company Limited", 14688.0, "Language school Your Choice in its 10 years existence has gained a reputation as a professional and innovative place for high quality language teaching. We work extensively with local and regional employers to increase the levels of employment in the region. More than 70 of our courses are designed for students of business English as required by our corporate clients. In the Trnava, Nitra and Bratislava regions we significantly contribute to the increased public participation in education, the improvement of employee skills of corporate clients and to building effective links between employers and young people to improve their chances in the labor market.The project has 2 main targets. The first is to provide additional professional skills to our teachers.  The courses focus on creative methodology and business English. The participants will be trained in current innovative teaching methodologies, use of the current teaching and supplementary materials, creative and alternative approaches to teaching, in the skills to teach English for special purposes (business). Our aim is that the project participants will gain practical appliable knowledge and skill which will then be forwarded to other colleagues. The professional development of the individuals will contribute to the growth of the school as a whole. This part of the project includes courses for trainers in cooperation with the Pilgrim Language School and other educational and training centers in the UK. This will involve three teachers from our school.The second objective is to set up an effective system of training for teachers and a progressive approach to working with students. The course \"How to train teachers\" will allow us to work with our lecturers to ensure their continued education, to link the needs of the schools, of the clients with teachers' performance and lessons. The second activity is coaching and NLP, which represents a new and modern way of working with students based on empathic understanding, effective communication to maximize the students' potential, leading to better results and increased motivation. Both activities are in line with the latest trends in education that emphasize a humanistic approach to the student and the need to adapt the education to students (not students to the education plan).The knowledge and skills acquired by the teachers will be applied practically in the form of new courses, improved methodology, in creative work with teaching and supplementary materials to provide the student with more interesting and effective classroom hours. Their contribution to the development of the school will be optimized in the school\u2019s curricula with the teachers able to provide a wider range of courses and actively participate in the training of colleagues through mentoring. The expected learning outcomes of activities aimed at training teachers will improve the system of professional development of our lecturers. Our school will offer training courses intended for both our teachers and those at other teaching institutions. Better results and good feedback achieved by more effective approach to students will motivate them to seek further language training.The results are seen at several levels: the personal and professional development of the teachers, the continuing development of the school and its human resources, the expansion and diversity of course offer, the enrichment of teaching methodology, an increased interest in courses from corporate clients, greater public participation in education and improved language preparation of candidates and corporate clients.The impact of activities at local and regional levels is seen in qualified and professional language services for key employers, graduates and jobseekers with a positive affect on their work performance and activities on the labor market. New expanded courses with topics relevant to teachers from other language schools will create an opportunity for the further professional development and improve the quality of language teaching in Slovakia - at the national level.The project will enable us to modernize the methodologies used in our school and to carry out training that will increase the professionalism of our teachers . We wish to respond to the needs and expectations of the labor market and its participants with our language services. According to recent data up to 54% of jobs require English skills (source profesia.sk 02/2015), but in reality this requirement cannot be met. In this area we see the key effect of our project.

On the whole, performances on secondary lower level are much better which is proved in the test results of national standards E8 from 2014. Unfortunately only a small number of schools received raters to find out about pupils' oral communications skills. Speaking in a language class does still not have the importance it should have. In inclusive settings every child  can contribute to language learning providing knowledge and skills in their mother tongue.\r\nCLIL is an option to introduce more English in schools without rising the number of English lessons per week. Only teachers with a high language competence can run CLIL-lessons, only teachers with high language competence can set up a learning environment that challenges the pupils to use English as a medium of instruction and communication. Therefore we need to qualify our teachers in terms of language competence as well as in methodology and didactics. Teachers also have to prepare pupils to make use of digital ways to learn and improve a language.

In addition school inspectors who have to guide schools with their school development as well as education psychologists who contribute their knowledge of learning styles to the implementation of successful inclusive learning environements take part in job shadowing and exchange meetings.\r\nAs far as job shadowing is concerned teachers usually have only limited knowledge of how other teachers of English act in their classes. Observing classes has become more frequent on secondary level, but is still the exception in primary schools for reasons as tight timetabling and English considered a low priority subject. Teachers need time to watch the students' learning process with both struggling and success. Teachers will volunteer to job shadowing and will indicate their interest to the Landesschulrat via their headteachers.\r\nTeachers who want to do intensive training in a course in Ireland or Scotland will come up with a selected course from the Erasmus+ SEG course catalogue. Teachers who choose courses that are in line with the school profile will get priority. Only schools with a school development plan that contains \"Improvement of language competence\" will be nominated. All participants must be willing to share their experience with other colleagues not taking part in the programme. They are to act as disseminators.\r\nThe strong impact of the consortium will help the region and the province to make faster progress aiming at the targets of Europe 2020. \r\nAbove all the project will serve the pupils: better learning performances achieved with the help of innovative and motivated teachers will improve the students career opportunities and will in the end strengthen the economy and as a consequence the province of Styria.

R. Stefanik in Ivanka pri Dunaji is a big school for more than 800 pupils (at the age of 6 to 15) near Bratislava. The build was extended twice in recent years, as the number of pupils has been growing. Along with that, the number of teachers has been growing as well. Luckily, most coming teachers are enthusiastic. We want them to educate themselves and feel happy and loyal part of our institution \r\nThe school is oriented to foreign languages, ICT and environmental education. Our pupils have achieved many successes in various competitions, including English and German language competitions. Many students continue in bilingual secondary schools. However, we still have to work hard to develop quality of education, bring new methods and more entertaining activities into classrooms. \r\nWe have participated in some European projects, such as eTwinning Schoolovision, European Languages Day, ENO Tree Day. We cooperate with our twin school in the Czech Republic. A British teacher comes every year to our school with amazing presentation about Britain and with information about studying in the UK. \r\nNevertheless, there is yet much to do if we want our students to think in European dimensions. It is even more important now, when media are full of negative news and conspiracy websites spread lies. \r\n\r\nAims:\r\nThe first aim of our project is to improve our teachers' language competences, which will mean better quality of foreign languages teaching at our school too. Along with that we also want to widen knowledge about European, British, and specifically English and Scottish culture and life. Teachers should be able to promote and support European values, such as peace, cooperation, human rights, tolerance and solidarity. They will become better in teaching critical thinking and how to distinguish reliable sources of information from the fake ones.\r\nA crucial challenge is inclusion of the pupils with special needs. Therefore we are sending our employee to Special Needs and Inclusive Learning course. \r\nAll participants will bring inspiring information about education system and methodology in other countries. They will meet new colleagues and possibly start international projects with them. \r\n\r\nParticipants, mobilities and expected results:\r\n- Eight employees are involved in the mobilities. They are all teachers and also have other important roles in the school. \r\n- Seven participants will attend Pilgrims courses in Canterbury. We have only the best experiences from 2015 Pilgrims summer courses, when three teachers brought new enthusiasm and many interesting activities to school. We are still in touch with some Pilgrims teachers and collegues from Sweden, Poland, Hungary, Estonia, Germany...  \r\n- They will study at one or  two weeks courses, in compliance with their needs and our school needs:  \r\nMethodology & English Language for Primary Teachers \r\nMethodology & English Language for Secondary Teachers\r\nEnglish Language Improvement Course\r\nSpecial Needs and Inclusive Learning\r\nDrama Techniques for Creative English Teaching\r\nPractical uses of Mobile Technologies in the Language Classroom\r\nBritish Life, Language & Culture.\r\n- One teacher will participate in Teacher Training in Inlingua Edinburgh. The course consists of two main components (Teacher Training and Spoken Performance) plus an extensive Scottish culture programme.\r\n- Studying English in an English-speaking country and intensive contact with teachers from around the world will surely bring efficiency to our teachers' communication skills and widen their intercultural knowledge. The courses will empower them with the tools to communicate effectively in English and to apply their knowledge to the classes too. The participants will refresh the oral and listening English skills, apply a modern, communication-oriented teaching methodology, benefit from the exchange of best practice.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\nOur school has participated in two Erasmus plus KA1 projects so far and the mobilities and results were amazing. Therefore we know we can expect great benefits for our school, our pupils and our teachers. We hope to promote students' deeper interest in learning, and not only English. Our teachers will inject life into lessons and make them more attractive. \r\nWe are also convinced that the chosen courses will contribute to giving European dimension to our school. The students will gain a better understanding of European life, culture and values in its various aspects.\r\nWe believe our participation will promote cooperation of our school with other educational institutions abroad.\r\nOur school is part of local community.

The effort to create a pedagogically and professionally erudite team of teachers interested in lifelong learning is the basis of a good school. Teachers who lack  such attributes are unable to guarantee  high quality in education and upbringing even if all the other conditions are provided. On the other hand, high quality teachers can, to a certain extent, compensate for worse conditions in educational process. Having the top teachers in the school system is determined by  the attractiveness of teaching profession. The attractiveness does not depend solely on adequate salary, conditions for personal development, work conditions and public recognition, but also on career prospects and opportunities for professional growth.\r\nFor this reason, our school has decided to participate in Erasmus + programme and send 6 teachers and 1 school executive, the deputy headmaster, to take part in the educational programmes.

Our objectives include increasing interest and enjoyment during science lesson  resulting in a potential increase choice of STEM subjects as well as fostering creativity, problem solving and critical thinking while providing equitable and inclusive educational opportunities for all.\r\n\r\nFollowing the mobility,  our potential participant will share and support our science department with implementing these techniques. \r\n\r\nLet us not forget that our scientists are the scientists of tomorrow.

The centre is immersed in a powerful Europeanization process from which it is trying to strengthen the teaching of languages, mainly in the non-linguistic areas.

For both sectors we are developing internationalization projects that pivot around the participation of the educational community members in E+ projects.\r\nThe school Faculty is undergoing a major reform and most of the professionals who join our centre are qualified at a high level (linguistic skills) to provide bilingual teaching. \r\nLooking to offering our students the optimal teaching level, we believe it is convenient and even, prescriptive, that our teachers have the possibility of undertaking qualified training courses to enhance their languages skills.\r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT:\r\n- To Know new teaching methodologies, focusing on attention to diversity outreach. \r\n- To detect the strengths and weaknesses of our methodology. \r\n- To promote knowledge, appreciation and dissemination of the common European heritage: linguistic, cultural and natural. \r\n- To use English as a communication tool in the classroom, improving it with our pupils.\r\n- To include the strengths detected in the schools visited, in our Center Plan and carry out the modification of those, that do not contribute to the achievement of all the above. \r\n- Europeanization of the school and teaching practice. \r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF THE PARTICIPANTS:\r\nThe number of participants in the project is 8. They are qualified on the heritage preservation and dissemination, the respect for Human Rights and their European dimension. Finally, due to the extensive experience of some components in E+ projects, as well as the bilingual teaching, the performance of responsability positions at regional level, our team represents a promising group to consolidate an innovative European Development Plan in our school.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITIES AND METHODOLOGY:\r\na) job shadowing (Belgium and Germany) to learn teaching practices for the integration of immigrant students to promote European identity, and methodological strategies based on learning by tasks, as well as classroom and center dynamics aimed at favoring attention to diversity and the integration of the European Common Heritage in our classrooms.\r\nb) b) mobility activities focused on the enhancement of the participants\u2019 foreign languages competence will be held to improve formative needs in our staff Participants will attend specific courses in Malta, France, Finland, Ireland, Greece and UK.\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS AND IMPACT:\r\nThe outcomes will be measured through the participants\u2019 assessment of both written and oral competence in foreign languages, their ability to share teaching experiences with other professionals, and to learn skills and new resources used in other countries. The participants will share their newly acquired knowledge through a personal blog. They will also employ digital platforms, (eTwinning, Moodle) to get their work known by the school comunity. \r\nLONG-TERM BENEFITS:\r\nMobility activities will increase the number of language acquisition-related activities in our school, thus promoting values such as interculturalism, European Heritage dimension and citizenship awareness. They will also facilitate the family participation, a better approach to bilingual areas and the improvement in methodology and teaching strategies.", "http://www.pilgrims.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA101-048745_1"], ["6PR", "Berufsbezogene Praktika und Bildungsaufenthalte zum Erwerb europ\u00e4ischer Schl\u00fcsselqualifikationen", "The Oxford Centre Limited", 453344.0, "In this project the Friedrich-List-Schule in Darmstadt as the sending organisation and our partner organizations in Spain, France, Ireland and Great Britain are involved. \r\nOur target group are above all students in their first year of studies and graduates of commercial assistance qualifications focusing on foreign language management and office management. These management courses are full-time schooling. Sometimes also graduates of dual system qualifications who don\u2019t find any employment after their graduation take part in this project. For example social insurance clerks, IT clerks, office clerks, bank clerks, retail clerks, notary clerks and clerks in public administration. Besides the students and graduates of the mentioned professions the target group also consists of the teaching staff of Friedrich-List-Schule. The different skill enhancements should be realized in this project.\r\nA central target of our project is the better employability on the labour market. This employability however is not given with the majority of the participants before this project. Especially the graduates of full-time schooling courses i.e. graduates of the commercial assistance qualifications have great difficulties in finding a job because they lack work experience, important linguistic and social competences.\r\nThe planned project is suited for the further education demands of the participants and thus enables them to find a job.\r\nOur main target, the good employability of participants on the first labour market is achieved by the acquisition of international competences, foreign language experiences, intercultural knowledge and experiences in the international world of work. Therefore the participants in general do a 26- week internship related with their job in a European destination country.\r\nThey acquire linguistic, intercultural, personal and social skills as well as competences referring to their job without those they would hardly find an adequate job. The requirement of our target group is the further education concerning languages, personality and job specific to increase the employability on the local, national and international labour market. By means of this project the participants achieve a considerable additional value related to their job and personality and after their return it\u2019s a lot easier for them to get a job on the first labour market. \r\nThe Hessian Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs officially authorized the sending organization to make it possible that also graduates from other Hessian vocational colleges which are not in a position to carry out such projects to take part in those projects. To promote the demand for further education above all the mobility of young graduates coming from the structure weak regions in East-North and Mid-Hesse is another vital target of the project since in these regions there are only few jobs available catering for the individual commercial qualifications the students have. \r\nThe students will do a 6-week commercial work placement at the end of their first year of studies in a European target country. The participants will increase their motivation and will start their second year of studies highly enthusiastically. The benefit will be that they got the experience to be able to stay and live in a foreign country. Most of the time they are fond of their experiences and proud of themselves. Due to these positive experiences made they again apply for another work placement  at the end of their studies.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is also to cover the different individual demands of skill enhancement of our teachers. To prepare our school for new challenges and to increase the European dimension and international orientation of our school.\r\nWith regard to our first target group the graduates of the above mentioned commercial professions , we are planning to send a total of 64 participants from all over Hesse in 2 flows that means in August 2018 and in August 2019, each time till February of the following year.\r\nWith reference to the group of students in their first year of studies we are planning with a total of 48 participants, all students are from our school. There will be also 2 flows, at the beginning of June till mid-July, in 2018 and in 2019.\r\nReferring the teaching staff the Friedrich-List-Schule is planning a total of 27 sendings, above all during the Hessian summer holidays in 2018 and in 2019.", "http://www.oxfordenglish.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004385_1"], ["0AB", "Experience European Business", "YHA Oxford", 49111.0, "Context and background:\r\nAustria in general and especially Carinthia live from the intensive integration into the European and international economic and cultural areas. Business and society need young people with adequatge qualifications. With the project \u201cExperience European Business\u201c we also want to further internationalise the education at our school. Beyond that, we believe that positive experiences from international exchange may counter tendencies towards sharper national differentiation.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nThe emphasis is on the development of professional competences of the trainees, which we define as language, commercial, intercultural and social competences. Interns shall be placed in interesting companies. In this way they are challenged to use and extend their knowledge and skills. Thus, their chances on the Austrian and international labour market are rising (\u201eemployability\u201c). Moreover, they shall be increasingly able to take an active part in European life and to accept the challenges of a more and more diverse society and of digitalisation in a positive way. The participating institutions (school, companies) should also share their experiences and benefit from them.\r\n\r\nParticipants:\r\nIn the first year of the project we assume that 16 to 20 students from the third to the fifth grade will take part in this specific project. They will be active for 4 to 8 weeks, to the biggest part in UK, and also in Italy. We hope to arrange internships in other countries, too. Hosting organisations will be various businesses (accountancy, trade, services, municipality, etc.), which will offer varied professional experiences. In the second year of the project we expect about the same number of participants. We want to encourage learners from our evening school to also participate; so far we have not succeeded.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nLearners will be prepared in special workshops for their jobs regarding language acquisition, job relevant activities and organization management. The project team and teachers of diverse subjects will participate here. Practical and logistical preparations are done on an individual basis with each participant, also in cooperation with partners in the host country (e.g. Go English). After the internships the experiences will be passed on to a various target groups in different formats (peer-to-peer activities, reports, presentations,\u2026).\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\nThe Absolventenvereinigung der Handelsakademien Klagenfurt (Association of graduates of the business college Klagenfurt) as the applicant body is responsible for the processing of the project and cooperates intensively with the business college (HAK) in Klagenfurt. For this reason a separate bank account was opened. An optimal coordination is guaranteed through close personal interrelations. For UK internships our partner Go English is intensively involved in finding adequate companies and suitable accommodation, and in supporting our trainees on site. Further stakeholders, such as parents, will regularly be implicated.\r\nThe application of instruments on the Europass and ECVET-basis will also assure the quality of the execution and the internships.\r\n\r\nExpected results and impact:\r\nMainly the learners will profit from the projects directly, as their professional, social, language and cultural skills will certainly be advanced. With a highly regarded internship abroad they will obviously have great advantages on the labour market that looks for motivated, open-minded and well-educated applicants.\r\nAlso the sending institutions will have the opportunity to share the experiences of the trainees. They (respectively the involved persons) will improve their competences in international project organisation. The teachers will benefit from this projects by expanding their experiences through post-proceeding activities and by passing them on to their other students.\r\nMoreover, the region will profit from higher qualified young people in economic and social respects.\r\n\r\nLong-term benefit:\r\n2018 will be the third year of our mobility project. We hope to extend it in the future \u2013 also geographically. In the long term, we would like to create a sustainable culture of internationality in education.
