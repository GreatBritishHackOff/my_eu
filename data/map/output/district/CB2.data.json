Both geological evidence from the Holocene, when sea levels rose quickly and significantly and models of contemporary sea level rise suggest that saltmarshes are able to keep pace with sea level rise when sediment supply is sufficient, thus protecting inland habitats from inundation. Saltmarshes have also been shown to be very effective at attenuating wave energy during storm surges.

The aim of the project is the identification of selective microRNA modulators by fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) approaches.\nMicroRNAs are short ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules, on average only 22 nucleotides long that act as post-transcriptional regulators by binding to complementary sequences in the three prime untranslated regions (3`UTRs) of target messenger RNA transcripts (mRNAs), usually resulting in efficient sequence-specific gene silencing, which is referred to as RNA interference (RNAi). The numerous reports indicating a role of microRNAs in connection with diseases such as diabetes, neurological disorders, and cancer  raises the question whether microRNA could be targeted in the development of a novel therapeutic strategy.\nFragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) methods have been developed for finding lead compounds as part of the drug discovery process. The approach is based on identifying small molecules (with a molecular weight less than 250 Da and so called fragments), which generally bind only weakly to the biological target, and then iteratively elaborating them to produce successively more potent compounds.\nThe target microRNA will be microRNA-122, which plays a key role in hepatitis C virus infection, microRNA-155, an inducer of pancreatic cancer by suppressing the expression of cell-cycle protein p53 and let-7 microRNA, which has been shown to control the timing of development of nematode Caenorhabditis elegans from the last larval stage to adulthood.\nDetailed binding studies will be done by NMR spectroscopy.

Increased loads make supersonic flow velocities more prevalent and are inherently connected to the appearance of shock waves, which in turn may interact with a laminar boundary layer. Such an interaction can quickly cause flow separation, which is highly detrimental to aircraft performance, and poses a threat to safety. In order to diminish the shock induced separation, the boundary layer at the point of interaction should be turbulent.\nThe main objective of the TFAST project is to study the effect of transition location on the structure of interaction. The main question is how close the induced transition may be to the shock wave while still maintaining a typical turbulent character of interaction.\nThe main study cases - shock waves on wings/profiles, turbine and compressor blades and supersonic intake flows - will help to answer open questions posed by the aeronautics industry and to tackle more complex applications. In addition to  basic flow configurations, transition control methods (stream-wise vortex generators and electro-hydrodynamic actuators) will be investigated for controlling transition location, interaction induced separation and inherent flow unsteadiness. TFAST for the first time will provide a characterization and selection of appropriate flow control methods for transition induction as well as physical models of these devices.\nEmphasis will be placed on closely coupled experiments and numerical investigations to overcome weaknesses in both approaches.", 121746.0, 4060337.0, "TFAST", null, null, null, null, "http://www.cam.ac.uk", null, "fp7_101445_999977172"], ["1TN", "Interrogating macromolecular assemblies by using fragment-based small molecule approaches: The multiprotein von Hippel Lindau-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex", "The Chancellor Masters and Scholars of the University of Cambridge", "Most proteins exert their biological function by interacting with other proteins in complex macromolecular assemblies.

This project aims at investigating the plasticity and druggability of PPI interfaces within multi-protein assemblies by an innovative approach combining fragment-based chemical tools, biophysical and structural methods, using the von Hippel Lindau (pVHL)-Cullin Ring type E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex as a model system. The pVHL-CRL is responsible for the recognition, poly-ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of HIF-1\u03b1, a key regulator of cellular oxygen sensing. This interaction is impaired during the hypoxic proliferation of tumours and as a result of pVHL mutations in the VHL disease, a human syndrome predisposing to cancer. By characterizing the binding of fragments to wild-type and disease mutants of this multi-subunit complex, this project will provide novel insights on the important features for small molecule targeting to PPI interfaces and on how to modulate PPIs not only directly by targeting the interaction hot spots, but also indirectly e.g. through binding to distant allosteric sites. Such knowledge will also be harnessed towards developing novel drug like small molecules, by applying NMR techniques for the detection of fragment binding to adjacent sites and developing dynamic combinatorial X-ray crystallography to in situ linking of these fragments.

Fuel cells are typically classified by the type of electrolyte. The Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), where the electrolyte is a solid, has been proposed as the most effective choice due to its versatile choice of fuel, almost quantitative thermodynamic efficiency and tolerance to most impurities. Nevertheless, limitations and problems arise from the high operating temperatures (700 \u00b0C) and very humid atmospheres (pH2O = 0.5), which are largely due to the low anionic O2- and protonic H\\ conductivities of anionic conductors electrolyte materials. Overall SOFC improvement relies on increasing the conductivities of the electrolyte, which could only be obtained from a mechanism understanding of how O2- and H\\ propagate through the electrolyte. We proposed here to tackle these issues by studying the structural chemistry and O2- / H\\ dynamics of electrolyte materials under in operando SOFC conditions using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the most powerful structural determination technique available.

Only a comprehensive chemical analysis of SOA simulated in laboratory experiments can rigorously identify and quantify SOA sources. However, only a small minority of the SOA mass can be characterized on a molecular level due to fundamental limitations of conventional analytical-chemical techniques.

We are particularly interested in developing and studying a new graphene-organic hybrid material (GOH) for applications in microelectronics; the new material proposed, while maintaining the excellent properties of classical graphene, will have improved processability in solution, chemical functionalization and tunable optoelectronic properties.\nWe will use supramolecular interactions to cover single graphene sheets with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules, i.e. nano-graphenes (NG), which are composed of i) an aromatic core able to interact strongly with graphene, and ii) flexible side chains to provide solubility in organic solvents. NGs adsorb reversibly on graphene by pi-pi interactions, forming ordered adlayers on its surface with pre-programmed molecule spacing and orientation, ultimately modulating the electronic properties of the GOH.\nThe interaction of NG and graphene will be studied at macroscopic scale by optical, Raman and current-voltage spectroscopy, and at molecular and microscopic scales primarily by Scanning Probe Microscopies.

The nature of this challenge is exacerbated by the likely impact of climate change. These factors combine to make Food Security one the key challenges for the 21st century. To deliver improvement and sustainability in crop production it will be necessary to harness a broad spectrum approaches. Crop improvement will be crucial and a major part in the delivery of this will be based on classical breeding. This harnesses the genetic variation that is generated by homologous recombination during meiosis. Meiotic recombination creates new combinations of alleles that confer new phenotypes that can be tested for enhanced performance. It is also crucial in mapping genetic traits and in the introgression of new traits from sources such as wild-crop varieties. Despite the central role played by meiosis in crop production we are remarkably ignorant as to how the process is controlled in these species. For example, it is not known why recombination in cereals and forage grasses is skewed towards the ends of the chromosomes such that an estimated 30-50% of genes rarely, if ever, recombine thereby limiting the genetic variation that is available to plant breeders. Moreover, as many crop species are polyploid a further level of complexity is added to the meiotic process. Over the past 15 years studies in Arabidopsis, many conducted in the laboratories in the COMREC consortium, have provided both insights into the control of meiosis in plants and generated the tools to analyze this process in crop species.

Despite much work characterizing regulation in these circuits, how circuits interact to control global cellular programs remains unclear. This is particularly true given that recent research at the single cell level has revealed that genetic circuits often generate variable or stochastic regulation dynamics. In this proposal we will use a multi-disciplinary approach, combining modelling and time-lapse microscopy, to investigate how cells can robustly integrate signals from multiple dynamic genetic circuits. In particular we will answer the following questions: 1) What types of dynamic signal encoding strategies are available for the cell? 2) What are the benefits of dynamic gene activation, whether stochastic or oscillatory, to the cell? 3) How do cells couple and integrate output from diverse gene modules despite the noise and variability observed in gene circuit dynamics?\n\nWe will study these questions using 2 key model systems. In Aim 1, we will examine stochastic pulse regulation dynamics and coupling between alternative sigma factors in B. subtilis. Our preliminary data has revealed that multiple B. subtilis sigma factors stochastically pulse under stress. We will look for evidence of any coupling or interactions between these stochastic pulse circuits. This system will serve as a model for how a cell uses stochastic pulsing to control diverse cellular processes. In Aim 2, we will examine coupling between a deterministic oscillator, the circadian clock, and multiple other key pathways in Cyanobacteria.

METHODS: We will use neurons co-cultured with astrocytes and/or microglia from neonatal rat or mouse brain. Co-cultures will be incubated in either excitotoxic or oxygen and glucose deprivation conditions of different durations to determine conditions in which maximal neuronal loss occurs without apparent cell death.

Through the analysis of a set of monogenic mutants with clear effects on both the number of shoot branches produced and on its responsiveness to environmental inputs, we have developed a model for shoot branching control involving interactions between three systemically transported plant hormones.

The allocation of cells to either lineage depends on the activity of FGF signaling and two gene regulatory networks (GRNs), one centered on the transcription factor Nanog, the other one relying on Gata factors. The two GRNs are initially activated in an overlapping and heterogeneous pattern in the ICM, and have been proposed to compete each other out over time. The dynamics of this competition, and how the transition state between the two lineages, marked by co-expression Gatas and Nanog, is resolved, is not known.\nHere I propose to address these questions in vitro by recapitulating the competition between the Gata- and Nanog-GRNs through the controlled overexpression of Gata factors. This converts embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which contribute primarily to the epiblast when introduced in chimeras, into extraembryonic endoderm (XEN) cells, which contribute solely to PE derivatives. I will combine fluorescent reporters with this ES-to-XEN transition to ask with which dynamics transitions occur in individual cells, whether they involve heterogeneities at the population level, and how these parameters are controlled by the activity of gene regulatory networks and signaling pathways. I will aim at identifying culture conditions that stabilize the transition state, where cells might be on the brink of being XEN, and therefore akin to ICM. I hypothesize, that under these conditions cells will be endowed with higher developmental potential compared to parental ES cells, and be able to contribute to both epiblast and PE-derived tissues.\nThe results of this project will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying lineage decisions in early development and may uncover more general principles that govern the way in which differentiating cells are specified in a stem cell pool.", 173107.0, 173107.0, "CellStateTransitions", "What controls cell fate?", "In multicellular organisms cells with different fates come from originally uncommitted precursor populations.

During early mammalian embryogenesis, the cells of the blastocyst's inner cell mass (ICM) differentiate either into epiblast or to the primitive endoderm (PrE). Initially, individual ICM cells co-express the transcription factors affecting this differentiation. Later, the expression patterns become mutually exclusive, responding to the extracellular signalling.\n\nThe EU-funded project CELLSTATETRANSITIONS (Capturing transition states associated with lineage decisions in the early mouse embryo) took a closer look at these events. The project used mouse ESCs as a tissue culture model. The researchers engineered cell lines carrying doxycycline-inducible genes, encoding fluorescently tagged GATA transcription factors. These DNA-binding proteins control differentiation processes in the cell by activating or repressing transcription. The project studied the interplay between the transcriptional regulation and a signalling pathway, involving fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).\n\nCELLSTATETRANSITIONS showed how the levels of GATA factor in individual cells influenced the cell fate to undergo PrE-like differentiation. Scientists used time-lapse imaging of the fluorescently tagged GATA factors in individual cells, followed by immunostaining for fate markers. They found that PrE-like differentiation required a threshold level of GATA factor expression in individual cells. Differentiation experiments at different signalling levels revealed that FGF/MAPK signalling determined the proportion of differentiating cells by setting the threshold of GATA factors.\n\nThe project demonstrated that both transcription factor expression levels and signalling control the proportion of cells differentiating along the PrE lineage. The team suggested a simple mathematical model to describe the events underlying fate choice and validated this model by comparing simulated expression dynamics with experimentally measured processes.

In this regard, one of the most promising research lines is the thorough investigation of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of past climate changes. This has often been attempted through examination of the fossil record, or by means of phylogeographical surveys and Species Distribution Models (SDMs). Despite their valuable contributions, all these sources of inference have their own caveats and limitations that preclude further understanding. For instance, accurate migration rates, persistence of rear-edge populations, or location of cryptic refugia are difficult to obtain at large (continental) scales by any of these methods. Here we propose the use of new approaches to model species distributions, based on metapopulation theory and Bayesian dynamic occupancy models, to reconstruct the range dynamics of several European tree species since the LGM, as well as to predict the expected changes in species distributions as a consequence of current climate change. Thus, the fossil record will be integrated with state-of-the-art palaeoclimate simulations to reconstruct species distributions at 1000-year time steps, and for the end of this century. Among other advantages, our integrative modelling approach permits the probabilistic estimation of population persistence and migration rates as well as inferring the location of cryptic refugia, in relation to prevailing climatic conditions.

The long-term vision of COOPOL is to develop new methods and tools for modeling and control, based on real-time sensing, which will facilitate the development of a new paradigm of processes: intensive, low-impact, sustainable chemical technologies.

Within the chemicals sector polymer production plays a significant role, with European market share of 25% and providing employment to 1.6 million people within EU27.\nMany polymer products are manufactured using batch and semi-batch reactors. In most cases the process parameters, such as temperature profile, feeds, etc follow a specific time schedule, which has been fixed after an expensive period of product and process development. This tight recipe schedule is sensitive against disturbances e.g., unexpected variation in operating conditions, variation in feed purity etc., which inevitably leads to variations in polymer structure and\u00a0to inter-batch variability and off-spec products. Furthermore, the use of empirically determined recipes with fixed-time controls does not allow intensification of the process which requires time-varying feeds and reactor temperature to run the reaction faster and hence closer to its limits,  and also to switching from a semi-batch to other reactor or process types.\nCOOPOL addresses the complex issues of real-time process control based on advanced models and on-line sensors, to develop a generic basis for widely applicable sustainable intensified processes. COOPOL will develop a new process control approach, linking molecular level information and understanding of the reaction chemistry with real-time sensing, rigorous modeling based on first principles, subsequent model reduction and non-linear model-predictive control (NMPC) with economic objectives, called dynamic real-time optimisation (DRTO).

BAT dysfunction contributes to obesity and impaired glucose metabolism, increasing functional demand on the beta cells. The cellular dysfunction of beta cells and BAT in diabetes is the fruit of defective signal transduction and organelle function, and the vulnerability to these molecular defects may be modulated by diabetes genes.

This diagnosis will be used to define novel targets for intervention to prevent dysfunction and facilitate recovery of functionally impaired metabolic tissues. Some of these targets have already been identified by consortium members, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis.

ER stress is a cellular response to the misfolding of proteins in the ER. If prolonged or severe, it causes deterioration in cellular functions and eventually cell death. A first, BETABAT showed that markers of ER stress are present in islets of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and that modulation of ER stress protects two different mouse models of diabetes against disease.\n\nA cell's powerhouse, the mitochondrion is crucial for smooth functioning and survival of beta cells and BAT cells. The team has established that immune and metabolic stress causes death of pancreatic beta cells via activation of the mitochondrial or intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. They have also developed models to study apoptosis in brown adipocytes using mitochondrial toxins and ER stressors. Detailed mechanistic studies of the brown adipocyte apoptosis machinery and the pathways mediating BAT protein folding in the ER will now be possible.\n\nEvidence from animals and humans suggests that increased BAT activation protects against diabetes. Adipokines are cell-signalling proteins secreted by adipose tissue. BAT has a unique adipokine profile as opposed to white adipose tissue (WAT). Two new \u2018BATokines\u2019 have been identified and there are more molecules in the pipeline.

The influence on the whole population of environmental factors is undoubtedly powerful, but one remarkable feature of the obesity epidemic is the persistence of enormous individual variation in body weight throughout the population.

There is strong evidence that within a population the variance in weight is largely genetically determined.

Recently it has been shown that BAT exists in humans being predominantly present in lean, young healthy humans opposed to humans that are obese.\nTypically BAT is activated in cold exposure to increase body temperature. This signal is mediated via activation of transient receptor potential channels (i.e. extreme-cold receptor transient receptor potential channel member A1(TRPA1)) in nerve endings. The cold signal then reaches the hypothalamus via afferent neuronal pathways. Via activation of certain cerebral nuclei, a sympathetic response is produced that reaches end organs such as BAT. TRPA1 can also be activated by allyl-isothiocyanate (AITC, present in mustard). AITC in animal studies induces energy expenditure. The end transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member (1 TRPV1), is an other receptor that activates energy expenditure via the natural compound capsaicin.\nWe suggest that the activation of BAT is a promising target to increase energy expenditure in humans. The aim of this fellowship is to investigate the activation of energy expenditure via various protocols such as cold and the administration of AITC and capsaicin in healthy humans and obese subjects.\nIncluded subjects will undergo test protocols under two temperature conditions (thermoneutrality and cold), AITC and capsaicin administration.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is present in newborn babies that do not shiver, but recent evidence indicates that it is also present in adults.

Among the objectives of the study was to develop BAT activation protocols using different stimuli and assess their impact on glucose/lipid metabolism and cardiovascular changes.\n\nCurrently, imaging of BAT in humans relies on the combined positron emission tomography and computerised tomography imaging technique, which has several limitations.

In both cases, these efforts have met considerable resistance from the social sciences, especially from social anthropology. This project proceeds from a conviction that antagonism between these disciplines can often be explained by deep, and unacknowledged, philosophical differences regarding the nature of scientific explanation, the composition of culture, and the characterisation of human nature.

Recently, we provided in vivo evidence that local mRNA translation in mature axons is required for their maintenance. This new finding, along with in vitro work from other groups, indicates that promoting axonal protein synthesis is a key mechanism by which trophic factors act to prevent axon degeneration. Here we propose a program of research to investigate the importance of ribosomal proteins (RPs) in axon maintenance and degeneration. The rationale for this is fourfold. First, recent genome-wide studies of axonal transcriptomes have revealed that protein synthesis (including RP mRNAs) is the highest functional category in several neuronal types. Second, some RPs have evolved extra-ribosomal functions that include signalling, such as 67LR which acts both as a cell surface receptor for laminin and as a RP. Third, mutations in different RPs in vertebrates cause unexpectedly specific defects, such as the loss of optic axons. Fourth, preliminary results show that RP mRNAs are translated in optic axons in response to trophic factors. Collectively these findings lead us to propose that locally synthesized RPs play a role in axon maintenance through either ribosomal or extra-ribosomal function. To pursue this proposal, we will perform unbiased screens and functional assays using an array of experimental approaches and animal models. By gaining an understanding of how local RP synthesis contributes to axon survival, our studies have the potential to provide novel insights into how components conventionally associated with a housekeeping role (translation) are linked to axon degeneration.

Studies suggest that addition of catalytic species to prevent the charge build-up should be done with care not to increase undesirable reactions.\n\nIn contrast to other tools, the project's ssNMR-based methodology enabled the researchers to gain a clear picture of the factors affecting efficiency. The team has proven ssNMR to be a powerful and flexible analytical tool for the study of electrochemical reactions in battery cells.

EU-funded scientists working on the project 'Active self-assembly' (ACTSA) are pushing the boundaries to enhance understanding of active self-assembly through theoretical studies, computer simulations and experiments.\n\nThe densest way to pack objects in space, also known as the packing problem, has intrigued scientists and philosophers for millenia. Today, packing comes up in various systems over many length scales from batteries and catalysts to the self-assembly of nanoparticles, colloids and biomolecules. Despite the fact that so many systems' properties depend on the packing of differently-shaped components, we still have no general understanding of how packing varies as a function of particle shape. In this project, we carried out an exhaustive study of how packing depends on shape by investigating the packings of over 55,000 polyhedra. Our resulting density surface plots can be used to guide experiments that utilize shape and packing in the same way that phase diagrams are essential to do chemistry. The properties of particle shape indeed are revealing why we can assemble certain crystals, transition between different ones, or get stuck in kinetic traps.\n\nEntropy modulates the ordering of particles and the phase behaviour of colloids (particles of one substance dispersed in another). ACTSA scientists quantified the directional entropic forces that tend to align neighbouring particles. Most importantly, the team provided a framework to quantify the role of shape in packing and in self-assembly in experimental systems in which other forces contribute to assembly. Finally, the team demonstrated that the mechanism occurs in a wide range of systems.\n\nResearchers also studied emergent phenomena in systems of spinners, particles that experience a constant internal torque in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. They showed that the active motion of the otherwise non-interacting rigid bodies induces an effective interaction that favours rotation in the same direction. This can lead to self-organisational and cooperative behaviours that are not possible in equilibrium systems (without applied activity).\n\nResults to date have already led to three publications.

To do this I will study avian brood parasites called Honeyguides that exploit other species to raise their young. This exposes parasite nestlings to diverse antigens related to the range of hosts that might raise them. Honeyguides also destroy host eggs and kill host chicks which remain rotting in the nest, further exposing parasite nestlings to high disease pressure. I will ask if over evolutionary time this has selected for strong immune defences and if Honeyguides suffer less than host nestlings in terms of reduced growth when disease conditions are experimentally altered. Using a second brood parasite, where host-specific races parasitize hosts of different sizes, I will explore a related question: do growth conditions during development affect immune function in adulthood? Finally, using modern metagenomic approaches I will examine how brood parasites and hosts acquire their gut microbiota and how disease exposure might shape this microbial community, providing important data on the microbiomes of wild birds that is currently lacking.

Additionally, these new concepts will also produce less radioactive waste, which is radiotoxic for a shorter time frame. If such concept succeeds, nuclear power can be considered almost sustainable bearing in mind that the waste we already have generated may be used for next generations.

According to this, several methods exist to predict crystal morphologies favouring one of the driving parameters over the other. The aim of the proposed project CRYSURFSIM (crystal surface simulations) is to develop a unified crystal growth model that combines classical crystal growth theories with modern quantum mechanical simulations.

The EU-funded project 'Crystal surface simulations' (CRYSURFSIM) was launched to develop a unifying model for modern crystal morphology engineering.\n\nThe amazingly varied shapes of crystals, even those of the same compound, arise from the different growing conditions to which they are subjected. Surface free energy is an important driving parameter.\n\nSurface free energy, also called surface tension for liquids, is the difference between the energies of atoms at the surface versus on the inside of the crystal. The bond\u2013valence deficiency (BVD) model can be used to predict surface free energies and crystal morphology.\n\nCRYSURFSIM exploited the BVD model to gap the classical and quantum mechanical descriptions of crystal growth. Scientists successfully applied it to describe the surface free energy of common metal crystal structures. Results agreed with those of quantum mechanical lattice simulations and the crystal structures it predicted resembled those found in nature. The most important advantage of the BVD model relative to lattice simulations was its speed.\n\nApplication to minerals (specifically, with structure types AX and AX2) was more challenging. While the BVD model handles both neutral and charged surfaces, lattice simulations require a 'correction' to convert charged to charge-neutral surfaces, proving a challenge for the comparison of results. However, when halides, sulphides and oxides were considered, the BVD model once again showed a clear agreement with lattice simulations and with morphologies seen in nature.\n\nThe BVD model has proven to be a fast tool to accurately predict the morphology of crystals with minimal computational load, forming an effective bridge between macroscopic and quantum mechanical crystal formation models.

Moreover CMV attacks more crop and wild-plant species than any other virus. A key contributor to the success of CMV is a recently-discovered factor made by the virus: the 2b protein. Until recently the most important known role for the 2b protein was that it counterattacks resistance mechanisms that plants use to defend against virus infection. In particular, the 2b protein can disrupt a form of antiviral resistance that is controlled by a variety of small RNAs (small interfering and microRNAs). We have discovered a remarkable and novel property of the 2b protein: it inhibits plant resistance to insects. This is very important because under natural conditions, CMV (like most plant viruses) is transmitted from plant to plant by aphids. Aphids are insects that feed on plants and in doing so promote the spread of disease caused by viruses and other disease-causing organisms. We can imagine that it will be in the interests of the virus to inhibit defences against insects so that sufficient aphids will settle on CMV-infected plants to pass on the infection to new host plants. We found that the 2b protein blocks the action of a natural chemical signal, jasmonic acid, which stimulates anti-insect defences in plants.

In the opposite, strong coupling limit setups with magnetic and superconducting domain walls will be studied, focusing on adiabatic transport properties and on localized excitations related to Majorana fermions.\n\nThe second strand of research focuses on formulating the surface theory of 3D FTIs in the framework of the parton construction.

While much attention has focused on the economic dimensions of recessions in Europe, very little work is being done to analyse the consequences of these events for health and well-being. There are widespread concerns that losses of housing, jobs, and income will have damaging effects on public health. Curiously, however, a growing body of social science research suggests that economic recessions may reduce death rates at a population level, such as by lowering the number of road-traffic injuries, alcohol-related deaths and hospital admissions. Hence, although there is universal agreement that economic shocks will affect health, there is considerable confusion about what the direction of this relationship is. This project aims to understand two interrelated questions: How will the recent economic downturns affect health in Europe? What can be done to mitigate potential negative consequences for health from these economic shocks? To answer these questions, the proposed research will draw on a secondary analysis of longitudinal household datasets and country-level economic and health data to estimate how job loss, poverty, debt, and housing foreclosures affect health. Then, drawing on a conceptual model of \u2018resilience\u2019, the project will seek to understand why certain groups have experienced better or worse health outcomes than others in the context of recession.

While the average level of health in EU countries has continued to improve over the last decades, differences in health between advantaged and disadvantaged sections of the population within each country remain substantial. A broad spectrum of policies influences the determinants of health inequalities. Such interventions are seldom evaluated for their impact on population health in general and even more rarely for their differential impact on different socioeconomic groups. There is an urgent need to extend and strengthen the evidence base on differential policy impact, to help identify the most effective ways to reduce health inequalities in different EU countries. Methodologically, this is a highly challenging task for which traditional experimental evaluation designs are neither adequate nor feasible.\n\nObjectives\n1 Develop, evaluate and refine methodologies for assessing the effects of social, economic and health policies on the pattern and magnitude of health inequalities among socioeconomic groups.\n2 Assess the differential health effects by socioeconomic group of \u2018natural policy experiments\u2019 in the fields of unemployment and poverty reduction; tobacco and alcohol control; and access to education and preventive health care.\n3 Synthesise the evidence from the findings of objectives 1-2, and actively engage users in the research in order to promote transfer of knowledge for policy and practice with maximum effectiveness.\n\nApproach\nNew methods of policy analysis and evaluation of natural experiments will be combined with a unique longitudinal dataset of health determinants and health outcomes by socioeconomic group in more than 20 European countries covering several decades, in order to generate new knowledge on differential effects of policies targeting the strategic drivers of health inequalities.", 36224.0, 3234246.0, "DEMETRIQ", "Reducing health inequalities", "Reducing health inequalities", "Health inequalities are associated with factors such as living conditions, psychosocial conditions, lifestyle and access to critical services such as healthcare.

Over the last years it has become increasingly clear that progress in the understanding of the molecular basis of PD, the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, and hence the chance to develop effective disease-modifying treatments, will most likely be brought about by focusing on the rare variants of the disease with known genetic defects. The groups forming the MEFOPA-consortium will therefore analyze the molecular pathways underlying inherited forms of PD with autosomal-dominant and autosomal-recessive inheritance in an integrative way, using cellular and animal models and cutting-edge technology. These two subprojects will provide targets for novel, disease-modifying treatment strategies. In a third subproject, a European registry and biobank for patients with rare Mendelian forms of PD will be established.

The haploid fission yeast with its relative genomic simplicity, genetic tractability, uniform size and shape, and well-characterized, conserved and simple growth and polarization machinery is ideal for this study.

Trophoblast cells indeed invade deep into the uterus while maternal NK cells accumulate adjacent to the invading trophoblast. These immune cells are a unique population and are known as uterine NK (uNK) cells. The interactions between trophoblast and uNK cells most likely influence the tissue remodelling that results in increased blood flow necessary for fetal growth. Thus, these interactions are key to successful reproduction but the molecular mechanisms are unknown and are the focus of this proposal. Like human uNK cells, also mouse uNK cells express activating receptors, such as the Natural Cytotoxicity Receptor NKp46, which is coded by the Ncr1 gene and is conserved in human, mice and many other species. NKp46 is a key receptor to recognise cancer cells. The host laboratory (lead by F Colucci) has shown that NKp46-deficient mice are more prone to metastatic melanoma (JCI, 2009) and that mouse trophoblast cells may express NKp46 ligands (unpublished). Considering the invasive properties of trophoblast, the question we wish to address is whether NKp46 controls the extent of trophoblast invasion, thereby affecting spiral arteries remodelling and fetal-placental growth.

The current becomes spin-polarised with the majority of electrons' magnetic moment aligned with magnetisation of the ferromagnetic material.\n\nHIGHSPIN scientists fabricated NLSVs using a variety of channel materials to address the exponential drop in spin currents. Metals had an advantage due to their high conductivity that helps to reduce the conductivity mismatch prevalent in spin devices.\n\nNext, HIGHSPIN's focus turned to a particular aspect of domain walls in ferromagnetic nanowires \u2013 boundaries separating areas of a magnetised material that possess different magnetic alignments. Magnetic domain walls cannot only be moved by magnetic fields, but also by spin-polarised currents, offering an attractive alternative in designing magnetic non-volatile memories.\n\nScientists have shown that highly pure 3D magnetic nanowires can be fabricated using focused electron beam-induced deposition. The nanowires can be grown with high aspect ratio (up to 100) and complex geometries as required in future spintronics memory devices. Lastly, their magnetic switching behaviour can be directly probed by the magneto-optical Kerr effect.\n\nManipulation of such magnetic domain walls opens the way for an alternative technology that addresses the shortcomings of existing magnetic hard disks and solid-state solutions. The HIGHSPIN project has already made a significant step in this direction with the demonstration of magnetisation reversal in the nanowires as a result of domain walls' formation or propagation.", null, "http://www.cam.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-07/158103.jpg", "fp7_104012_999977172"], ["1TN", "Carbon Nanotubes for Interconnects and Switches", "The Chancellor Masters and Scholars of the University of Cambridge", "VIACARBON aims to develop carbon nanotubes for vertical and horizontal interconnects for CMOS nodes of 22 nm and beyond, and for NEMS RF switches.

EMT constitutes a morphogenetic process that emerged during the project as a key player in determining CSC characteristics and fate during cancer metastasis.\n\nAn important finding of the TUMIC study was the discovery that genes associated with normal stem cell identity could also be relevant to the properties of CSCs that drive tumour growth and metastasis. With respect to EMT, partners found that it was a common process in CSC-enriched sub-populations and gave a better ability to form metastases. By identifying key pathways, transcription factors and epigenetic remodeling mechanisms that regulated EMT, scientists aimed to interfere with the process and impair transition to malignancy.\n\nInvestigation of the metastatic niches revealed a role for certain proteins (SAA1 and SAA3) in lymph node dissemination. Key players in any form of metastasis were bone marrow-derived cells that colonised pre-metastatic organs and primary tumours and, through the secretion of cytokines and proteases, facilitated the invasion by cancer cells.

The host laboratory has recently identified a mechanism by which one gene product, SPG6, can affect axonal transport. The Drosophila SPG6 homolog, spichthyin, is a novel antagonist of BMP/TGF-beta signaling that acts by modulating receptor traffic. Furthermore, the host lab has found that BMP signaling is required for maintenance of axonal microtubules (MTs) in Drosophila, and that impairment of this signaling leads to loss of axonal MTs and impairment of axonal transport. This role of BMP signaling is a novel cellular process, and may be a target for other degenerative diseases. The purpose of the project is to determine how BMP signaling regulates axonal MTs. The specific objectives are (i) to determine if BMP regulation of MTs acts via the canonical BMP pathway that involves transcriptional regulation, and/or via a more localised non-canonical pathway; (ii) to test if the MT regulation occurs by regulation of tubulin expression, and/or by activity of of MT-binding proteins; (iii) to use live imaging and techniques such as FRAP to study the effect of BMP signaling on dynamic localization and traffic of MTs.

Regional model simulations highlighted the vulnerability of some near-shore regions as a result of river input and organic matter degradation as well as local upwelling systems.\n\nThe book 'Ocean Acidification' contains a great deal of information from the EPOCA project including advances from the modelling initiative and the majority of the synthesis chapter.

Studies of this unique cell lineage are of wide general interest in the context of stem cells and mechanisms of pluripotency. Relatively little is yet known about how germ cells are specified in mice. Recent genetic studies showed that the transcriptional repressor Blimp1 is a critical determinant of germ cell fate in the epiblast cells of the mouse embryo. There are only about 35 founder primordial germ cells (PGCs) present in each embryo, providing a significant hurdle for the mechanistic elucidation of germ cell specification. A robust in-vitro system that mimics PGC specification is essential to gain a deeper insight into the role of Blimp1 in germ cell fate determination.

First, by engineering embryonic stem cells to express Blimp1 in an inducible manner and utilizing them for the induction of PGC fate. Second, by generating transgenic mice expressing fluorescent reporter molecules, for the derivation of epiblast stem cell cultures and subsequent FACS sorting of PGCs. To elucidate the gene expression programme governed by Blimp1 during PGC specification, the culture models will be used for analysis of the genome wide target site binding of Blimp1 and performing functional assays of the target genes and co-repressor proteins bound with Blimp1 to the sites identified.

The ultimate goal was to study the mechanisms that explain disease phenotype and the effects of metabolite accumulation.\n\nAn important achievement of the consortium was the discovery of a common gene regulatory network that controls lysosomal biogenesis and function mediated by the transcription factor TFEB. Overexpression of TFEB rescued pathologic storage and restored normal cellular morphology in LSD mouse models.\n\nWork on the glycogen-accumulating PD revealed a number of cellular abnormalities in patients, including increased autophagy and aberrant trafficking and recycling of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). Mutation analysis of the acid alpha glucosidase (GAA) gene in Pompe patients revealed a strong correlation with disease phenotype.\n\nEnzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) is currently the only approved treatment for PD but the emergence of neutralising antibodies raises the issue of efficacy.

Atherosclerosis and its final complication, plaque rupture and subsequent infarct in heart or brain, is the main underlying pathology of CVD and atherosclerosis is responsible for 70% of all cases of CVD. Extensive studies into the pathology of atherosclerosis show that its etiology is found in a combination of dyslipidemia and a related inflammatory response with an established autoimmune component, while the major cause of acute CVD events, plaque rupture, due to an inflammatory destabilization of the atherosclerotic lesion.

Moreover, concern about exhausting battery lifetime is also one of the main reasons why users do not opt to use advanced multimedia services on their mobiles more frequently.<br/>The perspective for the future does not look encouraging in this aspect, as one could easily expect a rise of power demand for 4G devices while the progress of battery technology is very slow. Therefore, without any new approaches for energy saving, 4G mobile users will relentlessly be searching for power outlets rather than network access, and becoming once again bound to a single location. In addition, high power dissipation means that the temperature of the small handheld devices would rise to unpleasant values for the user, and make active cooling necessary.<br/>To avoid the foreseen 4G 'energy trap' C2POWER project will investigate, develop and demonstrate how cognition and cooperative strategies can be extended to decrease the overall energy consumption of mobile devices while still enabling the required performance in terms of QoS.

Such loosening commonly occurs because the joint between the implant and the surrounding bone is insufficiently strong and durable. It is a serious problem both for implants cemented to the bone and for those dependent on bone in-growth into a rough/porous implant surface. In the latter case, the main problem is commonly that bone in-growth is insufficiently rapid or deep for a strong bond to be established. The idea proposed in this work is that the implant should have a highly porous surface layer, made by bonding ferromagnetic fibres together, into which bone tissue growth would occur. During the post-operative period, application of a magnetic field will cause the fibre network to deform elastically, as individual fibres tend to align with the field. This will impose strains on the bone tissue as it grows into the fibre network. Such mechanical deformation is known to be highly beneficial in promoting bone growth, providing the associated strain lies in a certain range (~0.1%). Preliminary work, involving both model development and experimental studies on the effect of magnetic fields on fibre networks, has suggested that beneficial therapeutic effects can be induced using field strengths no greater than those already employed for diagnostic purposes.

The examination included the fundamental flow physics affecting both scenarios.\n\nUsing a generic NLF wing results showed the possibility of designing SCBs that offer improvements in aerodynamic efficiency of swept wings. An improvement of 18 % was achieved at dash conditions of the considered wing cut, without affecting cruise performance. The result extends the flight envelope of a given wing design, applicable to swept wings and finite wings forming part of a full aircraft configuration.\n\nFurther results revealed that, at buffet conditions, certain SCB designs delay the onset of the buffet. Yet, generally, when the flow degrades the introduction of bumps exacerbates this further. The project also identified the mechanisms by which shock bumps generate streamwise vortices. In combination with further, more detailed, findings this allows the design of shock control bumps that also generate streamwise vortices without damaging the boundary layer. Such vortices may provide additional control benefits, comparable to vortex generators.\n\nNEXTWING's results led to improved understanding of wing aerodynamics, meaning potential for improvement in efficiency and performance. Hence, the outcomes help to improve the sustainability of aviation.", null, "http://www.cam.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/149527.jpg", "fp7_100013_999977172"], ["1TN", "Variable Stars in Current and Future Large Scale Observing Surveys", "The Chancellor Masters and Scholars of the University of Cambridge", "Observing and analysing changes in the brightness of stars is one of the oldest means of studying them, their populations and underlying laws of physics.

Pathological states of the breast, such as pre-neoplastic lesions and carcinomas, retain aspects of cellular composition observed in the normal breast. It is not clear if the heterogeneity of breast cancer reflects the same hierarchical pattern of the normal tissue. In particular, the question remains as to whether specific molecular pathways establish the subtype of breast cancer or whether different cell types within the breast hierarchy become transformed and give rise to each tumour subtype. Currently, one of the major limitations in the field consists of a lack of experimental model systems that correctly recapitulate the pathogenesis of human breast tumours.\nThe main aim of this project is to study the cellular origin of breast cancer. In order to use a model which more closely recapitulates the human pathogenesis of breast cancer in a relatively short time frame as compared to traditional transgenic mice models, we will develop a novel system which will be used to address several important questions. The model will provide a powerful tool to dissect the contribution of oncogenes and targeted cells to the development of specific types of cancer.

However, further work is needed to optimise the slippage cassette for cancer studies.\n\nProject members were successful in deleting genes representing specific cell populations. Moreover, genes that can affect breast tissue structure and cell composition were also identified. Characterisation of genes led to the identification of a gene called regulator of mammary alveologenesis (Roma).  This gene regulates the differentiation of cells into the milk-producing lineage.\n\nTo study Roma gene function in mammary gland development, researchers generated a mouse model lacking the Roma gene.

The dialects to be studied are the extreme Southern Italian Dialects Salentino and Southern Calabrese. These dialects are unique in Europe in that they show strong variation between an Italian-type system of complementation, with an infinitival verb, and a Balkan-type, with a morphologically finite verb. Furthermore, the finite/non-finite contrast is spelled out also on other elements of the dependent clause besides the verb, such as the complementiser. Finally, the existing descriptive literature on these dialects is far from being exhaustive, and recent fieldwork has found several previously unknown verbal forms. These dialects therefore provide an ideal empirical foundation for any theory of finiteness which aims at universal validity. More precisely, they could provide the fine-grained evidence needed to establish which of the many features related to finiteness is indeed relevant, and how these features are mapped onto the verbal morphology and other elements of the clause.

It will enable architects to manage the thermal impact on the overall aircraft architecture (which today is not possible) by delivering an optimised thermal behaviour of the entire aircraft\u2019s systems, equipment and components.\n\nTOICA builds on the Behavioural Digital Aircraft (BDA) collaborative environment developed in the previous EU project CRESCENDO. It enables architects, experts and suppliers to work together to study the most promising thermal aircraft concepts and to collaboratively build viable technical solutions. New BDA advanced capabilities are developed by the TOICA project: an Architect Cockpit, to allow the architects and experts to monitor the thermal assessment of an aircraft and to perform trade-off studies, and Super-integration, to support a holistic view of the aircraft and to organise the design views and the related simulation cascade.\n\nThroughout the project, a number of technical \u201cplateau\u201d sessions are organised with architects from the main industrial partners  and involving the whole consortium to test and improve the trade-off processes that will be increasingly instrumented by the capability enablers and validate the definition, selection and evaluation of thermally optimised aircraft configurations.\n\nThese plateaus represent major milestones and are held as face-to-face and virtual meetings to ensure and assess the progress of the project.\n\nIn parallel, Technology Readiness Level (TRL) evaluations are put in place to assess the maturity of the developed technologies and support the future deployment and exploitation of the TOICA results.\n\nThanks to TOICA architects will be able to manage the thermal impact of the whole aircraft for the first time ever.

The main objective was to promote therapeutic strategies for the treatment of leukodystrophies.\n\nThe consortium generated a European database with the clinical data, mutations and biological samples of more than 500 patients. They validated biomarkers found in patients' biological fluids such as the peptide neurotransmitters N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) for leukodystrophies with inborn error of myelin formation.\n\nAdditionally, they investigated the role of oxidative stress in axonal degeneration to screen for new biomarkers. Patient fibroblasts exhibited an impaired mitochondrial metabolism. Without anti-oxidant compounds, this would result in oxidative damage. This finding alongside other results clearly indicated that oxidative stress constitutes a major causative disease-driving factor in leukodystrophies.\n\nA compound screen led to the identification of anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, or neuroprotective compounds for ameliorating disease symptoms. This was exemplified by a cholesterol derivative which induced a delay in the appearance of some behavioural symptoms in young mice.\n\nEnzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has limited efficacy in treating leukodystrophies due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB limits the delivery of arylsulfatase A (ARSA) from the blood to the brain parenchyma. To overcome this problem, the consortium explored the use of implantable minipumps to deliver ARSA directly to the brain.\n\nResearchers explored further therapeutic avenues in the form of innovative cell and gene therapy approaches. Clinical trials were initiated using haematopoietic stem cells transduced with viral vectors for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and presymptomatic metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). Results showed that expression of the mutated protein in nearly 10% of their circulating haematopoietic cells was restored. Moreover, this approach successfully arrested the progression of cerebral demyelinating lesions.\n\nIn symptomatic forms of MLD, gene therapy with direct brain injection of the viral vector has been successfully tested in animal models. Cell therapy using neural stem cell transplantation can restore myelin production.\n\nFinally, the LEUKOTREAT Ethics Research Group carried out a survey on patients\u2019 needs and expectations regarding research in LDs, with the aim to better understand them and thus to provide better support.\n\nTherefore, the LEUKOTREAT project successfully translated many therapeutic strategies into the clinic, bringing hope to many patients. Additionally, the efficacy of these dietary and pharmacological interventions opens up avenues for less invasive therapeutic approaches.\n\nAll documents created during the project are available for download on the LEUKOTREAT website: guidelines for database creation (LeukoDB Charter), Ethics model documents, Patient Information & Consent Forms.

Previous studies in animal and cell culture model systems have revealed a number of polarity determinants that act coordinately to establish and maintain epithelial cell polarity under normal conditions. Recent work in Drosophila melanogaster has demonstrated that under starvation conditions, normal polarity signaling is not sufficient; activation of a distinct low-energy polarity pathway is required to maintain polarity. This low-energy polarity pathway is mediated by the LKB1-AMPK signaling module, which acts as a sensor of energy availability. Additional components of the pathway include dystroglycan and the growth regulator TOR, which are not required for epithelial cell polarity except under starvation conditions. Intriguingly, LKB1, AMPK1, dystroglycan, and TOR are all associated with incidence or progression of human epithelial cancers.

We will contrast specifically linguistic forms of complexity (derivational and inflectional morphology, argument structure, etc.) with more general sources of complexity reflecting on-line competition between different lexical and phrasal interpretations. Research in English suggests that these engage different processing systems across the two hemispheres. The second strand (Polish) examines the neural dynamics of the same sources of processing complexity in a morphologically much richer language, but sharing with English the same concatenative word-formation mechanisms. The third strand will analyse neural responses to processing complexity in the radically different morpho-lexical context of Arabic, where the fundamental mechanism of word formation is non-concatenative, and where key grammatical morphemes serve multiple linguistic functions.

The vast majority of the Information Theory literature ignores these constraints and theoretical studies that provide a finite-length treatment of information processing are hence urgently needed. When finite-lengths are employed, asymptotic techniques (laws of large numbers, large deviations) cannot be invoked and new techniques must be sought.

Importantly, there is currently no reliable method allowing prediction of the risk of an individual to develop a psychotic disorder.\n\nThe risk of developing a psychotic disorder is known to be related in particular to both a person's genetic make-up, and environmental factors during his/her course of life. These factors include adversity during childhood, belonging to a society's minority group, drug addiction, or just living in a city rather than in a rural environment. Twin studies show that susceptibility to developing a psychotic disorder may be to 50 % determined by genetics. It is assumed, but still needs to be rigorously tested, that a person's genetic make-up also influences the role that environmental factors can play to enhance/or decrease risk for psychiatric disorders to develop.\n\nTo address this key question, a multidisciplinary, multinational collaboration within, and beyond, Europe has been initiated, the EU-funded 'European network of national schizophrenia networks studying gene-environment interactions' project (http://www.eu-gei.eu (EU-GEI)).\n\nEU-GEI is investigating genetic, environmental, behavioural and clinical variables in samples and data from more than 7 500 individuals, including families of patients with psychotic disorders, twin pairs and individuals from the general population.\n\nIn order to better understand fluctuations in behaviour and experiences in the flow of daily life, EU-GEI scientists have developed the PSYMATE device and application. This data collection and software tool, is able to capture multiple parameters during moments in the flow of people's everyday life, and is thus providing a 'film' rather than a 'snapshot' of the patient's day. Data from the PSYMATE tool helps to empower patients in managing their own lives, helps clinicians in terms of diagnosis and it can contribute to the evaluation of mental health care interventions.\n\nThe EU-GEI website is up and running, providing both information for the general public and patients as well as a web-based training package available for researchers in the centres that are participating in the clinical study under the project.\n\nA fully functional database has been established that handles the large quantities of incoming data from the large EU-GEI cohorts that will provide the largest set of data available on genetic, environmental, behavioural and clinical variables in psychosis, in particular schizophrenia. DNA samples collected under the EU-GEI study are all genotyped in the project's centralised genotyping facilities, and a large number of subjects have already been genetically analysed.\n\nApproaches for statistical analyses of the complex EU-GEI data sets have been developed and are currently in use.

First explorations have already provided replicated evidence that the impact of cannabis use on psychosis is moderated in people that carry a specific variant of the AKT1 gene.\n\nConsiderable progress has been made in discovering genetic variants that increase risk for schizophrenia. Moreover, functional neuroimaging studies have discovered correlates of environmental exposures in the brain.\n\nThe prime clinical relevance of the EU-GEI project will be the establishment of risk assessment charts based on genetic, environmental, behavioural and clinical variables.

The proposal involves both materials preparation and drug loading/releasing processes. The DDNDs will be made in three steps. Firstly, magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared. Then a decomposable FeOOH shell will be coated on the NPs. Finally, the above core-shell structures will again be coated by a layer of mesoporous silica forming core-double shell structure. The DDNDs with increased hollow volume will be obtained by the decomposition of the FeOOH inner shell. Thereafter, the drug loading and releasing will be done in two separated steps where the release can be triggered by a stimulus input, e.g. sharp pH change. All structures/devices obtained from these steps will be thoroughly characterised. The evaluation on the delivery efficiency and improvement on the fabrication process parameters will be made according to the characterisation results. In particular, the \u2018zero-release\u2019 before the stimuli input, the load maximization per DDND and the sustainability of the release once triggered will be the main aims to be achieved in the project. As fulfilled, all pre-set training objectives will be realised by the knowledge and competencies gained in the project and will definitely benefit to the candidate career development and mobility among the European Research Area.'", 175046.0, 175046.0, "CAMLC10", "Nanodevices for drug delivery", "Targeted and controlled drug release is particularly desirable for treating diseases like cancer and thrombosis (blood clots). Researchers demonstrated the use of functionalised nanoparticles (NPs) in a controlled drug-delivery nanodevice.", "An effective drug-delivery nanodevice requires that NPs be site-specific and stimuli-responsive with good drug-loading capacity, controlled drug-release capability, biodegradability and biocompatibility. Under an EU-funded initiative, the CAMLC10 project, a drug-delivery nanodevice was developed with large drug-loading capacity and controlled release capability. \n\nTo begin with, bare magnetite (Fe3O4) NPs with strong paramagnetic properties were first synthesised to ensure remote triggering capability using an external magnetic field. The Fe3O4 NPs were then coated with substances like cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, oleic acid and iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) to endow hydrophilicity. \n\nCoating with mesoporous (pore size 2\u201350\u00a0nanometres) silica (SiO2) will ensure uniform pore diameter, large surface area, high stability and ability to be functionalised. Outer coating with mesoporous SiO2 was achieved using a sol-gel process. \n\nThe SiO2-Fe3O4 NPs with decomposable inner shell of FeOOH were functionalised using either a double-layer\u2013structured ligand configuration or a covalently grafted ligand configuration. Such NPs can then be endowed with high specificity to the target site by grafting selected nanocomponents such as ligands, surfactants or peptides.\n\nProject work also involved several studies to assess performance of the NPs in terms of drug-holding capacity and controlled release. For testing purposes, the drug gentamicin sulphate was loaded into these nanodevices and drug release was assessed by varying relevant parameters. The parameters changed included pH, pore sealing and stirring speed. Pore sealing is an important attribute as it ensures that the drug remains inside the NPs during transport to the target site.\n\nBiocompatibility is a major safety concern where clinical application is a consideration. In\u00a0vitro cytotoxicity tests were also conducted. The naked NPs showed minimal cytotoxicity whereas the functionalised NPs showed varying levels of toxicity depending on their size and configuration. \n\nCAMLC10 outcomes have laid the foundation for clinical application of mesoporous SiO2 hybrid NP-based nanodevices in drug delivery. However, further research and testing is necessary to ensure biocompatibility, safety and efficacy. Besides cancer therapy, mesoporous SiO2 NPs could also find applications in catalysis, chemical separations, implants, thrombolysis and more.", null, "http://www.cam.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/146974.jpg", "fp7_98921_999977172"], ["1TS", "Development of a Strategic Research and Innovation Roadmap for Future Architectures and Services for Manufacturing in Europe and Derivation of Business Opportunities", "Ifm Education and Consultancy Services", "In the global economy, European manufacturers face increased competitive pressure and continuous innovation is required to remain competitive.

However, to exploit this potential, a method for direct conversion of spin information into an electric signal is indispensable. Spin-charge conversion in inorganic semiconductors and metals has mainly relied on the spin-orbit interaction, a fundamental relativistic effect which couples the motion of electrons to their spins. The spin-orbit interaction causes a flow of spins, a spin current, to induce an electric field perpendicular to both the spin polarization and the flow direction of the spin current. This is called the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). We have very recently been able to observe for the first time the inverse spin-Hall effect in an organic conductor. This breakthrough raises important questions for our understanding of spin-charge conversion in materials with intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling.

Combined behavioural and functional imaging studies in healthy older adults demonstrated their ability to control motor cortex activation using imaging feedback. Training enabled participants to either associate or dissociate activation, a manipulation that induced plasticity of cortical white matter.\n\nUnderstanding the brain's mechanisms and modulation of plasticity in health and disease or trauma will facilitate early diagnosis and improved prognosis.

One feature of anhydrobiotic organisms is the production of many examples of highly hydrophilic proteins (or  hydrophilins ) in preparation for severe dehydration. Although data are limited, these hydrophilins are suggested to fulfil various roles in preserving homeostasis of the desiccating cell, including the maintenance of protein, nucleic acid and membrane structure.

The loss can be gradual, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, rapid as in stroke, or intermediate as in the delayed neuronal loss after stroke. Following damage, the nervous system is able partially to compensate through the formation of alternative connections and pathways, a process known as plasticity. Adults are therefore able to regain considerable function after stroke, and to compensate for the synapse and cell loss of Alzheimer\u2019s disease until it reaches a critical level. Children undergo a period of enhanced plasticity in most parts of the CNS at the end of development, known as critical periods. During these periods their ability to compensate for damage to the CNS is in many cases much greater than in adults. The overall concept behind this application is that restoration of the function in neurodegeneration can be achieved through plasticity (the formation of new functional connections, withdrawal of inappropriate connections, modulation of synaptic strength). Promoting increased plasticity in selected parts of the adult nervous system back to the level seen in children is a powerful method of enhancing recovery of function in animal models. Plasticity-promoting treatments could therefore be beneficial in a wide range of conditions that damage the CNS.

It is crucial to be able to quantify the contribution of volcanogenic gases to the atmosphere so that the global atmospheric effects of a major eruption can be predicted and so that volcanogenic effects can be discriminated from anthropogenic emissions. At the scale of one volcano, monitoring of gas plumes is a major tool in volcanic risk management. Volcanologists have long measured gas composition and fluxes between and during eruptions and often noted a decoupling between degassing flux and magmatic flux. In parallel, experimental petrologists are now able to calculate the gas composition that is in equilibrium with the magma at depth. However, when the calculated gas composition is compared to that measured at the surface, a general disagreement arises. As a result, it is currently impossible to determine whether a plume is generated in response to passive degassing or to magma ascent. This is a serious drawback as these processes have opposite implications for volcanic activity. Such difficulties are mainly due to the fact that the interplay between degassing mechanisms and gas chemistry has not been addressed. To improve the application of volcanic gas analyses to understanding global geochemical budgets and for the mitigation of volcanic risk, we propose to link deep magmatic processes and surface emissions. Our objective is to model the quantity and composition of volcanic gases as a function of the petrology of the magma at depth and the eruptive regime, and compare those calculations with new measures of plumes at active volcanoes. We will achieve this by modeling the chemical kinetics of degassing in volcanic conduits by using a combination of experimental, field, and numerical approaches.

Failure in mitochondrial homeostasis is strongly linked to age-related conditions such as neurodegeneration.\nThis subject has garnered intense interest recently with emergence that two genes linked to Parkinson's disease, PINK1 and parkin, regulate the autophagic degradation of mitochondria (mitophagy).

The most appealing hypothesis is the one of oxidation-mediated oligomerization of AS, causing the formation of highly toxic early amyloidogenic species.

No direct samples can be taken of the core and our knowledge of the thermal and compositional state of the Earth's outer and inner core relies on seismology.

In condensed matter physics complex behaviour arises from the interaction of a large number of basic degrees of freedom. It is fascinating to uncover the richness of this behaviour, and to understand the universal principles that organise the physical world. One of the established principles is the Landau theory whereby states of matter are classified according to their broken symmetries. In recent years distinct ways were uncovered showing how this description can break down. During my Fellowship I will focus on condensed matter systems out of equilibrium beyond the Landau paradigm in regimes in which the laws of quantum mechanics are important. A burst of experimental advances has triggered a lot of activity in the field. Exciting developments come from pump-probe spectroscopy in correlated materials. In addition, progress in cold atomic gases offers the possibility of studying isolated quantum systems far from equilibrium and of engineering topological quantum states long searched for.

In particular, the mother becomes less reactive to insulin, leading to increased glucose availability to the fetus in late pregnancy. These adaptations are thought to be signaled, in part by changes in placental hormone production. Whilst studies have shown that the placenta has the capacity to produce different hormones, their specific role in adapting maternal metabolism during pregnancy relies principally on association studies. Moreover, there are likely to be more protein mediators secreted by the placenta with systemic actions in the mother. Failure to adjust the mother's body to the pregnant state may result in pregnancy complications, including abnormal birth weight and maternal diabetes, which can further lead to a range of medical complications for the mother and baby. The overall goal of this study will be to identify the nature and wider biological significance of placental endocrine function in adapting the mother's body during pregnancy to support fetal growth, with a focus on maternal metabolism.

Topics we will study within NANOTRANS are at the core of modern technology (i.e. active design of \u201csmart\u201d nanomaterials, nanofluidic and \u201clab on a chip\u201d devices, sustainable nanocompounds, energy storage, contaminants dissemination in environment, oil recovery, drug delivery and disease treatment). \nThe main objective of the ITN network is to train students. We will offer a balanced and timely supradisciplinary research training program providing a range of skills in various scientific and technological disciplines and fostering creativity and entrepreneurial mindset. Both, private and academic sectors are strongly represented in the network and will substantially contribute to the NANOTRANS training program, which will offer the participating fellows unparalleled education unavailable in standard academic programs at Universities, as well as excellent career opportunities both in academia and industry. \nNANOTRANS research will result in improved fundamental understanding of soft matter systems out of equilibrium, novel experimental and theoretical methods for nanoscale exploration, as well as in designing advanced aterials, products and applications. In turn, it will contribute to issues connected to energy production and storage, sustainable development, and novel disease treatment strategies.

The benefit of using TCO is that a decision maker could be incentivised to go beyond the consideration of capital expenditure, and think of the potential whole-life cost arising through the use of their assets. In this regard, TCO helps achieving a cost-efficient life cycle management of the assets owned by the company. But TCO models are still poorly practiced in industry, in spite of their advantages. Further on, the flavour of the day in the industrial and academic world is to encourage innovative thinking to extract the maximum value from the assets, instead of thinking only about cost. Value can be tangible or intangible, and is determined by the organization and its stakeholders, thus TVO extends cost-based decisions.

Currently used neural probes often fail in chronic evaluations (>1 year); the stiffness and chemistry of probes induce inflammation, neuronal death, and fibrous capsule formation. When examining a neural probe, the vast majority of the surface area is comprised of the encapsulation material; an insulating polymer that shields electronics from tissue.

Furthermore, adherence of proteins and cells to insulation promotes the immune response against the probe. Therefore, introducing an effective barrier between insulation and tissue is a highly promising approach for improving probe biocompatibility and performance. In this proposal, the approach is to use water-immiscible liquids anchored to the surface by a gel to shield neural probes from surrounding tissue.

In the proposed research, we will use a novel brain stimulation technique, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to selectively alter neural oscillations. By manipulating neural phase entrainment to speech with tACS we can, for the first time, provide decisive evidence concerning whether phase entrainment and speech comprehension are causally linked: If a modulation of phase entrainment leads to changes in speech perception and comprehension we can conclude that the former causally influences the latter. In a preliminary experiment, combining tACS with functional magnetic imaging (fMRI), we will determine the optimal tACS electrode montage to modulate neural activity in speech-specific brain regions (in the superior temporal gyrus). Using this setup in a behavioural task, tACS can be applied at different phase-lags in relation to rhythmic speech sequences.

With a specific focus on screening/early detection of cancer, this project will map industry dynamics, technological trajectories and regulatory developments in Europe and the USA from 1996 to the present day. Combining quantitative and qualitative methods, the project\u2019s innovative dimensions include a new conceptual model of socio-technical transition in the diagnostics sector, and the first integrative analysis linking scientometric data on the interactions between public and private actors in the diagnostic research domain with comparative transnational analysis of regulatory decision-making. Through a novel integration of conceptual insights from the literature on biomedicalisation and scholarship on socio-technical regime change, this project aims to advance both fields of research by applying a new multi-scale, multi-level model of socio-technical transition.

While many bacteria have only one flagellum, most well-studied pathogenic bacteria possess multiple flagella. Why have some bacteria evolved to use many flagella when others survive with one? In order to answer this question, one needs to understand quantitatively how multiple flagella provide a fitness advantage to a cell exploring its environment. The principal difficulty in deriving rigorous models for swimming bacteria lies in the {nonlinear} nature of the underlying external physics, which involves nonlocal hydrodynamic interactions between flagella, short-range steric and electrostatic interactions, and elastic deformations of the flagella, which not only bend and twist but also undergo conformational changes. In this project, we will develop novel experimentally-testable theoretical modeling of the configurations and regimes relevant to swimming bacteria with multiple flagella with a focus on the mechanical forces at play. As a fundamental departure with past work, we will seek to exploit the slenderness and relative proximity of the flagella to incorporate all nonlocal hydrodynamic interactions between flagella analytically and to simplify the determination of elastic stresses. This will allow us, in turn, to determine precisely the distribution of flagellar forces and derive a predictive framework for the stochastic behavior of swimming cells.

We propose the following multi-prong approach, which addresses all main shortcoming of currently available 2-to-2 NNLO results: First, create a library of partonic events for the processes with top quarks and jets. A user-friendly interface will allow direct analysis by the user. Such a system would be novel, especially at NNLO, and once operational could be extended to any 2-to-2 NNLO process. Second, develop matching of NNLO calculations for processes with coloured partons to parton showers. This is an outstanding problem, which naturally fits the existing fixed order/shower expertise in the Cavendish. Its solution will unleash the potential of NNLO calculations and will make them truly useful for experimental analyses. Third, work on specific phenomenological analyses that make use, and promote, the precision results developed by the group. Last but not least, pursue novel techniques for computing 2-to-3 two-loop amplitudes, which is the bottleneck for advancing beyond the current frontier in LHC processes; use this to compute the 3 jet NNLO cross-section at the LHC.

In this project, I propose to quantify the extent of local adaptation in Anatomically Modern Humans by using climate-informed spatial genetic models (CISGeM) to reconstruct past population sizes, local movements, and range expansions, and thus provide a null model against which the signature of geographically-localised selection can be detected.\nIn CISGeM, demography is affected by local resource availability, which in turn is defined by paleoclimate and paleovegetation reconstructions. By using these additional lines of evidence, it is possible to generate accurate demographic reconstructions for any number of populations, as well as integrating information from both modern and ancient genomes. Such spatially-explicit reconstructions are key for defining the expected neutral patterns due to complex demography, and thus allow us to isolate the signals of selection from this noisy background with high fidelity. The availability of paleoclimate reconstructions also enables formally testing hypotheses about the drivers of selection, integrating the changes in the strength of selection through space and time.\nWhile this project will be focused on Anatomically Modern Humans, the framework that I will develop will be applicable to the investigation of local adaptation from genomic data in any species.

Rising levels of misfolded prion protein cause sustained over-activation of the PERK-eIF2\u03b1 branch of the UPR in neurons resulting in an uncompensated decline in global translation rates, synaptic failure and neuronal death.

The main expected results are: 1) a better understanding of the physical processes involved in the propagation of DSWC flows, 2) a quantification of their capacity to erode and deposit sediment, and 3) a characterization of the sensitivity of DSWC formation and distribution to climate change in Polar Regions. The host institution expertise on the links between ice sheet dynamics, climate change and marine geological records will be crucial for the training of the applicant and for the success of the project.

Beyond immune modulation, many viral proteins interact with components of the cellular proteome to enable viral replication.

Then, the new models will describe the roles of precipitates on DRX (by acting as nucleation sites for the formation of new grains, or at the opposite by acting as pinning centres for grain boundaries, limiting their mobility and hence retarding or inhibiting DRX), and on RHE (by influencing, among others, the distribution of hydrogen between the matrix, the precipitates, the grain boundaries and the precipitate-matrix interfaces).

They are contracted for various studying programmes such as 5-year  Slovak-English bilingual programme, 4-year national programme,  and 8-year national programme, all of which end in national school leaving examination on C1 level.\r\nThe main activity involves further professional development on the following courses:\r\n-Language Development and Britain Today:  this course develops linguistic skills and intercultural awareness, including vocabulary development, conversation and listening skills, pronunciation improvement and grammar.\r\n- Bringing British Culture to Life: This course focuses on improving the knowledge of British language and culture. \r\n- Focus on Scotland  and  Focus on Ireland: attendants of these courses will gain plenty of new teaching ideas and motivational material ready for class usage. The main focus will be on how to motivate students with creative activities. These courses include Scottish and Irish history and tradition, literature and education as well as Edinburgh and Dublin sightseeing tours. \r\nWhen carrying out the project we made a detailed analysis of the school\u2019s needs, then we chose the appropriate courses meeting the school\u2019s needs. After the arrival we will carry out the second implementation phase which means applying new knowledge and skills into the teaching process, updating the syllabus and creating new school leaving assessment sheets. New knowledge and skills will be shared in the form of in-school presentations and lectures. \r\nThe selected courses will improve the language skills of the appointed teachers, will make the organising and methodical leadership of the students more efficient, improve and update the teacher\u2019s knowledge of the language, culture and life in the UK. These courses will enable the teachers to get in touch with colleagues from other countries, thus extending the knowledge acquired on the courses. \r\nLong term benefits of the project will bring about improvement of the teaching process quality of the course attendants as well as other teaching staff, improvement of the syllabus and new school-leaving assessment sheets for C1 level. This will lead to better student motivation to learn English language and become successful in the learning process as well as in the European labour market. The acquired knowledge will be shared within the school community in the form of lectures and in-school workshops.

Thus, from the wide spectrum of identified needs, our school project intends to approach two strategic priorities: the necessity of implementing a long-term policy plan on internationalization and the need to promote innovation and quality in education through the alternative way of exploiting the high potential of digital technology in the didactic process to ensure that tomorrow\u2019s European pupils are highly competitive in the digital world. These two essential directions circumscribe the following main areas for improvement: European dimension, staff competences (language, digital, management competences) new teaching methods or tools, curriculum. Based on the previous needs, we have outlined the European Development Plan which includes six European mobility projects within four professional development courses.\r\nWith regard to enhancing international cooperation, we have chosen two courses \"How to make your school more international ? \" proposed by Euneos ,  How to become a teacher trainer \" , by Cambridge Bell.\r\nSpecifically, \"How to make your school more international \" Euneos clearly meets the need for development and integration of the international dimension in the curriculum, by creating both tangible results ( drafts of international development plan, concluding (bi)multilateral partnerships) as well as development of key competences of a good international coordinator, able to develop a  school vision and long-term policy plan on internationalisation. \r\nThe course \"How to become a teacher trainer\" organized by Bell Cambridge, with a world-wide reputation in the academic excellence, addresses our school\u2019s need of a highly-qualified English teacher trainer able to design, implement and run 20 bimonthly workshops throughout the year to facilitate linguistic preparation for our colleagues keen to develop and involve in international partnership projects.\r\nGiven that technology plays a vital role in today's society and students are incredibly receptive to digital technology, it becomes imperative to adapt ourselves to and adopt the new technologies in education. Therefore, the course \" How to use tablets in education\" meets our school\u2019s needs to specialize two teachers from different subject areas in digital education, to acquire the didactic and digital competences needed to successfully implement by 2016 pilot projects of tablet use  in students\u2019 learning program to facilitate the transition to digital education. Moreover, we need to learn from and be inspired by the efficiency of Finnish educational system by sending two teachers (at least one person from the Board members) to attend  Best Practices Benchmarking in order to improve both our school management and to set up a qualified team of promoters of innovation in the school responsible with improving the quality of teaching and learning through the development of innovative digital learning methods and tools ( blended learning, flipped classroom ) .\r\nIn conclusion, the six European mobilities for teacher training proposed within our school project are appropriate to achieve the two strategic objectives for institutional development. Moreover, once these strategic priorities are achieved, they trigger a major impact both on organizational level, as well as on individual beneficiaries and local community level.\r\n At macro - institutional level, the short and medium-term impact is visible in the following concrete outcomes :\r\n\u2022 workshop at school level based on planning, implementing and evaluating European partnership projects\r\n\u2022 at least one multilateral strategic partnership project grant \r\n\u2022 training course materials for the workshop English for International Cooperation Project\r\n\u2022 bimonthly workshops throughout one year to develop English language competences of staff willing to participate in future international projects\r\n\u2022 a guide for parents and teachers on How to use tablets in classroom (advantages / impact of using tablet applications in learning)\r\n\u2022 trainings for school staff on the use of tablets in teaching and learning\r\n\u2022 teacher\u2019s portfolio of digital resources with lesson plans integrating technology (plus a DVD with interactive lessons )\r\nThe long-term  impact is quantified by defining and successfully implementing :\r\n\u2022 a policy, strategy and vision of the school to promote international dimension and innovative methods in curriculum\r\n\u2022 pilot-projects based on the use of tablets in classroom to facilitate the transition to digital learning\r\n\u2022 a more international and innovative oriented curriculum ( how students learn Finnish ) by integrating  iPad applications in lessons", "http://www.bellenglish.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-RO01-KA101-001218_2"], ["1TN", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "THE CHANCELLOR, MASTERS AND SCHOLARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE", 491175.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.cam.ac.uk", "THE CHANCELLOR, MASTERS AND SCHOLARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000450_coordinator"], ["0QU", "\u201eNARROW THE GAP.

The volunteers will be given lots of support by people in their local communities as well as Time For God, and will be able to develop their skills and improve their knowledge as well as benefitting the local communities. \r\nTime For God has built strong partnerships with organisations in the sending countries (Germany, Hungary, Italy, Sweden, Slovakia and Poland) who will help to recruit the volunteers and prepare them for the experience, as welll as supporting them during the project. \r\nThe project is designed to meet the following objectives:   \r\n-  Challenge young people to become actively involved in society by \u2018being there\u2019 and caring for others, especially those on the edge of society\r\n- Give the volunteer new skills and work experience through volunteering\r\n- Develop the volunteer\u2019s capacity to work, and/or live in, groups/teams\r\n- Get to know the British culture, people and language \u2018from the inside\u2019\r\n- Promote intercultural dialogue between young people (in the volunteer group, but also in the local community of which the volunteer is part)\r\n- Challenge the volunteer to reflect critically on his/her spirituality and be open to other religions & ways of life \r\n- Benefit the Receiving Organisation with the enthusiasm and cross cultural experience of a volunteer, who is able to augment the work of paid staff members with energy, new perspectives and time to build relationships with the community/ client group being served. \r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that this project will involve 14 volunteers, who will have a range of socio-economic backgrounds. In particular Time For God will encourage participation from volunteers who may otherwise struggle to access opportunities for higher education or work experience, whether this is due to geographical reasons, health problems or economic obstacles. It is hoped that the project will be accessed by an equal number of male and female volunteers. \r\n\r\nThe actual tasks that each volunteer will be involved in will vary depending on where they are based, but each placement will involve an element of service to others. At  the Cambridge URC placement, the volunteer will spend time working in a community caf\u00e9 alongside people with learning difficulties. The participants at SPEC will help with (and eventually lead) groups of children and young people at the retreat centre, encouraging them to try new activities and improving their self confidence. At the House of Light and Oakham Lodge Trust projects, participants will work in a home for adults with learning disabilties, helping them with daily tasks as well as creating new activity programmes based on the volunteers\u2019 own interests and skills. Volunteers at Wolverhampton Lea Road and Morley Community Church will be involved in a range of community activties which include working with youth groups, visiting the elderley and reaching out to disadvantaged groups. The projects at Marylebone Church Army, Yeldall Manor and Edinburgh Bethany all involve supporting people who are vulnerable through homelessness or recovering from addictions. All volunteers willl be given comprehensive training and ongoing support and supervision to help them manage the challenges of this type of work. \r\n\r\nSeveral methods will be used to monitor the success of the project and gain feedback on the learning achieved by the participants.

The selected participants have to show their enthusiasm to learn and share with others and they have to prove their determination to cooperate. The special teacher is included to the team to help with teaching students with special educational needs.\r\nTo promote creativity in our classrooms we selected a participant who will learn how to use drama, music, storytelling and role-play in teaching.\r\nTo refresh the methodology we chose two participants (one for young and one for secondary learners) who will improve their confidence and competence in English and update their skills in the class management and practical teaching techniques. \r\nTo teach cross-cultural awareness in the classroom we've got a participant who will explore different aspects of modern British life and culture.\r\nOne of our participants  is to develop her language skills and one is to learn more about the CLIL methodology.

On behalf of the European development plan of our school it is necessary that the teachers get the needed knowledge, skills as well as high motivation to gain new teaching ways in CLIL learning, so our school is able to offer their pupils competent CLIL teaching of high quality. For the time of being our school offers the CLIL learning only at lower primary school - first through fourth graders, which means, kids from 6-10 years, but, as the interest of parents for this classes grows, our school would like to be able to go on with this modern teaching method also at upper primary school - fifth through ninth graders, pupils from 10-15 years. Referring to the need of further education of our teacher, our school has an interest to increase the linguistic and methodical competence of them.

At our school the pupils from upper primary learn German (age 11 \u2013 15).\r\nWe do not only want to increase the interest of the students for learning foreign languages we also want to bring them closer the country, English, or German and their culture. To achieve all this goals we want to use the possibility of Erasmus KA1 coursers for teacher development \u2013 for 5 lower primary and 2 upper primary school teachers from our school.\r\nFor two teachers, we plan a Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLILL) course, which is focused on developing practical skills and gaining a lot of new ideas for the work with children, improving language competences, with the opportunity to share their experiences with other teachers, establish contacts with teachers for this age group in other European countries, obtaining knowledge of the culture and life in the UK, a picture of the everyday lives of children at home and at school. The course content is CLIL methodological workshop led by experienced teachers with focus on science subjects, discussions of different approaches to CLIL in primary children education, many practical demonstrations, activities, advices and tips. This course will be held in Portsmouth 7.10.  - 15.10. 2017.\r\nFor another two lower primary teachers we plan a course named \u201cLanguage & Practical Methodology: Creativity in the Classroom\u201c, focused  on developing practical skills and gaining many new ideas for working with pupils aged 3-11 years, improving language competences, with the view to primary education in the UK, the opportunity to share their experiences, establish contacts with teachers for this age group in other European countries, obtaining knowledge of the culture and life in the UK, a picture of the everyday lives of children at home and at school.\r\nThe next course \u201cBringing British Culture to Life\u201c, is planned for one lower primary teacher together with one upper primary teacher. This course aims to improve knowledge of the language and culture in Britain, which are reflected in teaching intercultural awareness. The course will enable teachers to explore different aspects of modern life and culture in Britain; it will help to explore different ways to teach intercultural awareness as it also includes visits with commentary in major places in Cambridge.\r\nThe last course an upper primary teacher from our school would like to take part is in German language, as it is planned for a German teacher. The course \u201cMethods & Language\u201d takes place in Regensburg and informs about the current teaching trends, develops the skills for communication-oriented teaching. It also updates and enhances knowledge of the country, and gives the opportunity to establish contacts with teachers for this age group in other European countries.\r\nIn preparing the logistics ensuring of the educational stay, we will cooperate with the partner organization International Study Programmes. The participation of teachers would increase the practical skills, language self-esteem, valuable insight into trends and enthusiasm to apply them in everyday school practice. It is expected for all students to increase their motivation to learn foreign languages as well as the science subjects. Further we do hope to be able to improve their academic performance, to increase motivation and stress relief from the requirements and demands of learning both foreign languages and the science subjects.\r\nFor the school this opens the possibility for further long-term cooperation on projects of international school partnerships.
