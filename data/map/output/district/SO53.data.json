We will create a toolbox of analytical/design methods and novel treatment systems including an innovative intelligence driven sanitation control system based on a dynamic model tailorable to each installation. To achieve our objective we will develop knowledge with of the kinetics of, disinfection microbiology, DBP formation chemistry, and construct a flexible hydrodynamics modeling method of pools with these kinetics embedded. This knowledge will be translated into a radically improved treatment concept responding dynamically via optimized real-time control systems and treatment process interfaces. It will use a novel photocatalytic reactor integrated into energy recovery air conditioning to destroy airborne DBP\u2019s and a combination of on-site chlorine electrolysis, energy-efficient filtration, UV technology, air stripping, smart sensors and control technology to reduce water borne DBP\u2019s.

In order to achieve these objectives we are presenting a concept that is based on the highly innovative integration of existing technologies, development of new thermo energetic components and advance guidance and control system implementation. All components will be integrated and optimized as an autonomous unmanned power production unit in a form of new commercial product, the EFISOL. EFISOL is therefore a combination of following key innovative technologies; - half linear Fresnel lens based concentrators - PCM (phase change materials) based heat storage tanks - ORC (Organic Rankin Cycle) cogeneration unit - Advanced control system This proposed system will be suitable for various small and medium energy consumers, it will be particularly well suited to those placed in \u2018sunny areas\u2019 such as MEDITERRANEAN AREA. Various types of energy consumers e.g. hotel resorts, campsites, industrial units, housing groups and energy producer entrepreneurs are targeted users. Proposed product will be able to produce renewable electrical energy and sell it directly to the power grids or use it for internal consumption purposes. This proposal will emphasize the most relevant issues to be addressed by this project.
