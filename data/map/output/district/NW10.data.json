As such, it requires a high level of inter-disciplinary cooperation as well as collaborationbetween researchers and industrials. The outcome will be a truly novel composites manufacturing system capable of producing parts with increased accuracy, reduced cost and enhanced functionality.\n\nDiCoMI project will focus on Directional Fibre-Reinforced Polymers (FRP) materials and combined different manufacturing techniques into a unique and innovative hybrid system.

These systems are mostly used to monitor infrastructures using many types of sensors and tools and correlate the obtained events to discover possible threats (attacks, vulnerabilities, etc.) to the organization. The DiSIEM project aims to enhance existing SIEM systems with diversity-related technology. More specifically, we want to (1) enhance the quality of events collected using a diverse set of sensors and novel anomaly detectors, (2) add support for collecting infrastructure-related information from open-source intelligence data available on diverse sources from the internet, (3) create new ways for visualising the information collected in the SIEM and provide high-level security metrics and models for improving security-related decision project, and (4) allow the use of multiple storage clouds for secure long-term archival of the raw events feed to the SIEM. Given the high costs of deployment of SIEM infrastructures, all these enhancements will be developed in a SIEM-independent way, as extensions to currently available systems, and will be validated through the deployed in three large-scale production environments.", 224265.0, 3506952.0, "DiSIEM", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_202707_949722151"], ["7EW", "A test for predicting the efficacy of common platinum drugs enabling personalized chemotherapy for bladder cancer patients.", "Hammersmith Medicines Research Ltd", "Platinum-based chemotherapy is the primary therapeutic intervention for over 500,000 patients per year in the EU.

Levels of drug-DNA damage are measured by AMS in white blood cells and tumor biopsy tissue, which are used as a predictor of therapeutic response. \nWithin the innovation project Accelerated Medical Diagnoistics intend to: gain medical certification within the EU; run a scaled up clinical trial to gain significant results; and adress the EU market and launch their service in the EU.", null, 51289.0, "platinDx", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_197367_934307202"], ["2EA", "Multi-channel biometrics combining acoustic and machine vision analysis of speech, lip movement and face", "Horowitz Biometrics Limited", "The SpeechXRays project will develop and test in real-life environments a user recognition platform based on voice acoustics analysis and audio-visual identity verification.
