Among those countries was the United Kingdom and a Primary school in NewCastle. The children at the school in NewCastle are aged between 3 to 11. During a visit at the school, the idea of letting our students at the Child- and Recreation Program have practical experience among these children and teachers, started to grow.\r\nThe school is in a socio-economically deprived area. Engaged and enthusiastic teachers use interesting and instructive methods concerning teaching, special needs teaching and integration.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the project:\r\nis to let students from the Child- and Recreation Program have practical experience for two weeks in NewCastle. Totally will 8 students and a teacher realize practical experience during different periods. The students have defined tasks to execute at the school.The documentation will be carried out in form of notes, blogs, films/photos. The students will communicate with Karlfeldtgymnasiet through mail, skype and Twitter.\r\n\r\nThis is one item in the International development plan of Karlfeldtgymnasiet and to increase the mobility among the students at the Vocational Programs. The effects desired are to increase language skills among students, the status of the Vocational Programs, employment ability and to learn new pedagogical methods. Focus is to learn from the English school how they work with children from socio-economically deprived areas, integration, individual adaptions, to encounter future challenges in the community.\r\nThe project will encourage other Vocational Programs to become more interested in practical experience in other European countries and to attract more students to the Vocational Programs. This is a step to fulfil the goals that our school, the community, the nation and EU have concerning education.", "http://www.thedriveprimary.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA102-034451_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NE10"}
