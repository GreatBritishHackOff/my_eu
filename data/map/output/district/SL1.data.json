HLH is usually fatal if untreated. Even when treated, the overall survival rate is still as low as 60-70%. No drug has been formally developed for the treatment of this disease and current treatment methods require the use of drugs which have not formally been developed for this indication which have an unfavourable safety profile. The cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3) was shown to play a key pathological role in the disease. It has been demonstrated that neutralization of IFN\u03b3 with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) reverts the disease and rescues animals from death in murine models of primary HLH. In patients, evidence points towards a correlation between levels of IFN\u03b3 and disease activity. In order to target IFN\u03b3 in patients with HLH, NovImmune generated and characterized a fully human mAb, NI-0501, that neutralizes the biological activity of human IFN\u03b3. This consortium proposes an adaptive clinical trial with a pilot and a pivotal phase to provide the necessary data for Market Access Authorization for NI-0501 in HLH. The pilot phase will enroll only patients well-known to have a primary form of HLH and who relapsed after having responded to an initial treatment while the pivotal phase will open the recruitment to newly diagnosed HLH patients. The transition between the pilot and the pivotal phase will be governed by strict pre-defined transition rules and will only occur if a favorable benefit-risk profile has been demonstrated. During the course of the pilot phase the consortium will attempt to generate the necessary information to justify the inclusion in the pivotal phase of a broad range of HLH patient (secondary forms of the disease), for which the pivotal role of IFN\u03b3 will have been demonstrated thanks to the research activities of members of the consortium.", 160412.0, 9052400.0, "FIGHT-HLH", "Novel therapy for a rare blood disease", "European scientists are in the process of developing new therapy for a rare haematological disorder.", "Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare condition characterised by an increased proliferation of immune cells, which leads to inflammation. It can be caused by a genetic defect or could emerge as a co-morbidity following infection, rheumatic disease or malignancy.\n\nIf not promptly treated, HLH can prove fatal. There is no drug approved for the treatment of HLH, only recommendations for its management. The usual strategy entails an induction therapy (steroid, chemotherapeutic and immune therapy) followed by haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Even then, the survival rate of HLH patients does not exceed 50\u00a0%, clearly indicating the urgent need for alternative regimens.\n\nWith this in mind, scientists on the EU-funded 'First targeted therapy to fight hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH): A novel approach to HLH' (FIGHT-HLH) project propose to target IFN-gamma as a treatment modality for HLH. The rationale is based on a growing body of evidence that suggests a pivotal role of IFN-gamma in the development of HLH.\n\nIn the pre-clinical model of the disease, administration of anti-IFN-gamma antibodies reduces the clinical symptoms and improves overall survival. Combined with the high circulating IFN-gamma levels observed in patients with primary HLH, this information strengthens the neutralisation of IFN-gamma as a more specific treatment. Observational studies in patients with Rheuma HLH indicate that this secondary form of HLH shares key pathogenic mechanisms with primary HLH, including defective cytotoxicity and increased levels of IFN-gamma and other chemokines.\n\nAs a result, the aim of the FIGHT-HLH initiative is to develop an anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibody and validate it as a therapy for primary and secondary HLH. For this purpose, the consortium is recruiting patients at 14 sites in 5 European countries and in the United States.\n\nThe antibody has received orphan drug designation and the ongoing clinical studies will test its efficacy as a therapeutic approach to treating HLH.

As LRUG sensors detect all significant corrosion in oil and gas pipelines within typically 50 metre of the sensors in a few milliseconds, long lengths of pipe can be scanned very rapidly with sample wave echo patterns obtained only every 50 metres thereby data storage requirements will be orders of magnitude less than present inspection methods. The speed of travel through the pipe could thus be faster than pigs that gather data with ultrasonic compression probes.\n\nTo test the technology developed by the project, the LRUG collar will be deployed initially by a mechanism to pull the collar through a pipe full of water at different constant and also varying speeds.\n\nA prototype robot will be developed that is intrinsically safe for operation in explosive environments and that is lightweight (neutrally buoyant) to investigate how best to deploy the LRUG technology in a real pipeline with faster travel and cheaper robots.", 79302.0, 855176.0, "PIGWAVES", "Pigs for unpiggable pipes", "Underground pipes are one of the most efficient ways to move fluids long distances, but they are difficult to inspect.

Scientists are developing pigs sporting long-range ultrasonic testing (LRUT) technology exploiting guided waves. They will conduct faster, cheaper and more accurate total-volume inspection in pipe segments of about 50\u00a0m in length.\n\nEvery 50\u00a0m, the robot will expand a probe collar and lock itself to the pipe. The collar will utilise the LRUT technology to map the circumferential and axial pipe corrosion and cracks. It will be able to inspect 50\u00a0m in a few milliseconds and reduce the amount of data stored by several orders of magnitude. The robotic pig will demonstrate one more step in its evolution: the ability to swim. In addition to freely floating around sharp bends and past debris, it will be able to swim if there is no current flow in the pipes.\n\nTeam members have developed all system specifications and inspection procedures and completed the majority of designs. When it is finished, the tool will be applicable to previously non-piggable as well as to piggable pipes, greatly expanding utility.\n\nThe PIGWAVES robotic pig is thus expected to have major impact on the safety of EU pipeline infrastructure and the security of the products it carries.
