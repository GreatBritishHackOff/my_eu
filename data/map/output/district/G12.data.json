Antivirals are available for treatment of influenza, however drug-resistant viruses often emerge. Thus, there is urgent need to develop new antivirals with lower chances of selecting resistance. As viruses rely extensively on cellular functions, one way to minimise resistance is to target new antivirals against host factors. This concept requires a fundamental understanding of mechanisms underpinning the interplay between influenza viruses and their hosts.\n\nIn this project, we will investigate the role that host SUMO pathways play during influenza virus replication. SUMO proteins are important regulators of cell signalling, and are covalently linked to other proteins in order to alter structure, localization or function. As such, SUMO conjugation regulates many diverse aspects of biology. Our own work shows that global cellular SUMOylation increases during influenza virus infection, and that virus replication is severely impaired when cells are depleted of key enzymes and components required for general SUMO conjugation. Here, we will determine what viral components trigger SUMOylation, and which specific cellular enzymes are involved. We will characterize where in the cell SUMO conjugates accumulate, and for the first time apply large-scale affinity-based quantitative proteomics to the identification of proteins that become SUMO modified during infection. A key aim will be to correlate changes to the SUMO sub-proteome with the function of specific host SUMO-modifying enzymes, thereby establishing the mechanistic role of these modifications during virus replication.\n\nUnderstanding basic mechanisms underlying SUMOylation during influenza virus infection will provide new insights into the fundamental biology of these important pathogens.

The aim is to predict treatment response thereby improving the use of current AEDs and also identifying new therapy targets. Partners focused on the impact of the AEDs most commonly prescribed in the EU and those that incur huge healthcare costs.\n\nDuring the initial phase of the project, scientists extracted data from over 5,000 clinical cases and genotyped nearly 8,000 samples. Genome-wide association studies for broad drug resistance and AED adverse reactions is also ongoing. Exome sequencing will also offer information on rare genetic variation that may influence AED treatment.\n\nCollective analysis of these datasets should provide pharmacogenomic guidance to avoid serious adverse effects and help clinicians select the best-tolerated AEDs. Special emphasis will also be given on identifying biomarkers of teratogenesis that are associated with the use of the drug valproate in pregnancy.\n\nFurthermore, the consortium is interested in developing an in silico method to predict the best treatments and outcomes for individual patients. This platform is anticipated to attract great interest from the industry.\n\nOverall, the identification of biomarkers that can predict the pattern of response to AEDs will be of high clinical importance for people with newly-diagnosed and chronic epilepsy.

Seaplanes can be defined as fixed-wing aircraft capable of taking off and landing on water, whereas amphibian aircraft are seaplanes that can also take off and land on airfields.\n\nResearchers identified four main challenges to the increased use of seaplanes. The first was that the aircraft operate in two different areas \u2013 air and water \u2013 and that the approval of different public bodies, including aviation, naval, police and local authorities, are required for establishing an airline. This could be a lengthy and costly process for prospective seaplane operators.

As a result, pilots need to be recruited from outside the EU, requiring work visas and validation of licences.\n\nExisting commuter seaplanes were designed 30 to 40 years ago and do not comply with the cost, emission and performance requirements of modern aircraft. The project examined possible modifications to modern aircraft and the concept of a new boat-plane; however, these would require new infrastructure that must first be assessed for environmental impact. The final and most critical issue was profitability and the opening up of new markets in the face of other modes of transport, such as ferries.\n\nFusetra identified a large number of potential locations for seaports, which could provide jobs and drive regional economic development.

Unsaturated soils also occur in manmade structures that are built by compacted earth such as embankments, gravity dams, barriers for underground nuclear waste repositories and flood defences. The engineering properties of unsaturated soils are therefore crucial to many civil engineering applications as well as to geohazards engineering (e.g. slope instabilities and landslides). The response of unsaturated soils to loading and environmental actions is crucially dependent on the mechanical anisotropy of this material.

However, albuminuria is of low specificity at early stages of disease, and of considerable biological variability, hence a poor predictor at early stages of disease. In two independent studies we have demonstrated that urinary proteomics offers the prospect of detecting nephropathy earlier in the preclinical phase, enabling targeted treatment at an earlier stage. We propose to assess the potential of this technology to identify normoalbuminuric patients at risk and to target therapy with an aldosterone receptor antagonist (spironolactone) as add-on to recommended therapy including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) according to national guidelines.

They will also reversibly employ DNA molecules as chemical information, for example to control surface-surface binding of lablets, or to program chemical sensors, not to synthesize proteins as in cells. The project builds on pioneering FET-funded work towards electronic chemical cells, taking a giant stride to cell-like microscopic autonomous chemical electronics with self-assembling electronic membranes controlling the entry and exit of chemicals.<br/>These autonomous mobile smart reactors will provide a novel form of computation that microscopically links reaction processing and chemical construction with computation, providing a radical integration of autonomous chemical experimentation. The self-assembling smart micro reactors can be programmed for molecular amplification and other chemical processing pathways, that start from complex mixtures, concentrate and purify chemicals, perform reactions in programmed cascades, sense completion, and transport and release products to defined locations. The project defines a continuous achievable path towards this ambitious goal, making use of a novel pairwise local communication strategy to overcome the limitations of current smart dust and autonomous sensor network communication.

We still know very little about what telomere loss measurable at the cellular level actually means for organismal level performance, how it is influenced by environmental factors and intergenerational maternal effects, and how telomere dynamics relate to Darwinian fitness parameters.  We lack experimental studies that track telomere loss within individuals subjected to varying environmental circumstances and relate this to organismal level outcomes for parents and offspring. I plan to address this gap in our understanding in a novel and innovative experimental programme that tests the idea that the effects of environmental stressors on senescence rates and lifespan are linked to accelerated telomere loss and that, through this route, can affect more than one generation.", 1706913.0, 1706913.0, "ECOTELO", null, null, null, null, "http://www.gla.ac.uk", null, "fp7_98411_999974165"], ["8QQ", "Interferometry beyond the Standard Quantum Limit using a Velocity Sensitive Sagnac Interferometer", "University of Glasgow", "From the very first Michelson Interferometer invented over 100 years ago to today\u2019s kilometre-scale gravitational wave detectors the sensitivity of interferometric length measurements has been improved by about 10 orders of magnitude and is now limited by the so-called Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), a manifestation of Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle. The SQL is comprised of the inevitable combination of sensing noise (photon shot noise) and back action noise (photon radiation pressure noise) when repeatedly measuring the position of a test mass. However, by measuring a different variable, i.e. the test mass velocity (speedmeter) instead of its position (position-meter), it is possible to evade back action noise. The momentum of a free test mass can be measured continuously to arbitrary accuracy without being limited by the SQL. Since a Sagnac interferometer is sensitive only to the time-dependent part of the arm-length difference it is automatically a speed meter and therefore brings measurements beyond the SQL into our reach.\n\nTheoretical analyses have shown that the speedmeter approach is the most promising track towards wide-band sub-SQL measurements. An experimental test of this technique is urgently required! Therefore, my three main objectives of this proposal are: 1) Realisation of an ultra-low noise, quantum radiation pressure dominated speedmeter test bed. 2) Experimental demonstration of back action noise supression in a Sagnac speedmeter. 3) Development of speedmeter based sub-SQL interferometery for future gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope.\n\nBy the end of this project I will have demonstrated the sub-SQL potential of the Sagnac speedmeter configuration.

In this pathway, pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family cause mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation (MOMP) leading to the release of mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins that activate caspase proteases and apoptosis. Regulation of MOMP has been intensively investigated because it represents a crucial, and potentially targetable, process that determines cell survival.\nUpon initiation, MOMP has previously been shown to occur synchronously and quickly in all mitochondria in less than ten minutes. However, using a new approach that mimics cancer cells that are primed to die, I find that the duration of MOMP can take over one hour in some cells (termed here slow MOMP). Importantly, cells that undergo slow MOMP fail to display overt signs of caspase activity and survive in the short-term, strongly indicating that caspase activity and kinetics of MOMP are tightly linked. My first objectives are to understand what controls differential MOMP kinetics and define how these regulate caspase activity and cell survival.\nFurthermore, I have recently found that some mitochondria can remain intact upon MOMP. This suggests that under normal or stressed conditions a minority of mitochondria can undergo MOMP without triggering apoptosis (termed here accidental MOMP). A second objective will be to investigate the occurrence of accidental MOMP and understand its impact upon caspase activity and cell viability. To meet both objectives I will use a variety of biochemical and cell biological methods including extensive and novel live-cell imaging techniques.\nThis project will provide new insight into how MOMP and cell survival are regulated.

Beneficial impacts will be also on Quantum Metrology.  As crucial steps towards these objectives we propose  five research lines:WP1 aims at bringing to the quantum realm the spectacular progress achieved by the introduction of frequency combs in the classical domain.WP2 aims at realizing sources of multimode spatially entangled light appropriate for paving the way to parallel quantum communication and  information processing.WP3 aims at realizing a very high-D entanglement between twin photons produced by parametric down- conversion (PDC). It focuses on the conjugate variables angle and optical angular momentum (OAM), providing a larger alphabet for QC and a more robust non-locality.WP4 explores  the non-factorable spatio-temporal X-structure of light entanglement in PDC, opening an avenue  that offers unique access to the full broad band of  PDC.WP5 exploits various forms of  multimode light-matter entanglement, to realize multi-modal light-atom quantum interfaces and a parallel quantum memory for light (quantum hologram), with resolution and memory capacity exceeding those of classical holograms.The consortium gathers an unparalleled expertise in measuring and manipulating OAM, in generating/controlling quantum effects in multi-mode PDC and in realizing light-matter quantum interfaces.", null, 3926504.0, "HIDEAS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.gla.ac.uk", null, "fp7_87675_999974165"], ["8QQ", "Host and microbial molecular dissection of pathogenesis and immunity in tuberculosis", "University of Glasgow", "Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading public health problem.

Normally, telomere shortening in the absence of sufficient telomerase leads to telomere uncapping, activation of a DNA damage response, and either replicative senescence or apoptosis. Paradoxically, however, under certain conditions (when damage response pathways are defective, eg through p53 gene mutation) unchecked telomere shortening can generate a chronic genomic instability that drives and accelerates clonal evolution and cancer progression. As a result, telomeres are dysfunctional in human cancers.

Though origins may not be conserved DNA sequences, they are defined through binding conserved replication initiator factors. In some circumstances, such as after DNA damage or origin deletion, origin-independent replication can be observed in cellular organisms and can be driven by recombination. However, origin-independent replication is not normally considered to be a genome-wide, central reaction of genome replication. Very recently, genome-wide mapping of DNA replication initiation in two species of the kinetoplastid parasite Leishmania revealed only a single locus-specific origin per chromosome.

Old arguments about the need to protect workers\u2019 interests are met with counterarguments, informed by neoclassical economics, that protective measures inhibit economic growth and increase unemployment. \nThe WorkOD project aspires to nothing less than a fundamental transformation of the discipline of labour law across the whole of Europe and beyond. Understanding the crisis to have at its heart a crisis of methodology, it aims to develop a new methodology for the study of the key legal concept of the contract for work. It aims to explain trends in the field of work organisation and working relationships and to assess the significance of particular labour market institutions to the achievement of policy goals in a way that is useful to scholars and policy-makers. And it aims to pave the way for future contributions by scholars to policy debates, so that they may influence in positive ways the identification of new economically and socially sustainable solutions to the problem of the division of responsibilities and risks between workers and those for whom they work. \nIn a marked departure from the state of the art, the project defines contracting for work as an instance of economic, social and legal behaviour, influenced in a variety of ways by the institutional context within which it proceeds. Rejecting the reframing of labour law according to a full blown market paradigm, it argues instead for the utility of sociological methods.

Consequently, the face can elicit myriad rapid social judgments (e.g. personality, emotion, group membership, age, health, social status) with significant consequences (e.g. sentencing/voting decisions, social isolation, job offers). Yet, little is known about how the complex, dynamic face transmits the myriad messages that regulate social interactions in different cultures, how these complex face signals map onto psychological processes (e.g. categorical/dimensional perception) or which signals facilitate or hinder cross-culture communication. This is largely due to fragmented research on social concepts (mental states, personality, emotions), face signals (morphology, movements, complexion) and culture, which, consequently, has overlooked a possible latent algebraic, syntactical structure to social face signals across cultures. My own work hints at such a structure. My ambitious program will unify these fragments to derive the first generative, algebraic and syntactical model of social face signals using innovative methods combining social/cultural psychology, 3D dynamic computer graphics, vision science psychophysical methods, and mathematical psychology.

The complex parasite biology requires a multifaceted approach targeting multiple life cycle stages and virulence pathways. The pathogenesis of the most deadly of human malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum, is related to the capability of infected red blood cells to sequester in deep tissues. Sequestration is critical for the completion of the red blood cell cycle because the release of parasites into the blood circulation allows recognition by surveillance macrophages and clearance in the spleen. A series of studies have since led to the understanding that sequestration of asexually replicating parasites is caused by the adherence of parasite infected red blood cells to the vascular endothelium of various tissues in the body.\n We have recently demonstrated that gametocytes, the only stage capable of transmission to the mosquito vector, develop in the extravascular environment of the human bone marrow.

The adverse effects are more than just those related to the energy/efficiency budgets; the separation could be unsteady and 3-dimensional which imposes heavy unsteady loads (including thermal loads) on the structure. An understanding of the 3-dimensionality and unsteadiness associated with strong shock-boundary layer interactions thus becomes inevitable in view of controlling them, especially at high-speed Mach numbers, particularly in the context of intakes. The objectives of the propose study are:\n1) investigate experimentally the spatio-temporal organization of a shock induced laminar/transitional separation bubble near the leading edge.\n2) study in detail, the mechanisms responsible for the unsteadiness using advanced flow diagnostic techniques.\n3) propose and demonstrate novel methods of control of the unsteady interactions. \nThe research programme will advance the frontiers of supersonic and hypersonic aerothermodynamics and propulsion and it will firmly establish a UK/European lead in research on shock-boundary layer interactions and their control.

MYC, however, is difficult to target directly, owing to its lack of enzymatic activity or obviously druggable structural features. \nAn alternative strategy is to target the biological consequences of MYC deregulation. The Murphy lab recently showed that MYC overexpressing tumour cells in culture exhibit an ectopic dependency on a little-known kinase called ARK5/NUAK1: whereas cells lacking MYC overexpression are able to withstand NUAK1 depletion or inhibition, cells with overexpressed MYC are unable to maintain energetic homeostasis in the absence of NUAK1, deplete their ATP levels, and consequently lose viability. We have therefor taken a genetic approach to examine the requirement for NUAK1 during tumour development in a genetically engineered mouse model of sporadic Beta-Catenin-driven CRC. Our preliminary results show that NUAK1 is required for CR tumour initiation and, more importantly, that NUAK1 depletion shrinks pre-existing tumours, suggesting that NUAK1 is an excellent candidate target for treatment of CRC.\nBased on these exciting preliminary data, I now propose to thoroughly evaluate NUAK1 as a target for therapy in CRC and to use a combination of proteomic, phosphor-proteomic and metabolomics analysis to determine the mechanism by which NUAK1 suppression erodes tumour cell viability.", 158682.0, 158682.0, "NuSiCC", null, null, null, null, "http://www.gla.ac.uk", null, "h2020_201302_999974165"], ["8QQ", "New commercial EUropean RICE (Oryza sativa) harbouring salt tolerance alleles to protect the rice sector against climate change and apple snail (Pomacea insularum) invasion", "University of Glasgow", "About 2/3 of the rice consumed by European citizens is produced in EU, and its productivity is affected by abiotic and biotic stresses.

One consequence has been a clear tendency toward salinization, which affects rice as one of the most salt sensitive crop in the region. Associated with changes in temperature and salinity, the biotic stress of the Apple snail species from genus Pomacea now threatens to destroy rice paddy fields eating the sown seed and the rice plantlets, representing one of the worst introduced gastropod crop pest of the recent time. It is calculated that nowadays this pest causes damages in rice fields worldwide that result into losses of tens of billions of Euros a year.

The recent elucidation of the mechanistic role of DUTs in the transfer of staphylococcal pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) by our group has revealed an entirely novel and surprising strategy involving DUTs in signalling. Namely, we have demonstrated that in addition to the 5 classical domains present in all the trimeric DUTs, staphylococcal phage-encoded DUT proteins possess an extra region (Motif VI) involved in SaPI de-repression by binding to the SaPI-encoded repressor (Stl). Although this domain is necessary, it does not suffice to induce the SaPI cycle. Unexpectedly, the strongly conserved DUT motif V is also inherently involved in mediating de-repression. Crystallographic and mutagenic analyses have demonstrated that binding to dUTP orders the C-terminal motif V of phage-encoded DUTs, potentially rendering these proteins in the conformation required for SaPI de-repression. In contrast, conversion into the apo state conformation by the hydrolysis of the bound dUTP disorders motif V and generates a protein that is unable to induce the SaPI cycle. Analogously, previous work demonstrated that the trimeric rat DUT interacts with the transcriptional factor PPAR\u03b1, an interaction that depends on an \u201cextra\u201d N-terminal motif VI present in the DUT protein and requires the C-terminal domain contribution, strongly supporting in general the mechanism involving DUTs in signalling.

State-of-the-art technologies will be used to interrogate host/parasite interactions to define key signatures of protection that can be used to inform delivery systems that will enhance immunity, while other studies will define polymorphism in current vaccine candidates to ensure derived prototypes will be fit-for-purpose across geographic scales. Fundamental, is engagement of the scientists with pharma and other stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, regulators) via many dissemination activities that will be used to obtain feedback on how the vaccines can be best deployed in the field. The output will be at least two prototypes to the point of uptake by pharma, government or philanthropic agencies, and a clear pathway to commercialisation for all prototypes studied.", 95778.0, 7459338.0, "Paragone", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_193331_949839230"], ["8QQ", "Bendable Bioplatform for Electrically stimulated Neuronal Differentiation", "University of Glasgow", "Summary of Marie Curie Proposal for H2020-MSCA-IF-2015 \n\n\u201cBendable Bioplatform for Electrically stimulated Neuronal Differentiation\u201d\n\nWith western countries aging faster, the neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, Huntington\u2019s etc. pose serious threat to quality of life, especially for people over 65 years[1]. In Europe, number of people suffering with dementia, which results from neuronal degeneration, is on the rise it is expected to be double in the next 20 Years[2]. The neuronal degeneration is irreversible[3] and currently the cell therapy for regeneration of neuron network is the only option to compensate such a loss. Recently, the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived NSC therapy has come up as an excellent opportunity in treating of neuro degenerative diseases. However, proliferation and differentiation of iPS cell population in neuronal replacement therapies poses many technical challenges such as targeted neurite differentiation to compensate desired loss with controlled differentiation[4]. Traditionally, the neuronal differentiation of iPSC is performed using several transcriptional and growth factors, which are complex, expensive and non-scalable processes[5]. For this reason, the research for a simple, robust and scalable method for generating large number of mature, differentiated neuronal cell deserves top priority. In addition, an accurate on/off system for scalable proliferation and neuronal differentiation is pivotal for the development of implantable bioelectronics circuit suitable for in vivo application. It is believed that the electrical stimulus controlled neuronal differentiation of stem cells on a soft, bendable electro conductive substrate can be suitable for bioelectronics application and also for compensating neuronal loss in the degenerative disease or injuries. This project is an ambitious endeavour in this direction. \nA bendable bioplatform will be developed for electrically stimulated neural differentiation t", 170580.0, 170580.0, "BEND", null, null, null, null, "http://www.gla.ac.uk", null, "h2020_205347_999974165"], ["8QQ", "Novel biocontrol agents for insect pests from neuroendocrinology", "University of Glasgow", "Insects are the most diverse Class of life on earth, and different insects can be essential for, or highly damaging to, agriculture, horticulture and forestry.
