The partners are ideally placed to demonstrate how to widen the bottlenecks and increase the flow of ideas and products derived from the marine microbiome towards a greater number of successes in a larger number of application areas. Despite the tremendous potential of marine biodiscovery, exploitation, particularly at a commercial scale, has been hampered by a number of constraints. These relate to access (physical and legal), genetics of the organisms, compound isolation, structure elucidation, early reliable validation of biological activity and best mechanisms of flow-through into exploitation. PharmaSea will solve these chronic bottlenecks by developing essential actions beyond the state of the art and linking them with best practice and appropriate pragmatic approaches. The robust pipeline structure established within PharmaSea will process a wide genetic basis including marine microbial strain collections held by partners and new strain collections from extreme environments (deep, cold and hot vent habitats) to produce new products with desirable characteristics for development by the SME partners in three accessible market sectors, health (infection, inflammation, CNS diseases), personal care and nutrition. The global aim of PharmaSea is to produce two compounds at larger scale and advance them to pre-clinical evaluation. To address relevant challenges in marine biodiscovery related to policy and legal issues, PharmaSea will bring together practitioners, legal experts, policy advisors/makers and other stakeholders, focusing on the feasibility of harmonising, aligning and complementing current legal frameworks with recommendations and ready to use solutions tailored to marine biodiscovery.", 263174.0, 10580037.0, "PHARMASEA", "New drugs from the ocean depths", "The world's oceans are home to more living organisms, especially microorganisms, than any other environment on the planet. However, successful exploitation of this exceptional resource has been limited, despite its enormous potential for harvesting unique biological compounds with benefits for all of humanity.", "The purpose of the project 'Increasing value and flow in the marine biodiscovery pipeline' (http://www.pharma-sea.eu/ (PHARMASEA)) is to discover new marine bacteria and novel compounds. In addition, the consortium will improve the effectiveness of the biodiscovery pipeline, thereby making bioresources attractive to industry.\n\nProject partners will achieve their aim by processing genetic material from in-house collections of microbial strains, while seeking out new strains from extreme marine environments. These will be used to develop new products for the pharmaceutical, food and nutrition, and cosmetic sectors. The main disease areas to be addressed are microbial infection, diseases of the central nervous system and inflammation.\n\nBy sampling some of the deepest parts of the ocean floor, PHARMASEA hopes to utilise microorganisms that are new to science. Deep ocean trenches are 'islands of diversity' with a unique chemistry and where evolution may have developed differently. Because so little of this extreme environment has been explored, PHARMASEA is breaking new ground.\n\nThe final goal of this exciting initiative is to produce two compounds from newly discovered microorganisms on a large scale. These compounds will be taken forward to pre-clinical evaluation for treating infection or diseases of the central nervous system. Other outputs will include a validated model biodiscovery pipeline, new chemometric tools, data mining techniques and data sets.\n\nFurthermore, PHARMASEA will develop solutions to improving access to marine bioresources in different habitats and jurisdictions, and equitable sharing of the benefits from their exploitation. A toolbox will also be created to navigate legal aspects in order to simplify and speed up the marine biodiscovery process.\n\nPHARMASEA is not just expected to have a major impact on scientific progress, it will also influence policy and enhance economic performance. It will also strengthen the competiveness of the European Research Area (ERA) by increasing technological know-how through interdisciplinary and international cooperation, thereby contributing to Europe's knowledge-based economy.
