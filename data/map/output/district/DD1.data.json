It builds on a unique, comprehensive, high-quality compound collection contributed by EFPIA Pparticipants, i.e. the Pharma Consortium Compound Collection totaling over about 300.000 compounds. Screening of these previously safeguarded corporate compound libraries against competitor\u2019s targets and targets from public sources may result in otherwise inaccessible valuable lead structures that could ultimately result in the development of novel treatment options for patients. Academic Participantsa or other eligible bodies (and Contributing Third Parties) will be invited to submit proposals for screening of innovative targets and to suggest the design of new and diverse chemical libraries utilizing novel concepts and strategies. The latter will fuel the generation of a Public Compound Collection that will combine with the Pharma ConsortiumEFPIA Compound Collection to generate the Joint European Compound CollectionLibrary. These public sector contributions will not only provide a constant flow of innovation, but also generate opportunities for future partnerships amongst public Public Participants and private contributors EFPIA Participants on scientific and commercial grounds.

Chronic bacterial pulmonary infection leading to an irreversible decline in lung structure and function is the main cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with CF, with more than 95% of deaths due to respiratory failure. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is the most frequently isolated pathogen, chronically infecting up to 80% of adult patients. When this occurs patients require lifelong inhaled antibiotic therapy, which although onerous to take, has been fundamental in increasing life expectancy by suppressing infection, reducing exacerbations and preserving lung function in CF patients chronically infected with Pa. Studies employing enhanced culture techniques and culture-independent molecular approaches have recently shown that the lungs of CF patients harbour diverse polymicrobial communities, the \u201cmicrobiome\u201d. Other Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria (GNnF), including Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and bacteria from the genera Burkholderia, Achromobacter, Acinetobacter, Ralstonia and Pandoraea may be present and contribute to disease. Moreover, Burkholderia cenocepacia is associated with rapid deterioration of lung function and poor clinical outcome.  \n\nEstimates for the prevalence of non-CF bronchiectasis (BE) range from 4 per 100 000 in young adults to nearly 300 per 100,000 in persons 75 years and older in developed countries.

There is a direct relationship between bacterial load, airway inflammation and risk of exacerbation supporting the use of long-term administration of inhaled antibiotics in BE. \n\nCurrently, a limited number of inhaled antimicrobials are available for use in CF with no antibiotics approved to treat lung infection in patients with BE. As median predicted survival of CF birth cohorts is now greater than 40 years, adherence to consensus treatment guidelines requires that chronically infected patients are treated for decades with inhaled antimicrobials.

This proposal aims to address this by studying the human protein RNF4, which sits at the interface between the UB and SUMO pathways. RNF4 is a SUMO targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) which binds poly-SUMOylated chains and ubiquitylates them. To date, very few RNF4 targets are known.

However, RNF4 depleted cells are sensitive to a wide range of DNA damaging drugs, indicating that RNF4 functions at other lesions. I will monitor RNF4-dependant ubiquitylation changes in response to ionising radiation, hydroxyurea and camptothecin; conditions that induce distinct types of DNA damage.

It will also allow me to target deubiquitinases (DUBs) to test how loss of UB impacts DNA repair. This work could reveal novel DNA repair proteins as well as those acting at specific lesions.

Moreover, dynamic changes in the SMO-1 proteome in response to ionizing radiation as well as tissue-specific SMO-1 sub-proteomes will be assessed taking advantage of the recently developed SILAN (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in nematodes) technique. In parallel, the role of SMO-1 conjugation in the DNA damage response and meiotic recombination will be addressed by genetically altering the conjugation pathway. I will also study the dynamics of specific SMO-1 conjugates after ionizing irradiation, by applying multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-mass spectrometry. The role of SMO-1 modification of selected target proteins will be addressed by generating transgenic strains carrying a sumoylation deficient allele. Overall, this project combines high accuracy mass spectrometry and the nematode C. elegans to provide insights into the biological consequences of dynamic, tissue-specific SUMO conjugation.

Unbounded by traditional research silos, subjects range from cancer and developmental biology to crop growth all unified under a modelling and quantitative sciences approach. Whilst tackling challenging problems that cut across distinct disciplines, interactions and networking opportunities with leading scientists from across the EU will be assured through a flexible schedule of secondment opportunities to leading industrial and academic organisations. A programme of symposia and workshops involving the cohort of researchers, CLS researchers and partner organisations will maximize impact to stakeholders and society at large. The strategic goals for this programme are synergistic with the CLS \u20ac30Mn Centre for Translational and Interdisciplinary Research which opened in 2014.", 1431204.0, 2862408.0, "QUANTEXBIO", null, null, null, null, "http://www.dundee.ac.uk", null, "h2020_197131_999975523"], ["4HN", "Unravelling the effect of origin number on the success of genome replication", "University of Dundee", "DNA replication must be regulated in eukaryotic cells to ensure that the genome is precisely duplicated. The process is split into two non-overlapping stages: origin \u201clicensing\u201d and origin \u201cfiring\u201d. During licensing in G1, ORC loads MCM2-7 onto DNA, and during the firing stage in S phase MCM2-7 is activated to drive replication forks. To prevent re-replication of DNA no new origins must be licensed once S phase begins. Since replication forks can irreversibly stall, it is crucial that sufficient origins are licensed before S phase entry. The \u201clicensing checkpoint\u201d prevents cells in G1 with too few licensed origins from entering S phase. A number of different MCM and ORC mutations have been identified, leading to cancer susceptibility, proliferation defects and/or developmental abnormalities. However, it is hard to explain the spectrum of defects caused by specific mutations, such as in Meier-Gorlin Syndrome. In this project, I will use genome editing to engineer iPS cells with specific mutations in MCM and ORC proteins to determine the effects on origin licensing, licensing checkpoint activation and genome stability. I will use state-of-the-art quantitative proteomics, next generation sequencing and flow cytometry to unravel the molecular mechanisms underpinning the licensing checkpoint and to define the core molecular pathways that coordinate DNA replication and the cell cycle. A comparison of the effect of ORC and MCM mutations in clinically-relevant cells derived from iPSCs and in cancer cell lines will allow me to understand cell-type specific differences in regulation of DNA replication and explain the effects of these mutations on human patients. These new results will open new possibilities to develop specific anti-cancer drugs against selected components of the licensing checkpoint system. Moreover, it will allow me to merge neurodevelopment, DNA replication, stem cell biology and cancer research, laying the foundations upon which to build my future career.", 170803.0, 170803.0, "ORI NUMBER", null, null, null, null, "http://www.dundee.ac.uk", null, "h2020_212621_999975523"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1LS", "Enterprise Support Tayside - Delivery", "Dundee City Council", "Complement and extend the scope of core Business Gateway activities across Tayside.
