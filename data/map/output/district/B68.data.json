We  offer a range of innovative and flexible day and support services to people with learning disabilities, supported by a team of paid staff and volunteers.\r\n\r\nOur organisational objectives are:\r\n\u2022 to give service users the same opportunities as non-disabled people\r\n\u2022 to promote the integration of service users into the local community\r\n\u2022 to challenge any discrimination and marginalisation faced by this disadvantaged group.  \r\n\r\nThe philosophy underpinning the entire organisation is that of inclusion, and this philosophy is fundamental to all of the activities we provide and the way in which we interact with all those who come into contact with the organisation.\r\n\r\nWe offer EVS placements of between 9 and 12 months to a maximum of 6 volunteers from any eligible country.  Volunteers taking part in this project work alongside paid staff and other volunteers to provide a varied, stimulating and interesting programme of community-based leisure and social activities for people with learning disabilities.  \r\n\r\nThe aniticiapted outcomes of the project are:\r\n\u2022 to give weight to the fight against marginalisation of disadvantaged groups of people\r\n\u2022 to promote cultural diversity and exchange\r\n\u2022 to foster a heightened sense of European citizenship amongst all parties\r\n\u2022 for the volunteers to give \u2018added value\u2019 to Options for Life\u2019s activities\r\n\u2022 for the dissemination of good practice across Europe within the social care, disability and inclusion field\r\n\u2022 to improve the employability of the volunteers, thus tackling (in a small way) the issue of youth unemployment\r\n\u2022 to develop the volunteers\u2019 personal and social skills\r\n\u2022 to develop the volunteers\u2019 independent living skills\r\n\u2022 to promote the participation of young people", "http://www.optionsforlife.info", "Options for Life", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA105-000115_coordinator"], ["8ED", "L\u00e4ra av varandra - \u00f6kad kvalitet genom jobbskuggning 2017-2019", "Our Lady and St Huberts Catholic Primary School and Teaching Alliance", 29186.0, "The Childcare and Education department of Eskilstuna Municipality in Sweden has the ambition to continuously develop and improve the quality of teaching, improve the results and give the pupils a good foundation in order for them to succeed with future education and work.    The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other in order to develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and this job shadowing project is part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe consortium consists of the Childcare and education department and five schools: Lagersbergsskolan, H\u00e5llsta skola, Fristadsskolan, Skogstorpsskolan and Djurg\u00e5rdsskolan.  During the years 2017 \u2013 2019 we are planning to send a total of 22 staff members from these schools on job shadowing activities in Birmingham (head teachers, deputy head teachers, leaders of learning, teachers of Swedish as a second language and also special pedagogy teachers).   They will spend a week at one of our partner schools within the BCPP where they will have the opportunity to learn and get valuable experience that will be used in the quality development of their own schools.  \r\n\r\nIn this project the consortium has three objectives:\r\n\u2022 We want to gain knowledge and experience that will lead to a positive development of our schools with the aim to improve the quality of teaching and improve the pupils\u2019 results.   Besides looking at teaching methods, we would like to see how the staff and the teaching are organized in order to make the most optimal use of the resources and also how different schools work with collegial learning.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Through the job shadowing activities we want to gain knowledge and experience which leads to a development of methods in order to take care of and educate pupils who have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  We want to develop their knowledge of Swedish and to maximize their learning and results in the multicultural classroom.  Eskilstuna is a multicultural city where 31% of the pupils have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 We want to improve the quality and results within special pedagogy by educating the staff in finding and developing different teaching methods and tools in the teaching of special needs pupils.  We especially want to focus on methods and tools involving ICT.\r\n\r\nAfter the job shadowing activities the school development will progress at the individual schools, based on the needs of the school, what experience and knowledge that the staff has gained and also based on the reflections of what already works well.  Collegial learning will be a different factor in this work.\r\nThe development will also be driven forward by the Development unit at the Childcare and Education department.  Here there are networks for head teachers, deputy head teachers and leaders of learning where discussions and dissemination activities will take place, in order to share the experiences that have been made during the job shadowing activities with colleagues who are not in the project.  This way, the job shadowing activities can lead to positive development at other schools as well.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the knowledge and experience which we gain from the job shadowing activities will contribute to an improved quality of teaching and better results in general, but also more specifically within the teaching of Swedish as a second language in the multicultural classroom and within special pedagogics.   We hope that this project will help give the pupils a good foundation to stand on so that they can succeed in their future education and working life.", "http://www.st-huberts.sandwell.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA101-034303_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B68"}
