This question embraces mechanisms spanning multiple levels of description, from genes to biochemical pathways, from neurons to circuits, from circuit activities to adaptive behaviours. The goal of the FLiACT programme is to train young researchers in the concepts and techniques necessary to study integrated brain functions. FLiACT will create a unique pan-European training network interconnecting 8 academic partners and 3 SMEs specialised in complementary fields of research from molecular and behavioural neurogenetics to electrophysiology, bioengineering and applied biomedicine.\n\nTo facilitate knowledge transfer across the network, FLiACT will focus on one model organism, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. During the last decades, Drosophila has become a premier system to clarify the molecular and cellular logic of perception and cognition. It has also emerged as a powerful model to study the genetic bases of neurodegenerative diseases affecting humans. The fly community can now capitalize on an unprecedented toolkit to probe the function of neural circuits in vivo and to interfere with their functions in a highly controlled manner. We aim to provide a group of neuroscientists with enough momentum to combine all these tools in a unifying framework.\n\nIn collaborative and personalised research projects, FLiACT fellows will seek to elucidate how neural circuit computation controls behaviour and how circuit-function relationships are genetically encoded. FLiACT will organise a series of interdisciplinary workshops on neurogenetics, neuroanatomy, neuroimaging and behavioural analysis and transferable skills. We will maximize the impact of our initiative by opening all workshops and conferences to the neuroscience community.

Most of these disorders act at the neuronal synapse, a cellular organelle comprising in the order of 2000 proteins. Pleiotropy, cross-talk between proteins and the complexity of the underlying signalling complexes pose a significant challenge to dissecting the molecular mechanisms of disease and to design efficient drugs. SynSys assembles leading European laboratories to provide the expertise and established research platforms that uniquely enable a systems-level analysis of synaptic signalling. The consortium features a closed loop from data integration and modelling, human genetics, physiology, proteomics and the application of engineered model systems to test model predictions. The main objectives of this project are to (i) provide a qualitative and quantitative description of the protein composition and the interactome of the mammalian glutamatergic synapse that integrates known human variation in these genes, (ii) to generate quantitative dynamic models describing the main functional features of the synaptic system, (iii) to reiterate on modeling by relating model predictions to synaptic function, (iv) to identify and validate, using appropriate model systems, human vulnerability genes that may form the basis of future therapies. Only a Systems level analysis can provide the means to describe synaptic transmission from molecule to function, its dynamics in relation to physiology and, brain function and brain disorders. As such, SynSys will establish a new platform for iterative molecular analysis of synapse function and dynamic modeling, with the perspective to generate a blueprint for discovery of novel pathways and targets that enable rational strategies to design therapies for human brain disease.", 378133.0, 11975776.0, "SYNSYS", "At the junction to brain disorder therapy", "Synapses are at the very root of nerve transmission.

An incredibly complex structure, around 2\u00a0000 proteins make up this organelle.\n\nFunded by the EU, the 'Synaptic systems: Dissecting brain function in health and disease' (http://www.synsys.eu (SYNSYS)) project aimed to investigate at a molecular level one particular type, the glutamatergic synapse. Furthermore, they aimed to generate models describing the main functional features of the synaptic system. Appropriate model systems were used to identify genes that can be targeted to develop therapies for human brain diseases.\n\nSYNSYS is three quarters through the project time and has already surpassed major research milestones. The scientists have developed a thorough description of the synaptic proteome, its complete set of proteins. The information has been linked to choice of drug targets. The http://bioinformatics.charite.de/synsys (SynSysNet database) gives details of all genes, their proteins when expressed, protein interactions (interactome), neurological diseases and drugs relevant to certain pathways. Users can construct their own 'Interactive Network' if they know protein ID and the drug they are interested in.\n\nMultiple workshops have been dedicated to the technologies used and the modelling of the interactome. It is expected that future work on the tools will benefit the analysis of the synaptic interactome.\n\nThe extensive proteome data is poised for testing of proteins in the larger groups recruited for human genetics. Already, SYNSYS has contributed to determining the role of synaptic genes in schizophrenia, the results featuring in a high-impact paper. Overall, there have been more than 100 papers published and other communication mediums include press releases, blogs and interviews.\n\nStrength of the nerve signal, or synaptic plasticity, is a crucial factor in many diseases and is controlled by many variables, including vesicle number availability and protein\u2013protein interaction. Pre- and post-synaptic plasticity are thought to be major determinants in information processing. Alterations in signalling are believed to be central to learning and memory processes in the brain.\n\nThe impact of genes or environmental stimuli on plasticity may cause disease but the reasons for this remain largely unknown. The SYNSYS systems biology approach combining modelling tools and experimental neuroscience promises to unravel the mechanisms in play. The next step will be development of targeted therapies.", "http://www.synsys.eu/", "http://www.brainwave-discovery.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20141119135953.jpg", "fp7_95503_991046091"], ["3RJ", "Miniature Insect Model for Active Learning", "Brainwave-Discovery Limited", "Biology provides the inspiration for a vision of small low-power devices that are able to learn rapidly and autonomously about environmental contingencies, enabling prediction and adaptive anticipatory action.

Current computational learning theory cannot fully account for or replicate these capacities. We aim to develop a new foundation for understanding natural learning by developing a complete multilevel model of learning in larvae.
