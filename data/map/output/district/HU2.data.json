We prioritise making our placements accessible to those with fewer opportunities and those who will benefit most from the personal and social development opportunities which the scheme offers. Selected volunteers will have the opportunity to take part in a range of humanitarian projects, which will enable them to develop their understanding and experience of active citizenship in a global world and enhance their employability skills.\r\n\r\nThe various projects included in this application are thematically linked by a common commitment to the inclusion of vulnerable groups, both at the local and community level; this focuses primarily on supporting vulnerable individuals in the community such as refugees and asylum seekers, the elderly, people with learning disabilities. \r\n \r\nIn line with Erasmus+ Programme specific objectives in the field of youth, our project aims to achieve the following:\r\n- encourage young people\u2019s active participation in society by helping them to increase their self-confidence and sense of initiative;\r\n- enhance young people\u2019s employability and career prospects, by enabling them to develop their skills in a safe, supported environment and validating these through the Youthpass framework;\r\n- facilitate opportunities for young people to develop enhanced inter-cultural dialogue. \r\n\r\nThrough a range of informal and non-formal learning activities and experiences, volunteers will be supported over the course of the placement to take an active role in society, and will also have the space for personal development, self-reflection and learning. The personal development and training opportunities available will enable participants to develop skills crucial for future training or employment, while given them the chance to be engaged as active citizens in civil society. At the local level, the participants will be directly involved with the delivery of services to vulnerable people in the community. Their contact with community groups who may otherwise have little contact with people from overseas enables the intercultural learning from the programme to spread more broadly than the participants themselves. The volunteers will also be encouraged to proactively engage the communities in which they volunteer with issues around European identity. Engaging Red Cross National Societies across Europe, the project enables collaboration at the EU level and encourages cross cultural learning and understanding.", "http://www.redcross.org.uk", "THE BRITISH RED CROSS SOCIETY ROYAL CHARTER", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-035424_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "HU2"}
