Continued strong growth is predicted. However, a growing problem is manifesting itself within the industry.\n\n\nThe submarine cables that are an essential infrastructural component of offshore energy now account for 80% of insurance claims related offshore renewables. Unfortunately, current practice is to simply lay these cables on top of the seabed without burial or protection, as the traditional tracked trenching machines originally developed for deep sea oil and gas applications are inadequate for the harsh coastal terrain. Cables are therefore exposed to numerous risks such as tidal forces, rock abrasion, snagging from fishing nets etc. Furthermore, unburied HV cables present serious environmental concerns related to local habitat & water temperature.\n\n\nExisting technologies cannot address this growing problem. HexaTerra will develop a novel solution to the problem that builds upon recent advances made in \u2018stepping\u2019 locomotion systems for traversing undulated harsh terrain. This system will provide a robust solution for its environment, by achieving the following objectives: modular design suited to existing trenching machines; mechanical movement subsystem with <5% error in desired motion tracking & <1cm in actual tracking error; control subsystem capable of negotiating \\/-0.5m 90\u00b0 step in terrain & turn on-the-spot; complete simulated locomotion cycle in under 5mins, with <5% desired motion tracking error.\n\n\nUsing this solution the project expects to comprehensively address the problem of damage to subsea energy cables, thereby maximising offshore energy reliability, maintain renewable energy affordability, & minimise the marine environmental impact of cables. In turn, we will deliver a profit of \u20ac10.95m & 100 new high skill jobs to the SME partners after 5 years.", null, 1227744.0, "HEXATERRA", "Protecting undersea power cables", "High-voltage submarine cables are necessary to transmit offshore wind energy. An EU-funded project is developing an innovative system that traverses the seabed to prevent their damage.", "Offshore wind energy and tidal energy are becoming increasingly important parts of the world clean energy mix, with Europe being at the forefront of energy market reform. However, submarine cables are the main cause of the most frequent insurance claims against offshore wind developments. Given that the conventional trenching machines originally developed for oil and gas applications cannot penetrate the seabed, current practice involves leaving submarine cables above it.\n\nThe EU-funded project http://www.hexaterra.eu/ (HEXATERRA) is designing a modular system suited to existing trenching machines that prevents failure of unburied submarine cables. Possible threats include tidal forces, rock abrasion or snagging from fishing nets.\n\nHEXATERRA's system is a bolt-on locomotion system for an underwater trenching machine that can move in all directions. The system automatically adapts to the terrain, keeping the trench cutting tool stable. Responding to sensor inputs, the machine distributes its weight evenly over the ground and seeks a support base for each of its six legs. Depending on ground irregularity, the machine operator can adjust both the machine ground clearance and the height of each step. It has exact step positioning and spot contact with the ground, with the ability to step over obstacles.\n\nThe user requirement and functional design specifications have been fundamental to the consortium understanding the needs of the underwater locomotion system and the human interface design.\n\nSignificant developments have taken place concerning the human-machine interface and the video overlay. Scientists focused on the relationship between the sensors on the remotely operated vehicle, the stepping platform and the user interface. This should help combine visual and sonar data, and develop a haptic feedback joystick.\n\nOther project tasks have been to perform simulations for investigating the system's dynamic behaviour and developing various operation scenarios.\n\nWith its activities, HEXATERRA is helping maximise the reliability of renewable energy networks. Furthermore, it minimises the adverse impact of high-voltage cables on the surrounding marine environment and prevents a rise in water temperature.", null, "http://www.aph.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/157242.jpg", "fp7_109873_952171013"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3AY", "Keeping in touch with new technologies", "Glasgow Clyde College", 50185.0, "The proposed program aims to to give students from  our school the opportunity to come in contact with new technologies that are either recently evolved or are used in other countries for some time now but not in Cyprus . The size of the Cypriot economy hinders the extensive use of such technologies.\r\n\r\nMobility A1.1 will take place  in Schotland and will concentrate on CNC technology, renewable energy production mainly in the form of wind power, and new technologies employed in the electrical installations of buildings. Participants will  be given the opportunity of visiting a college that has vast experience in these  technologies as well as educational visits to industries employing these technologies. It is proposed that 14 students will participate as well 2 accompanying teachers. \r\n\r\nMobility A1.2 and A2 will take place in Greece and will concentrate on Drywall constructions and heat insulations of buildings.\r\nMobility  It is proposed that 4 students will participate as well 1 accompanying teacher for mobility A1.2 , and 4 teachers to mobility A2 \r\n\r\n Students chosen will be from under privileged families that would otherwise never be able to participate in such a project. We believe that these students especially will gain a lot from such an opportunity and it would also increase their employment opportunities upon leaving school.\r\nThey will be able to gain expertise on the respective technologies. This undoubtedly will have a great impact since this type of technologies are vital in industry. \r\nAll students will be able to connect the theory learned at school with practice in an actual live working environment.\r\nThe main activities of the project will include the preparation of the participants both in the technological and cultural aspects of the project, the lessons taught at the hosting organisations, the work placements and visits to local  industries and finally the immersion in cultural activities/way of life in country they will visit.\r\nThe main objectives are to boost existing basic knowledge into a more fruitful or deeper understanding of new technologies and the impact that it can have on our manufacturing industry. Another objective is to make our students more employable by increasing their knowledge and skills and enabling them to seek jobs not only in their home country but also within the European community and elsewhere.\r\nOur anticipated results are that our students will realize that by using these technologies, their effectiveness, efficiency and flexibility in the employment market will be vastly improved. Students will become familiar with an actual working environment., pportunity they do not have in Cyprus.\r\nAdditionally, students will 'see' that there are more opportunities available to them than they presently believe. Their minds will be opened up to a wider world and this will ultimately motivate them to strive for a better life. They will have the opportunity to mix and experience a different culture and way of life and hopefully one of the longer term benefits is that it will produce a better 'European' feeling of integration.\r\n\r\nMobility A1.1 is expected to take place around March of 2018 in Scotland.\r\nMobility A1.2 is expected to take place around October of 2017in Greece.\r\nMobility A2 is expected to take place around August of 2018 in Greece.\r\nAs a supportive document for the dedication of all partners to the project  letters of intent have been prepared and signed by the respective partners and will be electronically attached.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the expected outcome of this project will be the greater knowledge gained by our students and staff of new  technologies used in modern industry sectors.", "http://www.glasgowclyde.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-CY01-KA102-026620_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "G52"}
