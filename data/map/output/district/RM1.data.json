It will give the opportunity to the participants to go and observe the teaching practices existing in other European countries so as to integrate them in their own teaching practices. All the participants to this project share either an interest in developing our international partnerships for those who work as teachers of a foreign language, or an interest in renewing their practices in order to adapt them to the profile of our students. It will contribute to reducing educational inequalities, often based on the difficulties of students to master foreign languages and also a difficulty to conform to a constrained school environment. The skills we will have developed during our training or job shadowing sessions will be  reused and set up in collaborative teaching projects, with the creation of pilot classes with which we will develop different teaching approaches, like the cooperative class and practices based on advances in neurosciences, but also co-teaching with English-speaking teachers. The first training session on the subject of non-formal education will take place in Rome at the end of November 2018 and the following job shadowing sessions are due to take place between January 2019 and April 2020.  Our partners are 'Enjoy Italy' in Italy, 'Colegiul Tehnic Mihai' in Romania, 'Hermann Hesse Oberschule' in Germany, 'Bower Park Academy' in the United Kingdom and  'Gimnazia Brezice' in Slovenia.", "http://www.bowerpark.havering.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA101-046608_4"]]}}, "outwardCode": "RM1"}
