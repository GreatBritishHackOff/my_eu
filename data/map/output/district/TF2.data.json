However, freezing animal and plant tissues causes many irreversible physical and chemical changes within the food matrix, often leaving the final product with lower eating quality than when it was in the fresh state. Ice crystals represent one of the key contributors to quality degradation in frozen foods. As they grow in size, they exert additional stresses on fragile cellular structures and can damage emulsions and lead to negative product characteristics such as poor appearance, unacceptable texture and physical and nutritional product damage. In short, smaller ice crystals promote a better quality product and control of the crystal size distribution in the final product is one of the most important aspects for many freezing operations.  As quality issues take increasing precedence among EU consumers, a key challenge facing frozen food manufacturers is how to reposition their products as health-friendly. Consumers not only instinctively believe that fresh food tastes better than frozen food- they also see frozen foods as cheap and inferior. In response, this project will build upon promising research in the ability of high powered ultrasound (HPU) to initiate ice nucleation and to control crystal size distribution in the frozen product during solidification of liquid food. Past research has also shown promise for HPU to shorten the freezing process and lead to a product of better quality. This project will design and develop a prototype HPU system for its industrial validation in food freezing facilities. It will be cost-effective and easy to operate and easily integrated with commercially available freezing equipment.", 95687.0, 1231921.0, "MINICRYSTAL", "Ultrasonics and better frozen foods", "Ultrasonics can modify ice crystals as food freezes. Smaller crystals mean better preservation of the food's structure, taste and quality.", "Freezing is widely used in food production industries as a means of preserving perishable foods. However, ice crystals resulting from freezing often damage food cells, resulting in lowered quality and taste, and also giving frozen food a poor reputation. The bigger the crystals, the worse the damage.\n\nHowever, this can be controlled, thanks to the EU's funding of the http://www.ttz-bremerhaven.de/en/research/food/research-projects/899-minicrystal.html (MINICRYSTAL) project. Started in 2008 and concluded in 2010, it included nine partners, three research agencies and six small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and represented five countries. High-powered ultrasound (HPU) had been shown to reduce the size of ice crystals in food during the freezing process. MINICRYSTAL aimed to develop a prototype industrial system capable of that, and which could be industrially validated, easy to operate and simply integrated with existing systems.\n\nInitial research using HPU during food freezing showed 19\u201322\u00a0% reductions in crystal size in carrots and up to 25\u00a0% in meats. The project also achieved up to 28\u00a0% reduction in 'drip loss' for the same foods. Both measures show improved retention of food microstructure and reduction in cellular damage, meaning enhanced frozen food quality. The work yielded recommendations for the ultrasound parameters to be used in the prototype system.\n\nThe prototype was constructed and consists of a treatment bath and ultrasound equipment, plus conveyor belt and software control systems. As intended, it was compatible with existing commercial systems. After construction and testing, the prototype system was installed in a plant in Bremerhaven, Germany. Thorough testing on sample foods resulted in the same outcome as for the test phase: better frozen food produced with ultrasound, especially for chicken.\n\nFurther testing remains to be done for other types of foods, but MINICRYSTAL has established its system's effectiveness. It was assessed as giving robust, safe performance with strong commercial potential. Besides the frozen products, MINICRYSTAL technology will also result in energy savings and expanded production capacity for SMEs. It should also be applicable to other industries, including biomedicine.", "http://www.minicrystal.eu/", "http://www.freshseal-limited.com", "/docs/results/images/2014-01/58225.jpg", "fp7_107628_998754196"], ["7QZ", "Novel microwave-assisted vacuum drying for heat sensitive foods", "Freshseal Limited", "'Heat sensitive foods and products that possess excellent quality in terms of taste, aroma, texture, and appearance, such as herbs, spices, seafood, etc., pose a major challenge to food driers. Products such as garlic, ginger, spring onions and shrimps are cellular tissues containing gas-filled pores that tend to collapse when subjected to dehydration. This collapse is more noticeable with prolonged exposure to elevated drying temperatures, such as those used in convective drying. For this reason, hot air drying results in substantial degradation in quality attributes such as colour, nutrients and flavour, sever shrinkage also reduces bulk density and dehydration capacity. Also, chemical changes causing loss of flavour and nutrients occur during convective drying so the properties of dehydrated products are poor. A number of drying techniques have been developed over the years, among them atmospheric forced-air dehydration, a very common method. The major disadvantage of the hot air convective drying of food is the low energy efficiency and lengthy drying time during the falling rate period.\n\nMILD-DRY will build on the positive results of laboratory trails using microwave-assisted vacuum drying (MAVD) for the successful dehydration of selected foods, whereby the drying time for carrots for example was reduced to 2 h compared with 4.5-8.5 h in convectional hot air drying. Moreover, dried carrots showed higher rehydration potential, higher beta-carotene and vitamin C contents, lower density, and softer texture than those prepared by air drying. Further research effort will be performed in order to optimise the approach through the intermittent as opposed to continuous application of MW in order to achieve higher energy savings and product quality enhancement. To bridge the gap between laboratory research and industrial application, a prototype system will be developed for its validation in commercial food drying facilities.'", 152261.0, 1241650.0, "MILD-DRY", "Providing efficient and affordable food-drying methods", "Drying heat-sensitive foods in order to produce high-quality products is a challenge.

Modern methods include heating, which can adversely affect sensitive foodstuffs unless the process is controlled very carefully. Taste, aroma, texture and appearance are all at risk.\n\nFunded by the EU, the 'Novel microwave-assisted vacuum drying for heat sensitive foods' (MILD-DRY) project delivered an alternative technology for the dehydration of heat-sensitive food. The technology combines the benefits of two effective microwave and vacuum methods, and achieves a 40\u00a0% reduction in drying time plus energy savings. The innovation results in improved quality and nutritional value of dried foods compared to conventional methods. Treated food is analysed to ensure its safety and to assess its quality and shelf life.\n\nProject members initially specified the needs of dried-food processors. Next, efforts focused on laboratory tests using the microwave-assisted vacuum drying to successfully dehydrate various fruits and vegetables. An industrial-scale prototype was developed for validation in commercial food-drying facilities.\n\nThe system design focused on positive economic returns, taking into account the start-up and maintenance costs, electricity use, ease of operation and added value.

Appearance, nutrition, texture, freshness, and spoilage are the most important quality and safety attributes of fish products. Quality inspection of fish is typically carried out manually on candling tables by human visual detection, which is very labour intensive, and many quality and safety attributes are invisible to the inspectors. It is also subjective and dependent on the experience and criteria of the inspectors. Available traditional instrumental measurements are destructive, expensive, time-consuming and inefficient. Moreover, they cannot provide spatial distribution information of desired attributes, critical for evaluating the quality and safety of fish products.\nIn this project, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology will be applied for quantitative and non-invasive measurement and visualisation of quality and safety of finfish fillets. Combining the main advantages of spectroscopy and computer vision, HSI can simultaneously acquire spectral and spatial information in one single system, enabling it to measure both external physical and morphological characteristics and internal quality attributes from a finfish product. A reliable HSI system with numerous quantitative models will be trained, established, and validated for rapid and non-invasive measurement of quality and safety attributes of finfish fillets based on the most critical image features extracted from visible and invisible (near infrared) hyperspectral images of finfish fillets and their reference attribute values, which will be measured by using traditional instruments and sensory analysis.\nThis development brings a major advance to the EU finfish industry for ensuring the safe processing of finfish products and the correct labelling of products in relation to quality, safety, authenticity and compliance.", 153865.0, 1154241.0, "SPECTRAFISH", "Fresh fish guaranteed", "An effective and non-invasive inspection system for finfish products is being developed by an EU-funded consortium made up of small and medium-sized enterprises and research centres.

The HSI approach provides both spatial information and information relating to each pixel in an image, thereby revealing 'what is where'.\n\nProject partners are currently developing a laboratory test rig to train and validate quantitative models for measuring the quality and safety attributes of finfish fillets. The next stage will be to build an HSI prototype system that will be tested in industry for the rapid, non-invasive and simultaneous measurement of a series of safety and quality attributes.\n\nThe novel technology developed by SPECTRAFISH will enable end users to conduct automated inspection of fish fillets, which can be operated online.
