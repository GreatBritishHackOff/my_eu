User modeling. A profile for each learner should be built. The profile should include, among others, the type of dyslexia and the errors  the user is most likely to make.<br/>2. Teaching strategies. The interaction of a learning system with a child should be based on a teaching strategy that supports the individual user in fulfilling her specific learning goals.<br/>3. Classification of learning material. Content classification must be a major component in any content management system. To think about it, a tutor helping a child to learn reading/writing always selects appropriate learning material based on the child's needs and capabilities.<br/>4. Personalized content presentation. If we know the errors the user is likely to make, we can enrich the text presentation with visual cues by combining highlighting, text-reformatting and word segmentation. In addition, the type of dyslexia should also influence the presentation.<br/>5. Engaging learning activities. High degree of learner engagement is sought in any learning activity. To achieve this goal, we integrate learning activities into serious games. A creative game scenario, coupled with a positive reinforcement mechanism, will extend child's engagement.<br/>6. Evaluation of learning. When a game is coupled with a game usage logging mechanism, data collected related to the user's actions may lead to a quantitative assessment of learning.<br/>7.

Where possible, we apply the standards and values which we derive from the Bible to the lives of the youngsters. Our pedagogical climate is featured by notions as: authority, love, responsibility and personality. We aim at a tailor-made approach for all types of pupils, quality of our education and the own responsibility of teachers.\r\nLocation Guido de Bres expresses  this as follows: \r\n- Room for education that takes place beyond the physical building.\r\n- Room for deepening the Christian identity.\r\n- Attention for the development of talents (during lessons, debating and extra subjects).\r\n- Room for a wide range of educational activities and approach within the classroom: tto (bilingual education), veto (strengthened language education), and also a variety of didactics.\r\n\r\nThis has been worked out by the tto-team as follows:\r\nThe school wants to educate the tto-pupils who are capable to serve in the Dutch or international society.  \r\n \r\nBeing valuable as christian citizens implies: \r\n1. After three years the pupils have acquired a B2-level of English according to the ERK-model. \r\n2. The pupils are able to write and speak with insight on a diversity of European and International aspects. In this way they learn how to adjust to different cultures and make themselves subservient to their international environment. \r\n3. The pupils are educated in a challenging learning environment. \r\n4. Teachers point at the relevance of the English language in the national and international society. \r\n\r\nAims: The tto-teachers will develop their English language skills and CLIL-didactics (Content and Language Integrated Learning) in order to raise the level of English of the pupils. Also the teachers will be able to dig deeper in the subject content. Another aim is that pupils will grow in the way they give English output which will make it possible to participate in the society as European citizen.\r\n\r\nNumber of participants: \r\nTen teachers.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\n- CLIL-course at the Hilderstone Institute. \r\n- Job shadowing at several English schools.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n- De CLIL-course exists of a 'Language' as well as a 'Methodology' part. It focuses on classroom English and also on how to give the right instructions when it comes to effective learning. On top of that the course offers a wide range of CLIL-didactics that will provides the teachers more tools to manage the educational process.\r\n- The job shadowing exists of: the attending and observing of classes, the collecting of new classroom English and didactics and the collaboration with English teachers (discussing each others' lesson materials and lessons observed as well as the participation on moments of spiritual formation).\r\n\r\nExpected impact:\r\nAfter the courses teachers will have made huge progress on the area of language skills, CLIL-didactics as well as international orientation. They will experience a personal, professional growth and this will enrichen the tto-education. The impact will also influence the veto-tam as well as the subject departments. On all these areas the new didactics will be shared, new authentic material will be handed out and a new impulses will be given to set up international projects.", "http://www.riverschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA101-034987_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WR3"}
