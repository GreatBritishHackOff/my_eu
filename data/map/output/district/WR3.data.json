User modeling. A profile for each learner should be built. The profile should include, among others, the type of dyslexia and the errors  the user is most likely to make.<br/>2. Teaching strategies. The interaction of a learning system with a child should be based on a teaching strategy that supports the individual user in fulfilling her specific learning goals.<br/>3. Classification of learning material. Content classification must be a major component in any content management system. To think about it, a tutor helping a child to learn reading/writing always selects appropriate learning material based on the child's needs and capabilities.<br/>4. Personalized content presentation. If we know the errors the user is likely to make, we can enrich the text presentation with visual cues by combining highlighting, text-reformatting and word segmentation. In addition, the type of dyslexia should also influence the presentation.<br/>5. Engaging learning activities. High degree of learner engagement is sought in any learning activity. To achieve this goal, we integrate learning activities into serious games. A creative game scenario, coupled with a positive reinforcement mechanism, will extend child's engagement.<br/>6. Evaluation of learning. When a game is coupled with a game usage logging mechanism, data collected related to the user's actions may lead to a quantitative assessment of learning.<br/>7. On-line resource bank. Coherent collections of data which support specific teaching strategies should be accessible to learners and educators.<br/>The ILearnRW environment will support the English and Greek languages", 148498.0, 1864523.0, "ILearnRW", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_105465_956396236"], ["8TJ", "Infrastructure and integrated tools for personalized learning of reading skill", "Dolphin Computer Access Ltd", "The overarching aim of the iRead project is to develop a software infrastructure of personalised, adaptive technologies and a diverse set of applications for supporting learning and teaching of reading skills.

The domain models will utilise and generalise the domain model \n      implemented in a previous FP7 project \u2013 iLearnRW  \n3.
