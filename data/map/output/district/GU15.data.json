Three European regions will be participating in this effort: the UK (the Midlands and Plymouth), the Brussels area and Wallonia, and the Weser-Ems region in NorthWest Germany. Each of these regions will deploy a new hydrogen refuelling site to close the gaps in a continuous \u2018hydrogen highways\u2019 that leads from Scotland via the Midlands to London, connecting to Brussels and on to Cologne and Hamburg/Scandinavia/Berlin via Bremen.\nThe vehicles employed are low-cost, high fuel-efficiency, hybridised, light-weight passenger cars specifically designed for city and regional transport. These vehicles provide a complementary pathway to commercialisation to the large Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of hydrogen fuel cell options, by allowing near-term rollout on a commercial basis to a wide range of users \u2013 in parallel with the planned rollouts for large OEM vehicles from 2015. Their deployment regions will gain the infrastructure, public exposure and technological understanding to act as seed locations for future large scale OEM vehicle rollout.\nIn view of the lower vehicle costs, this project will deploy an unprecedented number of road vehicles for a demonstration project, with three OEM\u2019s contributing 20, 10 and 20 vehicles respectively to the project. These will be put in the hands of users in a variety of real-life operating environments. An extensive data monitoring exercise will run throughout the demonstration phase, allowing the reliability of the vehicles tested by different users to be evaluated and leading to recommendations for the improvement of future, fully commercial vehicle designs.\nThe three European regions will deploy several hydrogen refuelling stations, adding a total of 3 new stations to existing supply sites, contributing to some of the first regional hydrogen refuelling clusters in Europe. Each region will as a consequence either own a high-standard filling station with = high capacity (200 kg/day) and high performance (70 MPa) refuelling technology (Wallonia, Weser-Ems), or build on existing smaller stations of lower capacity and pressure (UK, Midlands and Plymouth).\nThe project will be a near-commercial stepping stone and will include a reach-out activity timed to coincide with OEM\u2019s commercialisation plans in the post-2015 period, to attract further vehicles to the newly developed infrastructures - by offering cost effective and readily available focal points for additional hydrogen fleets developing around these regions.

The scientific and technological objectives of iSPACE are to: Develop concepts for individualisation of passenger cabin environment and prove its general feasibility. Develop and prove emerging step-change technologies for individualisation of passenger cabin environment.  Provide simulation tools for individualised cabin environment and give recommendations for existing and future commercial aircraft. iSPACE is in line with former projects funded by the EC which investigated the cabin environment with a philosophy on human centred design. So far most of these projects did investigate the current status (HEACE) and/or studied the impact of environmental parameters on the human perception of cabin comfort (FACE, ICE). Recommendations for future technological developments are on the way to be set (ICE). Thus only fields of development have been explored and problems have been identified.

Based on this, the project developed concepts that were then evaluated against the identified requirements; the technology solutions needed are currently under development.\n\nOn completion, the project will be able to present recommendations for utilising the new systems in both existing and future aircraft designs. Aircraft manufacturers will need reliable simulation tools such as those currently being developed and improved on throughout the duration of the project.\n\nDuring the second half of the ISPACE project, the new system will be proven experimentally.

Thirdly, recommendations would be made on how to adapt the process for effective use across all aspects of the transport sector.\n\nIn terms of impact assessment, the EU-funded Mefisto project conducted research whose results could be formulated as a tool for influencing future policy at the mid-point of FP7. This would also come in handy prior to preparations for FP8. For aeronautics, the FP5 and FP6 policy goals included technology objectives aimed at increasing competitiveness, serving social needs and protecting the environment. Also, activities were geared to promoting the vision of a competitive, safe, secure, sustainable and user-friendly air transport system.\n\nIn addition, policies were set with the aim of establishing a European Research Area (ERA) that would encourage cooperation and integration of research across Europe. In this way, the Lisbon objectives for Europe to become a leading knowledge-based world economy can be further strengthened.\n\nMefisto partners considered the views of over 300 sector-specific experienced individuals, generating a data set of responses to 94 key questions. This allowed for assessment of the impact of policies. Interviews with selected aviation executives, representatives of government and the European Commission meant personal experiences could be explored and considered as related to positive outcomes of the FPs.\n\nFP5 and FP6 were highly successful for the aeronautical sector, bringing about important changes in sector operations, increasing competitiveness, driving environment-focused activities and enabling innovative work on aircraft structures. The outcomes were also shown to have had substantial impact on research integration of the sector.
