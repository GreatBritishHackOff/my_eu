More than 60 million containers are handled in the main EU ports alone. These containers are forwarded by rail, sea or road transport. The transport sector provides more than ten million jobs and generates 10% of EU wealth measured by gross domestic product (GDP), equivalent to about one trillion Euros a year. Huge savings can be made for the SMEs in the transport sector by securing delivery time and place, improving the capacity utilisation of containers and reducing theft. A project focusing on electronic container security demonstrated savings of $378 to $462 per container per shipment due to improved monitoring of container movement and tampering attempts. The idea is to develop a tracking and security system with energy source and energy generation to be retrofitted in containers to enable tracking and security independently of fixed check point installations and satellite navigation systems. The supply chain will enjoy benefits from lower shrinkage and increased efficiency. The system will meet demands for increased security in the supply chain and provides location information and protection against crime. The system will increase security against terrorist attacks as it will sense and report tampering attempts before arriving to any crowded place and the container can be halted to reduce potential impacts. The aim of the project is to develop a system utilising a combination of commercial transmitters and cell phone base stations for low power, low cost positioning. The navigation will be based on signal parameters and IDs from commercial transmitters and GSM base stations combined with information in a central data base.

The insecticide production will be based on growing specific cyanobacteria proven to be insect repellent to cabbage root fly in a fermentation reactor for subsequent drying to a flake state. The final stage will consist of mixing the solid fertilizer with the small amounts of cyanobacterial flakes (1-10 kg flakes/100 ton fertilizer) to produce granules by protrusion technology with the moisture content of 5-10%. No industrial process can currently manufacture this combined insect repellent-fertilizer product due to lack of carrier substance for the insect repellent that also will add fertilizing value and delayed release.

The key issue and barriers to large scale uptake of these systems is their high installed cost, decades pay-back periods and their ongoing maintenance issues and that they are so large and require internal locations or are fitted in outside pits that they are not suitable for most consumers houses/flats.

The problem is, unfortunately, unlikely to decrease in the foreseeable future due to predicted warmer climates, which may exacerbate the water shortage.\n\nOne step towards a sustainable solution would be the development and implementation of household systems capable of recycling shower and bath water (so-called grey water). Significant challenges exist, however, in the form of high installation costs and the lack of suitability of the system for installation in domestic settings.\n\nThe AQUACONSERVER project overcame these challenges by designing a low-cost water and energy recycling system that can be effectively installed in around 90\u00a0% of households.\n\nResearchers investigated a range of membranes for their ability to remove pathogens and other contaminants from grey water. An investigation into pore size revealed that a tighter pore dimension filter was always needed in the system to adequately reduce the microbial load.\n\nAn important component of the system was a water quality sensing device, containing turbidity, temperature, conductivity and chemical sensors. A useful heat exchanger also formed part of the system and played a role in harvesting heat energy from wastewater for reuse in water heating. The project also witnessed the manufacture of a full-scale 'shower tray' prototype.\n\nThe project resulted in a low-cost bathroom water recycling system that could be retrofitted and was capable of reusing water from showering and bathing. This enabled savings of up to 50\u00a0% of personal washing water usage and more than 50\u00a0% of personal associated heating energy usage. In addition, the system was capable of using grey water to flush toilets, thereby saving up to 35\u00a0% of household water usage.\n\nAQUACONSERVER is superior in terms of water saving and water quality to conventional grey water recycling systems and can compete very effectively in both the grey water systems and shower systems markets. The potential European market for the system is around 2 million units per year, with an average growth rate of 5\u00a0%.\n\nIt is likely the system will be sold in combination with a new shower or shower cubicle, which will increase overall revenues for AQUACONSERVER members. At the same time, the system has the potential to cut the water bills of European households by over EUR\u00a027.8 million and household energy bills by up to EUR\u00a018 million.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2015-06/159319.jpg", "fp7_101034_998799883"], ["0HH", "Autonomous wireless sensors driven by harvested vibration energy for leak detection in water mains", "Haswell Moulding Technologies Ltd", "The Advocate project consortium, led by ULEFOS ESCO AS from Norway, aims to develop smart gate valves which will be used in the detection and management of water leaks through employing autonomous wireless sensor nodes in an underground MESH network powered by a unique, vibration energy harvesting  system.\n\nThe amount of leaked water in Europe, per year, is estimated to cost society approximately \u20ac80 billion.  To reduce this huge cost burden on society, the ADVOCATE consortium will develop innovative gate valves on water and waste water pipes.  Valves will automatically monitor for leaks and overall water/wastewater pressure in the system. A vibration energy harvesting system will generate enough power that these same valves could be monitored in a network of wireless sensors.

In order to reduce this enormous figure, local authorities and water utilities need to be able to monitor the status of their underground water and wastewater assets.

The valves will be monitored using autonomous wireless sensor nodes in an underground mesh network powered by a novel vibration energy-harvesting system.\n\nProject partners have already built and tested a novel pressure sensor prototype. A number of test beds for validating the prototype have also been developed. In addition, a laboratory prototype for vibration energy harvesting has been produced and tested.\n\nResults from the ADVOCATE project will have three main areas of application. These include the replacement of valves on an ad\u00a0hoc basis when they fail or stretches of leaking pipe need to be replaced. They also include replacement of valves during refurbishment programmes and the integration of valves during new service installation programmes.\n\nThe technologies developed by the consortium will also have potential application in a number of other industrial sectors, such as for oil and gas pipelines and brewing. In fact, the project's results can benefit any sector that relies upon the cost-effective and reliable valve monitoring for maintaining the integrity of its processes.\n\nADVOCATE will benefit the EU economy by reducing losses through leaks in underground pipes and through minimal inspection and replacement charges linked to low-cost communication technologies.

The most commonly used concrete piles are the pre-cast concrete piles and the cast in-situ concrete piles. Cast in-situ concrete piles are limited in the length or depth at which it could be cast unlike pre-cast piles (it can be extended to greater depths using mechanical joints). Apart from its advantage in installation depth, pre-cast concrete piles are becoming more preferred because of the decreasing length of the individual pile sections before installation. There are equipments and method available for concrete pile integrity testing that is time and cost effective (e.g. ultrasonic testing), but they have limitations especially when testing pre-cast piles. Therefore, our idea is to produce an innovative quality assurance system to enable a cost effective, efficient and reliable means of monitoring the integrity of pre-cast concrete piles through out its supply chain from manufacturing up until after its installation.
