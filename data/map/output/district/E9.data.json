This innovative initiative will seek to develop new audiences, deepen engagement and extend the reach of positive participation in the arts across Europe.Artists who work collaboratively connect with non-artists in the creation of contemporary artwork. Collaborative Arts, more than most forms of art making, is fundamentally based on principles of participation and democratization. In collaborative arts the non-artist participants (community member, young person, hospital work, scientist etc.) can become both co-creator and new arts audience.  Collaborative Art by its nature affirms the right of everyone to take part in cultural life.  Historically this work has seen artists co-create with communities, connected to social, political and environmental agendas and quite often marginalised groups and culturally diverse communities. The different strands of the work programme will cumulatively build skills and competences, and offer professional development opportunities for artists through a series of workshops, artist residencies, arts commissions, presentations and a final cultural showcase.  The COLLAB Arts Partnership Programme was initiated as a pilot for the first time during Ireland\u2019s hosting of the EU Presidency in 2013 by lead partner Create Ireland in tandem with founding partners Tate Liverpool (UK); Live Art Development Agency (UK) and m-cult (Finland).  The original partners have been joined by Hablar an Arte (Spain), Agora (Germany), Kunsthalle Osnabruck (Germany) and Ludwig Museum (Hungary).", "http://www.thisisliveart.co.uk", null, "creative_552219-CREA-1-2014-1-IE-CULT-COOP2_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "E9"}
