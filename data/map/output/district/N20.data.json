This multidisciplinary project is focused on the process leading to epilepsy, epileptogenesis, in adults. Our main hypothesis is that there are combinations of various causes, acting in parallel and/or in succession, that lead to epileptogenesis and development of seizures. Our central premise and vision is that a combinatorial approach is necessary to identify appropriate biomarkers and develop effective antiepileptogenic therapeutics. The project will focus on identifying novel biomarkers and their combinations for epileptogenesis after potentially epileptogenic brain insults in clinically relevant animal models, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and status epilepticus (SE); explore multiple basic mechanisms of epileptogenesis and their mutual interactions related to cell degeneration, circuit reorganization, inflammatory processes, free radical formation, altered neurogenesis, BBB dysfunction, genetic and epigenetic alterations; and translating these findings towards the clinic by validating biomarkers identified from animal models in human post TBI brain tissue and blood samples, post-mortem brain tissue in individuals that died soon after  SE, and human brain and blood samples from chronic epilepsy cases. The project will identify novel combinatorial biomarkers and novel disease-modifying combinatorial treatment strategies for epileptogenesis, create an Epilepsy Preclinical Biobank, and validate translational potential of results from animal models in human tissue. To adequately address the proposed goals, the project will develop technological breakthroughs, such as completely novel chemogenetic approaches, novel MRI techniques, novel multimodal organic recording devices for simultaneous recordings of EEG / cellular unit activity and biochemical measurements, novel bioluminescence for in vivo promoter activity analysis, and novel systems biology approaches.", 38281.0, 12903570.0, "EPITARGET", "Predicting and treating epilepsy", "Epilepsy is a devastating condition affecting over 50 million people worldwide. An EU consortium is using a combinatorial approach to identify biomarkers and develop antiepileptogenic therapeutics.", "A five-year EU-funded project, http://www.epitarget.eu (EPITARGET) (Targets and biomarkers for antiepileptogenesis), is studying the processes leading to epilepsy in adults. The consortium, consisting of 18 partners from 9 countries, aims to identify novel biomarkers and their combinations in clinically relevant animal models. These biomarkers, defining the different stages of epilepsy, will be used to predict/diagnose early and late stages of the evolution of the disease.\n\nAfter the first year the project advanced significantly towards its objectives. Sample collection from various animal models of epileptogenesis is ongoing. The project developed a biocompatible electrode for fast and sensitive glucose measurement in the brain.\n\nEPITARGET characterised expression patterns of a number of molecules at various time points after epileptogenic insults. They include lipid mediators and their receptors, microRNAs, immunoproteasomes, free radicals and antioxidants, amyloidogenic factors, inflammatory molecules, extracellular matrix proteins and synaptic proteins.\n\nThe consortium members are investigating complex mechanisms of epileptogenesis with the goal to design disease-modifying combinatorial treatment strategies, targeted to the different stages. EPITARGET optimised the two-stage approach for drug screening and explored pharmacokinetics and tolerability of combinations of clinically available drugs in naive and epileptic rodents. For targeting compounds to the brain, EPITARGET developed a lipid encapsulation approach. The first formulation of amiloride is undergoing in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo testing. The first generation of long-term transgene expression viral vectors was already verified in\u00a0vivo.\n\nEPITARGET findings using animal models will be translated into clinical use by validating biomarkers in human blood and brain tissue samples. Ongoing sample collection includes human brain tissue and biofluids from status epilepticus, traumatic brain injury and pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients. The creation of animal and human databases is under way. The first year of the project resulted in 20 peer-reviewed publications.\n\nUpon completion, EPITARGET is expected to improve diagnosis of epilepsy, and to develop new antiepileptogenic treatments and means to predict their efficacy. It will improve the quality of life for millions of people and reduce treatment costs.", "http://www.epitarget.eu", "http://www.nanomerics.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-10/163287.jpg", "fp7_111305_935406115"]]}}, "outwardCode": "N20"}
