This will allow the production of:  multilayer parts for enhanced product performance  fibre-reinforced composites  and facilitate automatic and controlled internal mould cooling \u00b7 Decreasing the processing cycle time by as much as 30% through automated feeding in the loading/heating/cooling/demoulding cycle. Reduced thermal stress to the polymer will allow use of engineering plastics for value added applications and improved dimensional stability. The EU rotational moulding sector uses 1.7 TWh of energy each year and therefore reducing energy consumption by 20%, through improving cycle times, will result in a saving of \u20ac30M. The Kyoto protocol aims to cut CO2 emissions by ~10% by 2012 and 50% by 2050. It is estimated that across the EU 750K tonnes of CO2 are emitted each year due to rotational moulding. Reduced energy usage gives a proportionate environmental impact. \u00b7 Integration of rotational moulding simulation software (RotoSim) with new finite element models, validated experimentally, to quantify variables and control shrinkage, residual stress and warpage, leading to higher quality roto-products. \u00b7 Knowledge-based rotational mould and machine design criteria/guidelines to accommodate the new universal feed system, and optimise processing performance; reinforcing the supply chain. \u00b7 Apply the new automatic feed system, mould and machine design, and knowledge-based processing to enable the use of engineering materials, and the development of new multilayer, fibre-reinforced and wood-polymer composite (WPC) products, achieving target end-user specifications for value added applications.", 194240.0, 1508799.0, "ROTOFLEX", "Automated moulding process expands product range", "Rotational moulding, or rotomoulding, is a well established process to manufacture hollow, seamless plastic components. Retrofittable automation has improved performance and opened the door to promising new markets.", "In rotomoulding, polymer powder or resin is placed in a hollow mould cavity and heated while rotating biaxially to coat the inside of the mould. Rotation is rather slow and coating is not through centrifugal forces. The mould is then cooled and opened and the product removed. Timing is critical. Too much time in the oven means degradation of the materials and too little means inconsistent melting and coalescence. Rapid cooling can cause the polymer to shrink and warp.\n\nCurrently, the process almost exclusively employs polyethylene (PE) due to incompatibility with the rheological characteristics of other polymers and resins. Rotomoulding of PE is used to make products ranging from toys and containers to car parts and tanks and the EU is a world leader in the field. Despite its widespread use, rotomoulding is relatively undeveloped compared to injection moulding or blow moulding. The EU-funded project http://www.rotoflex-eu.org/ (ROTOFLEX) was designed to advance rotomoulding technology and open the door to new markets. This would further enhance the international competitive position of EU small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nROTOFLEX scientists developed knowledge-based machine design and process optimisation guidelines to reinforce the supply chain. Process simulation software (RotoSim) quantifies parameters affecting behaviours such as shrinkage, residual stress and warpage. Based on a deeper understanding of equipment and process control, researchers have brought the process up to speed, so to speak. Retrofittable automated material feeding for polymers, additives and coolants enables input at any point during the process cycle. Automation not only facilitates a significant decrease in production time and energy consumption, but the precise control opens the door to a wealth of new components. Rotomoulders can now use novel materials to manufacture composite parts, including fibre-reinforced and wood\u2013polymer composite (WPC) components, and multi-layer and other value-added products.\n\nProject outcomes should positively impact the competitiveness of European SMEs in the rotomoulding sector with better control over processing and less material degradation of conventional PE components. Manufacturers can now use novel materials to create added-value parts particularly for the automotive and aerospace sectors.", "http://www.rotoflex-eu.org", "http://www.sorcerermachinery.com", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58370.jpg", "fp7_99476_998190820"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TA18"}
