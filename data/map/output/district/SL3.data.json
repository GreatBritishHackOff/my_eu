Cloud promises cheap and flexible services to end-users at a much larger scale than before. However, Cloud business models and technologies are still in their initial hype and characterized by critical early stage issues, which pose specific challenges and require advanced software engineering methods.The main goal of MODAClouds is to provide methods, a decision support system, an open source IDE and run-time environment for the high-level design, early prototyping, semi-automatic code generation, and automatic deployment of applications on multi-Clouds with guaranteed QoS.Model-driven development combined with novel model-driven risk analysis and quality prediction will enable developers to specify Cloud-provider independent models enriched with quality parameters, implement these, perform quality prediction, monitor applications at run-time and optimize them based on the feedback, thus filling the gap between design and run-time. Additionally, MODAClouds provides techniques for data mapping and synchronization among multiple Clouds.MODAClouds innovations thus are: (i)simplify Cloud provider selection favoring the emergence of European Clouds, (ii) avoid vendor lock-in problems supporting the development of Cloud enabled Future Internet applications, (iii) provide quality assurance during the application life-cycle and support migration from Cloud to Cloud when needed.The research is multi-disciplinary and will be grounded on expertise from several research areas. MODAClouds consortium consists of highly recognized Universities and research institutions that will assure a sound scientific progress, SME partners providing expertise on modelling tools, and large companies that assure industry relevance. The MODAClouds approach and tools will be applied on four industrial cases from different domains.", 89662.0, 7210723.0, "MODAClouds", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_105624_951277061"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["9EH", "CBP West Phase 1", "JAD Developments (Redruth) Ltd", "Responding to demand for grow-on space in strategically important location.", "ERDF", 3472926.0, 7463685.0, "erdf_england_473"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SL3"}
