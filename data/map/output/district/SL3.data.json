Cloud promises cheap and flexible services to end-users at a much larger scale than before. However, Cloud business models and technologies are still in their initial hype and characterized by critical early stage issues, which pose specific challenges and require advanced software engineering methods.The main goal of MODAClouds is to provide methods, a decision support system, an open source IDE and run-time environment for the high-level design, early prototyping, semi-automatic code generation, and automatic deployment of applications on multi-Clouds with guaranteed QoS.Model-driven development combined with novel model-driven risk analysis and quality prediction will enable developers to specify Cloud-provider independent models enriched with quality parameters, implement these, perform quality prediction, monitor applications at run-time and optimize them based on the feedback, thus filling the gap between design and run-time. Additionally, MODAClouds provides techniques for data mapping and synchronization among multiple Clouds.MODAClouds innovations thus are: (i)simplify Cloud provider selection favoring the emergence of European Clouds, (ii) avoid vendor lock-in problems supporting the development of Cloud enabled Future Internet applications, (iii) provide quality assurance during the application life-cycle and support migration from Cloud to Cloud when needed.The research is multi-disciplinary and will be grounded on expertise from several research areas. MODAClouds consortium consists of highly recognized Universities and research institutions that will assure a sound scientific progress, SME partners providing expertise on modelling tools, and large companies that assure industry relevance. The MODAClouds approach and tools will be applied on four industrial cases from different domains.", 89662.0, 7210723.0, "MODAClouds", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_105624_951277061"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0FF", "Europe, here we come!", "Hilton London Heathrow Airport Terminal 5", 156144.0, "67 students of the Hertha Firnberg Schools for Business and Tourism in Vienna as well as 4  student of the HLW 19 and 4students of the Tourismusschule Wien 21 take part in the project \u00ab Europe, here we come! \u00bb in summer 2017 The project is administrated by the \u00ab kulturzentrum Hertha Firnberg\u00bb. There are 48 companies available as project partners in France, Spain, United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Germany, Greece, Malta and Belgium . Many companies already cooperated with the Hertha Firnberg Schools in the last years. \r\n\r\nStudents complete a compulsory internship in upmarket hotels and restaurants in the course of their education. Internships in foreign countries are seen as highly significant at the Hertha Firnberg Schools, since they constitute an excellent preparation for the occupation-related practical as well as theoretical training, and the so-called \u00ab Vorpr\u00fcfung zur Reife- und Diplompr\u00fcfung \u00bb (exam taken just before the \u00abA-level \u00bb/school leaving exam and which is seen as part of the \u00ab A-level \u00bb) at the end of the fourth year.

The teachers have all worked in the hospitality industry and dispose of international experience. Pupils are trained in restaurant service in as well as in the kitchen to be prepared to work in upmarket hotels and restaurants, offices. A training at the reception desk is also part of the curriculum.  The linguistic as well as intercultural competence are taught in the language courses as well as in the optional course for intercultural competence. Students practice simple every-day conversations and complex professional situations by doing role plays. They also get special support by native speaker teachers.\r\nIn order to anchor the spirit of the idea of European mobility in our students\u2019 as well as their parents\u2019 heads, a yearly information evening takes place at our school. The students and their parents get to know about the advantages of the Erasmus + programme and receive necessary practical information in order to successfully participate in this programme. Further information is available at our website. Even on our open-house days we inform about the possibility of doing an internship abroad and we also motivate other schools to participate. \r\nUndoubtedly, students having completed an internship abroad, have acquired a high level of linguistic, technical as well as personal competence. Thus the quality of the  final practical and theoretical exams (\u201eVorpr\u00fcfung zur Reifepr\u00fcfung\u201c and \u201eA-level\u201c)rises significantly. Without any doubt, many pupils who have stayed in a foreign country for a certain period of time, show readiness to integrate Europe-wide mobility into their future career plans.
