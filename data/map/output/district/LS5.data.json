The vision is to underpin smart and sustainable custodianship of land and soil, whilst meeting the demands of food production, and to answer a long-standing challenge for space science, namely the validation of soil moisture detection from satellites. GROW is highly innovative project leveraging and combining low cost consumer sensing technology, a simple soil test and a large user base of growers and plant enthusiasts to contribute individual soil and land data. It is designed to engage primarily individual growers and small-scale farmers across Europe, and to enable them to develop new wisdom and innovative practices through the collective power of shared and open data and knowledge. Citizens contributing data will gain access to the first single-source comprehensive crop and watering advice service for individual and small-scale growers incorporating scientific and crowdsourced information. Moreover, they will develop \u2018campaigns\u2019 (coordinated sampling operations) around local needs and issues, to underpin smarter decision-making and implementation of policy objectives. GROW will actively identify and enable new and credible social and business innovation processes, creating potential new services, applications and markets. The outcome will be a central hub of open knowledge and data created and maintained by growers that will be of value to the citizens themselves as well as specialist communities in science, policy and industry. The GROW partnership will connect and scale to globally dispersed communities linked through digital and social platforms, and a wide range of additional citizen associations and NGOs in sustainable agriculture, gardening, food democracy and land management.", 442387.0, 4696858.0, "GROW", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_203271_959416428"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3BP", "Permakultur - konkret und in die Fl\u00e4che", "PERMACULTURE ASSOCIATION (BRITAIN)", 48989.0, "The Permaculture Institute Germany established in 1983 imparts competence in designing sustainable systems. Permaculture is an interdisciplinary design system for creating ethical, efficient and resilient systems.\r\n\r\nWith the project \u201cPermaculture Practical and in the Field\u201d the Permaculture Institute aims to expand its portfolio of educational programme and add to its portfolio the field of agroforestry, solidarity-based economy and urban farming. Thereby it contributes to the internationalisation, professionalisation and quality standards in the Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in adult education. It supports and encourages the participants to deal with current developments for a sustainable society, to identify their own position and to find their fields of activity.\r\nThe current educational programme will be enriched by offers with more practical relevance as well as more international courses. It is our aim to establish a learning programme for sustainable garming and to offer a training course \u201cAgroforestry for farmers and designers\u201d. Our permaculture teachers open up for themselves a new teaching field services and thus ensure practical implementation.\r\n\r\nWe wish to achieve our goals by:\r\n\u2022 Larger pool of permaculture teachers in Germany\r\n\u2022 Supporting junior teachers\r\n\u2022 More professional didactics and methodology of teaching, \r\n\u2022 Better foreign language skills\r\n\u2022 Specialist knowledge in the field of agroforestry, regenerative farming and new economical models \r\n\u2022 Conception and implementation of attractive learning programmes\r\n\u2022 Approaching new target groups\r\n\u2022 Professional management of training programmes\r\n\u2022 Transfer and exchange of knowledge with our partners\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these goals, we plan 30 mobilities for teachers and tutors with different level of teaching experience, but also for administration and staff who develops new educational programmes. The following activities are planned:\r\nFor teachers and tutors:\r\n\u2022 Assistance and co-teaching assignments abroad at innovative courses\r\n\u2022 Teaching assignments at our partners and at conferences\r\n\u2022 Structured courses abroad to deepen specialist knowledge\r\n\u2022 training events that focus on didactics and methodology\r\n\u2022 Job Shadowing at a partner organisation\r\nFor management and support staff :\r\n\u2022 Job Shadowing at our partners that already offer education programmes we would like to implement \r\n\u2022 Job Shadowing at partners with high competence in the field of public relations\r\n\u2022 Seminars for management competence and social skills\r\n\u2022 Seminars for organisational development like sociocracy\r\n\u2022 Attend international events and networking events\r\n\u2022 Deepening of skills in foreign languages \r\nThe Permaculture Institute Germany has two partner organisations in the United Kingdom and Italy. In the course of the two years more partners will join us in order to accomplish the requirements of this project.\r\nFor ourselves and our partners we expect the following impact:\r\n\u2022 Work-flow in administration will be more flexible and adaptive to the upcoming challenges\r\n\u2022 A pool of teachers with excellent specialist knowledge and high methodology improves the chance of the participants of our courses on the labour market \r\n\u2022 A better network of educational programmes on an international level will lead to higher efficiency to reach our goal and to synergetic effects\r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to a better understanding of permaculture in the society and how the Permaculture Institut contributes to this. The graduates of our training courses will be more competent to implement agroforestry and other sustainable farming methods as well as new social and economical concepts for our society. \r\n\r\nThe Permaculture Institute will be an established competence centre for sustainable agricultural systems in the European network of Sustainability.", "http://www.permaculture.org.uk ", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA104-003850_2"], ["3BP", "Kapacitetsopbygning for Permakultur Danmark 2017", "PERMACULTURE ASSOCIATION (BRITAIN)LBG", 26008.0, "The project contains 14 mobilities within Structured training, Job shadowing and Teaching / Training Assignment.\r\nPermaculture Denmark's teachers are a diverse group with different needs and it is clearly reflected in the choice of mobilities. This year the focus is on upgrading the ability to teach on the basic course - Permaculture Design Course (PDC) - which is an \"entrance ticket\" to permaculture, but also a bottleneck when there are shortages of qualified teachers in relation to demand.\r\n\r\nWith the training of teachers in different educational situations like job shadowing, training of teachers and teaching on real courses, it is possible for a lift of the present teachers while giving new teachers skills and opportunities. This means for teachers:\r\n- Improving the capacity to organize specialized and relevant courses and other training\r\n- Better quality and outreach of the teachers who have participated in international educational context and facilitation\r\n- More diversified education and larger scope of teaching\r\n- Better financial sustainability\r\n- Enhanced European and global network.\r\n\r\nQuality assurance of teaching and better European project management is another area of focus for this project. Building these skills in the association will have a direct impact on the efficiency of administrators to manage both the increasing demand for education in permaculture and also the association's collaboration with organizations at European level.\r\n\r\nThe research cooperation at European level is a promising, innovative approach which involves educators and practitioners in Citizen Science through the collection of data about for example climate adaptation. The expansion of the action learning methodology, already used in the design-oriented education and diploma system is also a foreseen effect of the Citizen Science approach.\r\n\r\nAll in all, people interested in permaculture in Denmark gains easier access to education in permaculture with higher quality, greater diversity and more options. We hope that this will encourage more people to take a course in permaculture and make permaculture more known - also in the more formal educational institutions.
