Indeed, CO2 is no longer considered as a waste but as an efficient resource enabling industries to:\n- reduce dependency on fossil fuels and primary raw materials for the production of industrial and transportation fuels, basic chemicals, and building materials;\n- increase the use of renewable energies from intermittent sources (e.g. solar, photovoltaic, or wind) by providing a solution for electricity storage, via the conversion of CO2 into gaseous or liquid fuels in periods where potential production exceeds demand on the grid and would otherwise be wasted.\nSCOT is the first ever European initiative in the field of CO2 recycling / utilization.\nThrough a stronger coordination of efforts among the consortium, the SCOT project will enable to:\n- define a Strategic European Research Agenda aimed at developing new breakthrough solutions and market applications\n- attract additional EU clusters, regions and investors to participate to multi-disciplinary research programmes and other collaborative actions defined in a Joint Action Plan\n- propose structural policy measures to favour the transition to a new European society based on the paradigm of \u201cCO2-as-a-resource\u201d, thereby significantly improving the EU\u2019s overall competitive position and environmental performance on the international scene.", 47016.0, 1850832.0, "SCOT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ycf.org.uk", null, "fp7_111299_954406087"], ["3DH", "Solutions and Processes to Enhance the Competitiveness of Transport by Rail in Unexploited Markets", "The University of Huddersfield", "Modern manufacturing techniques and logistics require reliable, time sensitive delivery of lower density and higher value goods.

For example in the manufacture of smart phones, i-tablets, etc, high-precision laser micro-machining is essential to produce some of the key features we use in these devices. In the car industry it is has been shown that diesel nozzles produced with ultrafast lasers lead to significantly reduced air pollution in comparison to nozzles produced with conventional fabrication techniques. Spinning nozzles used widely in the textile industry are also produced using ultrafast lasers. The main goal of RAZipol is to demonstrate laser material processing at unprecedented levels of productivity (leading to drilling process times below 4 s of high aspect ratio [40:1] holes compared to current times of 25 s) and precision material processing (structure dimension below 1 \u00b5m) using beams with novel radial and azimuthal polarization. The challenge is not only to achieve high productivity at moderate levels of precision or highest quality at low speeds, but to reach both targets at the same time. Therefore an adequate ultrafast laser source with a very high average power and well-adapted beam parameters, including pulse duration, pulse energy, intensity profile, and polarization, is needed. Additionally, the laser beam has to be applied to the work-piece in a well-defined application-specific manner. Finally, advanced processing strategies are required to obtain optimum results at high productivity. The ultrafast laser source planned for RAZipol project combines several quite unique features. Its modular 3-stage master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) concept offers a high degree of flexibility to generate a broad range of pulse durations, pulse energies and repetition rates. The MOPA combines an ultrafast oscillator together with a Single Crystal Fiber as 1st amplification stage and a thin-disk multipass amplifier as final amplification stage. Although the potential range of material processing applications for this laser source is extremely broad, within the project, we will focus on two demonstration applications. The first application will be based on a fast scanner system which facilitates the production of complex structures like a 'lab on a chip' on large wafers (8' diameter). For this application, the MOPA system providing up to 500 W average power will be set up for repetition rates in the 20-40 MHz range with pulse duration of approximately 1 ps. The second application will be trepanning drilling of deep, high aspect holes with tight tolerances. In this case, the MOPA system providing up to 200 W average power will be set up for generating high pulse energies (\u2264 1 mJ) at pulse duration of about 5 ps.

Lateral flow immunodiagnostics has long offered the promise of fast, high quality testing for substances of low molecular weight. There have however been very real challenges to bringing the full power of such technology to bear in this area. The problem is simply size. Large analytes can support the simultaneous binding of both capture and detector antibodies, allowing typical excess-reagent sandwich immunoassays to be formatted in which increasing analyte concentration provides an increase of observable signal over a very low zero background. Small molecules are simply not large enough to support such simultaneous binding. Alternative systems in effect measure how much analyte is not present. This causes major problems in terms of precision, sensitivity and read-out where, classically, increasing concentration of analyte reduces the signal produced, making point-of-need devices often difficult to read. What is required is a robust system in which there is no observable signal in the absence of analyte, and even low level samples give an obvious observable signal over this zero background. SALIANT offers a system based on a small bindable moiety that is first conjugated close to the binding site of a primary antibody against the analyte such that when analyte binds the antibody, the moiety can still be bound by a labelled secondary antibody.

Ideally, fuel cladding materials must demonstrate leak tightness and containment of fuel pellets and fission products during the fuel residence in the reactor, even under transient/accidental operation conditions. The innovative ATF cladding material concepts proposed in IL TROVATORE are expected to demonstrate significant improvement in performance when compared to the current fuel cladding materials, thus helping to take a critical step towards an improved energy safety worldwide, in response to the requirements of the amended Nuclear Safety Directive. The development of ATF clads will eliminate redundant safety systems, improving the market profile of current reactor designs, and the overall envisaged innovation will strengthen the competitiveness of European industries in both nuclear and non-nuclear sectors. To achieve its ambitious objectives, IL TROVATORE relies on academic excellence and industrial support, while also involving standardization bodies and nuclear safety regulatory authorities to accelerate the transfer of key innovation to market.

Through this process, the artist gain new experiences and local citizens will have the opportunity to reclaim their cultural habitat through an artistic intervention. A programme will be organised alongside these workshops, it will offer opportunities for knowledge exchange between artists and the citizens, training and education for the local community.The partners who are looking forward to sharing their knowledge, come from a diverse cultural and economic background, each an expert in their designated role.The process of the project is designed to build audiences through engaging citizens in the local activities, creating a \u201ccommons\u201d where the art will be created and where the finished work will be presented \u2013 thereby presenting their urban living space to a broader audience. To achieve the project goals, the partners will use several tools and strategies: emotional mapping, links to major festivals, and cooperation with schools and universities. The timeline has been designed to meet the needs of the target participants and audiences, and of other key cultural activities in their towns (one is undertaking its workshops in a short intensive period; the others are undertaking theirs over a period of two years).To ensure the best possible result the partners will also work with Dr Steve Millington, an external expert on evaluation and dissemination.
