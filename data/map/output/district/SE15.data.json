Our aim is to meet the demands of these diverse markets providing a high performance, low maintenance solution with reduced energy usage and superior operational performance which our extensive market research has validated a significant commercial interest in our objectives.\nEZ-Liner offers major advantages in trenchless relining for long runs of pipe in a single operation with associated reduced labour, reduced energy costs, reduced disruption and reduced time for pipe repairs. By utilising a thermoplastic liner, instead of traditional epoxy methods, the risk of contamination from such chemicals will be eliminated. The traditional methods are labour intensive and expensive, typically \u20ac300 to \u20ac350/m2. Our method will improve relining speed by 100% achieving a target cost of \u20ac230/m2 by minimising labour. By developing a novel liner delivery system that focuses the heating and consolidation of the pipe to a narrow band we aim to reduce energy consumption by at least15%. Uniquely our design will achieve consolidation, even in pipe work with surface defects.\nThe system will utilise a conformable thermoplastic liner drawn through the pipe by a novel consolidating head. This will clear debris in the pipe by water jets, form the liner in the pipe and consolidate with locally produced steam providing reduced energy usage and losses. Focusing steam into a localised area avoids escape into surroundings or damaged pipe, as is prevalent in traditional methods. The system we will deliver will be safer and more robust making it simpler to operate and easier to maintain; ideally suited for the harsh environment of the pipe relining market.\nThe system will be primarily validated in the drinking water pipe relining industry. This validation of our technology will be undertaken by our end user partners CEPA and Gadmon.", 240919.0, 1918353.0, "EZ-LINE", "Novel technology repairs pipes in\u00a0situ", "EU-funded scientists developed a safe, robust and less labour-intensive system, ensuring effective and durable pipe repairs.", "The sewerage infrastructure in European cities is old and needs repair. More than 2.6 billion cubic metres of drinkable water (30\u00a0% of the overall quantity) are wasted through leaks, which also represents an energy loss. In London alone, 890 million litres of water are lost each day through pipe cracks. Repairs are difficult, slow and costly, but European legislation on drinking water quality is forcing the need to find relevant solutions.\n\nWith EU support, the project 'Novel technology for low cost re-lining of pipe infrastructure' (http://www.ezline.info/ (EZ-LINE)) developed technology that eliminates the need to completely replace old pipes. As a trenchless technology, this system does not require excavation to rehabilitate pipes, but only access to the pipe ends.\n\nThe EZ-LINE solution is a low-cost system and does not incur any increase in the infrastructure cost. Furthermore, it has low-maintenance needs, reduced energy usage and superior operational performance.\n\nTo retrofit old pipes, the EZ-LINE system coats them with a thermoplastic liner from the inside. Compared to other trenchless rehabilitation methods, it does not have any harmful resins and is quick to install as well as ecologically sound, thus conforming to European standards. This conformable thermoplastic fabric is pulled through the pipe, pushed against the inner surface of the defective pipe, heated and consolidated by a novel pig-head design.\n\nDuring consolidation, the liner fabric partially melts to form a smooth, watertight solid sheet of reinforced plastic. Optionally, the liner can be braided with reinforcing fibres. This increases its burst strength, helping it to withstand high water pressures.\n\nConsortium members successfully demonstrated the EZ-LINE rehabilitation process at a partner institute. The relining process was carried out using prototype equipment at a speed of 6\u00a0metres per hour. This speed is expected to increase significantly when using commercial equipment with higher capacity.\n\nThe EZ-LINE system should serve both residential and municipal markets, ensuring continuing function of Europe's pipe networks. This innovative relining method could also be further developed to serve in the oil and gas sectors.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/149721.jpg", "fp7_96345_989192033"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2EE", "CHANGE OF PARADIGM LIMITED", 208363.0, "Promoting entrepreneurship and improving the competitiveness and access to markets of Union enterprises  (02.02.01)", "fts_2016_24579", 2016], ["5HG", "SOUTHWARK LAW CENTRE", 26342.0, "Ensuring the protection of rights and empowering citizens (33.02.01)", "fts_2017_38980", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "SE15"}
