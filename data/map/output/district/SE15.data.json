Our aim is to meet the demands of these diverse markets providing a high performance, low maintenance solution with reduced energy usage and superior operational performance which our extensive market research has validated a significant commercial interest in our objectives.\nEZ-Liner offers major advantages in trenchless relining for long runs of pipe in a single operation with associated reduced labour, reduced energy costs, reduced disruption and reduced time for pipe repairs. By utilising a thermoplastic liner, instead of traditional epoxy methods, the risk of contamination from such chemicals will be eliminated. The traditional methods are labour intensive and expensive, typically \u20ac300 to \u20ac350/m2. Our method will improve relining speed by 100% achieving a target cost of \u20ac230/m2 by minimising labour. By developing a novel liner delivery system that focuses the heating and consolidation of the pipe to a narrow band we aim to reduce energy consumption by at least15%. Uniquely our design will achieve consolidation, even in pipe work with surface defects.\nThe system will utilise a conformable thermoplastic liner drawn through the pipe by a novel consolidating head. This will clear debris in the pipe by water jets, form the liner in the pipe and consolidate with locally produced steam providing reduced energy usage and losses. Focusing steam into a localised area avoids escape into surroundings or damaged pipe, as is prevalent in traditional methods. The system we will deliver will be safer and more robust making it simpler to operate and easier to maintain; ideally suited for the harsh environment of the pipe relining market.\nThe system will be primarily validated in the drinking water pipe relining industry. This validation of our technology will be undertaken by our end user partners CEPA and Gadmon.", 240919.0, 1918353.0, "EZ-LINE", "Novel technology repairs pipes in\u00a0situ", "EU-funded scientists developed a safe, robust and less labour-intensive system, ensuring effective and durable pipe repairs.", "The sewerage infrastructure in European cities is old and needs repair. More than 2.6 billion cubic metres of drinkable water (30\u00a0% of the overall quantity) are wasted through leaks, which also represents an energy loss. In London alone, 890 million litres of water are lost each day through pipe cracks. Repairs are difficult, slow and costly, but European legislation on drinking water quality is forcing the need to find relevant solutions.\n\nWith EU support, the project 'Novel technology for low cost re-lining of pipe infrastructure' (http://www.ezline.info/ (EZ-LINE)) developed technology that eliminates the need to completely replace old pipes. As a trenchless technology, this system does not require excavation to rehabilitate pipes, but only access to the pipe ends.\n\nThe EZ-LINE solution is a low-cost system and does not incur any increase in the infrastructure cost. Furthermore, it has low-maintenance needs, reduced energy usage and superior operational performance.\n\nTo retrofit old pipes, the EZ-LINE system coats them with a thermoplastic liner from the inside. Compared to other trenchless rehabilitation methods, it does not have any harmful resins and is quick to install as well as ecologically sound, thus conforming to European standards. This conformable thermoplastic fabric is pulled through the pipe, pushed against the inner surface of the defective pipe, heated and consolidated by a novel pig-head design.\n\nDuring consolidation, the liner fabric partially melts to form a smooth, watertight solid sheet of reinforced plastic. Optionally, the liner can be braided with reinforcing fibres. This increases its burst strength, helping it to withstand high water pressures.\n\nConsortium members successfully demonstrated the EZ-LINE rehabilitation process at a partner institute. The relining process was carried out using prototype equipment at a speed of 6\u00a0metres per hour. This speed is expected to increase significantly when using commercial equipment with higher capacity.\n\nThe EZ-LINE system should serve both residential and municipal markets, ensuring continuing function of Europe's pipe networks. This innovative relining method could also be further developed to serve in the oil and gas sectors.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/149721.jpg", "fp7_96345_989192033"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2SW", "Language Professional Development", "John Donne Primary School", 45739.0, "John Donne Primary School is an outstanding school with a children and staff from diverse backgrounds.

The activities of each partner organisation, regardless of their differing foci, enable each volunteer to connect issues of racism, discrimination and prejudice through providing support for people with fewer opportunities. Each organisation also has historical links, or is influenced by European history, helping volunteers to appreciate the effects of racism, discrimination and what can happen if people are excluded from society, a theme that very much remains relevant in contemporary Europe. \r\nVolunteers at the Aegis Trust, Jewish Museum and Wiener Library contribute to pedagogical programmes, often with local, European and international school classes, contributing their own historical perspectives and views on contemporary Europe. The diverse range of groups involved with these three hosting organisations brings the volunteers into contact with young people from different social and cultural backgrounds, enabling them to demonstrate that a voluntary service is a very productive activity, regardless of where one comes from.

We want to look at practice in Sweden and how they implement teaching and learning through their forest school system in order to bring back ideas, strategies and excellent practice from one of the homes of this type of learning. This will help us to improve the practice of our practitioners as well as the strategies they use for outside learning for our outside learning areas.

As a backdrop to the project, in recent years Europe has had to come to terms with high rates of unemployment in all age groups, but most particularly among young people and among adults with low levels of qualification. To coincide with this, the European labour market shows ever-increasing competitiveness related to specialised competence and knowledge and to the involvement of new technologies. In social terms, recent months have been characterised by a negative economic impact on inclusion and on social justice, exacerbated by the refugee crisis and the simultaneous increase in the threat of terrorism, often originating from inside the EU itself. European values and principles appear to be at a crossroads as cohesion weakens. It is within this kind of context that projects such as this one can make a difference, by contributing at grass-roots level towards an upturn in growth, based on the principles of equal opportunities and inclusion, gradually leading to a new increase in prosperity and wellbeing. This will be achieved through local and transnational co-operation and by means of the mobilities we intend to promote, which together will provide important added value to all involved and will represent another step forward in achieving these goals. At the level of the organisations involved (the members of the consortium, the intermediary and the receiving organisations), there is a valuable opportunity to become more competitive though the processes of innovation, of co-operation and of internationalisation implicit in the execution of the project, which will also include the application of several elements of the ECVET system. This will permit the full integration of these elements into the curricula of some of the courses offered by the organisations involved, and the integration of mobility into the training plans of these courses.In practical terms, the project will provide 2-month mobility experiences for 55 participants who will have completed vocational training related to sectors which reflect the training offered by the members of the consortium, with a emphasis on those from economically, financially and socially underprivileged backgrounds. The mobility opportunities will be distributed according to the needs of each organisation and will take into account the number of trainees completing courses each year. The co-ordinator, CEL, will attribute 16 mobilities to students completing vocational training in translation and interpreting, and in language teacher training, given the average total of 50 per year. The CML training department will benefit from 10 mobilities given their average annual total of 30 trainees who complete courses in gardening and paving. The Education and Development Centres at CPL will benefit from 29 mobilities distributed among 16 training areas, which include a variety of sectors, such as management, fashion design, tourism, IT, electricians, arts and audiovisuals. Every year, more than 500 trainees complete training at CPL. As a result of their mobilities, the participants will gain the knowledge, skills and competence which are fundamental to obtaining enhanced employability, both on a personal and on a professional level, in terms of both language skills and cultural awareness, and in terms of both social and civic skills. The project will also provide 12 2-week mobilities for staff (professionals working at the organisations of the consortium), in areas related to vocational education, training and integration, with a view to improving their skills so that they may better contribute towards the common strategy of international co-operation.With the aim of ensuring that these goals are achieved with high levels of quality, the project will include 29 partner organisations (intermediary and receiving organisations). The considerable quantity of PIC numbers belonging to receiving organisations demonstrates the commitment already consolidated between them and the intermediary partners, a clear indication of commitment to the aims of the project.

Pupils at the school are from diverse backgrounds and linguistic backgrounds.  There are 24 different languages spoken at the school and 21.5% of the pupils are EAL.  15.89% of pupils are described as disadvantaged.  \r\n\r\nSpanish and the International Curriculum have a high status within the school.   For the past six years, children in KS2 (7 to 11 year olds) have received 45 minutes of Spanish each week, led by a specialist teacher.  Children in KS1 and Early Years receive 30 minutes of Spanish each week.  As well as this, class teachers led a 15 minute consolidation session during the week.   Understanding of Spanish speaking cultures is also embedded in the curriculum, for example, in Reception, children learn about Spanish food in the topic 'Viva Espa\u00f1a'.  Each year, in the summer term, the whole school learns about a different aspect of Hispanic culture, as part of, 'Spanish Day'; children dress up and eat a special Spanish lunch!\r\n\r\nWe have found that our children have benefitted enormously from the opportunity to learn a foreign language and enhance their understanding of different cultures around the world.  We believe it is vital for our children to have a deep understanding and respect of other cultures and languages, as well as their own.  By embedding Spanish across the curriculum, our children are keen to  celebrate their differences and similarities.  \r\n\r\nLast year, there were significant changes in the teaching staff team; there are six new class teachers including a new Spanish specialist teacher.  The Spanish specialist teacher is not a native speaker.  After conducting a staff audit, we have found that five of the class teachers lack the confidence to teach Spanish and as a result have not effectively taught the fifteen minute consolidation session.  To continue to develop the Spanish and international curriculum it is vital that these class teachers receive specialist training in MFL pedagogy, Spanish language and Spanish culture.  We also want to further the knowledge of the Spanish specialist, who is new to the role, so she is better able to support and develop the skills of all members of staff.\r\n\r\nWe would like funding to send six class teachers on a one week immersion course in the first year and again in the following year.  S  The course is run by the Malaca Instituto in Malaga, a Cervantes Acredited Spanish Language provider of training since 1971, and includes   21 Spanish lessons during the week, as well as cultural activities and time spent in a Spanish primary school.  Cervantes has provided courses for primary schools across Southwark borough in the past and has a good record of success.    \r\n\r\nOn returning to school it is our aim that all class teachers will have an enthusiastic and confident approach to teaching Spanish.  Class teachers will have the skills to teach Spanish effectively in a fun and engaging way.  Teachers will be better able to support children finding Spanish difficult, as well as extending the more able learners.  We will also be better able  to ensure that Spanish learning is woven into the normal school day.

Many of our families face significant life challenges including no recourse to public funds, low income, overcrowding in multi-occupancy housing and limited outdoor play provision. \r\n\r\nWe work with children and families from a wide range of communities with 22 shared languages and 67% of our children categorized as EAL.  The needs of our families and children shape our school priorities and our unique offer. \r\n\r\nThe school was inspected by Ofsted in July 2015 and achieved a \"Good\" in all areas. We are now striving towards \"Outstanding\". \r\n\r\nIn September 2017 staff, governors, parents and carers worked together to revise our school vision to include, \"We are a dynamic school; progressive, forward thinking and willing to take risks. In our outward facing school, children benefit from links with the wider community, including exposure to high quality international practice.  We empower children to stand up for their rights and the rights of others whilst challenging negative views and stereotypes. We actively promote gender equality, opposing discrimination in all its forms and foster positive attitudes and commitment to an education for equality\".  Our school improvement plan prioritizes the need:  \" To diminish gender differences through staff behaviors towards children\" ,\"enhance the understanding of gender equality at child level\" and \"to enhance the understanding of gender equality at family level\".\r\n\r\nWith this is mind, our objectives for this project are to improve our language,practice  and provision in the area of gender neutrality for our children and families.  Our staff  will attend courses in Sweden and Latvia focusing on how we might do this effectively.   We want  to return with ideas, strategies and ways of working to improve our own practice and cascade this learning to families and other early years and primary providers in our network, so that as great a number as possible may benefit from our experience and strategic planning around this theme.  \r\n\r\nWe have developed links with organizations able to deliver courses to meet our needs.  In Sweden, Lotta Rajalin of Egalia, an expert in this practice, will collaborate with Stockholm University's Monica Soderberg-Forslund, a former Regio project collaborator with our LA,  to deliver our training.  In Latvia, our course provider will be Inese Liepina of the Bernu videa Skolas an environmental foundation of trainers working with Kindergartens in a 'gender neutral'  way.

To ensure impact in our school, we intend to send the same group on both courses in Sweden and Latvia as each will have a different focus pertaining to it's geographical/cultural nature and circumstances and it will be beneficial for participants to be able to compare both experiences, grow in expertise and then cascade this learning to as widely as possible on their return.\r\n\r\nOur school views a well trained staff as having the greatest impact on outcomes for children and families.  Participants will build on the course training at many levels. Firstly within the school as a whole, but also with our  federated nursery, the four other maintained nursery schools in the borough  and a number of private and voluntary settings. The strength of these relationships will also enable us to further disseminate and embed course outcomes and ensure this training is excellent value.\r\n\r\nNell Gwynn has formed a link with Rye Oak School through a Diversity Group, who are also applying for courses on gender neutrality.

We value all of our staff and want all of them to receive high quality professional development which allows them a deeper understanding of education in a European context. \r\n\r\nOver the next 2 years, we want our teachers to receive high quality Spanish language and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering/Maths) training and our newly appointed leadership team plan to focus on developing excellent teaching and practice in these areas. \r\n\r\nAs an Academy with flexibility over our curriculum, we aim to provide a rich, balanced and broad curriculum to all pupils regardless of their gender, ethnic or social background.  We have made language learning in Key Stage 2 a compulsory subject.  This means our teachers are required to teach Spanish (our school\u2019s chosen language) to an acceptable standard.  With a large number of Spanish speaking families and children attending our school, this is sometimes intimidating for those members of staff required to teach a subject that they are not fluent in.   \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve our objectives, we will send 12 teachers and teaching assistants across Key Stage 1 and 2 on week long Spanish training in Gran Canaria, delivered by MBA Business School, Las Palmas. \r\n\r\nWe will send 6 members of staff in the first year. They will disseminate their experience back in school and in the following year, we will choose 3 of those 6 participants to train further in Spain to advance their proficiency, along with 3 other members of staff that leaders judge would also benefit and boost language learning learning impact back in school.   \r\n\r\nAdditionally, our school was recently awarded silver in the 'Primary Science Quality Mark'.  We have also been appointed STEM Ambassadors for encouraging and inspiring young people in STEM subjects through the use of STEM teaching.   It is a school objective to continue prioritizing Science excellence, so experiencing different approaches and STEM school practice in other EU settings will further this focus too.  \r\n\r\nIn year 1, we will therefore send 6 teachers and teaching assistants from Key Stage 1 and 2 on a course in Cyprus, (hosted by Grammar School, Nicosia) designed to teach us how to better  motivate STEM students.  In year 2, 6 staff will attend a course in Latvia (hosted by B\u0113rnu Vides skola, an environmental training foundation in Riga) designed at Motivating Students of Science. \r\n\r\nAgain, through measuring how well participants disseminate their learning back in school after Yr 1, we will choose 3 of the original cohort of staff to train again in Yr 2, along with 3 other members of staff who we judge would benefit most from the experience and impact our Science focus most positively.  \r\n\r\nThe result will be that: \r\na) Staff in John Donne grow in their confidence and ability to deliver high-quality Spanish language lessons which enable pupils to learn more effectively \r\nb) We improve our approach as a school to Science subjects and can cascade our expertise across our networks     \r\nc) Staff who have experienced training in a different European country will have greater expertise and a greater understanding of the international dimension and their role as teachers and future leaders \r\nd) Staff will be better able to deliver INSET Days and Staff Meetings to the entire staff to enrich and up-skill teaching and daily practice\r\n\r\nMFL and Science are the focus of the impact we want to see as a result of this training.

The school has an autistic resource base and provides 18 places across the school for children with autism who cannot access a mainstream classroom setting.  The school has an ethically diverse community of non-white British pupils and families (86.4%).  On the IDACI deprivation school, 17.% of children are in band 1a, 48.9% in band 1b and 28.9% in band 2. This totals 74.8% of the school being in the most deprived 40% nationally. \r\n\r\nIn 2014 the school  and EYFS was graded as 'requires improvement'.   Last year, the EYFS acheived 69% GLD, only 2% below the national average.   However, the Ofsted report also highlighted a gap between boys and girls.  This has become a focus for the EYFS in continuing to raise attainment and on the journey from good to 'outstanding'.  The setting is now considered an example of best practice within the borough.  As part of this, I have been asked by the local authority to become an EYFS champion and have given presentations to EYFS coordinators, staff and leaders on boys in the early years, supporting same-sex families and deconstructing gender.  I have also undertaken moderation for the local authority and have been part of establishing an EYFS diversity group within the borough.  The group has 5 school members and provides an opportunity to discuss, plan and engage with current debates and research on gender equality and supporting LGBTQ parent families.  The school also has a curriculum focus on raising children's self-esteem and PSHE is a high priority across the school.  In particular, the school is committed to challenging stereotypes for both adults and children.  The school is at the beginning of the journey of embedding equality for all stakeholders and addressing inequalities in gender and for same sex parent families. \r\n\r\nAs the school has identified the gap in attainment between boys and girls as a significant need, the project objective is to upskill practitioner knowledge and pedagogy in relation to gender in the EYFS by  attending two one week courses and training during the Spring half-terms (2019 and 2020) on gender neutrality in early years education.  Another local school, Nell Gwynn nursery school, are also applying for funding to attend the same courses.  Both Rye Oak and Nell Gwynn are members of the EYFS diversity group in Southwark and have both identified approaches to teaching in a gender neutral way as the next steps in their development.    In Sweden, Lotta Rajalin of Egalia and Monica Soderberg-Forslund, from Stockholm University, will deliver the training.  The gender officer officer from Jarvalla Local Authority will also be involved. In Latvia, our course provider will be Inese Liepina of the Bernu videa Skolas.    Both courses will focus on the way gender neutral language, provision and practice support children and help to raise attainment for both boys and girls.  We will send 14 participants on both courses. This will include 1 senior leader (assistant head teacher and EYFS coordinator), 5 EYFS teachers, 1 HLTA and 8 early years practitioners.  \r\n\r\nBy attending both courses participants will be able to share their learning and embed their learning across the phase.  By sending the EYFS team as a group, new approaches to tackling gender equality across the EYFS and the school can become embedded at a deeper level and ensure that both boys and girls achieve to their full potential.   We aim to develop all of our EYFS staff within our setting to ensure that the improved practices and provision will be embedded throughout the phase.  Sending all staff ensures that gender neutral approaches to learning is not a 'top-down' pedagogical approach.  Information will be disseminated across the school through staff meetings and INSET training. and by various participants.   The team will support other local nurseries and disseminate learning through the EYFS coordinators briefings (termly), Southwark EYFS Champions work (half-termly) and the Southwark EYFS conference (April 2019 and 2020).   We aim to collaborate closely with another local nursery, Nell Gwynn. Preparing for the course,  evaluation and dissemination will be shared with staff from Nell Gwynn.  Collaborating with Nell Gwynn and with our international colleagues will give staff the opportunity to embed and develop the learning after the courses have been completed.
