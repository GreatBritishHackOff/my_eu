Our aim is to meet the demands of these diverse markets providing a high performance, low maintenance solution with reduced energy usage and superior operational performance which our extensive market research has validated a significant commercial interest in our objectives.\nEZ-Liner offers major advantages in trenchless relining for long runs of pipe in a single operation with associated reduced labour, reduced energy costs, reduced disruption and reduced time for pipe repairs. By utilising a thermoplastic liner, instead of traditional epoxy methods, the risk of contamination from such chemicals will be eliminated. The traditional methods are labour intensive and expensive, typically \u20ac300 to \u20ac350/m2. Our method will improve relining speed by 100% achieving a target cost of \u20ac230/m2 by minimising labour. By developing a novel liner delivery system that focuses the heating and consolidation of the pipe to a narrow band we aim to reduce energy consumption by at least15%. Uniquely our design will achieve consolidation, even in pipe work with surface defects.\nThe system will utilise a conformable thermoplastic liner drawn through the pipe by a novel consolidating head. This will clear debris in the pipe by water jets, form the liner in the pipe and consolidate with locally produced steam providing reduced energy usage and losses. Focusing steam into a localised area avoids escape into surroundings or damaged pipe, as is prevalent in traditional methods. The system we will deliver will be safer and more robust making it simpler to operate and easier to maintain; ideally suited for the harsh environment of the pipe relining market.\nThe system will be primarily validated in the drinking water pipe relining industry. This validation of our technology will be undertaken by our end user partners CEPA and Gadmon.", 240919.0, 1918353.0, "EZ-LINE", "Novel technology repairs pipes in\u00a0situ", "EU-funded scientists developed a safe, robust and less labour-intensive system, ensuring effective and durable pipe repairs.", "The sewerage infrastructure in European cities is old and needs repair. More than 2.6 billion cubic metres of drinkable water (30\u00a0% of the overall quantity) are wasted through leaks, which also represents an energy loss. In London alone, 890 million litres of water are lost each day through pipe cracks. Repairs are difficult, slow and costly, but European legislation on drinking water quality is forcing the need to find relevant solutions.\n\nWith EU support, the project 'Novel technology for low cost re-lining of pipe infrastructure' (http://www.ezline.info/ (EZ-LINE)) developed technology that eliminates the need to completely replace old pipes. As a trenchless technology, this system does not require excavation to rehabilitate pipes, but only access to the pipe ends.\n\nThe EZ-LINE solution is a low-cost system and does not incur any increase in the infrastructure cost. Furthermore, it has low-maintenance needs, reduced energy usage and superior operational performance.\n\nTo retrofit old pipes, the EZ-LINE system coats them with a thermoplastic liner from the inside. Compared to other trenchless rehabilitation methods, it does not have any harmful resins and is quick to install as well as ecologically sound, thus conforming to European standards. This conformable thermoplastic fabric is pulled through the pipe, pushed against the inner surface of the defective pipe, heated and consolidated by a novel pig-head design.\n\nDuring consolidation, the liner fabric partially melts to form a smooth, watertight solid sheet of reinforced plastic. Optionally, the liner can be braided with reinforcing fibres. This increases its burst strength, helping it to withstand high water pressures.\n\nConsortium members successfully demonstrated the EZ-LINE rehabilitation process at a partner institute. The relining process was carried out using prototype equipment at a speed of 6\u00a0metres per hour. This speed is expected to increase significantly when using commercial equipment with higher capacity.\n\nThe EZ-LINE system should serve both residential and municipal markets, ensuring continuing function of Europe's pipe networks. This innovative relining method could also be further developed to serve in the oil and gas sectors.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/149721.jpg", "fp7_96345_989192033"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["6DT", "School EU Professional Development Project", "Ann Bernadt Nursery School", 19730.0, "Ann Bernadt is a Maintained Nursery School in Peckham, South East London. Statistical data indicates that the school is situated in one of the 10 most deprived areas in the UK. There are currently 122 children aged between 2 and 5 years old on roll. The community scores highly on the IDACI  deprivation index . Last year 33% of our children spoke English as an additional language (EAL). In addition a high percentage of children were new to English. A growing percentage of our children have SEND (Special Educational Needs and Disabilities). Last year 13% of our children had SEND, however this year 20% within a cohort of 122 have been diagnosed with SEND. This percentage is nearly 3 times the national average and continues to increase. Our children and families  heritage is world wide, with most ethnic groups represented within the nursery. In addition they share over 30 languages.\r\n\r\nOur objectives are to improve our practice in the area of inclusion for children and families for whom English is an additional language or  where they are new to the language. We also wish to be able to attend courses dealing with how children with SEND are supported and included within the early years education systems in Greece and Germany so that we may learn from  effective strategies to support inclusion and integration at both child and family level in our own country. We want to be able to bring back ideas, strategies and ways of working to improve our own practice and cascade this learning to other early years providers  so that as great a number as possible may benefit from our findings.\r\n\r\nThis training would be an important opportunity to develop staff at all levels within the setting; management, teaching and support staff. We view it as particularly important for our support staff as they generally work most closely with children and can therefore have the most impact. However, we believe that it is everyone's responsibility to really understand and respond to individual needs so that all children are able to reach their full potential.\r\n\r\nWe intend to send  a group of 12 comprising of our early years practitioners and learning support staff (8), our teachers(2) as well as members of our senior leadership team (2), to both Greece and Germany to attend courses in these countries. This will allow us to compare and contrast the systems they have developed to support those children and families with the highest level of need.  We intend to send the same participants on both courses so they can compare and contrast both systems. By learning about the principled practice that has developed to meet the needs in contrasting education systems ,we will be able to invigorate our own practice,leading to improved outcomes for our own children and families.  By sending representatives of the whole staff team we will ensure that on our return, improved practice is embedded at all levels.\r\n\r\nThe school is committed to developing it's staff team and views a well trained staff as having the greatest impact on outcomes for children. Participants in the training will cascade their learning to other members of the staff team through developing and delivering training to their colleagues . Our nursery has developed close links with the 4 other maintained nursery schools within our local authority and will share our findings , further increasing the reach of the improvements. We have also been developing links with childminders and private and voluntary sector providers , they will also benefit. Our school has also committed to forming cluster groups of nurseries and schools within our local authority to undertake peer review. This will also serve as a conduit to disseminate the learning from our training so that the benefits will reach a much larger staff base and even greater number of children and families.\r\n\r\nBy learning about international practice within a course structure, practitioners will have the  opportunity to grow and develop through an in depth and extended programne of CPD, be reflective and guide children and families to enhanced outcomes.", "http://annbernadtnursery.co.uk/", "Ann Bernadt Nursery School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035418_coordinator"], ["3RA", "School EU Professional Development Project", "St Mary Magdalene CE Primary School", 18997.0, "St Mary Magdalene is a one form entry, Church of England school in Peckham, South London.  Pupils at the school are from diverse backgrounds and linguistic backgrounds.  There are 24 different languages spoken at the school and 21.5% of the pupils are EAL.  15.89% of pupils are described as disadvantaged.  \r\n\r\nSpanish and the International Curriculum have a high status within the school.   For the past six years, children in KS2 (7 to 11 year olds) have received 45 minutes of Spanish each week, led by a specialist teacher.  Children in KS1 and Early Years receive 30 minutes of Spanish each week.  As well as this, class teachers led a 15 minute consolidation session during the week.   Understanding of Spanish speaking cultures is also embedded in the curriculum, for example, in Reception, children learn about Spanish food in the topic 'Viva Espa\u00f1a'.  Each year, in the summer term, the whole school learns about a different aspect of Hispanic culture, as part of, 'Spanish Day'; children dress up and eat a special Spanish lunch!\r\n\r\nWe have found that our children have benefitted enormously from the opportunity to learn a foreign language and enhance their understanding of different cultures around the world.  We believe it is vital for our children to have a deep understanding and respect of other cultures and languages, as well as their own.  By embedding Spanish across the curriculum, our children are keen to  celebrate their differences and similarities.  \r\n\r\nLast year, there were significant changes in the teaching staff team; there are six new class teachers including a new Spanish specialist teacher.  The Spanish specialist teacher is not a native speaker.  After conducting a staff audit, we have found that five of the class teachers lack the confidence to teach Spanish and as a result have not effectively taught the fifteen minute consolidation session.  To continue to develop the Spanish and international curriculum it is vital that these class teachers receive specialist training in MFL pedagogy, Spanish language and Spanish culture.  We also want to further the knowledge of the Spanish specialist, who is new to the role, so she is better able to support and develop the skills of all members of staff.\r\n\r\nWe would like funding to send six class teachers on a one week immersion course in the first year and again in the following year.  S  The course is run by the Malaca Instituto in Malaga, a Cervantes Acredited Spanish Language provider of training since 1971, and includes   21 Spanish lessons during the week, as well as cultural activities and time spent in a Spanish primary school.  Cervantes has provided courses for primary schools across Southwark borough in the past and has a good record of success.    \r\n\r\nOn returning to school it is our aim that all class teachers will have an enthusiastic and confident approach to teaching Spanish.  Class teachers will have the skills to teach Spanish effectively in a fun and engaging way.  Teachers will be better able to support children finding Spanish difficult, as well as extending the more able learners.  We will also be better able  to ensure that Spanish learning is woven into the normal school day.
