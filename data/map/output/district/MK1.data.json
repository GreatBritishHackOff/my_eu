Almost all new entrants to Europe\u2019s market are microbreweries producing speciality beers, and globally craft brewing is growing at 79% a year.\nYet, whilst brewing is diversifying, the production of malt from barley remains an industrial, centralised process. As a result, craft brewers cannot access the local, speciality malts they need; and arable farmers get the lowest value for their crops and have to transport their grains vast distances to industrial maltings.\nTo overcome economic difficulty, Europe\u2019s farmers need innovative solutions to help them diversify, collaborate and grow.\nCustom Laboratory Products has identified a significant market potential for a craft malt system that is cost effective for on-farm use. CAPTIVATE harnesses our 30 years\u2019 experience to recreate \u2013 at small scale - the reliable, quality production of industrial maltings with high control suitable for non-specialists to operate effectively.\nIts scale is ideal for on-farm use empowering farmers to add significant value to their crop, counter the effects of increasing concentration at the processing and retailing stages of the chain, and meet demand for locally produced, high quality malt. CAPTIVATE gives arable farmers an opportunity to access the growing, global craft malt market directly. It will enable them to grow across traditional boundaries, empowering them to sell high value malt, rather than low value barley, directly to end users in the brewing, distilling and food sectors. Our project thus positions farmers as an integral part of a growing, global industry.\nThis innovation project will refine, scale up and commercialise a larger (2.5 tonne), modular and more cost effective version of our existing CAPTIVATE system to meet market demand. In so doing, we will create 162 jobs, and secure \u20ac48.4 million annual revenue and \u20ac18.8 million annual profit in 2021.", 835503.0, 1193575.0, "CAPTIVATE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_209091_923378115"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1BA", "Empowering who sees less; through intercultural exchange and new communication technologies", "VICTA Children", 28884.0, "Empowering who sees less; through intercultural exchange & new communication technologies is a youth exchange set up by a group of young volunteers (ICC Belgium) part of the association KVG. You can find us in Leuven, Belgium from the 23rd of July to the 1 of August 2017. We will gather 58 young visually impaired people (aged 16-23) from 9 EU countries. \r\nWith this exchange we want to:\r\n1. Increase the self-esteem of visually impaired participants (VIP)\r\n2. Increase their autonomy\r\n3. Increase and facilitate their integration\r\n\r\nTo achieve these objectives the young VIP\u2019s will prepare workshops or outdoor activities like: learn to use applications to get around in the city, use social media, learn how to speak in front of the public when you see very little or nothing at all, discover different adapted sports etc. We let the young people prepare all the activities so they will choose the methodology: brainstorming, debates and workshops will be mostly used, but learning from each other too. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the youth exchange the young VIP\u2019s will have created a blog where they can share their experiences and what they have learned. They will also make a podcasts and a radio programme to show the atmosphere of the event and to collect participants\u2019 experiences. A newspaper of the youth exchange will allow their friends and many other people to see what they have achieved and learned. The Open door day planned for the public will give citizens from Leuven and Belgium the opportunity to see the results of the project and experience for a moment what it is to be blind or partially sighted.\r\n\r\nAt a long term the YE opens doors for our young participants to become more independent. They will dare more to learn from their peers who dare already. The acquired knowledge will be used in their daily life and studies, making them active European citizens. At the end of the exchange, the brainstorm with students from KU Leuven on the missing tools or non-covered areas will give research ideas for the students to create something to increase the participation of blind or partially sighted people in our society.", "http://www.victa.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-BE05-KA105-002115_2"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1SW", "CUSTOM LABORATORY PRODUCTS LTD", 831656.0, "Fostering inclusive, innovative and reflective European societies (08.02.03.06)", "fts_2017_24752", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "MK1"}
