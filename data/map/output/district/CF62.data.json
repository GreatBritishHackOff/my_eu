As a result of this collaboration, in April 2016 four students and two teachers from the Hairdressing program of the Cardiff and Vale College center visited us and carried out training practices. The experience was a success so we wish to continue the collaboration. In June four of our students will be doing traineeship in Cardiff companies. The Cardiff and Vale College is a leading center in the area, offering courses of all educational levels and has a great offer of professional training and great experience with companies in the area. For all these reasons we think it is a good partner-intermediary, and gives us confidence and credibility.\r\nAll the internships will last one month and will be held in the second quarter of 2018. They will have a strong linguistic and cultural preparation prior to mobility. It is planned to organize the entire stay (travel, transfers, accommodation and maintenance, insurance), covering all expenses and, in coordination with the host partners, the amounts of the different concepts are managed. This stay will be certified with a diploma of language preparation, a certificate of completion of the practices in the corresponding company, as well as with the Europass Mobility Document.\r\nA secondary objective but equally important, is that this experience serves as a pilot program in order to be able to extend it to the rest of VET studies and to the largest possible number of students.\r\nWe intend this to be a long-term center project, with continuity and expansion throughout the different courses. We hope that international mobility ends up being one of our center inherent characteristics.", "http://www.cavc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037035_1"], ["8YJ", "ECAM: PR\u00c1CTICAS EN  EL EXTRANJERO", "Cardiff and Vale College", 97192.0, "The Escuela Comarcal Arzobispo Morcillo, is a (100%) state-subsidised catholic school in possession of the EFQM European Model of Excellence +400 since 2016. It is dedicated to vocational education and training in different levels and it is located in the Madrid region. Our school and teachers have experience in finding work placements since 1998. Furthermore, the school and the teachers have built along the years a wide network of almost 600 companies. Indeed, we have a trustworthy and long established relationship with those companies which have provided our school with many work placements for our students. Teachers in charge of the work placements are very reliable, communicative and very quick at solving problems. Moreover, they are used to work with companies and monitor students. Our teachers have the social skills needed in order to handle excellent work placements.\r\nBecause of our desire to improve in a European level, in 2012 a team work was created to carry out projects and in 2014 the Erasmus charter for Higher Education besides the first Erasmus project were obtained. As a consequence of the great success, the following year we got it again but for 24 months. In 2017 our target is to achieve it once again in order to ask for the Erasmus+ Vocational Education And Training Mobility Charter.\r\nThis projects contains two activities:\r\n1. Vocational training for one month at workplace in a European Country: the students are around 17 and 22 years old and study Vocational Education Training on commerce, administration, electromechanics, body work repairs, electronics and electricity. 40 students will be sent between 2018 and 2019. \r\n2. Staff mobility for 5 days in a job shadow in colleges: 12 teachers of the different fields studied at ECAM will pay attention to the differences between the way we work in Spain and the work in other European countries so that they can bring us the knowledge and methods to be applied in our school.\r\nBoth activities will be developed in France, Romania and Wales so we will promote the multilingualism. \r\nRegarding the staff involved, a well-prepared mobility team has been created and it is formed by a coordinator, the principle, two head teachers and an economic counsellor\r\nOur desire is both to open our school to the European dimension and to collaborate on achieving  some European objectives such as helping young people to be more qualified and answer qualified workforce demand of entreprises, to take part in an international experience and to enhance employability and improve career prospects at a local, national, European and international level, avoid the early school dropout and encourage students to go on studying a Higher Degree. The students must develop practical knowledge related to their field of study, acquire corporate culture and practical knowledge besides relate it to theory, develop autonomy, improve foreign language competences, enhance intercultural awareness, foster awareness of the European project, increase motivation to take part in future education or training after the mobility period abroad, improve learning performance, increase his/her sense of initiative, self-empowerment and self-esteem. This project will also enhance employability and improve career prospects. Moreover, this mobility project will strengthen cooperation between companies and schools and enhance social cohesion \r\nThe objectives staff mobility must achieve are the following: share teaching practice and improve the skills related to their professional profile, improve both their training  as well as the European education system knowledge, their language skills, their job opportunities, enhance intercultural awareness, promote excellence in teaching, develop innovative teaching methods, learn  how to fight against bullying and pass on what they have learned during the staff mobility period to students and teachers.\r\nThe programme will have an impact and some benefits on students, teachers and our school. The impact on our students is : motivation increase to take part in future education or training after the mobility period abroad, improvement of learning performance, reduction of school dropout, employability enhancement and improvement of career prospects, self-empowerment and self-esteem increase, personal and educational enrichment through the experience and promotion of the European values.\r\n The impact on our teachers is: enhancement of teaching practice, trigger changes in terms of modernization and internationalization in their educational organizations, motivation and satisfaction  increase in their daily work and broaden their horizons. Finally, the expected impact on our  school is: school education project enhancement, teaching quality improvement, school prestige with students enrolment increase and become better in terms of modernization and internationalization.\r\nThe Project 2017 will allow all the community to be better as workers and active people in the European society", "http://www.cavc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037738_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CF62"}
