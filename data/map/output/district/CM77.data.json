CITI-SENSE will develop, test, demonstrate and validate a community-based environmental monitoring and information system using innovative and novel Earth Observation applications.\nTo achieve this, the project will: (i) raise environmental awareness in citizens, (ii) raise user participation in societal environmental decisions and (iii) provide feedback on the impact that citizens had in decisions. It will address the call\u2019s request for effective participation by citizens in environmental stewardship, based on broad stakeholder and user involvement in support of both community and policy priorities. The project aims to learn from citizen experience and perception and enable citizenship co-participation in community decision making and co-operative planning.\nThe concept of CITI-SENSE rests on three pillars: technological platforms for distributed monitoring; information and communication technologies; and societal involvement. Three pilot case studies will focus on a range of services related to environmental issues of societal concern: combined environmental exposure and health associated with air quality; noise and development of public spaces, and indoor air at schools. Attention will be given to representativeness of citizen participation. The case studies will be designed in collaboration with citizens\u2019 groups and decision makers. They will be based on distributed data collection using innovative static, portable and personal devices (low-cost reliable microsensor packs) that communicate with a data repositories through mobile phones or other devices. Development of participatory methods, data management strategies, and applications to facilitate exploitation of the data and information for policy, and society, will be done.", 313327.0, 9805573.0, "CITI-SENSE", null, null, null, "http://www.citi-sense.eu/", "http://www.alphasense.com", null, "fp7_106482_990373978"], ["7AA", "\"Development of a Common Sensor Platform for the Detection of IED \"\"Bomb Factories\"\"\"", "Alphasense Limited", "The detection of IED manufacturing facilities is crucial for the security of citizens, as well as infrastructures and utilities. Current sensing methods suffer from susceptibility to false positive results due to environmental contaminants, or false negative results to interfering compounds. The need exists for a single distributed network, with a common interface and communications protocol, to manage and communicate with a variety of different sensor technologies, and use the combined sensor data to produce clear and unequivocal results with low false positive/negative readings.\n\nThe goal of the CommonSense project is to create and demonstrate this sensor network, through the simultaneous and parallel development of novel materials, portable sensors and a wireless communications network, which uses chemometric data processing algorithms to \u201clearn\u201d to recognise trace amounts of explosives, and differentiate them from interferents. The partners will produce a series of novel organic, polymeric and nanocrystalline materials with tuned optoelectronic properties and surface affinities to be used as the active sensor elements. These elements will be incorporated into devices based on optical, electrical, and other readout mechanisms, for detection of airborne and waterborne analytes.\n\nThe CommonSense project will also incorporate radiation detectors to detect this growing security threat of \u201cdirty bombs\u201d, where sub-critical amounts of radioactive materials, obtained from medical waste or other sources, are incorporated into IEDs. The key point in the use of such a variety of sensor technologies is that no one substance can act as an interferent to all of the sensors, thus reducing false positives and negatives. Eliminating the remaining false readings will be achieved through use of the chemometric algorithms in order to teach itself to recognise the \u201cfingerprint\u201d sensor response to different explosives types and ignore interfering compounds.", 214938.0, 4028040.0, "COMMONSENSE", "Detecting homemade bombs", "An EU project developed chemical and radiation sensors, for deployment throughout cities, which detect the components of bombs. The sensors are connected wirelessly, and novel processing algorithms allow the system to learn.", "With a growing number of threats to the security of European citizens, authorities need the ability to detect a greater variety of dangerous devices. One suggestion is city-wide deployment of a network of wireless sensors that detect the signature traces of bombs.\n\nCurrent sensors are inadequate and unreliable. Hence, the EU-funded project 'Development of a common sensor platform for the detection of IED \"bomb factories\"' (http://www.fp7projectcommonsense.eu (COMMONSENSE)) planned improvements. The eight-member consortium worked to develop the necessary network, using novel sensor materials, communication technologies and data-processing algorithms. The network was designed to enable detection of airborne and waterborne chemical signatures of bomb production, and of chemicals potentially able to mask the targets. The system also includes radiation detectors, for location of 'dirty bombs'. The project operated for three years to the end of 2013.\n\nCOMMONSENSE developed two sensitive sensor types. The nanoelectrochemical sensors detect powerful nitrous explosives, while fluorescence-based optical 'turn-off' sensors detect gas residues of TNT. A radiation sensor was produced that achieved high sensitivity and a low-error rate. In addition, the consortium developed various modules for an integrated housing for the sensors.\n\nThe components were united in a wireless communication network based on several international standards. The application was successfully tested and demonstrated. The team also developed chemometric processing algorithms that 'learn' to better resolve target chemicals while ignoring others.\n\nProject activities included the construction of special facilities for sensor validation and a testing site.\n\nThe COMMONSENSE project developed sensor technologies that will autonomously detect various bomb components. The upshot is increased safety for citizens, without invasive surveillance, and opportunities for European business.", "http://www.fp7projectcommonsense.eu/", "http://www.alphasense.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/153772.jpg", "fp7_97603_990373978"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CM77"}
