It will test current hypotheses that postulate specific changes in ear emergence and the timing and duration of developmental phases, which are thought of as components of ear emergence, will improve wheat productivity. Precise genetic stocks varying in specific flowering time elements and subjected to genotyping and characterisation with diagnostic markers for key flowering time genes will be used to test these hypotheses. They will be phenotyped at the molecular (transcript abundance), physiological (growth stage dissection) and agronomic (yield components) levels in multiple field trials located at sites in Europe that represent regional agricultural diversity and at non European locations that have mega environments of relevance. Controlled environment experiments will investigate specific environmental interactions including day length, ambient temperature, and heat stress. Data analysis will aid the construction of new wheat flowering models that can be used to refine existing hypotheses. They will allow standing genetic variation for flowering time in European germplasm to be deployed more efficiently in wheat breeding programmes. This knowledge will be used to inform searches for specific phenotypic and molecular variants in diverse and non adapted wheat germplasm panels provided by consortium members. Vital novel genetic variation will be efficiently imported into the germplasm of European wheat breeders. The project will deliver new diagnostic markers for genotyping, molecular reporters for novel breeding selection strategies and the tools and knowledge necessary for a combined physiology and genomics led predictive wheat breeding programme. A conduit for these outcomes will be three SMEs, who will exploit the tools developed to deliver these outcomes.", 1997.0, 3910434.0, "ADAPTAWHEAT", "The genetics of flowering in wheat", "Researchers are investigating how genes control flowering time in wheat. They intend to find out how the process influences the overall productivity of this vital crop.", "Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most valuable crops in the world. However, due to increased demand and changing environmental conditions, there is a real chance of global wheat shortages in the future.\n\nTo address this, the EU-funded ADAPTAWHEAT project is investigating and characterising the genetics of the plant's flowering time. One of the main aims of the project is to uncover how these genes are influenced by environmental conditions.\n\nADAPTAWHEAT has screened the genes that control flowering in over 1\u00a0000 different wheat lines, and collected information on the physical characteristics of each line. In addition, new laboratory methods have been developed to track the expression of key genes over the flowering period.\n\nIn order to better understand environmental factors affecting flowering, the various wheat lines were planted in locations within and around Europe. Initial results show potentially relevant genes and gene variations, which need to be confirmed in future field trials. \n\nOther project efforts will focus on incorporating these results into advice for wheat breeders and breeding programmes. Once complete, ADAPTAWHEAT will contribute to the overall sustainability and profitability of wheat agriculture in Europe.", null, "http://www.limagrain.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20141119135943.jpg", "fp7_101673_968661692"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LN7"}
