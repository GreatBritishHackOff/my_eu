However, various threats endanger the sustainability of this key industry: imports from low-cost labour countries outside Europe increased and more than 14,000 employments were lost in the European glass industry during the last 3 years. In addition, glass directly competes with other materials for packaging applications, especially plastics. It is cleaner, non-reactive, tasteless, chemically inert, fully recyclable and transparent but its surface is relatively brittle and prone to scratching which will result in premature breakage during the manipulation of the containers. Weight is also a drawback as an important percentage of the production costs from the food and beverage industries comes from transport of glass containers .\nMost of the glass containers produced nowadays are treated with an organic coating after formation to improve its resistance. There is a great demand from the glass containers industry itself for advanced coatings that allow improvement of mecahnical resistance and weight reduction. OneCoat will develop a coating material and application technology for glass containers based on polysiloxane (silicone) water emulsion with the following characteristics:\n- Competitive in price\n- Improved 30% overall resistance and 25% higher resistance to scratching allowing for a 10% reduction in weight of glass containers and increase of returns cycles (>40)\n- Highly versatile coating technology useful for different industry segments involved in the supply chain of glass containers (manufacturers, decorators and packaging companies).\n- Application by spraying from water emulsion and drying of the material with speeds of up to 800 bottles/min in modern production lines.\n- Compatible with the recycling process of glass.\n- Free of VOCs during the application process and safe for use in contact with foods and edible products", 2465.0, 1042854.0, "ONECOAT", "Cheap, scratch-resistant glass containers", "Despite the advantages of glass over other materials for packaging, the glass container industry must reduce product cost and improve mechanical properties to remain competitive. Novel coatings promise to do both.", "Europe is the global leader in production of glass containers. However, the industry has suffered tremendous losses in recent years as a result of increasing competition form low-labour\u2013cost countries and from producers of other materials, including plastic and metal. Glass is prone to scratching and breaking and its greater weight compared to plastics translates into higher transportation costs. Overcoming these limitations will enable customers to take advantage of the many benefits of glass compared to plastics, including being non-reactive, chemically inert, fully recyclable and transparent.  \n\nA European consortium of industrial partners and two leading research entities are developing advanced glass coatings and process technologies within the scope of the project 'Development of a polymer strengthening coating system for glass containers' (http://www.pulverit.it/onecoat/ (ONECOAT)) . Outcomes promise to achieve production speeds up to 800 bottles per minute of products with a 25 % increase in resistance to scratching, a 10 % reduction in weight and substantial decreases in costs. \n\nONECOAT is focusing on coated glass containers exploiting polysiloxanes (organosilicon polymers) in a polymeric water emulsion for improved resistance to scratching, light weight and durability. Integrating special additives will help reduce costs and make it possible to use decorative pigments as well. Processing will eliminate the use of toxic chemicals and volatile organic compounds. \n\nDuring the first reporting period, scientists conducted extensive investigations into polysiloxane chemistry and polysiloxane resin synthesis and dispersion in water. They have developed sample formulations, including employing additives to improve characteristics, and have tested these on glass samples with two chosen application methods: dip-coating and spraying. \n\nThe project is well on its way to develop improved coating materials and processing technologies for high-performance glass containers compatible with decorative finishing at a competitive price. Outcomes are expected to enhance the position of the numerous small and medium-sized enterprises along the supply chain currently facing stiff competition from other countries and other types of containers. Beneficiaries include glass manufacturers, coatings and pigments manufacturers, and end-users such as wineries, breweries, soft-drink producers and cosmetics manufacturers.", "http://www.pulverit.it/onecoat/", "http://www.imageonglass.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813111920.jpg", "fp7_106811_953552002"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PH7"}
