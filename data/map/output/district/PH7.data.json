However, various threats endanger the sustainability of this key industry: imports from low-cost labour countries outside Europe increased and more than 14,000 employments were lost in the European glass industry during the last 3 years. In addition, glass directly competes with other materials for packaging applications, especially plastics. It is cleaner, non-reactive, tasteless, chemically inert, fully recyclable and transparent but its surface is relatively brittle and prone to scratching which will result in premature breakage during the manipulation of the containers. Weight is also a drawback as an important percentage of the production costs from the food and beverage industries comes from transport of glass containers .\nMost of the glass containers produced nowadays are treated with an organic coating after formation to improve its resistance. There is a great demand from the glass containers industry itself for advanced coatings that allow improvement of mecahnical resistance and weight reduction. OneCoat will develop a coating material and application technology for glass containers based on polysiloxane (silicone) water emulsion with the following characteristics:\n- Competitive in price\n- Improved 30% overall resistance and 25% higher resistance to scratching allowing for a 10% reduction in weight of glass containers and increase of returns cycles (>40)\n- Highly versatile coating technology useful for different industry segments involved in the supply chain of glass containers (manufacturers, decorators and packaging companies).\n- Application by spraying from water emulsion and drying of the material with speeds of up to 800 bottles/min in modern production lines.\n- Compatible with the recycling process of glass.\n- Free of VOCs during the application process and safe for use in contact with foods and edible products", 2465.0, 1042854.0, "ONECOAT", "Cheap, scratch-resistant glass containers", "Despite the advantages of glass over other materials for packaging, the glass container industry must reduce product cost and improve mechanical properties to remain competitive. Novel coatings promise to do both.", "Europe is the global leader in production of glass containers. However, the industry has suffered tremendous losses in recent years as a result of increasing competition form low-labour\u2013cost countries and from producers of other materials, including plastic and metal. Glass is prone to scratching and breaking and its greater weight compared to plastics translates into higher transportation costs. Overcoming these limitations will enable customers to take advantage of the many benefits of glass compared to plastics, including being non-reactive, chemically inert, fully recyclable and transparent.  \n\nA European consortium of industrial partners and two leading research entities are developing advanced glass coatings and process technologies within the scope of the project 'Development of a polymer strengthening coating system for glass containers' (http://www.pulverit.it/onecoat/ (ONECOAT)) . Outcomes promise to achieve production speeds up to 800 bottles per minute of products with a 25 % increase in resistance to scratching, a 10 % reduction in weight and substantial decreases in costs. \n\nONECOAT is focusing on coated glass containers exploiting polysiloxanes (organosilicon polymers) in a polymeric water emulsion for improved resistance to scratching, light weight and durability. Integrating special additives will help reduce costs and make it possible to use decorative pigments as well. Processing will eliminate the use of toxic chemicals and volatile organic compounds. \n\nDuring the first reporting period, scientists conducted extensive investigations into polysiloxane chemistry and polysiloxane resin synthesis and dispersion in water. They have developed sample formulations, including employing additives to improve characteristics, and have tested these on glass samples with two chosen application methods: dip-coating and spraying. \n\nThe project is well on its way to develop improved coating materials and processing technologies for high-performance glass containers compatible with decorative finishing at a competitive price. Outcomes are expected to enhance the position of the numerous small and medium-sized enterprises along the supply chain currently facing stiff competition from other countries and other types of containers. Beneficiaries include glass manufacturers, coatings and pigments manufacturers, and end-users such as wineries, breweries, soft-drink producers and cosmetics manufacturers.", "http://www.pulverit.it/onecoat/", "http://www.imageonglass.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813111920.jpg", "fp7_106811_953552002"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3AN", "Individuelle Begabungsf\u00f6rderung", "Morrison's Academy", 26765.0, "Background information:The Deutschhaus-Gymnasium (DHG) is a grammar school specializing in modern languages and sciences/ technologies and currently has about 1.100 students. There are three main educational areas the school development focuses on:1. the promotion of talent/giftedness (derived from the program of the enhancement of the very skilled students)2. the enhancement of competitive athletes3. ITC in the classroomDue to its innovative methods the DHG has been reviewed by the University of Wuerzburg and other universities for more than a decade. Moreover, it has continuously provided the opportunity for teachers to sit in on classes, which has been done by colleagues from German schools and from abroad. Currently the DHG is being turned into a centre of competence for the enhancement of the highly-gifted, and will then be responsible for the entire administrative district of Lower Franconia in that respect. The school is part of a broad network of other innovative schools and institutions that possess particular competences in a specific or in various of the areas mentioned above, and it will join these competences in this project. The school cooperates closely with universities, companies and organisations in the educational field. The aims of the project:The core idea is to improve the school\u2019s quality through the development of teaching. By offering the opportunity of mutual visits of teachers and the chance of teaching in partner schools, including feedback from partner to partner and by sending teachers to particular workshops, there will be an intensive mutual process of improvement. Another goal is to enhance the European dimension of the school (though student contacts as well) and to lower the rate of school drop-outs. The required skills for the centre of competence are to be systematically established. The number and profile of participants:The tasks for the participants will be defined in the staff teams responsible for the different school development fields. The participants have profound experiences in teaching their subjects and are exceptionally qualified in this respect. There is an adequate number of them who will be able not only to establish the skills gained in this project in their respective school development field but in the whole school and thoughout the administrative district as well. Description of the activities:Sitting in on lessons within the framework of job shadowing (first and second year of the project) will cover a wide scope. After thorough preparations the participants will collect specific information on the underlying conditions and the arrangement of the school\u2019s development of the institution being visited. They will exchange views with the staff of the partner school at a large scale. Colleagues of the partner school in return will be invited to participate in job shadowing at the DHG and pass on their experiences to their own school. There will be two teachers at three schools (including summer academy), with which there are already closer contacts on staff level, who will teach there for one week (predominantly in the second year of the project).In addition, further vocational training as part of seminars will interdisciplinarily enhance language skills. There will be an additional exchange with the partner school in this respect.Proceedings of the project implementationThe school administration will coordinate the entire project in close agreement with the project partners. It will supervise the preparations of the participants and the evaluation and distribution of the results of the project. The counseling of europafels will ensure the intercultural scale of the agreements with the partner institutions. There are no language barriers as all the participants in all of the institutions can communicate competently in German or English. Intended results and effects and intended long-term benefits:By getting to know and critically evaluating other forms of open and distance learning, project work and new media/ digital skills the teachers involved in this project should reflect their own teaching methods and share their views with teachers of the partner schools. The professional contacts between the members of staff in the different partner schools should lead to the establishment of a long-term network, enhanced by interdisciplinary projects reaching beyond one\u2019s own school and thus support the European dimension of the DHG. The results of the project will be continuously evaluated within the framework of vocational training at the school and will be profoundly established in ordinary lessons. Due to the fact that the school as a centre of competence for the enhancement of the very gifted students is responsible for the counseling and training of the staff of other schools.  The results also are feeding into the training program of  eVOCATIOn in Germany and  Austria  as well as into the project work of europafels.", "http://www.morrisonsacademy.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE03-KA101-022752_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PH7"}
