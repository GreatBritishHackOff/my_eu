Nozzle sections made from austenitic steel can be susceptible to rapid crack growth due to thermal fatigue and stress corrosion. Early detection of cracks is therefore essential to ensure the continued safe operation of the facility in question.  In order to reduce the time and cost of such inspections there is an urgent need to develop a system capable of performing a full inspection of nozzles without the need to change probes. The aim of NozzleInspect project is to design an autonomous robot system that able to: reduce the inspection times, Improve defect delectability and sizing, Reduce human intervention which will reduce workforce radiation uptake and Reduce requirement for robotic manipulation and consequently reduce size and cost of robotic deployment system.  The goal of NozzleInspect project is to improve the reliability of the inspection of the welded nozzle sections in nuclear and other safety critical facilities. The robot will carry out a new and novel flexible phased array probe to allow a full inspection of nozzle weld areas and an advanced navigation system that follow the weld in nozzle. The presence of defects in these parts could lead to catastrophic component failure.", 232503.0, 1258389.0, "NOZZLEINSPECT", "Nozzle welds checks by robot", "An EU-funded initiative has built an autonomous robot to carry out safety inspections in nuclear reactors.", "Welded steel nozzle sections in nuclear facilities are regularly inspected as they are susceptible to cracking as a result of heat and corrosion. The nozzles form a critical part of the nuclear reactor and therefore detection of cracks is necessary to ensure safe operation of the facility. However, the nozzles are located in an area subject to high levels of ionising radiation and inspection personnel have a very limited amount of time to enter the reactor and set up and calibrate the inspection equipment.\n\nThe 'Autonomous robot for an automatic inspection of nozzle welds in nuclear environment' (http://www.nozzleinspect.eu/ (NOZZLEINSPECT)) project designed a robot for carrying out this vital work. The overall goal was to automate the procedures for calibration and inspection by developing an integrated system that could be carried to the inspection area and easily installed.\n\nProject partners produced a working prototype of the inspection system to help them overcome any technical issues related to the hardware, thereby enabling them to develop the necessary software control and inspection algorithms. The prototype needed to be large, but light enough to be portable and mounted on wheels. In addition, it had to be stable so that it would not topple over when manoeuvring, and rigid enough to resist clamping and other forces.\n\nResearchers developed a new flexible phased-array probe that enabled a full inspection of nozzle weld areas without the need to frequently change ultrasonic probes. In addition, an advanced navigation system was built that used its 3D steering capability to follow the weld around the nozzle, allowing it to be inspected in a single operation. An ultrasonic technique was also developed for inspecting the nozzle weld, as were analytical tools for interpreting large amounts of 3D data.\n\nThe robot will dramatically reduce inspection time and human intervention, thereby saving time and money, increasing reliability and further protecting personnel from radiation uptake. The NOZZLEINSPECT consortium will market the system to potential end users such as operators of nuclear facilities and inspection service companies. The system will therefore help support the nuclear industry and the wider European economy.", "http://www.nozzleinspect.eu", "http://www.phoenixisl.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58297.jpg", "fp7_93485_998136888"], ["4RF", "DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL INSPECTION TECHNIQUES FOR TRAIN AXLES", "Phoenix Inspection Systems Limited", "The structural integrity of wheel sets used in rolling stock is of great importance to the rail industry and its customers. A number of rail accidents have been directly related to the failure of train axles, leading to increased demands for their inspection and maintenance. Visual inspection and Magnetic Particle Inspection are the current standard practices used for manual non-destructive testing of axles. However, these processes require removal of the wheelset from the wagon/locomotive bogie and full disassembly in order to facilitate access.  Inspection is also carried out by some wagon providers using ultrasonic testing (UT) but its application is also limited to disassembled wheelsets.\n\nAn axle on a wheelset can be connected to a number of ancillary components including breaks and bearings. The disassembly (and reassembly) of axles from the wheelsets/wagon bogey is therefore very time consuming and expensive. There is evidence that even partial disassembly and reassembly could introduce future axle reliability problems. To minimise disruption to their train services but ensure continued safety, train operators require frequent and regular inspection methods that allow quick inspection at the depot with the minimum of wheelset and bogie disassembly.\n\nThe AxleInspect project aims to develop new inspection techniques based on phased array ultrasonic and electromagnetic techniques suitable for the inspection of both solid and hollow axles. For solid axles, inspection techniques are to be developed that inspect from the end face of the axles using new and novel phased array ultrasonic inspection technology. For hollow axles, probes based on UT and electromagnetic inspection techniques are to be developed, enabling detection of surface breaking cracks that cannot be found by ultrasonic inspection. These new techniques will allow inspection of axles whilst they are still attached to their supporting bogey, allowing minimal wheelset disassembly from the train.", 240403.0, 1127834.0, "AxleInspect", "Enhancing train axle safety", "New high-tech inspection methods for train axles, which can be employed without removing the axles from wagons, promise to facilitate rail maintenance and enhance safety.", "European trains are becoming faster than ever as rail technology improves \u2014 a trend that is expected to continue over the next 10 years. However, the increased demand on existing rail infrastructure requires increased safety checks and standards, particularly with respect to the structural integrity of wheel sets and axles. Against this backdrop, the EU-funded project 'Development of novel inspection techniques for train axles' (http://www.axleinspect.eu (AXLEINSPECT)) worked on new inspection techniques to improve the safety and security of rail cars.\n\nIn particular, the project team worked on new techniques for solid axles based on phased array inspection technology. It also developed inspection techniques for hollow axles involving probes that exploit ultrasonic and electromagnetic technology. Importantly, the techniques enable axle inspection while the axles are attached to the supporting bogie, saving precious time and resources.\n\nTo achieve its aims, the project team developed sophisticated probes for inspecting inner and outer surface breaking cracks, as well as automated scanners to deploy the probes. It also conceived a scanning jig to conduct the inspection and developed a bespoke data analysis software. The project then designed an innovated phased array probe based on ultrasonic modelling to enhance crack detection capabilities.\n\nOverall, the powerful inspection technology is intended for verifying the structural integrity of train axles in order to improve safety levels. It promises to give Europe a more competitive edge in the field of train inspection, encouraging train use and cost efficiency.

It is then clear that generic APIs represent a strategic industrial field for EU competitiveness, and it is as well clear that this competitiveness is seriously threatened by the emerging competitors in the Far Eastern Countries (China and India above all). The reasons behind this loss of competitiveness is manifold: (i) lower man power costs in the Emerging countries, (ii) lack of regulatory requirements in the emerging Countries, are the most obvious. The CCRYSTAL main objective is to develop a new technology to crystallize pharmaceutical substances, affording fundamental new approaches to obtain products with high purity levels and constant and reproducible crystalline forms at a competitive price, enabling EU APIs industry to regain his competitiveness against Asian Producers. The innovative proposed technologies are based on a new concept crystallizer and on continuous mode operation. Crystallizer is designed in such a way to assure a perfect actuation of elaborated operation strategies, intended to control the main phenomena involved in crystal formation: (i) Primary nucleation; (ii) Secondary nucleation; (iii) Crystal growth.

It is also recognised that a key enabling technology for achieving this goal entails greater use of continuous processes. A successful outcome will deliver processes which are more energy efficient, have higher yields, better controllability and quality, greater flexibility of output and faster development time. Most importantly, development of effective continuous processing methods will give European manufacturers a significant competitive advantage over Asian producers who have been  progressively eroding the European know how and market share leadership in the API market. The PHARMAGEN project aims to improve the competitiveness of the participants by developing continuous production routes for three specific APIs selected by the SMEs.

Despite this, yield indexes (= wt reactants/wt final product, representing the effectiveness of the processes) for high throughput plants are typically in the region of 1,2 - 1,5, compared to more 10, for pharmaceutical batch processes. Thus, traditional pharmaceutical processes are characterised by  waste levels of 90% plus.

Nanotechnology is a truly enabling technology, with unlimited potential for innovation. However, the novelty in properties and forms of NMs makes the development of a well-founded and robust legislative framework to ensure safe development of nano-enabled products particularly challenging. At the heart of the challenge lies the difficulty in the reliable and reproducible characterisation of NMs given their extreme diversity and dynamic nature, particularly in complex environments, such as within different biological, environmental and technological compartments. Two key steps can resolve this: 1) the development of a holistic framework for reproducible NM characterisation, spanning from initial needs assessment through method selection to data interpretation and storage; and 2) the embedding of this framework in an operational, linked-up ontological regime to allow identification of causal relationships between NMs properties, be they intrinsic, extrinsic or calculated, and biological, (eco)toxicological and health impacts fully embedded in a mechanistic risk assessment framework.  ACEnano was conceived in response to the NMBP 26 call with the aim to comprehensively address these two steps. More specifically ACEnano will introduce confidence, adaptability and clarity into NM risk assessment by developing a widely implementable and robust tiered approach to NM physico-chemical characterisation that will simplify and facilitate contextual (hazard or exposure) description and its transcription into a reliable NMs grouping framework.
