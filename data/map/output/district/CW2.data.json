The development of quantitative risk model enables implementation of data from other parallel activities in USA, Japan and Korea.\n\nThe measurement campaigns in hydrogen refuelling stations, as well as in SMR production units, provide quantitative data, which can be used for identification of canary species, when analysed with help of quantitative risk assessment.\n\nEssential part of the HyCoRA project is hydrogen contaminant research in PEMFC system level. The research is performed in down-scaled automotive fuel cell systems, which can replicate all the features of full-scale automotive fuel cell systems, including the change of gases in the anode and cathode during the start-stop cycling. The contaminants and levels to be studied are, excluding obvious carbon monoxide, determined using risk assessment with help of automotive advisory board.\n\nThe main objective of HyCoRA project is to provide information to lower reduce cost of hydrogen fuel QA.

The Technical School for Mechanical Engineering in Mindelheim seeks to fulfil this demand by offeringstudents an education which will enable them to gain these skills.\r\n\r\nSecondly, global energy and climate problems make the participation in this project even more important. Energy issues are in focus all over the world and there is an enormous potential for saving energy. Our technicians will definitely be involved with energy efficiency measures and will have contact to foreign suppliers or customers in and outside their home country in the course of their future careers. This is why it is so important to enable our students, through this mobility project, to gain experience of finding new solutions through the exchange of knowledge and the development of their problem-solving skills with people from other countries. \r\n\r\nBy staying in a foreign country with a different culture the pupils will not only get practical work experience but will also be confronted with technical problems in a foreign language. In addition, they will have the chance to improve and consolidate their foreign language skills (listening, reading, speaking and writing). Furthermore, staying in another country for a while will increase their intercultural awareness and encourage them to communicate with people who speak a different language and have a different culture from their own. \r\nWithin the scope of the project the attention of the pupils will be drawn to the challenges which can occur when carrying out a (professional) project in which there are participants from other countries or when taking part in a project in another country. At the same time, their (energy) technical knowledge will be consolidated and they will learn how to find and present energy efficiency solutions and measures. \r\nAdditionally, the participants from both sides should become more conscious of energy issues which will strengthen their feelings of responsibility for our common environment. In this way, permanent partnerships for future projects can be cemented, the results can be passed on to third parties and others will be encouraged to do the same. \r\n\r\nThe project participants have all completed a certified vocational training as well as at least one year of practical work experience. The Technical College offers its pupils a diverse vocational education which includes professional training (general education subjects and specialist subjects) as well as the chance to gain key qualifications. All the participants also acquire the training supervisor certificate as part of their technical training at the school. For this, they are required to take part in a 40-hour energy efficiency course certified by the German Chamber of Commerce for which they must pass a final exam. \r\n\r\nAt first, the participants will do a week\u2019s intensive course in English in the partner country including an examination at the end of the course. This course will also provide them with the necessary technical terms. \r\nDuring the second week of the participants\u2019 stay in the UK it is planned to carry out an \u201cEnergy Efficiency Day\u201d for different classes at the host school. This will be based on the knowledge the students gained from their last action/measure which was the creation of an energy efficiency catalogue. The participants will plan, organise and afterwards evaluate this action. A variety of activities relating to the cooperation with the SCC college students, facility management staff, administration staff and the college management will be necessary for the preparation of this action/measure and all kinds of conversational situations in the foreign language, English, will evolve. \r\n\r\nThe German participants, divided into small groups, will be responsible for introducing a variety of energy efficiency-related topics at different workstations and they will organise activities which should take place at different, topic-related places at the school.\r\nAfterwards, the participants' results from the individual days will be collected, evaluated and recorded in a written report which will be presented to the SCC college management.

It is made up of 23 VET programmes belonging to 18 vocational fields.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at meeting the needs of its members, in particular:\r\n-Modernize the schools and boost the appeal and quality of their Intermediate VET \r\n-Acquire the necessary skills to implement the dual learning apprenticeship model\r\n-Initiate or consolidate internationalization \r\n-Incorporate the European dimension in the curriculum\r\n-Improve the participant\u2019s global competences \r\n-Ameliorate key competences in students and boost professional competence in teachers.\r\n\r\nThese needs would translate into the following project objectives:  Contribute to lowering school drop out rates. Diversify the educational offering of the dual learning apprenticeship model. Give educational institutions a global dimension while fostering transnational mobility. Raise employability of Intermediate VET graduates and increase the number of students going on to study Higher VET.\r\n\r\nWith a means to achieve these objectives, two types of mobilities are being considered:\r\n- Mobility of 74 students to take their 5 week on-the-job training in companies in Germany, UK, Italy and Finland \r\n- Mobility of 44 CFGM teachers and members of the Department for Education, with a view to do job shadowing for the dual learning apprenticeship model in Germany the United Kingdom and Findland.\r\n \r\nIn order to make these mobilities a reality, there are 11 European VET shools acting as partners, all of them of considerable size, with international experience and most of them with previous experience of cooperation with the Department for Education. Agreements are celebrated for the exchange of teachers and students. The latter will be sent for internships to the companies with which agreements have been entered. The students will be also mentored by the VET institutions at their destination. The cooperation consists of visits, phone calls and emails.\r\n\r\nParticipants are selected at each educational institution, following a call and based on specific common criteria. Each school takes care of preparing for the visit on different dimensions: pedagogical, cultural, health and safety, trips, protection, etc. This preparation can also be done in cooperation with other schools be it a face to face cooperation or via the Moodle platform created to this effect. The students use the OLS and specific language courses,  and an online course is created for the staff at the Department for education. All participants sign learning agreements/work programs before the mobility takes place. \r\n\r\nThe sending institutions in close cooperation with the host partners organize travel arrangement, lodging and boarding, insurance, and offer the necessary advice to obtain the necessary documentation.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of skills and its communication to members is done using Europass and national instruments (credits for teacher training, recognition of on-the-job training hours, certificate of participation).\r\n\r\nThe assessment plan includes the proposal, methodology, learning results, impact, objectives, dissemination and statistics. It includes questionnaires and/or statistics analysis from the Department of Education and it caters for contingencies or poor quality of activities. \r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes are: \r\n-Increased interest by teachers on European projects \r\n-Growing number of institutions offering the dual learning apprenticeship model; \r\n-Improvement in management of transnational mobility\r\n-Better academic outcomes \r\n-Network creation; \r\n-Decrease in early school leaving rates\r\n-Changes in the Administration to facilitate these projects and their participation in KA2 and KA3;\r\n-Awareness of institutions and regional companies. \r\n\r\nThe impact is measured with numerical indicators calculated from statistical data and questionnaires.\r\n\r\nThe dissemination plan  and achieved results disseminates on traditional, social media and on the Web: the assignment and results of the project, the experiences of participants (reports on the website, dual VET educational sessions); sessions about organization of mobility in Erasmus + FP projects; debriefings to potential participants; hosting of  foreign participants; electronic posting at the end of the project with the results and experiences of participants.

The training activities planned aim to consolidate partnerships with the territory for a detailed analysis of needs and to bridge the gap between training and business needs. The planning and the implementation of the  internships are designed to overcome the seemingly irreconcilable separation between study and labor market  in line with \"Europe 2020\" and the '' Agenda for New Skills and Jobs \"\r\n\r\n2) Change of scope of the mobility flow\r\nStudents\r\nThe 50 internships, lasting three weeks, are aimed to integrate into the curriculum international mobility with an approach geared towards Personal Learning Environment (PLE). This implies that students will be able to use different methods and techniques designed to enhance soft skills: e-Learning on one side and the experiential self-learning in the company on the other hand, without  distinction between the two different times.\r\nIn line with the  PLE methodology the placements will be designed to:\r\n- Address the specific needs of the local  territory and the professional profile of each trainee\r\n- Experience transversal skills in the real production environment\r\n- Broaden the horizons of young people and educate them to mobility\r\n- Strengthen the future employability through experiences that can add value to the curriculum\r\nStudents will develop interpersonal skills; team working; critical thinking; autonomy and pro-activity by interacting with representatives of the business community with whom to share objectives and interests and exchange information and knowledge.\r\nThe internship also represents an important opportunity to put into practice the language skills acquired and to promote linguistic diversity. The active collaboration with the Polish branch of Leonardo Company Finmeccanica Group has created awareness and interest in the Polish language. The participants in placements  in Poland will attend a literacy course to Polish in order to use the national language as the language  during the internship.\r\n\r\nThe 10 internship experiences  lasting one week will enable teachers/staff  to:\r\n- Analyze the soft skills required by the companies appearing on the target markets of local companies\r\n- Receive incentive for educational innovation and test new forms of cooperation in the education sector;\r\n- Plan work placements in an  international context;\r\n- Promoting the comparison in the field of certification of skills in formal and non-formal learning\r\n- Improve language skills;\r\n- Promote the transfer of new organizational methods based on collaboration and teamwork;\r\n- Promote the acquisition of  skills and attitudes that favor the management of change in the workplace.\r\n\r\n3) accompanying Teachers\r\nAs provided by the guidelines of Erasmus + each stream of trainee students will be accompanied by a sending school official for a short period of time, 5 days + two journeyl, to optimize the cost / benefits, but enough to :\r\n- To verify the insertion of the trainee in the new reality\r\n- Check the quality of  accommodation\r\n- Make arrangements with the host institution's tutor and the company\u2019s  tutor\r\n- Ensure the integration in the company and subscription stages of Learning and Training agreements.", "http://www.ccsw.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005851_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CW2"}
