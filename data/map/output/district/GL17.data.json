Young people have thus seen an increase in the time required for access to the first job. This is particularly striking for overseas territories, most of which are island territories where labor markets are narrow open to new entrants. Each year, these markets are characterized by more youth entrants than the number of jobs offered. Thus, the economic dynamics specific to each ultramarine territory fail to absorb the surplus labor coming into the labor market. Moreover, the local and national policies and initiatives implemented today to support the integration of young people into the labor markets do not make it possible to sufficiently anticipate the needs on the territories.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the situation of young people \"not in education, nor in training, neither unemployed nor in employment\" is worsening among young people facing difficulties in entering the labor market. These young people often carry on short-term jobs with periods of unemployment or simply do not find work and end up resigning themselves to inactivity, considering that their chance of finding a job is almost nil. These difficulties are particularly frequent among those who have left the education system on academic failure and without obtaining a diploma. For these young people, a return to training is often difficult and often requires the use of innovative and non-formal teaching methods.\r\n\r\nIn this context, we believe that training opportunities through non-formal education and educational mobility, offered by the Erasmus Plus program but little exploited by professionals and especially ultramarine youth, constitute a real antidote for, on the other hand,  enable young people in difficulty to improve their training and thus increase their chances of entering the labor market.\r\n\r\n==> General objective\r\nThe general objective of this partnership building activity is to develop networks of organizations and to create new partnerships in order to set up projects at European level and within the framework of the Erasmus + program allowing inclusion and employability Of Young People With Fewer Opportunities.\r\n\r\n==> Specific objectives\r\n- Provide tools for participating organizations and youth workers and develop their skills, attitudes and knowledge in the field of inclusion through vocationaleducational  training and mobility, while taking into account the European dimension and the Local contexts ; \r\n-Develop and strengthen partnerships and networks by creating new international and multiplier projects between organizations working with the same target group.\r\n- Understand and share the situations, challenges and challenges faced by young people in the local context of the partners;\r\n- Visit and meet local associations working for the inclusion and employability of the youth with fewer opportunities.\r\n===> The project falls within the overall objectives of the program:\r\n- Strengthen the sharing and exchange of good practices among professionals (leaders, social workers and associations) on the support and employability of the JAMOs;\r\n- Improve the level of key skills and capacities, such as the spirit of initiatives of disadvantaged young people (resident in ZUS, NEET, under legal guardianship ...);\r\n-Promote participation in democratic life in Europe (especially in its ultra-peripheral regions) and on the labor market through social integration and the acquisition of new skills;\r\n- To promote the improvement of the quality of socio-educational activities, in particular by strengthening cooperation between organizations involved in the youth sector;\r\n- Strengthen the international dimension of projects, in particular by promoting mobility and exchanging good practices.", "http://www.ashacentre.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR02-KA105-012718_13"], ["0EA", "Creativity Tools for Youth Work", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", 113720.0, "This is KA1 project devoted to the development and promotion of creativity\u2013based tools and methodology in youth work.

By participating in EVS they will gain a better understanding of other cultures as well as of their own and will inspire others across Europe to celebrate differences rather than incriminate them. \r\n\r\nIndeed, in having France and Germany representing the West, Romania and Greece for the East, Estonia for the North, Spain for the South and Slovenia and Czech Republic for the centre of Europe, we believe we have a good representation of the map of Europe.

With this EVS, we therefore want to represent an equitably European EVS project that embraces its difficulties and celebrates its strengths in order to create more harmony and optimism in the EU. \r\n\r\nThe ASHA Centre has successfully implemented a range of international activities fostering peace and intercultural dialogue. We regularly host local and international groups for different projects promoting the exchange of ideas, harmony and coexistence. We regularly host short-term activities (Leadership Courses, Seminars, Interfaith Retreats and Youth Exchanges, Open Days amongst other) as well as international projects involving individuals from Israel, Palestine, South Africa and India. We are also hosting local and international volunteers working on sustainable development, biodynamic gardening, interreligious dialogue, non-formal education and arts and culture projects. We have excellent local partnerships with several local charities and educational centres. Many of our European participants have been inspired by our EVS volunteers.

The peoples of the world can learn a lot from each other\u2019s philosophical and religious traditions \r\n2.     We are stronger together \r\n \r\nThe importance in our modern European society of intercultural dialogue is perennial. Due to its inherent diversity, and migration from outside the continent, Europe today is a melting pot of cultures, faiths, languages and peoples. Today the need for understanding and connection is even more pressing given the worrying rise in nationalism, racism, economic instability and sense of disaffection across Europe. \r\n\r\nInter-religious understanding is a key challenge within the context of this diversity. Religion has been a powerful and enduring force in all societies at nearly all times. A culture\u2019s religion and philosophical thought encapsulates its people\u2019s values and ideas, sets forward their role models and is integrally related to a sense of identity for many. If we want to understand our fellow Europeans and neighbouring cultures, we must understand each other\u2019s religions. Ignorance of other\u2019s traditions is a key factor in rising xenophobia, nationalism and hostility to refugees. \r\n \r\nIn studying religions one is also learning about how people reflect on and react to what they consider to be of ultimate significance and value. Learning about the approaches of different religions to such questions, and, in so doing, studying multiple perspectives, is also therefore a profound way to reflect on them on the individual level. The benefit of doing so is that we broaden our thinking, resist superficiality, deepen our responses to life\u2019s challenges, and provide a corrective to commercial forces that, if unchecked in our lives, tend to diminish our imaginative, spiritual and intellectual potential. \r\n \r\nTo do justice to the potential depth of the topic, this project will therefore seek to present a diversity of world faiths, consisting of three-week long training activities on the following topics:\r\n 1. Islam (October 2017 course)\r\n2.  Indian Religions (December 2017 course)\r\n3.  Chinese Religions (February 2018 course) \r\n \r\nThis project seeks to go beyond a more common kind of interfaith dialogue which often focuses on the so called \u2018Abrahamic\u2019 faiths of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. This is often to the detriment of religions originating in other parts of the world, which, in terms of population, antiquity, historical influence and cultural richness are just as important. These religions include Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, Bahaism, Taoism and Confucianism.\r\n \r\nThe training activities will each focus on three main areas:\r\n \r\n1.     An introduction to the \u2018basics\u2019 i.e. the origins and main beliefs and philosophy of the religious traditions in question\r\n2.     Ideas within in each culture particularly relevant to European Youth Work (e.g. leadership, political engagement and environmental sustainability)\r\n3.     Interfaith Dialogue in general, its aims, techniques, tools and how to do it in one\u2019s own context\r\n\r\nLong-term project outcomes include enhanced interfaith youth work co-operation, exchange of expertise and good practice between youth workers and increased number and quality of projects dealing with religion and religious issues.", "http://www.ashacentre.org", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", "erasmus_2017-2-UK01-KA105-036971_coordinator"], ["0EA", "Europe's Refugee Crisis and the Role of Youth", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", 31545.0, "This is an innovative Erasmus+ Youth project developed to address the need for a youth work response to the refugee and migration crisis in Europe. \r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s main activity, a residential training course for youth workers, aims to develop youth worker competences and enhance youth involvement for a positive resolution to the refugee crisis, mainly using the International Organisation for Migration\u2019s #MigrantsContribute campaign and the IOM/UNHCR Not Just Numbers Manual. \r\n\r\nSince our inception, the ASHA Centre has sought to create a special space where we can contribute to the fostering of a \u2018truly global human community.\u2019 To this end we seek to: \r\n\u2022 Learn to respect and work with other people\u2019s perspectives, \r\n\u2022 Be part of an interconnected and interdependent world, \r\n\u2022 Discover the richness of other countries, cultures and faiths, \r\n\u2022 Make human connections across social and cultural divides, \r\n\u2022 Transform past prejudices and cultural biases and \r\n\u2022 Live harmoniously in an environment of diversity and change. \r\n\r\nThe project is a direct reflection of the interests and needs of young people in partner countries and organisations across European countries affected by the refugee crisis. \r\n\r\nOver the last four years the Middle East and Europe have been affected by wars, revolutions, armed conflict and tensions between societies and communities.

It will support the objective of the Erasmus + programme in a way that is clear, visible and has the potential for a vastly multiplied effect.", "http://www.ashacentre.org", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", "erasmus_2017-3-UK01-KA105-046304_coordinator"], ["0EA", "PEACE THROUGH THE PERFORMING ARTS", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", 107310.0, "Peace through the Performing Arts is a training project for young people and youth workers, the ultimate goal of which is to promote peace in Europe. It will be made up of three, nine-day courses to take place at The ASHA Centre, UK - led by the Centre\u2019s in-house team of theatre-professionals. Its essential premise is that theatre is an effective method for supporting social cohesion and that - by empowering a new generation of youth workers with theatre-based tools and techniques - a real contribution to peace can be achieved. \r\n\r\nThe project is a partnership between UGiN Nova Gradiska (Croatia), Seiklejate Vennaskond (Estonia), YouthFully Yours (Greece), Vulcanicamente (Italy), CET platforma Skopje (Macedonia), Asociatia Hair Redivivus (Romania), TDM2000 Polska (Poland) and ASHA (UK). \r\n\r\nThe ASHA Centre has an strong track-record of work in this field. It has previously delivered a number of drama-based peace projects, one of which, \"Acting it Out,\" received an 'Outstanding Project' award from the European Commission, and which generally have received international recognition. This has included praise from Nelson Mandela who enjoyed a performance of an ASHA production with South African young people at his home. It\u2019s production of Arabian Nights with young Jews and Arabs from northern Israel was described as \u201cthe greatest grass-roots contribution to peace in the region for decades\u201d \u2013 and directly led to a powerful transformation in the lives of its participants. \r\n \r\nThe project\u2019s three component courses will have a similar structure and some elements in common. They will all involve a creative investigation of the causes of conflict and their resolution, leading to a public presentation of scenes from Shakespeare. They will all engage participants in drama-based activities, through which they will learn tools and techniques of theatre as well as develop greater confidence in speech and movement. In other ways, the courses will be very different. The first will focus on cycles of violence, the second on radicalisation, the third on gender based conflict. Different supporting methodologies will be brought forward in each case, ranging from Theatre of the Oppressed to the Hero\u2019s Journey to Non-Violent Communication. \r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of the project is to empower youth workers to carry out peace-projects in their home countries and, to this end, we will support participants to conceive and develop their ideas for action.  As a learning experience we will help participants develop: heightened powers of empathy, a stronger sense of responsible citizenship, greater confidence and will to lead. We will facilitate a deeper understanding of the dynamics of conflict and how they can be creatively addressed. We will support a stronger  commitment to the vision and values that underpin the European mission. \r\n\r\nIt total, we expect around 96 people to directly engage with the project as participants. We expect a further 650 people to participate indirectly by attending one of the public performance or dissemination events. Our hope is that each one of those individuals will receive a seed of inspiration for future activities and that the multiplying effect of this will amount to something genuinely substantial in the field of peace-work. Our dissemination activities will include daily Facebook updates, an online short film, public performances and promotion at future European seminars. We are keen to promote awareness of both the project itself and the principles that underlie it.   \r\n\r\nWe have conceived the project in response to requests from other organisations and our own observation that peace is best achieved through creative means that engage people in shared, artistic activity. Its content is structured in accordance with a three-fold picture of the human being, in which people are seen as having faculties of thinking, feeling and willing \u2013 which need to be addressed in balance. Our approach will, therefore, be holistic and non-formal. Once the course is complete, we will evaluate it on the basis of detailed feedback from a number of sources, including that of our participants and course-leaders. \r\n\r\nEurope is an increasingly violent continent with growing tensions between individuals and communities. Simmering international conflicts as well as the rise of extremism and radicalisation mean that we can no longer feel safe in the assumption of peace. On the contrary, we must work for it. The goal of Peace through the Performing Arts is to equip a new generation of youth workers with the knowledge and confidence to be effective peace-workers. It is a plan for empowerment, whose goal is to strengthen the hearts and minds of young people so that they can become effective agents of change. It will harness the arts to the mission of peace, demonstrating that, through our feelings and human creativity, we are inherently connected and able to cohere.", "http://www.ashacentre.org", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", "erasmus_2017-3-UK01-KA105-046468_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["0EA", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", 49951.0, "Promoting non-discrimination and equality (33.02.02)", "fts_2017_28038", 2017], ["0EA", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", 18018.0, "Eastern Partnership \u2014 Poverty reduction and sustainable development (22.04.02.02)", "fts_2017_45289", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "GL17"}
