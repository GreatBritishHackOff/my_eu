Numerous attempts have been made, some very recent, but all have been sub optimal and most have failed completely. These failures are due to a lack of underpinning research and of certain key components. The project has the following objectives: Zero emissions to air and zero external noise and vibration in port Reduction of overall fuel consumption by 30%, tending to &gt;90% on applications such as long distance sailing boats using regenerative techniques CO2 reduction of &gt;30% in all \u201coff design point\u201d applications (e.g.fishing boats and small commercial ferries) 50% reduction in HC &amp; NOx The market for small hybrid drive systems is tens of thousands of units and the aggregate social and environmental benefits are substantial. A holistic approach will be taken to total energy consumption and production on board. At the centre of the new system will be a comprehensive energy management module which will supervise and control energy flows in and out of a specially designed battery bank. The NMEA 2000 standard will be developed as necessary for the new data formats. Safety issues will be addressed by developing new ISO standards. The following research, development and validation will be carried out: High efficiency, low speed, torque following propeller Rim drive propulsor using an embedded permanent magnet DC (PMDC) motor and contra rotating blades Load following, dynamic PMDC motor and generator controllers High efficiency DC to DC converters High efficiency AC to high voltage DC multi output battery charger Control algorithms for key components The final deliverables will be a validated hybrid drive system for small craft, a design tool, critical new components including a new propeller, and contributions to NMEA and ISO standards.", 120077.0, 2600768.0, "HYMAR", "More power to small boats", "EU researchers have developed a marine propulsion system for small craft. The market for such small hybrid drive systems is large, and the social and environmental benefits are substantial.", "Marine diesel electric and hybrid drive systems, where the power is generated by more than one source, have been used in large ships and submarines for many years. However, until now it has not been possible to transfer such systems successfully to smaller craft.\n\nAchieving this was the goal of the 'High efficiency hybrid drive trains for small and medium sized marine craft' (HYMAR) project funded by the EU. The project set out to develop an optimised hybrid system that would be close to being market ready.\n\nAt the end of its third year, the HYMAR project carried out a major re-evaluation of all the data it had collected. The conclusion drawn from this analysis was that the initial focus on serial hybrid systems had been misplaced, and that the project's objectives would be better met by parallel hybrid systems.\n\nThus, the project team was granted a project extension in order to explore other options. This enabled HYMAR to develop a parallel hybrid system that has since been installed, tested and validated on marine craft. The project has also developed modified lead-acid batteries that demonstrate enhanced performance in hybrid applications. Furthermore, HYMAR has built a comprehensive energy management module and graphical user interface able to control the energy flows of an entire craft.\n\nThe optimised hybrid system developed during the project offers three major advantages: no detectable emissions, no discernible noise and a substantial reduction in fuel consumption. Although the project is now complete, some relatively minor work remains to be done to make the system a market-ready solution for both commercial and recreational craft.", null, "http://www.triskelmarine.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2013-06/57677.jpg", "fp7_92079_972239828"], ["1DF", "A cybersecurity situational awareness and information sharing solution for local public administrations based on advanced big data analysis", "Caris Research Ltd", "Cybersecurity is one of today's most challenging security problems for commercial companies, NGOs, governmental institutions as well as individuals. Reaching beyond the technology focused boundaries of classical information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity includes organizational and behavioural aspects of IT systems and also needs to comply to the currently actively developing legal and regulatory framework for cybersecurity. For example, the European Union recently passed the Network and Information Security (NIS) directive that obliges member states to get in line with the EU strategy. While large corporations might have the resources to follow those developments and bring their IT infrastructure and services in line with the requirements, the burden for smaller organizations like local public administration will be substantial and the required resources might not be available.\nNew and innovative solutions that will help local public administration to ease the burden of being in line with cybersecurity requirements are needed. For example, cooperation and coordination is one of the major aspects of the NIS and EU cybersecurity strategy. An enabling technology for cooperation and coordination is cyber situational awareness and information sharing of cyber incidents. In this project we propose a cybersecurity situational awareness solution for local public administrations that, based on an analysis of the context provides automatic incident detection and visualization, and enables information exchange with relevant national and EU level NIS authorities like CERTs. Advanced features like system self-healing based on the situational awareness technologies, and multi-lingual semantics support to account for language barriers in the EU context, are part of the solution.", 205082.0, 4065231.0, "CS-AWARE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_210224_947374266"], ["1DH", "Nutritious, safe and sustainable seafood for consumers of tomorrow", "Westcounty Mussels of Fowey Ltd", "SEAFOODTOMORROW aims to validate and optimize commercial solutions for improving the socioeconomic and environmental sustainability of the seafood production and processing industry, while contributing to product quality and safety.

The proposal will take into account impacts across different regions and population segments, as well as the specificities of different types of seafood.\nActivities will include among others: utilization of agro and seafood byproducts to develop sustainable feeds for aquaculture enabling the production of tailor made products fortified with specific essential nutrients for consumers, assess the feasibility of salt replacers in seafood, validate digestible, attractive, functional and nutritionally adapted seafood for senior people and youths, validate strategies to prevent/remove contaminants from seafood, and optimize sensors and biosensors for the assessment of safety, among others.\nThe consortium expects strengthening the wider utilization of eco-innovative solutions, as a result of greater user acceptance, higher visibility of these innovative solutions and creation of scalable markets, and increasing the availability of healthier seafood to improve consumers' diet and health. The consortium is built on interdisciplinary research teams of 19 RTDs involved, renowned by its top-quality applied technological development and with strong and cohesive links gathered in previous funded activities (e.g. FP7 ECsafeSEAFOOD), thus anticipating successful outcomes.
