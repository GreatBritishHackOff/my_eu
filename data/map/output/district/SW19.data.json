Addressing the challenges that may arise in their personal or professional life, will make them develop new skills and also learn new abilities; and by overcoming these challenges, they will also overcome their fears and, by doing so, will be more confident.\r\nOpen Windows I (OWI) aims to be the first of several European projects aimed to \"open windows\" in our students, in our center and in our environment. \"Open Windows\" to allow fresh air to enter, to ventilate and open minds.\r\n\r\n1. Context and Background\r\nIn the line of work described above, our Center has been working with the Wimbledon Village Stables (WVS) for several years in the training of instructors. The basis of our relationship is centered on the complete end to end personal and professional development of the student: as a person, rider and instructor. This is a shared vision that is enriched with the particularities of their different nationalities.\r\nWhat has driven us to strengthen previous collaboration, so that it could also reach our students, is to realise the enormous benefits, not only for the maturity they acquire, but also for the opportunity to learn in one of the cradles of horse riding and, more specifically, the discipline that we practice and teach, the English Discipline.\r\n\r\n2. Goals / Targets\r\nThe goals we intend to achieve with the launch of OWI are:\r\n\u2022 Improve students' language  skills\r\n\u2022 Develop and Improve students personal autonomy and decision making\r\n\u2022 Promote European identity and awareness of belonging to European citizenship\r\n\u2022 Encourage knowledge exchange and collaboration among European companies\r\n\u2022 Make Erasmus + been known as a program that generates added value to VE (Vocational  Education)\r\n\u2022 Associate San Ignacio corporate VT image with the European image promoted by the Erasmus +\r\n3.

Methodology\r\nFor the development of this project \"Open Windows I\" (OWI) it has been necessary to answer the following questions:\r\n\u2022 Where will OWI be developed? (Context and Background)\r\n\u2022 What do we intend to achieve? (Goals)\r\n\u2022 What tactics and strategies will we use? (Methodology)\r\n\u2022 What resources will we have? (Resources)\r\n\u2022 How will we assess OWI's execution? (Evaluation)\r\n\r\nWe have started from the knowledge of the environment and we have analysed the initial situation in order to carry out a careful analysis of the needs; since this depends on the use of participation in the Erasmus+ Program.\r\nWe have also paid special attention to the relationship between objectives and planned activities.  And finally we have aimed to ensure a clear and lasting impact in our Centre.\r\n\r\n5. Results and expected impact\r\nThe achievement of the established goals will suppose a significant change in our educational community. By focusing on methodologies aimed at enhancing students' social and personal skills that will help us to improve their training, we hope to correct the following weak points which we have detected:\r\n\u2022 Poor language skills and poor student maturity\r\n\u2022 TECO\u00b4s Degree poor employable level \r\n\u2022 Traditional poor image of the VE, for being considered as a \"plan B\" of the educational system\r\n\r\n6. Long-Term Benefits\r\nAn important improvement in the training of students will be achieved, both in academic-professional and personal performance, that we sincerely expect to redound to an increase in the number of students interested in participating in European Projects. \r\nOther medium-long term benefit is to apply the same or similar scope to other educational stages of the School (Secondary and High School), so that a higher level of internationalization is achieved, which is one of the core values of our Centre.\r\n\r\nSan Ignacio de Loyola is part of the BEDA Program, which consists in a gradual implementation of a bilingual Spanish-English teaching at the School.
