This Fused Speaker Identification will result in significantly higher true-positive speaker identification, reduced False-Positives/Negatives while increasing reliability & confidence. SIIP analyzes rich metadata from voice samples and social media. SIIP provides judicial admissible evidence for identifying crime/terror suspects as well as for mapping/tracing the suspect terror/crime network. SIIP is crucial when individuals use Internet-based applications (e.g. VoIP or social media) to plan a crime or terrorist attack. SIIP's results can easily be shared with relevant authorities based on a sustainable SIIP Info Sharing Center (SISC) located at INTERPOL. SISC guarantees an increased reliability of the identification results through advanced technologies and through voice samples checked against a large centralized database of samples collected by INTERPOLs 190 members (based on standard operating/data privacy procedures). SIIP multiplies and increases the information sharing and cooperation in the LEA community and speeds up the use of Speaker Identification by LEAs in Europe not only for individual identification but also for authentication. SIIP runs on all speech sources (e.g. Internet, PSTN, Cellular and SATCOM) and uses the latest OSINT data mining applications to obtain and corroborate voice samples. The SIIP consortium consists of 17 partners bringing together end-users, SME\u2019s, industrial and academic partners from a variety of fields including Speech analytics, Social Media Analytics and Integration.

The CREDITS4HEALTH approach is virtuous and straightforward: 1)First, we will define personalised algorithms containing dietary and physical activity prescriptions, taking into account the medical, psychological, social, and economic background of each person; 2) Once screened by the local Credits4Health Committee, the participant receives an electronic card, which enables him to track his compliance to the regime through a dedicated web based platform; 3)With his electronic card, the participant also gets access to a full range of suppliers which offer him goods for fulfilling his health-related objectives;4)Suppliers must be certified by the local authority, according to a specified set of requirements and they must certify the products they intend to commercialise for this initiative;5)Participants gain credits as far as they comply with their daily, weekly and monthly goals; they are also subject to a six monthly mandatory assessment performed by the Credits4Health Committee, in which the algorithm can be modified and fine-tuned to the needs of the participant.", 192759.0, 5924163.0, "CREDITS4HEALTH", null, null, null, "http://www.credits4health.eu/index.php", "http://www.c3health.org", null, "fp7_109922_951096350"], ["7SQ", "BESAFE\nBiodiversity and Ecosystem Services: Arguments for our future Environment", "Economics for the Environment Consultancy Limited", "In order to protect biodiversity, policy makers increasingly require demonstration of its value.
