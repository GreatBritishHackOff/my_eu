It aims at sharpening the focus of European manufacturing through a number of application experiments, while adopting an innovative approach which ensures comparative performance evaluation. Each challenge is launched via an open call and is structured in 3 stages. 45 Contestants are selected using a challenge in a simulation environment: the low barrier of entry allows new players to compete with established robotics teams. Matching up the best Contestants with industrial end users, 15 Challenger teams are admitted to the second stage, where the typical team is formed by research experts, technology suppliers, system integrators, plus end users. Teams are required to benchmark use cases on standard robotic platforms empowered by this consortium. After a mid-term evaluation with public competition, the teams advance to showcasing the use case in a realistic environment. After an open judging process, 6 Challenge Finalists are admitted to run pilot experiments in a real environment at end-user sites to determine the final EuRoC Winner. A number of challenge advisors and independent experts decide about access to the subsequent stages.

The ENCOMPASS concept takes a comprehensive view of the L-PBF process chain through synergising and optimising the key stages. The integration at digital level enables numerous synergies between the steps in the process chain and in addition, the steps themselves are being optimised to improve the capability and efficiency of the overall manufacturing chain.\n\nENCOMPASS addresses the three key steps in the process chain: component design, build process, and post-build process steps (post-processing and inspection). The links between these stages are being addressed by the following five interrelations: \n1.\tBetween the design process and both the build and post-build processes in terms of manufacturing constraints / considerations to optimise overall component design \n2.\tBetween the design process and build process component-specific L-PBF scanning strategies and parameters to optimise processing and reduce downstream processing\n3.\tBetween the design process and the build and post-build processes in terms of adding targeted feature quality tracking to the continuous quality monitoring throughout the process chain \n4.\tBetween the build and post-build processes by using build specific processing strategies and adaptation based on actual quality monitoring data (for inspection and post-processing) \n5.\tBetween all stages and the data management system with the integrated design decision support (IDDS) system\n\nBy considering the entire AM process chain, rather than the AM machine in isolation, ENCOMPASS will integrate process decision making tools and produce substantial increases in AM productivity, with clear reductions in change over times and re-design, along with increased \u2018right-first time\u2019, leading to overall reductions in production costs, materials wastage, and over-processing. This will lead to higher economic and environmental sustainability of manufacturing, and re-inforce the EU\u2019s position in industrial leadership in laser based AM.", 698313.0, 3526772.0, "ENCOMPASS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.the-mtc.org", null, "h2020_205599_959490342"], ["9JU", "Industrial scenarios for connected factories", "The Manufacturing Technology Centre Limited Lbg", "There is a consensus among industry and policymakers that Europe is currently in the middle of an industrial revolution initiated by the digitisation of industrial processes.

EU industries are well placed to benefit from the new ICT- driven industry, but a challenge is for SMEs to participate in and to benefit from the new industrial revolution. To turn this vision into reality for European SMEs the I4MS project aims to increase the uptake of ICT by manufacturing  SMEs. It does so through innovation and support actions. The Access to I4MS (XS2I4MS) project is  a support action to advance the European I4MS community, and expand its coverage, notably through the I4MS Mentoring programme which is aimed at supporting the establishment of a network of Digital Innovation Hubs. \nXS2I4MS supports the continued expansion of services provided to DIHs in a number of ways. It has established a special section on the single portal for the I4MS community (WP1). The project builds a solid information base for I4MS in WP2 - the I4MS Observatory. Sharing best practices and dissemination (WP3) aims to extend the reach and impact of IMS as widely as possible through the collection of information about other digitization activities in Europe. Brokerage support and information activities (WP4) are aimed at supporting a key task of the DIH and also focuses on the assessment how DIHs can be financed. Specifically, the outreach activities in WP5 (Mentoring and Coaching for Regional Innovation Hubs) aim to extend the network to include SMEs in regions not currently participating in I4MS. WP6 (Management and Coordination) will ensure effective coordination of tasks.\nThe XS2I4MS consortium presents a strong mix of organisations to realise excellence and impact. Three large European applied research organisations, TNO, Fraunhofer and VTT, have as their core business transfer of technologies to manufacturing. They have state-of-the art facilities in open innovation. They have programs tailoring technologies and business models to the needs of SMEs.
