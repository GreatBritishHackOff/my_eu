The current method of linking these parts together is by mechanical coupling. Effective decontamination of such instruments is challenging but is critical to avoid cross infection between patients. The geometry of the instrument assembly (particularly bone reamers and similar tools used in joint implants) have crevices at the joints which are difficult and expensive to clean and fully sterilise. Welded instruments would eliminate this problem.\n\nApproximately 7000 cases of MRSA infections were reported in UK hospitals during 2007 and similar issues are prevalent across Europe. Such infections are of particular concern in post-surgery patients. The CleanTools project aims to develop technology which will reduce this issue by making surgical instruments easier to clean and disinfect. The crevice between stainless steel cutting heads and Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) flexible shafts currently makes decontamination challenging, time consuming and chemically intensive. Additionally there have been instances of cutting heads becoming detached from the flexible drive shaft during use, causing undue implications in theatre and potential long term impacts on patient quality of life.\n\nThe desirable materials for these tools, such as SMAs and stainless steels, are challenging to weld and their properties are severely degraded when they are melted in conventional welding. CleanTools will provide a method for the manufacture of surgical instruments containing SMA materials though the use of rotary friction welding (RFW). RFW is a low heat input solid phase welding technology that will preserve the properties of the materials in question. CleanTools will improve the function of flexible surgical instruments, reduce the required cleaning and disinfection effort, improve reliability and reduce the cost of manufacture within Europe.", 64223.0, 1184346.0, "CleanTools", "Better surgical tools for fewer infections", "Many flexible tools used in orthopaedic surgery are made of multiple materials linked by mechanical coupling. Using a no-melt welding process instead promises to improve sterilisation of hard-to-reach places.", "Bone reamers are used to form or enlarge holes in bone prior to insertion of prostheses. They are made of stainless steel cutting heads and shape memory alloy (SMA) flexible shafts. Mechanical coupling creates crevices that are difficult to clean and sterilise, increasing the risk of infection and, increasingly, of antibiotic-resistant infection. Welding could eliminate the crevices and contamination but the properties of stainless steel and SMAs are severely degraded when melted.\n\nTo solve the problem, scientists launched the EU-funded project http://www.cleantools.de/ (CLEANTOOLS). The team is exploiting rotary friction welding (RFW), a novel solid-state process that softens materials with friction heat and coalesces them with compressive force.\n\nUtilisation of RFW will require careful consideration of the materials for biocompatibility, service requirements and weld properties. In addition to legislative and literature reviews, researchers conducted experimental tests pointing to the need for an interlayer between the SMA and the stainless steel.\n\nNumerous weld trials have been conducted with the selected materials to optimise weld parameters to achieve required joint strength and ductility. Having demonstrated consistent tensile and guided bend test results, the team is now investigating commercialisation opportunities for this novel technology.\n\nCLEANTOOLS is on its way to delivering a method for producing surgical instruments with enhanced function and ease of cleaning. Exploitation of RFW will improve reliability, decrease manufacturing costs and reduce patient infections for major benefits across the board.", null, "http://www.coringroup.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/148693.jpg", "fp7_102178_959926454"], ["1QA", "Real Time, Secure Equine ID Information Platform (EQR-Equid)", "Equine Register Limited", "Criminal activities associated with horse and ponies are widespread across Europe. Horses and ponies are principally identified by a paper based \u2018passport\u2019, and/or micro-chip, or branding.  Passports are hand written and therefore prone to error, falsification and fraud. They can easily be \u2018recycled\u2019 from dead animals allowing contaminated horsemeat to enter the human food chain. Likewise, micro-chips can easily be removed or cloned. Purchasers of equidae have little assurance that \u2018their animal\u2019 is the one in the passport.\n\nEquine Register Ltd. are developing an exciting new equine identification method for vets, government agencies, welfare organisations and horse owners - EQR-Equid. Our solution uses an inclusive secure, remote-access data system underpinned by smart behavioural pattern recognition algorithms, that can automatically identify disease spread, criminal activity, missing animals and compliance issues. Via an intuitive interface, EQR-Equid allows equine sector stakeholders to identify and track an animal securely from anywhere, at any time, whilst enabling enforcement agencies to target their resources. EQR-Equid\u2019s accuracy, connectivity and immediacy will deliver increases in animal welfare, animal value, compliance and data confidence whilst reducing the opportunity for fraudulent activity.\n\nThe objective of our overall innovation project is to develop EQR-Equid for sale to those involved in the trade, enforcement, and welfare of equidae. The specific objectives of our Phase I project are to carry out a feasibility study to enable us to create a clear path for market replication.  Our sales forecast shows a projected turnover of \u20ac6.3m by 2023, 5 years after launch.
