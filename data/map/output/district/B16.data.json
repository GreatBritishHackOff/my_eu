Furthermore , if a good command of language is desirable for any profession, for this student body it result transcendental. In addition to be a requirement, it allows access to worldwide\u00b4s contents and available opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project also plans the mobility of 10 students from the professional medium degree training cycle of technician in animation of physical activities and sport in natural environment.

The shortage of labour opportunities and the requirement of this increasing competitiveness market, make necessary that the training must be complete with other types of experiences, formations and activities.
