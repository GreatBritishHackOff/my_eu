They will deeply dive in the local social life together with their guest-families and their work-mates.\r\nEven on weekends every spare minute will be full of activity: London is a must-see for visitors in the UK and maybe a premier-league-game is worth to see. To go shopping, pub-crawling and making friends would be exciting, too.\r\nThe target behind these activities is to overcome the natural speeking-bareer in one's head and to navigate savely in a foreign environment with unusual weights, measurements, even other money than what our young students know from their home.\r\nSo the effect of the project will be, that young people, our next generation, will get empathy for europe with all its commons and diversions. Hopefully they will see their personal chances in our great European Community and get the profits of this Union for their own careers on job, learning and living. \r\nMaybe - or better: for sure - this project helps to keep Europe closer together and every partipiciant realizes, that the chances of our European Community are bigger than the misfits.", "http://www.irisbertz.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-004023_1"], ["8QG", "\u00c9change de jeunes sportifs entre villes jumel\u00e9es", "Birmingham Sport and Physical Activity Trust", 20110.0, "The Europod exchange programme has been running for 8 years, initially involving Frankfurt and Lyon sports clubs and participants, but included Birmingham clubs and participants in 2016 as a pilot project. This pilot project was a success and plans are in place for the involvement of young people from Birmingham to be increased in future years. The overall exchange involves over 400 young people participating in sporting activity across 15 different sports. The organisation of the exchange is joint-working between Office des Sports Lyon, Sportjugend Frankfurt and Sport Birmingham. \r\n\r\nThe exchange has come about because the cities of Lyon, Frankfurt and Birmingham are twinned cities and this project forms a small part of the partnership working that occurs between the three cities. The majority of the participants will be from disadvantaged backgrounds and those with limited opportunities to participate in such activities. \r\n\r\nThe sports element of the project is used as a driver for the youth exchange, as this is at the heart of the young people's passions. By bringing together the young people through a shared love of sport, there will be opportunities for the young people to connect with their European counterparts, share ideas and develop skills that can assist them with their development. This will all help to meet our wider agenda of making the young people feel more European, raise their level of aspiration and increase their motivation to reach their full potential. \r\n\r\nThe principle of the exchange is around building a world in which sport is an essential lever to bring populations and communities together. The programme will look to provide opportunities for skill development within their chosen sport, other sporting and activity opportunities, while also providing learning on cultural and history of the partner cities involved, with key trips and activities organised. \r\n\r\nThe continuation of this project will allow greater partnership working with Frankfurt and Birmingham with the aim of widening opportunities available to young people within Lyon.", "http://www.sportbirmingham.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR02-KA105-012601_1"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["8DN", "SPORT 4 LIFE UK", 16847.0, "Developing the European dimension in sport (15.02.03)", "fts_2016_33758", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "B16"}
