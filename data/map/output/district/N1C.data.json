Our aim is to lead inclusive debate and action which promotes the role of women in music and the potential creative and economic contribution they could be making to Europe\u2019s music industry.Showcases, networking events and a Creative Lab Capacity Building programme will give a new network of 60 women the chance to build a sustainable international profile and extend their reach to audiences in Europe and beyond. The Lab provides opportunities for music creators to connect with the pioneering work of artists and entrepreneurs from tech, design, AV and other sectors which shape change and new business models. These activities will be backed by a dynamic web/social media platform that offers learning opportunities to hundreds of women from beyond Keychange\u2019s network, raising awareness of the music gender gap through targeted stories, case studies and tips.  Keychange activities will be devised, run and hosted by 6 European music festivals and an associate festival in Canada to extend the project\u2019s sharing of European values. To maximise new thinking, our Creative Lab will include an \u201cinnovation fund\u201d which offers small bursaries to Keychange participants to test new ideas and ways of working. A bold communications strategy backed by high profile artist ambassadors, pioneers and executives will maximise the project\u2019s impact. Through Keychange we tackle discrimination whilst enabling more women to develop new skills/business models and realise their potential as catalysts for creative change. Longer-term, partners will continue to collaborate on Keychange\u2019s manifesto, social media platforms and innovation fund. Keychange alumni will become role models for next generations.", "http://www.prsformusicfoundation.com", "THE PERFORMING RIGHT SOCIETY FOUNDATION", "creative_583777-CREA-1-2017-1-UK-CULT-COOP1_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["4AG", "THE PERFORMING RIGHT SOCIETY FOUNDATION", 95704.0, "Culture -programme \u2014 Supporting cross-border actions and promoting transnational circulation and mobility (15.04.02)", "fts_2017_39861", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "N1C"}
