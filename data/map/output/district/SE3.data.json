There are more than 5000, overall affecting about 30 million citizens of all ages in the EU. RD are often life-threatening and chronically debilitating, and healthcare is impaired by limited knowledge.\nCollaborative efforts are needed to tackle RD to prevent significant morbidity, perinatal or early mortality, to reduce socio-economic burdens and to improve an individual\u2019s quality of life.\nRARE-Bestpractices aims to improve clinical management of RD patients, narrowing the existing gap among EU MS and other countries, also considering the application of patients\u2019 rights in cross-border healthcare (EU Directive 2011/24).\nThe platform deals with RD as a global health issue, exploiting and integrating contributions from all EU MS and other world areas (Caucasus, Europe, America, Oceania, PAHO/WHO) and will identify additional research needs to further improve clinical practice.\nFostering synergistic collaboration among experts, patients representatives, policy makers, institutions, agencies, and other organizations experienced in systematic reviews and guidelines production, RARE-Bestpractices will focus on:\na) collection, evaluation and dissemination of existing best practices;\nb) an agreed methodology suitable to develop and update best practice guidelines;\nc) training activities targeted at key stakeholders to spread expertise and knowledge; and\nd) a forum for exchanging information, sharing lessons learnt, and facilitating collaborations.\nThe platform is conceived for health care providers, experts, patients, policy makers and best practice guideline developers with outcomes that support closure of healthcare gaps among countries and improved clinical management of RD patients globally.", 167718.0, 1831846.0, "RARE-BESTPRACTICES", "Reliable guidelines for rare diseases management", "Despite the low prevalence of rare diseases (RDs), affecting 5 out of 10\u00a0000 people in the EU, there are in excess of 5\u00a0000 illnesses in this category that are chronically debilitating or life threatening. Affecting some 30 million EU citizens, there is a need to organise a collaborative initiative to reduce socioeconomic costs and improve quality of life.", "The EU-funded 'Platform for sharing best practices for management of rare diseases' (http://www.rarebestpractices.eu (RARE-BESTPRACTICES)) project is a consortium of 15 partners. These include a range of academic institutions, health care services, systems analysts, health sector research groups and the European Organisation for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS).\n\nThe main aims of RARE-BESTPRACTICES are to develop a methodology for guidelines for RDs that will populate a comprehensive public database. The specially tailored databases will house guidelines and prioritised research recommendations respectively to help professionals, patients and policymakers. Both databases are in the user testing phase, and a prototype for a forum-based web community is ready for testing.\n\nGreat emphasis is being placed on training and there is already a schedule for a series of events on guideline development and evaluation. Two workshops have explored the issues involved in using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach when developing guidelines for RDs. The draft guidelines will be applied and tested on the RD catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome.\n\nRARE-BESTPRACTICES is mapping out policies on orphan drug appraisals in eight European countries. Critical factors leading to positive or negative recommendations for pharmaceutical use are being assessed and how these feed into clinical practice. Under study are 17 case studies on 17 drug-indication pairs.\n\nDissemination is critical and is being addressed through newsletters, a leaflet, Twitter (http://twitter.com/rarebestp (@RAREBestP)), press releases, the project website and several papers in journals. The project is also creating a new science open access journal, http://rarejournal.org (Rare Diseases and Orphan Drugs).\n\nRARE-BESTPRACTICES will help to ensure that the RD community has access to clear, quality guidelines that they can trust. A unique, first-time event, the project has brought together experts in all fields of RDs and this stands to ensure uptake of the innovative findings by the RD community, including RD national plans, centres of expertise and European reference networks in compliance with EU legislation.", "http://www.rarebestpractices.eu/", "http://www.jamarau.com.au", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/158110.jpg", "fp7_105806_962798430"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SE3"}
