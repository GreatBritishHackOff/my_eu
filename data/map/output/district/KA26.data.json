Having previously benefited from a course in the past we were keen to further develop our professional skills and abilities in delivering French to primary school children. The main objective of our project is to discover best practices to bring back and disseminate to colleagues in Scotland, as well as learning and sharing new ideas in both language and cultural experiences. The project will include a visit to a French primary school, participation in singing and games, reading and writing in French, general conversation, cultural excursions and  activities,  all supported by the effective use of ICT with an emphasis on practical classroom ideas.\r\n\r\nWe anticipate the outcome of the project will be a much greater confidence in delivering the Scottish Government's Languages 1+2 initiative from the teachers who have attended the course. This will enable the participants to cascade their learning to both pupils and teachers within the school. They will also be able to share knowledge with colleagues in neighbouring schools through CPD training sessions. This project is building on prior knowledge enabling the school to make further progress in improving methodological expertise in the teaching of French to young learners.", "http://www.girvanprimary.sayr.sch.uk/", "Girvan Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035593_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "KA26"}
