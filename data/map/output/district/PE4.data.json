In contrast to other schools in Peterborough who have large percentages of EAL, the vast majority of our students are new or recent arrivals and fall into the new census category A and B  (i.e. students with very little English who require a considerable amount of support to access the curriculum) and additionally, students at TVA come from the poorest areas of the city where there is high mobility leading to a number of students who have gaps in their knowledge due to an inconsistent educational history. \r\n\r\nAs a school, we have identified that a key gap in our knowledge is understanding clearly the prior learning experiences of our EAL students and the educational expectations of parents, as such, we understand that we need to make changes to tailor our provision to best meet the needs of our core cohort.  We have a significant and growing Roma community within our school who are currently making the least progress, therefore, it is crucial for us to better understand what Roma education in Slovakia looks like and how we can accelerate the students' progress once they arrive with us, as well as developing parental trust and support.  This project will help us to understand what prior education for these students looks like and how we can build on that to accelerate progress and gain trust.\r\n\r\nOur current Academy Development Plan shows that catering for EAL students is a key priority for us as an educational institution to ensure that results and outcomes for our students improve.  The trend towards increased numbers of EAL MENA is unlikely to change over the coming academic years, therefore, this year we have introduced ESOL as a curricular subject for groups of EAL students in KS3 and are aiming to use this project to drive further curriculum change in the future.\r\n\r\nTVA has key groups of EAL students which form large percentages of the student body, mainly Eastern European and Portuguese.  This project will consist of a series of visits to schools in two of those countries to shadow staff, to learn about the pedagogy used and the curriculum spread as well as the structure of qualifications and method of assessment.  \r\nThe objectives are to identify:\r\n- similarities between the British and other European systems which can be exploited in terms of resources in home languages (e.g. if they study volcanoes in Geography in Slovakia, those resources could be used to support MENA students' understanding of 'volcanoes' in TVA).\r\n- differences between the British and other European systems, which will allow us understand student and parent behaviours and to provide additional information to parents about their expectations of the Academy as well as the requirements / structure of the British system in comparison with other countries.\r\n- curriculum structure - understanding what the curriculum looks like in other countries, where and when option points are and which subjects are valued by students and parents and why, will help us to provide better choices and smoother transition for our learners.\r\n- pedagogy - understanding teaching pedagogy, expectations and behaviours for learning in countries of origin will allow us to better cater for our EAL learners and better understand how to better support them in their learning.", "http://www.qka.education", "Thomas Deacon Education Trust T/A Queen Katharine Academy", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036326_coordinator"], ["7TP", "\u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03b6\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u0395\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03cd\u03b3\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b7 \u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac \u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2", "C24 Education and Development Centre Limited", 26615.0, "During our participation (represented by the Assistant Director) in the recent TCA contact seminar, we got in touch (among others) with the representative of ISA from Wales and exchanged views, since they specialize in the beauty professions, which are also two of the main specialties offered in our Vocational Training Institute (IEK). Unfortunately, our infrastructure is poor, yet the need for continuing education and implementing new techniques and methods and the emergence of new materials and products is forcing everyone to adapt and evolve all the time. The implementation of the European Qualifications Framework and the need for mobility in the labor market, is a motivation, an objective and a constant challenge. Of the 34 trainees of our IEK to beauty sectors, we selected 16 who, accompanied by a trainer and a representative of the Administration will participate in this international project which we hope will become a model for upcoming international initiatives. Key activities include laboratory character training seminars, acquaintance with new techniques and products at workplace and in a reputed company for beauty products. We will also participate in international events and cultural activities.

For some, the option of a vocational career is imposed because of the difficulties they face in general education subjects including foreign languages. Teachers are often faced with the problem of motivation, Through the mobility abroad, this European curriculum is a means of involving these students in a mobilizing project which enables them to acquire skills and autonomy that are necessary for their success.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur project\r\nWe are applying for 20 grants for National BTECH in Retail Management for students who will have internal work experience abroad during the academic years of 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 (10 students in 2017/2018 and 10 students in 2018/2019) Lyc\u00e9e Poincar\u00e9 has been organizing mobilities abroad for the European section \u2018Secr\u00e9tariat\u2019 for several years. Given the positive feedback of this section, we have set up mobility projects in the Retail Management department for the years 2011/2012, 2013/2014, 2014/2015, 2015/2016 and 2016/2017. These projects having been accepted, similarly to our application for the European section, we are applying for a new project for the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 academic years.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Description\r\nThe mobility will take place in Peterborough, England and will be organized in 4 or 5 preparatory days and a 4-week internship. The first days are devoted to a progressive discovery of the environment before joining the host company, in which a tutor will be responsible for the participants.\r\nWe will travel on the Eurostar and students will stay with their host families. The allocation of families and businesses is organized by a local provider who also closely supervises the trainees with the educational team and in accordance to the previously approved specifications. This project involves the various members of staff of our school: the head teacher, the accountant, and the educational teams of the relevant classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe objectives notably involve the professional aspect as the project is primarily a linguistic enhancement in connection with the vocational training, but they also go beyond this aim. They bring a cultural aspect through the discovery of a way of life and a different environment. And finally, building up personal confidence in our students is the underlying objective of our project as it allows them to develop self-confidence, autonomy and thus helps them to mature.\r\n\r\nOur requirements\r\nOur students belong to families who mainly come from disadvantaged or underprivileged backgrounds. The financial aspect of the mobility is therefore important, hence the need to obtain funding from Erasmus+ in correspondence with that of the High School and of the Ile-de-France Region.\r\n\r\nPredicted Outcome\r\nThe internal training period done as part of the mobility will be taken into account for the Baccalaur\u00e9at degree. It is therefore assessed by teachers at the place of mobility. Regarding the foreign language assessment in the exam, the evaluation methods which are now being oriented towards oral practice and the skills acquired through the mobility will provide a concrete basis for the preparation of this exam. Because our students are enrolled in the European section, they will take a specific oral exam (which lasts 20 minutes, preceded by a 20-minute preparation time). According to their results, they can obtain a special European grade in the Baccalaur\u00e9at. In addition, each participant will receive a personalized Europass mobility at the end of their training period. In the perspective of professional integration, the skills acquired by students reflect the European dimension in their training. Finally, the European aspect of the project is an undeniable added value for the participants: our students will be able to \"experience Europe\" explicitly.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036690_2"], ["7TP", "SPACE PROJECT - Supporting vulnerable People through Accessing Creative Education and Entrepreneurship", "C24 Education and Development Centre Limited", 46233.0, "SPACE PROJECT - Supporting vulnerable People through Accessing Creative Education and Entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nContext/Background of Project\r\nWorld events on TV expose people to many images of discrimination, war and conflict.
