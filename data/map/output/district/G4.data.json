This will be possible by visiting companies and by company supported teaching (alternative traineeship). Furthermore, the students will be taught other subjects aiming at improving their language and cultural skills.\r\nThe reason for this period of study is that we know from experience that Danish business school students seldom apply for international jobs as they lack international skills. The lack of such skills makes it hard for them to find future jobs, and these are skills that the Ministry of Education has pointed out as being of great importance. Internationalization is part of the competence goals by which the students are assessed. This is therefore an approved part of the Danish education and does not prolong the students\u2019 education. Furthermore, it is important that internationalization is emphasized so that the students will be able to cope with international study environments.\r\nIn the course the students will receive an understanding of what it takes to live in another culture, furthermore they will get a good grasp of the Scottish business sector and the Scottish educational system through the subjects they are taught, company visits and the company supported teaching. This course is targeted at the HGS students. Thus the students must have a minimum age of 18 years, and they will be expected to be independent. The importance of making the students feel comfortable will not be neglected, but the main focus will be on vocational training so that their international skills will be strengthened. \r\nFurthermore, the students must start writing a report which must be completed upon arrival home. This report will document their knowledge and skills acquired during the period of study.\r\nApart from further strengthening the students\u2019 commercial skills, the purpose this periode of study is:\r\no To increase the awareness of the students\u2019 own language and culture, and by working with other national cultures the students will acquire an increased understanding of these being very different from their own although they are geographically rather close to Denmark.\r\no To increase an awareness of what other cultures have to offer us\r\no To increase an awareness of equality across national borders\r\no To further strengthen the students\u2019 international and intercultural skills\r\no To increase the students\u2019 mobility\r\nAs we have implemented ECVET, the students will receive a learning agreement prior to the period of study with detailed information on which competence goals they will be expected to acquire during the period of study.\r\nUsing Memorandum of Understanding and Learning Agreement the schools make sure, that the responsibility for the various parts the project before, during and after regarding everything from among others information and selection, travel and accommodation, assessment and documentation to validation and recognition is placed.\r\nThis project is an important part of marketing for the three Danish schools in order to attract more and better students.\r\nThrough previous projects we have documented that our students are very interested in participating in periods of study abroad, and therefore we know that the number of students mentioned in this application is realistic.", "http://www.cityofglasgowcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DK01-KA102-004135_1"], ["0RF", "Continuing Internationalization at Tradium - part IV", "CITY OF GLASGOW COLLEGE", 216829.0, "Tradium hereby apply for 280 mobilities for students, 19 accompanying persons and 35 mobilities for employees. We are aware that this is a very large application, but at the same time, we believe that the application is extremely realistic. Tradium is one of the largest combination schools, and internationalization is very integrated into our organization. This was also the reason why, Tradium got the Danish award as being the International School of the year 2012.\r\n\r\nSince 2012, we enhanced the international work by sending out even more students and employees, while we have participated in several international projects. In previous mobility projects we have send out whole classes with approximately half grants, so everybody had the opportunity to receive a grant. In the 2014-project  we have given a full grant for all participants, with the result that we don't have more than 26 student mobilities left.\r\n\r\nWith this project we apply primarily for grants for mobility in the year 2015/2016, but we have also added some elected classes for 2016/2017. This application is the result of an internal application process, where the departments of Tradium have fulfilled an internal application based on their needs for future mobilities in their department.\r\n\r\nThe mobilities for the year 2016/2017 are for the classes that have integrated the mobilities as a mandatory part of their training and the mobility project to Glasgow (which has been completed the last many years). This type of mobilities we are 100% certain will be realized, and that is why it would be right to inform all the relevant stakeholders about the economic conditions earlier on. For this reason we have applyed for 2016/2017 mobilities for these special classes as well, a total of 101 mobility grants for students + 3 accompanying persons.\r\n\r\nThe project is implemented in continuation of Tradiums strategy of having a global vision, and thus to the desire to integrate internationalization into all of the programs offered by Tradium. The Mobility project is a very important element in this strategy.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we wish to send out 188 VET students, 92 HHX students and 35 employees. VET students are primarily basic course students at either GF1 or GF2, but there are also individual students from the main program (school training students). We are applying for grants to accompanying persons to our basic course students, as these students are relatively young (some are under 18), and many times they are not strong linguistically / culturally. HHX students are all first-year students from the school's two international study programs. Staff members come from all parts of the school: Managers, teachers and administrative staff.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the mobility project will be in extension of the enclosed MoU / LOI. There will be an increased focus on getting participants' learning outcomes described in a better way (ECVET), partly by using Learning Agreements for the description of the individual's learning outcomes, and assessed by the host partner. At the same time we will maintain the Europass Mobility as a recognition of the skills that the participant has achieved during the mobility.\r\n\r\nExpected effect for students:\r\nThe project will help to increase students' linguistic, international and intercultural competencies. Particularly VET students often have a limited global vision, which makes it difficult for them to operate in an international environment. With this project, they will be better to compete with other groups of students on internships and jobs. Regarding HHX / HTX participants, they also need a practical approach to their theoretical education. The work placements for these students will add this dimension.

Agencies have years of experiences with the organization of mobility and network businesses, where students will be on the job learning placement. \r\nIn the second part of the activity (A2) we have 5 different streams of staff mobility who will go abroad for job shadowing. Three mobility will be carried out by individuals, one mobility will be attended by two teachers and one last counts seven teachers, who are experts in health care.

The first week of each group will be accompanied by a teacher, except with health and care will be two teachers. For activities A1 we want students enable on-the-job learning placement fields of secondary vocational and technical programs, such as computer science, electrical engineering, woodworking, car mechatronics, mechanical engineering, mechatronics, logistics, health care, gastronomy, agriculture, nature protection, trade and economy, and their mobility recognized as part of the learning process.\r\nIn the part A3 we will organize 9 mobilities for acoompanying persons who will join to 8 groups of students mobility going on-the job learning. They will spend only first week abroad, so we have separately marked activity A3 for teachers as acoompanying person, anyway it will be organized together with activity A1. \r\nAdditional project objectives for students are: to come familiar with education system of host country, to upgrade theoretical knowledge, to know better the procedure of  work and changes set by the foreign labor market, develop language (communication) and intercultural competences (knowing customs and traditions of new countries) and actively spend free time (get to know with culture and history of host country). \r\nWe want to speed the cooperation between VET institutions in Slovenia and other countries.

Every BKCR student should be enabled to actively take part in their educational processes, i.e. teachers and students together determine the content and design of their learning processes.In 2015, the BKCR was awarded the title \u201eEuropaschule\u201c by the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia, acknowledging our various international endeavours over the past decades. We believe that the main objective of our school \u2013 enabling personal and professional self-sufficiency intertwined with ethical responsibility \u2013 can only be achieved with an international perspective. For the first time, this mobility project would give students from all three of our departments the opportunity to do an internship abroad. This time abroad would enable us to prepare our students even better for their professional lives. The internships for the remedial/therapeutic educators in Borl\u00e4nge, Sweden, would provide a hands-on comparison of the basic principles of remedial/therapeutic work in Sweden and Germany. This would enable our students to have a significantly broader perspective on the German system of inclusion. The elementary principles of facilitating education in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) are \u2013 together with curricula and regulations \u2013 the central point of reference for educators and child carers in training. The concept of early childhood education has the goal of \"taking part in society\" (participation). The state of NRW recognizes that the foundations for societal participation are laid in the area of elementary and primary education. Other EU countries pursue this goal using different approaches.The above-mentioned fundamentals are valid for the field of business/administration as well. In the competence-oriented guidelines for the subject \"business administration\", for example, this is put into action through the topic \"human resources.\" In this project, office management students research possibilities for participation within a company. While in Glasgow, the students would analyze how the different national regulations they researched in class are put into practice. We expect the students in this project to significantly expand their competences regarding their discernment of job migration options and their ability to deal with diversity in the workplace.  The number of students taking part in this project would be 34. They are studying to be state-certified child carers/educators (including A levels), remedial/therapeutic educators, or office management clerks. All of these students will do the internships in their last year of training. The project topic, participation and inclusion for people with and without special needs (both in and outside of professional life), is an element within the main subjects in all three courses. Going abroad is prepared in class and also through numerous other activities. A Swedish language class is obligatory for all students doing their internships in Sweden, regardless of their course. This provides an interdisciplinary platform for this European project. Other examples are intercultural activities students prepare for other students at the \u201eEurope day\u201c celebrated at our school.Our co-operation agreements with Borl\u00e4nge and Glasgow are bi-directional. Additionally, the BKCR has established 3 classes for refugees. This and the Erasmus+ project will expand the intercultural competence of students and teachers at the BKCR.", "http://www.cityofglasgowcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-003023_5"], ["0RF", "Continuing Internationalization at Tradium - part V", "CITY OF GLASGOW COLLEGE", 208120.0, "Implementation of this project is an extension of Tradiums strategy to have global outlook, and include internationalization in all of Tradiums educations. Internationalization is a beacon for Tradium, and it is included in the strategic, tactical and operational levels. In 2012, Tradium was recognized with the international prize for our international engagement.  After the changes following OK13 and EUD reform in 2015, we have been concerned about the development within international activities, for example, mobility projects (timewise, resources as well as structural). Luckily, our experience is that many of our departments have made a priority to implement mobility projects. Within our vocational education, it is now typical that our EUX students in the beginning of their education and training, as well as our school internship students have had the opportunity to use the mobility grants to travel to one of our partner schools. After the restructuring of the vocational educations, it has been assessed that the options of mobility projects has been more constricted. With the agreement of OK13 the costs have been more considerably higher than before. Our upper secondary education continues to make mobility grants a priority.  We are applying for mobility grants altogether for 132 students, 22 accompaying persons and 19 staff. Our total mobility activity will continue to be high, albeit at a lower level than before. A large majority of our mobility\u2019s are planned for implementation for the school year 2016/2017. The mobility grants we are applying for regarding school year 2017/2018 are for the educations that thru the years have completed mobility exchanges and/or where we have a partnership with another school (MoU).Our mobility grants from 2014 are at the moment nearly used up (1 student grant left, and 2 grants for staff) These 3 mobility grants are expected to be completed in spring 2016.From mobility project 2015 at the moment there are 75 mobility grants planned (out of 164), and 9 (out of 26) mobility grants for staff are under planning.All previous mobility grants have been used up 100% except for one project from 2013, where we with a mistake hadn\u2019t requested the transfer of mobility grants from accompanying person to mobility of students (but just did it in reality) this resulted in a non-approval of that part of our mobility project.  We are applying for accompanying persons because a great part of our students are relatively young (under 18 yrs. old), and for many of these students this is the first time meeting professionals from the business community. The staff comes from all parts of the school, and the people in charge of education in the businesses. Implementation of mobility grants will happen in connection with the attached MoU/LoI. There will be greater focus on learning outcomes of our students, for example by incorporating Learning Agreements describing a specific students learning outcomes assessed by the partner school. We will continue to use Europass Mobility documents to recognize the competences the participants have gained on the mobility.  Affects for students:This project will help increase the student\u2019s language, international and intercultural competences. Especially vocational educational students have had a limited global outlook, which has made it hard for them to interact in an international environment. With this project, it will make it easier to compete with other students on internships and jobs. Regarding HHX participants, there is the need for a practical approach to the otherwise theoretical education. The internship part of their mobility adds this dimension. Afterwards it is expected that most of these students will have a better chance for employment in a globalized work place. These students can also be a model for other students and inspire them to participate in a mobility project in another country. Expected effect on staff/institution:\u2022 Staff/leaders gain language, international and intellectual competences so that our institution can give our students better support in regards to their own mobility. \u2022 Our staff will receive a specific pedagogical and/or skills advancement in their field. \u2022 Teachers will gain new inspiration for their teaching methods and pedagogical methods and tools. \u2022 Leaders/executives will gain new competences around the building up of education systems and inspiration on how to tackle future challenges (EUDs attractiveness, counseling, absence, working together with the labour market, rationalization, digitalization and more).The results of these mobility projects at a minimum will be evaluated and discussed in their respective departments, for example in relation to teacher meetings. The results will be discussed in other areas outside of the respective departments for example in relation to experience group meetings, together with other schools, press activity, Facebook, and/or blogs.", "http://www.cityofglasgowcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA102-022089_2"], ["0RF", "Onderwijsgroep Tilburg mobiliteit voor studenten en medewerkers 2016", "WEST OF SCOTLAND COLLEGES PARTNERSHIP", 47129.0, "In this Erasmus+ KA1 project, Onderwijsgroep Tilburg will send 24 professionals abroad to learn about specific innovations in Vocational Education and Training in other countries or about remarkable activities and circumstances in the working field.

They are preparing a BTEC first in Jean Baptiste Brochier vocational high school.\r\nWe already have partners companies in Glasgow through a partnership with Glasgow city council, Glasgow Kelvin College and Glasgow Old People's Welfare Association.\r\nWe need to fulfill the following goals :\r\n- to improve the current and professional English vocabulary,\r\n- to develop the pupils' autonomy and responsibilities,\r\n- to awaken them to another  European culture,\r\n- to help them develop their self-confidence and their self-esteem,\r\n- to acquire a better cultural and professional mind,\r\n- to favour higher education in which the knowledge of the English language is essential,\r\n- to make them become  more effective European citizens,\r\n- and finally,to make them contemplate a professional future in a European country.\r\nThe participants are preparing a BTEC first in administrative management with a European option. To pass their Euro option they have to be assessed orally by 2 teachers : an English teacher and a management teacher. They need to be able to develop a professional activity in English and obtain a minimum of 10/20. \r\nMoreover, they have an English exam too, as every other pupils preparing a BTEC first, but, they must have 12/20 to validate the Euro option. So, they really need to improve their English level as much as possible. The European option will be a great value on their diploma to help them being accepted in higher education courses and to find a job.\r\nOur pupils will be registered to the 'mobility unit option'. It is a new option created in 2015 by the French eduction board to give more importance to the pupils' placements abroad. It gives them the opportunity to have their placement assessment appearing on their diplomas as a positive mark. It is assessed through an oral exam in French relating their experience abroad on a professional and cultural point of view. At the same time they will take a EUROPRO exam in English.\r\nThe preparatory activities for this placement period will try to achieve the goals below : \r\n- cultural knowledge of the country,\r\n- social-economic aspects of the professional world of the country,\r\n-improvement in the current and professional vocabulary.\r\nFor the school year 2016-2017, we asked for an English speaking language assistant to our regional fund to help us achieve our linguistic and cultural goals. We succeeded in having this person. We asked for the same fund for next year.\r\nMany people from our school are part of this project and work in collaboration, both on the administrative and teaching sides (head of school and depute, financial manager, nurse, teachers). Pupils' parents and tutors from the companies are also part of the project.\r\n\r\nThe preparatory activities :\r\nSince their first year in this schedule, our pupils have more hours in English to get ready for this project and to succeed in obtaining their Euro option. They are also trained in the management course through oral communication linked to their professional field (oral presentation and role plays in English\u2026). English is a compulsory subject for every pupil preparing a BTEC first. And the exam is an oral presentation about a topic chosen by the pupil. They need to train, so the placement will be a perfect training, plus a perfect topic to talk about.\r\nOn a cultural and linguistic side, the pupils participated in the European langages day last October. During this day, they experienced many activities about the European history and culture as well as using the European languages.\r\nTo make our pupils aware about the European citizenship we have a partnership with 'La Maison de l'Europe', an association promoting Europe through different means. We choose to have our pupils participate in their European citizenship challenge. For their tenth edition, one pupil from the Euro section ranked second  this year and made us very proud of her.

The aim of the Master of Urban Climate and Sustainability (MUrCS) is to produce high calibre graduates with skills and knowledge to understand, assess and manage climate resilience in cities. MUrCS will integrate three subject-specific streams (Planning, Management and Science \u2013 both adaptation and mitigation) in a problem-oriented environment. Students will choose one of these thematic areas as their main and another as their secondary specialism. MUrCS will offer a two-year, 120 ECTS Master degree on the basis of a jointly developed curriculum by the Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU), UK, Lahti University of Applied Sciences (LAMK), Finland and University of Huelva (UHU), Spain. It will lead to triple degrees \u2013 MSc in Sustainable Urban Environment (GCU, fully accredited in the UK), MEng Environmental Technology (LAMK, fully accredited in Finland) and MSc Environmental Technology (UHU, fully accredited in Spain). The consortium includes University of Bologna, Italy, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Israel and North-West University, South Africa, UNIA, Spain and 7 industry/public body Associate Partners. MUrCS is aimed at both existing urban professionals as well as those with multidisciplinary environmental backgrounds and will create professional pathways in leading sustainable urban climate change. Graduates will gain critical understanding of the complexity of urban sustainability and the need for local action to combat climate change. They will develop intellectual and practical skills as well as the ability to use tools for the collection, analysis and interpretation of data related to urban climate change and sustainability. These and the transferable skills gained during the programme will enable graduates to operate in senior positions in both the public and the private sectors to lead sustainable and climate sensitive urban change. All students will begin their education in Glasgow (GCU) in Semester 1 to undertake core modules together with developing transverse skills (inter-cultural awareness, foreign language competencies, research methods and communication and employability skills). In order to maintain the inter-disciplinary approach, all students will then move to Lahti, Finland (LAMK) in Semester 2 to undertake further core modules and electives relevant to their main specialism. This innovative approach will also ensure staff and student mobility. Semester 3 will focus on the specialism of the students and will be undertaken in either GCU (Management), LAMK (Planning) or Science (UHU). Students will then undertake a thesis project covering both their specialisms, jointly supervised by two academics from different partner institutions in Semester 4.", "http://www.gcu.ac.uk", "THE GLASGOW CALEDONIAN UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_586614-EPP-1-2017-1-UK-EPPKA1-JMD-MOB_coordinator"], ["0BA", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "THE GLASGOW CALEDONIAN UNIVERSITY", 312934.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", null, "THE GLASGOW CALEDONIAN UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035567_coordinator"], ["0RF", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "WEST OF SCOTLAND COLLEGES PARTNERSHIP", 11035.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.woscop.co.uk", "WEST OF SCOTLAND COLLEGES PARTNERSHIP", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035679_coordinator"], ["0RF", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "CITY OF GLASGOW COLLEGE", 46607.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.cityofglasgowcollege.ac.uk", "CITY OF GLASGOW COLLEGE", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035782_coordinator"], ["0RF", "Gesundheitsaspekte an den Arbeitspl\u00e4tzen \u201eKita\u201c, \u201eEinrichtungen f\u00fcr Menschen mit Behinderungen\u201c, \u201eUnternehmen\u201c und \u201eSchule\u201c.", "CITY OF GLASGOW COLLEGE", 41664.0, "The Vocational College Castrop-Rauxel (\u201eBerufskolleg Castrop-Rauxel\u201c, abbreviated BKCR), Germany, is the institution applying for this KA1 Erasmus+ project.

The BKCR is an upper secondary school with courses leading up to the university entrance qualification (\u201eAbitur\u201c) with a vocational focus.\r\nThe European project the BKCR is applying for is the continuation of its institutionalized Europe activities that has spawned several previous Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus+ projects. Every two years since 2007, our school has successfully applied for this kind of projects. In 2016, we made the work placements abroad available to three main departments of the BKCR instead of two (i.e. education/social pedagogy, business/administration, and now also health/remedial education).\r\nFor the new project, we chose the topic \"health\". Our prospective nursery nurses, teachers and educators would have the opportunity to experience and analyse approaches to holistic health promotion at our partner institutions. \r\nOur students of remedial education would focus mainly on mental health. For many people with multiple disabilities, communicating their wishes and needs is highly challenging. Our project participants going to Sweden would get to know their approaches to this problem and, subsequently, compare them to German approaches. \r\nThe office management students would focus on the curriculum-relevant topic \"healthy workplace\", comprised of the aspects \"ergonomy\", \"adhering to the workplace ordinance\" and \"tax-exempt health promotion in the workplace\". The goal here is that our students can learn about the relevant regulations and practices in Scotland and compare them to the ones they know in Germany. \r\nThe number of students taking part in this project would be 34. They are studying to be state-certified child carers/educators (including A levels), remedial/therapeutic educators, or office management clerks, respectively. All of these students will do the work placements in their last year of training. The child education department would send eight students each year (within the framework of their obligatory three-week work placement focusing on \"conceptual and institutional approaches to pedagogical work in Germany, Sweden, Poland and England\"), the remedial education department four. The five students of office management would do two-week work placements. \r\nThe project topic includes both health promotion at the workplace regarding the project participants, and health promotion regarding their clientele (e.g. children, people with the need of specialized care). Health promotion is integral part of main subjects in each of these courses\u2018 curricula. The stays abroad will be prepared and reflected upon in several learning arrangements and/or educational science classes. Furthermore, our co-operations with Vuxenutbildning in Borl\u00e4nge, Sweden, and City of Glasgow College, Scotland, are bi-directional. In September 2018 and 2019, we expect three Swedish students at our school, doing a three-week work placement at a local hospital. This type of peer-to-peer support is also to be installed with the office management clerk students this time. \r\nWe expect that the work placements abroad prepare our students better for their professional future, e.g. by providing a broader perspective on relevance and possibilities of mental health promotion for young children and people with special needs. Furthermore, we hope for impulses on the level of our own school development. Our school\u2019s work groups for health and Europe have already composed an action plan for health promotion among students. One of the expected results is that project participants get to know communication structures and methods that may be useful for improving student feedback at our school. \r\nWe hope that connecting these two aspects of our school\u2019s program, namely health and Europe, through this Erasmus+ project will prove to create more positive effects. In the long run, we aim to have as many main points of our school\u2019s program as possible to mutually support each other.
