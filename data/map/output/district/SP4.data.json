Identification of critical properties (physico-chemical descriptors) that confer the ability to induce harm in biological systems is key to allowing these features to be avoided in nanomaterial production (\u201csafety by design\u201d).  Major shortfalls in the risk analysis process for nanomaterials are the fundamental lack of data on exposure levels and the environmental fate and transformation of nanomaterials, key issues that this proposal will address, including through the development of novel modelling approaches.

The demand for safe, efficient and high quality animal protein will rise significantly over the next decade with a concomitant increase in the world population of domesticated livestock. Infectious diseases continue to impact upon the productivity of farm animals and threats of disease incursions are further increased by the globalised trade of animals and animal products. Rapid and reliable diagnostic systems can play an integral role in the detection, monitoring, control and subsequent eradication of animal diseases and pathologies.\n\nThis proposal will develop and bring to market new tools to achieve effective diagnosis of livestock, companion animal and wildlife diseases.  The project RAPIDIA-FIELD will develop multiplex pen-side tests that can be used to support local decision-making by animal health practitioners. These tests will be simple to perform, robust, inexpensive and also provide unambiguous results for easy reporting. This concept also includes work to develop test formats for use in non-specialised front-line laboratories.\n\nIn addition to the development of the specific tests and assay platforms, the project will also consider how these tests will be used in the field or in local laboratories, and how data generated by the assays will integrate with other new (and existing) systems that contribute to the diagnosis, monitoring, control and subsequent eradication of animal diseases. Aspects of this work will include real-time monitoring on line of animal health on farms to collect parameters such as feed consumption and water intake as well as using thermography or thermal chip to look for early signs of clinical disease. Together with the data generated by the assays, reporting protocols will also be established to ensure that the critical information collected is correctly archived and is traceable to international quality standards.\n\nThe project will also pay some attention to new technologies and protocols only carried out in sophisticated laboratories.
