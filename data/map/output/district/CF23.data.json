Contemporary solutions involve BI users dealing with increasingly complex analyses. According to a 2008 study, the complexity of BI tools is the biggest barrier for success of these systems. Moreover, classical BI solutions have, so far, neglected the meaning of data.Semantic Technologies (STs), deal with this meaning and are capable of dealing with both unstructured and structured data. Having the meaning of data in place, a user can be guided during his work with data. In particular, we foresee FCA (Formal Concept Analysis), which is a well known ST, to be a key element of new hybrid BI system. However, STs have, traditionally, operated on data sets a magnitude smaller than classical BI solutions. They also lack standard BI functionalities such as Online Analytical Processing queries, making it difficult to perform analysis over semantic data.

Hindering attempts to prevent autoimmune T1D, the aetiology and pathogenesis of the islet auto-immunization, including whether it is preceded by metabolic abnormalities and cell-mediated autoimmunity, is still poorly understood. To overcome this, DIAPREPP will focus on the early auto-immunization against islet antigens, in particular to disclose events preceding current autoantibody markers. The concept is that events prior to auto-immunization govern the likelihood and \u2018signature\u2019 of immunization, which in turn determines progression to disease. The overall objective is to determine mechanisms of islet autoantigen immunization. In a truly collaborative manner, and through five S/T workpackages plus three dedicated to dissemination, training, and management, DIAPREPP will 1. provide a unique set of clinical material that includes a case-control cohort representative of the world\u2019s largest studies of pre-T1D, with follow-up and samples from birth, and pancreatic islets and lymph nodes from patients; 2. investigate the effects of environmental exposure to infections on islet cells and immune cells; 3. perform extensive metabolomic analysis of pre-autoimmune samples and in relevant animal models to test mechanistic hypotheses of auto-immunization; 4. carry out detailed analyses of early autoimmune responses with a special focus on autoreactive CD8\\ T cells; and 5. apply findings to ongoing prevention studies. The expected impact of DIAPREPP is new fundamental knowledge regarding how 1. immunization against islet autoantigens can occur; 2. signs of self-immunization can be exploited for prediction and monitoring of disease; and 3. the immunization or its progression to islet beta cell destruction and T1D development can be prevented.", 150802.0, 6697517.0, "DIAPREPP", "Finding ways to prevent childhood diabetes", "Understanding the causes of type1 diabetes (T1D) and finding early disease markers seem the only way forward to reduce disease incidence.

Considering the associated morbidity and substantially decreased life quality of T1D patients, novel strategies for preventing T1D are urgently required.\n\nThe key objective of the EU-funded 'Diabetes type 1 prediction, early pathogenesis and prevention' (DIAPREPP) project was to understand the mechanisms of autoimmunisation against self-antigens in order to develop diagnostic tools and strategies for preventing clinical T1D. Information about the project and related links can be found http://www.diaprepp.eu/ (online).\n\nCurrently, the earliest identifiable process in the pathogenesis of T1D is the development of autoantibodies to islet beta cells. However, the causes and events that precede the emergence of autoantibodies remain poorly understood.\n\nAfter generating a unique source of clinical material from children followed from birth to autoimmunity through to disease development, the consortium performed a thorough analysis of the patient metabolome. Interestingly, an altered profile in terms of phospholipid content and other metabolites in cord blood was found to be specifically associated with islet autoimmunity that leads to T1D.\n\nIn order to investigate the potential viral aetiology of T1D, partners examined patient samples for the presence of enteroviruses in relation to the appearance of islet autoantibodies, dietary intervention, maternal type 1 diabetes and clinical symptoms. Human enterovirus (HEV) was detected in nearly 10\u00a0% of the samples, but no correlation was found between the presence of HEV in the first year of life and the development of islet autoantibodies.\n\nHowever, the presence of enterovirus in the pancreatic islets of T1D patients led scientists to further investigate the mechanism of virus infection. They discovered that enterovirus could enter, infect and destroy beta cells while at the same time activating innate immune response pathways.\n\nAdditionally, genetic susceptibility was found to be instrumental in progression to T1D development. Children positive for islet autoantibodies were twice as prone to develop the disease if they carried susceptible genotypes for various genes, including IFIH1.\n\nAn important line of work of the DIAPREPP study entailed the development of technology for the capture and study of single immune responsive cells. This technology was implemented to identify autoantibodies that could be subsequently used for diagnostic purposes.\n\nThis commercially exploitable diagnostic technology, combined with the scientific discoveries of the DIAPREPP study, will contribute to the design of preventive measures against childhood diabetes.", "http://www.diaprepp.eu/", null, "/docs/results/images/2012-12/56054.jpg", "fp7_86772_999555707"], ["8XH", "Improved Water efficiency through ICT technologies for integrated supply-Demand side manaGEmenT", "Sms Energy Services Limited", "The aim of iWIDGET is to advance knowledge and understanding about smart metering technologies in order to develop novel, robust, practical and cost-effective methodologies and tools to manage urban water demand in households across Europe, by reducing wastage, improving utility understanding of end-user demand and reducing customer water and energy costs.The main scientific challenges for iWIDGET are the management and extraction of useful information from vast amounts of high-resolution consumption data, the development of customised intervention and awareness campaigns to influence behavioural change, and the integration of iWIDGET concepts into a set of decision-support tools for water utilities and consumers, applicable in differing local conditions.In order to meet these aims and challenges, iWIDGET will investigate: (i) how best to provide the dynamic accurate measurement and data transfer of useful information about end-user water consumption, (ii) how best to use consumption data to improve the operation of utilities and influence end-users to modify their behaviour, (iii) how to arrive at the best business model to convert a promising technology into a useful and cost-effective product, and (iv) how to demonstrate and validate the new methodologies on two case studies in the North and South of Europe.", 276751.0, 4024767.0, "iWIDGET", null, null, null, null, "http://www.up-ltd.co.uk", null, "fp7_105822_974978429"], ["8XH", "SmArt BI-directional multi eNergy gAteway", "Sms Energy Services Limited", "Flexibility needs to be added to Europe\u2019s power system to accommodate an increasing share of variable power generation from renewable sources. Indeed, service quality issues start to arise on the grid when this share in electricity consumption reaches 10%. To meet the EU\u2019s targets for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions this share should rise to 30% by 2030 and up to 50% by 2050. The cost of this transition and the necessary measures to guarantee stable and continuous supply are a major political concern. The SABINA project responds to it by targeting the cheapest possible source of flexibility: the existing thermal inertia in buildings and the coupling between heat and electricity networks it enables.\nThis coupling requires accurately estimating the thermal inertia of many buildings. SABINA\u2019s partner the University of Navarra has created a breakthrough, automatic method for this estimation, which shall be scaled up, validated and integrated in a complete management system through this project. This system will operate on two complementary time horizons:\n\u2022 One day: aggregation and management at the district level of the electric and thermal flexibilities, and conversion and storage of the excess electrical energy to thermal energy in the freely available building inertia.\n\u2022 Seconds to minutes: local control of inverters feeding renewable electricity to the grid, with optimal parameters automatically determined at the district level.\nResearch partners will develop novel control and optimization algorithms, and integrate and evaluate the system in lab and operational settings. The SABINA solution is compatible with both new and existing buildings; it is planned to be deployed within five years of the end of the project.
