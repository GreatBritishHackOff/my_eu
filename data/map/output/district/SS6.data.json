Eight percent of industrial plant operating costs may be attributed to heat exchanger fouling.  Despite enormous costs associated with fouling, the industry relies on off-line cleaning because there are no on-line systems capable of operating under high temperature, low velocity conditions with chemically reactive fluids.  The cost of taking plant off-line inevitably means that the heat exchanger operates at significantly less than peak efficiency.  Our proposed solution is to develop an innovative projectile based on-line cleaning and injection system that will work under the required operating conditions to mitigate foulant build-up throughout the heat exchanger.  Achieving our objectives will require research to formulate accurate correlations of foulant deposition rate as a function of geometry and operating conditions, the development of a composite projectile material to achieve the required mechanical properties and chemical stability as well as a projectile trajectory control system to deliver a uniform distribution of projectiles over the heat exchanger tube-face.  Furthermore; ensuring that projectiles are propelled through the heat exchanger tubes in a low velocity regime will require us to devise a means to temporarily increase flow velocity through selected heat exchanger tubes.  Research will concentrate on characterizing foulant deposition mechanism, structure and rate, projectile tribology as well as gaining a detailed understanding of heat exchanger fluid flow and its control. The proposed solution will provide the industry with significant energy savings of over 10% and reduce the CO2 foot print across a wide range of industrial sectors.", 570868.0, 3382544.0, "CLEANEX", "Refineries to benefit from online cleaning technology", "Scientists are developing an online cleaning system for key components of refineries.

Heat exchangers \u2013 literally, devices that transfer heat from one medium to another \u2013 are arranged in a network called the preheat train (PHT), which plays an important role in energy consumption and savings. When the PHT exchangers become fouled, more heat must be supplied for the same output or output is decreased leading to increased costs and emissions.\n\nFouling is a chronic operating problem for which the only solution currently available is offline cleaning. Taking the system offline obviously also results in decreased efficiency and billions of dollars are lost worldwide annually. Scientists are developing an innovative projectile-based online cleaning and injection system to solve this problem with EU-funding of the Cleanex project.\n\nThe main issues to be resolved include capability of operating under high-temperature, low-velocity conditions with chemically reactive fluids. To address these, scientists have undertaken a rigorous characterisation campaign. They are studying heat exchanger fluid flow and its control, as well as the effect of heat exchanger geometry and operating conditions on fouling deposition rate. With vital information at hand, they can develop the appropriate projectile material and control system to deliver uniform distribution of projectiles.\n\nWork on all fronts progressed well during the first 24-month period. The consortium expects to provide an online cleaning system for heat exchangers that will significantly enhance energy efficiency in the oil, gas, power and chemical process industries. End results will be decreased costs and emissions, and thus enhanced competitiveness in a critical sector of the EU economy.", null, "http://www.tubetech.com", "/docs/results/images/2013-02/53648.jpg", "fp7_91953_997979845"], ["9RL", "Automated System for Total Fouling Removal of Heat Exchangers", "Tube Tech International Limited", "In Oil & Gas, fouling, i.e. deposition of unwanted materials on heat transfer surfaces, is a notorious problem with severe effects on refinery economics, energy efficiency and carbon footprint. The total heat exchanger fouling costs were shown to exceed US$4.4 billion annually for industrialised countries.\nShell-and-tube heat exchangers, prevalent in refineries and petrochemical plants, experience most of the fouling on external tube surfaces. Traditional water jet systems (manual and automated) are unable to penetrate the 6mm space between the tube rows, thereby leaving approximately 40%-60% of fouling uncleaned.\nTube Tech, a market leader with more than 25 years of experience in fouling removal, have developed ShellJeTT, an innovative cleaning technology carefully engineered to go through these corridors, enabling 98% fouling removal. This keeps heat exchangers free from fouling; enabling considerable financial savings for the refinery operators. Specifically, results achieved from two case studies where ShellJeTT was applied (TRL-6), evidenced Return on Investment (ROI) of 5:1 to 20:1.\nDuring ShellJeTT\\, we target to enhance our current system\u2019s automation capabilities, allowing our operators to deploy ShellJeTT in a robotic mode. This will move them further away from the blasted area and reduce the deployment time. Project\u2019s activities are structured to raise the technology readiness of ShellJeTT\\ to TRL-9, through an extended period of market replication and demonstration activities.\nShellJeTT\\ is poised to have a tremendous impact in both economic and environmental terms; it will enable the oil refining industry to reduce operational costs by $2.46bn per year while reducing CO2 emissions by 313200 tonnes per year.\nOver a 5-year period after ShellJeTT\\\u2019s market launch we aim to increase our revenue by \u20ac6.75 million up to \u20ac33.75 million per year.
