The high-end manufacturing industry requests production systems that can quickly switch between diverse machining operations with short changeover, programming and set-up times without compromising quality, reliability or life-cycle costs. From a conceptual point of view, industrial robot technology could provide an excellent base for machining being both flexible (due to their lay-out) and cost efficient (robots cost 2-5 times less then machine tools). However, industrial robots lack absolute positioning accuracy (1), are unable to react in real time to changing process conditions (2) and lack reliable programming and simulation tools to ensure first time right machining once production commences (3). These three critical limitations prevent industrial robots from being integrated in high-end machining processes. The COMET consortium will provide a revolutionary Plug-and-Produce solution enabling the use of industrial robots for high end machining processes, appreciating the needs from the manufacturing industry for cost effective, flexible and reliable manufacturing solutions. The proposed solution will be on the average 30% more cost effective than dedicated machine tools whilst delivering absolute positional accuracy of at least 50 \u00b5m. Due to the sense of urgency in Europe\u2019s manufacturing industry the COMET consortium defined an ambitious work plan of only 30 months to develop and demonstrate the innovations planned and meet the objectives set.

EU-funded scientists developed a platform to exploit industrial robots to significantly reduce the time and cost of machining processes.", "Funded by the EU, the http://www.cometproject.eu/ (COMET) project sought to overcome the major challenges that limit the current use of industrial robots for milling processes. Major issues are the lack of positioning accuracy and adaptability to changes in forces required for automotive and aerospace components as well as for the production of moulds, dies and high-precision parts. Concurrently, a dearth of advanced programming and simulation tools decreases the potential for getting a piece done correctly the first time. \n\nCOMET delivered four important techniques and technologies to enable the use of industrial robots in a plug-and-produce platform for cost-effective, reliable and flexible manufacturing. Scientists developed a methodology to extract machine-specific kinematic and dynamic models of industrial robots from every possible configuration. It employs an off-line kinematic calibration, a dynamic robot simulation with new measurements of robotic joint parameters and a novel process for force calculation. Accurate simulation of robot behaviours produces a unique signature for each robot.\n\nThe robot signature is then exploited in a simulation environment that enables adaptive robot path generation. An adaptive tracking system then monitors the actual path with respect to the programmed path, using an advanced robot controller to correct deviations in real time. Finally, a high dynamics compensation mechanism (HDCM) compensates for high-frequency position errors and transients. This provides a turbo-boost to accuracy, enabling precision far beyond the capability of the robot system alone. As an example, the mean absolute error of a test piece improved from 255 micrometres with no compensation to only 32 micrometres with the HDCM.\n\nTest cases demonstrated that robot machining can significantly speed up processing compared to conventional computer-based numerical control methods. In addition, costs can be reduced by approximately 40 % with minimal to no impact on quality.\n\nResults have been widely disseminated through numerous presentations, publications and videos targeting scientific audiences, industry, policymakers, the media and the general public.

High material removal rates and highest surface finishing will be achieved resulting in an equal or even better workpiece performance. By using these two unconventional manufacturing technologies with their inherent advantages a much higher technological and time based flexibility in production of fir tree profiles can be achieved. Failure risks and machining costs will be drastically decreased due to faster and more efficient machining in combination with a higher degree of automation. Tool wear and time consuming tool renewal can be avoided. Machine tool footprints (in comparison to conventional horizontal broaching centers) or machine heights and fundaments (vertical centers) will be drastically reduced.

It focused on improved ways to manufacture 'fir tree' profiles that connect rotating blades and discs (blisks) in engines.\n\nADMAP-GAS evaluated abrasive water jet cutting (AWJC) and high-speed wire electrical discharge machining (HS-WEDM) to improve overall machining operations. No special tool had to be manufactured and tool wear had no influence on the workpiece performance. These new unconventional processes also helped to overcome machining challenges posed by the thermal and mechanical hardiness of nickel-based superalloys.\n\nScientists showed that both manufacturing technologies hold great promise for machining fir tree geometry profiles. Both processes improved material removal rates in combination with high form accuracy and surface quality. Compared to broaching, they allowed very flexible production of different profile geometries. \n\nThe developed AWJC process proved to be suitable for roughing cuts, which require a very economic technology to process hard-to-machine alloys. The process monitoring system, the multi-axis cutting head and the new developed nozzle geometry were all developed within ADMAP-GAS.\n\nFurthermore, the HS-WEDM process also proved to be a serious alternative to broaching, especially in terms of surface fatigue behaviour. Through optimising technology, scientists improved cutting rates and achieved very good surface integrities (minimal surface layer and contamination, and absence of cracks).\n\nFailure risks of engine discs decreased through the developed process monitoring systems. A life-cycle cost analysis showed a 25\u00a0% decrease in machining costs for producing a fir tree profile using one of the developed processes.

This will be complemented by our European partners, who will actively participate in the dissemination processes by issuing press releases to local media throughout the mobility. Friendly matches played by the participants against host opposition will be publicised in the host region and attendance by local spectators actively encouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\nAside from our own internal evaluation processes, SWFC will participate in a Sector Skills Alliance (SSA) involving other UK professional football clubs who are participating in Erasmus+ VET Learner mobility. This SSA will seek to improve the content and delivery of vocational training programmes and training methodologies in the UK by sharing European best practice and incorporating these initiatives within the vocational education framework.\r\n\r\nKey project objectives involve the enhanced acquisition of key coaching innovations which will result in improved player performance and enhanced skills levels for the participant during mobility. The ultimate evaluation of success will be an increase in employability of participants achieving success as a professional footballer or gaining employment in a secondary career pathway. These are medium/long term surveys, which will be undertaken by SWFC on an ongoing basis following completion of mobility.  The data collected will be disseminated freely.", "http://www.swfc.co.uk", "Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012943_coordinator"], ["1SW", "Increasing Apprentice Employability Through Mobility", "Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited", 45055.0, "This project will address key Erasmus+ priorities by targeting and benefiting 25 participants who are at a significant disadvantage in the labour market. \r\n\r\nThis Erasmus+ project will focus on providing European mobility experiences for our 25 young apprentices in the 16-20 age group who will travel to Portugal in July 2017.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese host partner is a regional training and coaching complex used by top Portuguese professional clubs (FC Olhanense, FC Portimonense, FC Louletano, FC Quarteirense).  Innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and player development. \r\n\r\nIn view of the differing restrictions imposed by the varying scholastic commitments of the players as they progress through their Modern Apprenticeship programme, plus their commitment to competitive match fixtures it was agreed by all of the partners that that a two week mobility period would provide maximum benefit from a European  mobility experience, while imposing minimum disruption to academic and vocational training courses. Mobility will be preceded by a structured preparatory phase and a two week duration will facilitate optimal absorption of the vocational training and skills development at the host institution.\r\n\r\nOur Portuguese host partner clubs are applauded as having world class records in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.  Innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and player development. Improved success rates for apprentices in being admitted to the first team ranks are anticipated, while improved academic attainment and European work experience will improve employability in secondary careers for those not fortunate enough to make the professional grade. \r\n\r\nConsequently this project will prioritise the following specific objectives :\r\n\u2022 Increase employability of all apprentices\r\n\u2022 Improve skillset of all apprentices to an international level\r\n\u2022 Provide apprentices with the knowledge and skills to compete on an International level\r\n\u2022 Enhance cultural awareness and social inclusion\r\n\u2022 Enhance training provisions and schedules at all levels in the club\r\n\u2022 Enhance the education of every apprentice through European learning6. Increased self-empowerment and self-esteem.\r\n\r\nOur Portuguese partner is fully committed to this Erasmus+ project, having successfully hosted participants in recent years from a variety of European countries under the Lifelong Learning Programme. \r\n\r\nYoung people in the UK are, in the main, rather parochial in nature and exhibit a reluctance to undertake occupational mobility. This is particularly so with young people who have poor records of academic achievement or are socially disadvantaged. At present, fewer than 1% of persons under the age of 21 in the UK will undertake a work-related mobility placement. This project will directly address this national shortcoming and will contribute to the Lisbon and Europe 2020 Strategies. \r\n\r\nFootball clubs are fairly unique entities in the access to the media of publicity and this will prove an excellent dissemination vehicle to encourage other young people to seek out mobility opportunities.\r\n\r\nSheffield Wednesday FC\u2019s dissemination activities will be complemented by our Portuguese partner, who will actively participate in the dissemination processes by issuing press releases to local media throughout the mobility. Friendly matches played by the participants against host opposition will be publicised in the host region and attendance by local spectators and vacationing Sheffield Wednesday FC supporters will be actively encouraged.", "http://www.swfc.co.uk", "Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036093_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "S6"}
