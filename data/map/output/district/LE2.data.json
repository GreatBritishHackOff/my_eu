Although building new homes according to the demanding energy efficiency regulations is essential, it will take several decades before such houses become a significant proportion of the stock.\n\nThe major challenge is to retrofit energy-inefficient buildings to meet 21st century standards. The EU-funded project 'Holistic energy-efficient retrofitting of residential buildings' (http://www.euroretrofit.com/ (HERB)) has been initiated to develop and demonstrate new and innovative energy-efficient technologies and solutions for retrofitting older buildings. These will be installed in a number of typical residential buildings in EU countries and their performance will be monitored.\n\nHERB is selecting and integrating the best available technologies, following a truly holistic approach.

The proposed solutions will be affordable, durable, easy to install, and compatible with existing building functions and aesthetics.\n\nThe types of building for retrofitting include detached, semi-detached and terrace houses, and flats of different ages. HERB will use various methods for measuring the building performance before and after retrofitting. These will be leakage tests and thermal imaging to determine the main parts of the building envelope that need to be improved. Furthermore, smart meters will be used for each technology to measure energy savings.\n\nSo far, project members have developed computer models for optimising components for each technology and each combination of technologies for retrofitting various types of buildings. Additionally, they have developed models for simulating energy demand and supply as well as the indoor environment in residential buildings.\n\nHERB is providing a holistic approach for retrofitting homes, allowing them to achieve the energy efficiency levels of new buildings.

This project builds on the success of our previous mobility projects, where we have seen significant impact on our learners, staff and course delivery as a direct result of participation in the mobility. \r\n\r\nThe Mobility project will provide the learners with on-the-job work experience, in a placement that is releavant to their vocational course of study. The skills that learner acquire during their work placement will be transferred back to Leicester college, and we will use the ECVET framework to validate specific units of the learners\u2019 vocational qualification.\r\n\r\nIn addition to gaining sector specific work experience, the learners will have the opportunity to develop their soft skills, such as team working, cross cultural communication and self assurance, in a structured and supportive setting. Each learner will have a line manager at their host organisation and will also be joined by a College tutor, who will act as an Accompanying Person, providing an additional layer of pastoral support to learners. \r\n\r\nThe project will recruit a total of 370 learners, which is a significant upscale of our mobility activity, meaning we can offer opportunities to a much wider range of learners within the College. Our learners are typically aged between 17-19, and many face economic and social barriers. For the majority of learners, this will be their first opportunity to work and and travel abroad, and we have designed our recruitment, preparation and support models to reflect this.\r\n\r\nWe will send 24 flows of learners, in groups of 10-20, to placements in Spain and Portugal over a 24 month period. The project gives us an opportunity to consolidate existing relationships with current host partners and expand our work by developing new partnerships. This will be the first time we are sending learners to Portugal. We have ensured that a process of due diligence has been followed when engaging new partners. We are also enlisting the support of a UK partner, REY Europe, who will support some of the central coordination functions, the project set up and the logistical arrangements. \r\n\r\nThe placements will last for 2-4 weeks, depending on the vocational area and the profile of learners. We consider this timeframe to berealistic and attainable for each group to gain valuable work experience, allowing a sufficient period for learners to adjust to life in a new country as well gain a meaningful experience with the host organisations that will enable them to achieve their specific learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nEach learner will complete a range of tasks within their work placement that are related to their vocational course of study. Our course tutors have selected specific units of their vocational course that can be achieved within the context of the work placement, avoiding the need for classroom duplication on their return. The learning outcomes for each unit will be detailed in an individual learning agreement for each participant, which will also include guidance on how learning should be recorded and evidenced whilst the learner is on placement. The ECVET framework will be used to support this process, with all roles and responsibilities for the host organisation detailed within a memorandum of understanding. The course tutor will meet with each of the host organisations during the first week of the mobility to discuss this process and clarify roles and responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe mobility will also provide an opportunity for soft skills development, and learners will be supported to set goals and reflect on their learning in this area. \r\n\r\nWe have seen positive impact on the learners that have been involved in our mobility programming to date, and we hope to build on this through this project. The mobility will provide an opportunity for personal and professional development, and we expect this to impact on our learners by increasing their job readiness and broadening their perspective and aspirations. They will gain sector specific work experience and a new perspective on labour market opportunities. We hope this will motivate, engage and inspire our learners to complete their course of study and progress to further education and/or employment. \r\n\r\nIt is a staff development opportunity for those tutors involved, and it enables us as a College to enhance our course offering, making our courses more attractive to prospective learners and widening the scope of our curriculum. It contributes to the College's wider internationalisation strategy, to bring new perspectives and engage in new partnerships within our work.

We have a top priority: gaining an international and European exposure. Some of us have sent students and apprentices abroad for a couple of years and managed to build a reliable network of workplaces and strong partnerships (UK, Finland, Spain, Germany). Experienced and willing to make mobility accessible to a greater number of students, we want to encourage the expansion of the other members thanks to our network thus allowing more young people from modest backgrounds to go on work experience placements.\r\nOur mobility actions are aimed at vocational baccalaureate students and apprentices in Commerce, Customer Services, Sales, Logistics and vocational baccalaureate students in Business & Administration, Beauty & Care, Clothing Design and Metal Work. All the students are part of our European classes. They wish to gain professional and cultural skills in a foreign environment and raise their language level. Mobility experiences are real life experiences and assets to complete their training, adapt to the demands of the labour market and continue their studies.\r\nWe have planned to send 90 students and 30 apprentices, aged 17 to 20, over the next two years. We will send different groups of selected students together according to their lines and types of training. The baccalaureate students will stay for 4 weeks whereas the apprentices for 2 weeks owing to the legal obligations binding them to their employers in France. We will inform, advise and prepare them to live a comfortable work experience abroad. Our challenge will be to mix and gather the different types of students during linguistic, cultural and professional preparation sessions by pooling the teaching staff of our colleges (teachers, language assistants and civic service voluntary workers). Our aim is to create a feeling of cohesion and help each young learner fit actively in the \u201cCitoyen d\u2019Europe\u201d path we will especially set up for them.\r\nOur students will be placed either in companies or benefit from adapted professional stays within the frame of our partnerships. The teachers will organise and coordinate the students\u2019 stays by keeping close contacts with their tutors and the college partners. They will also accompany them on their trips and will pay on-the-spot visits to assess the students\u2019 progress along with their different partners. We will use and complete both national evaluation documents (official grids based on vocational baccalaureate frameworks) and the Europass assessment forms to validate the different skills acquired. The students will be encouraged to take specific oral examinations to highlight their personal, linguistic and professional involvement (baccalaureate with the \u201cEuropean Section\u201d distinction or EuroMobipro). They will be honoured for their progress and their exemplary attitude at graduation ceremonies. \r\nWe have also planned 8 professional stays for our teaching and management staff. Their impact on teaching practices is an added value for our initial training schemes within our respective colleges.\r\nThe steering committee of our consortium will ensure the quality of our mobility actions throughout the stages of the project (organisation, financial management, intermediary and final reports). The members will draw specific attention to analysing our results, measuring the impact of the project on the students trained in their area. They will also support the partnerships to strengthen our European identity.\r\nAbove all, we are willing to act on a human level. Thanks to our project and the activities planned, we want to show our students and apprentices that they are able to succeed. The vocational route within our educational system can also contribute to the personal and professional development of these young adults.", "http://www.leicestercollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036810_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LE2"}
