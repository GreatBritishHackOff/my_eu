Technologies envisaged for envelope retrofitting include various types of insulation materials. Energy efficient solutions will also be deployed including energy efficient lighting and HVAC, and renewable energy systems. The technologies and solutions will be affordable, durable, easy for installation and compatible with existing building functions and aesthetics as well as energy efficient. The types of building for retrofitting will include detached, semidetached and terrace houses, and flats of different ages. Methods for measurement of building performance before and after retrofitting will include leakage test and thermal imaging to determine the major areas of building envelope for improvement, in addition to smart energy metering for individual technologies and building as a whole. The buildings will be retrofitted to at least the latest national building standards for new buildings. The type and number of technology deployed will be optimised using life cycle energy analysis for each type of building.\n\nThe work programme will involve development of computer models for optimising technologies and solutions, analysing dynamic energy demand of buildings and predicting microclimate indoors, development and testing of technologies and solutions under laboratory conditions, retrofitting and monitoring residential buildings in different climatic conditions, and a socio-economic analysis.\n\nThe above outcomes will be delivered through innovative solutions developed by a Consortium comprising leading companies, universities and public institutions from 10 European countries.", 158007.0, 6821858.0, "HERB", "Green solutions for old buildings", "An EU-funded project is working to develop sustainable refurbishment solutions for residential buildings. Its energy-efficient retrofit approach takes into account different building types, climates and socioeconomic conditions.", "Europe is facing a big challenge regarding the energy consumption of its housing stock given that it accounts for approximately 40\u00a0% of the total energy consumed. Although building new homes according to the demanding energy efficiency regulations is essential, it will take several decades before such houses become a significant proportion of the stock.\n\nThe major challenge is to retrofit energy-inefficient buildings to meet 21st century standards. The EU-funded project 'Holistic energy-efficient retrofitting of residential buildings' (http://www.euroretrofit.com/ (HERB)) has been initiated to develop and demonstrate new and innovative energy-efficient technologies and solutions for retrofitting older buildings. These will be installed in a number of typical residential buildings in EU countries and their performance will be monitored.\n\nHERB is selecting and integrating the best available technologies, following a truly holistic approach. Technologies envisaged for envelope retrofitting include various types of insulation materials. Energy-efficient solutions will also be deployed, including energy-efficient lighting, heating, ventilating and air conditioning as well as renewable energy systems. The proposed solutions will be affordable, durable, easy to install, and compatible with existing building functions and aesthetics.\n\nThe types of building for retrofitting include detached, semi-detached and terrace houses, and flats of different ages. HERB will use various methods for measuring the building performance before and after retrofitting. These will be leakage tests and thermal imaging to determine the main parts of the building envelope that need to be improved. Furthermore, smart meters will be used for each technology to measure energy savings.\n\nSo far, project members have developed computer models for optimising components for each technology and each combination of technologies for retrofitting various types of buildings. Additionally, they have developed models for simulating energy demand and supply as well as the indoor environment in residential buildings.\n\nHERB is providing a holistic approach for retrofitting homes, allowing them to achieve the energy efficiency levels of new buildings. With its proposed solutions, HERB is moving towards the goal of a low-carbon society, achieving more than a 60\u00a0% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.", "http://www.euroretrofit.com/", "http://www.lha.org.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/156353.jpg", "fp7_105487_953748136"], ["2LF", "Enhacing TRANslational SAFEty Assessment through Integrative Knowledge Management", "Pds Computer Software Limited", "Drug safety assessment is a knowledge-intensive process that demands advancement in data handling methods and tools for facilitating data sharing, mining, analysis and predictive modelling. This need is not restricted to any specific type of data and real advancement requires integrating information of different types and from different sources (e.g. publicly available biomedical knowledge, proprietary preclinical and clinical data, evidence from post-marketing studies) for addressing drug safety assessment from a holistic perspective.\n\nThe eTRANSAFE project will address these needs by developing a powerful data integration infrastructure (Knowledge Hub) and a collection of computational tools (exploitation modules) for making optimal use of these data. The proposed system will be a flexible and expandable framework, built on previous experience and applying state-of-the-art methods and technologies for providing the most advanced solutions for data sharing, interoperability and exploitation. An experienced honest broker will guarantee the confidentiality of any proprietary data. The project will develop in silico tools for data mining, visualisation, and prediction of potential toxicity, with specific attention to the assessment of the preclinical to clinical predictivity and the discovery of safety biomarkers. The CDISC-SEND format will be supported, facilitating the preparation of regulatory-compliant documentation. This infrastructure will be underpinned by development of open standards and guidelines recognised by regulatory agencies and international organisations.\n\nThe eTRANSAFE consortium brings together 13 organizations that mobilize an unprecedented capacity and resources, uniquely placed to leverage the experience of eTOX and other EU projects and initiatives. The project partners are six prestigious academic institutions, six highly skilled small-medium enterprises (SME) and one European infrastructure (ELIXIR), bringing in this way a perfect balance.", 483022.0, 34470237.0, "eTRANSAFE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_212141_918285906"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LE2"}
