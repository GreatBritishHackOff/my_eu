Crucial in this is the lack of appropriate outcome measures that can robustly identify patient benefit from a specific therapy. The lack of specific and sensitive endpoints to differentiate between responders and non-responders both at the level of pain and tissue structure modification (disease modifying OA drug: DMOAD) has led to trials that included hundreds of patients in each arm with at least 3-years follow-up. Even despite these enormous trials, EMA and FDA have not approved any DMOAD yet. There is a general lack of understanding OA pathogenesis, which appears rather variable and likely reflecting different phenotypes with fundamental differences in disease aetiology, tissue alterations, clinical manifestations (pain/mobility) and disease progression. Although the current mind-set for drug treatment in the field is moving to a more personalized medicine and patient stratification approach, there are no accepted methods or guidelines to classify patients according to their prognosis and differentiate between subsets in terms of diagnosis methodology and treatment plan. The APPROACH consortium brings together a competent and multidisciplinary group of stakeholders that will setup \u2013 for the first time \u2013 a longitudinal cohort based on highly innovative stratification methods that identifies different OA phenotypes and subsequently develop guidelines for differentially diagnosing the right patient for the right treatment.\n\nThe stratified medicine APPROACH \nThe APPROACH consortium brings together a unique complimentary set of skills to develop, validate and link biomarkers with biological processes and clinical end points in OA patient subsets. This will support future regulatory qualification and guide clinical trials for relevant endpoint validation, thereby paving the road for stratified or personalized medicine. This leads to the following overall objectives of the consortium:\n- Implement and establish a new, integrated and comprehensive database platform of existing data from partners that will be extended with newly collected longitudinal data, incorporating novel high quality biomarkers.\n- Define subsets of (phenotypically) different patients in both the existing cohorts as well as (later) in the new longitudinal extension cohorts and subsequently identify the \u201cright patient\u201d to treat for each subset/phenotype via innovative stratification techniques. \n- Optimize, introduce and validate the next generation imaging methodologies (modality \\ post-processing), human motion analysis and biochemical assays to enable more efficient and reliable diagnoses and treatment of OA patients. \n- Identify mechanistic targets for patient subsets, create prediction models and establish guidelines for a DMOAD development that forms the roadmap for OA.\n\nAPPROACH: a tri-partite partnership between relevant stakeholders\nThe ambitious objectives of the APPROACH consortium require the mobilization of a broad set of skills and extensive expertise, from academics, clinicians and the private sector.

Influenza infections affect all age groups but children and adults over the age of 65 are at most risk of developing severe disease.\nVaccination is the most effective approach to reduce the impact of annual influenza outbreaks and potential pandemics, however, the currently criteria of correlates of protection(CoP) show limitations in predicting protection for seasonal and pandemic vaccines. \nThe Haemagglutinin Inhibition(HAI) antibody titre is the most widely used CoP for seasonal influenza vaccine even if there is a lack of standardisation for conducting HAI and other serological assays and therefore  results obtained from different laboratories are not comparable. This leads to the urgent need of  improving international standardisation of serological assays to reduce inter laboratory variability and to generate supportive immunological assays to be used in studies aimed at developing clinically relevant surrogate markers of protection of influenza vaccines.\nObjectives: The main long-term aim of the FLUCOP project is to improve and standardize the existing immunological assays and to develop new assays for the better evaluation of the CoP of influenza vaccines.\nMain specific FLUCOP objectives include:\n-\tachieve standardization of HAI and Virus Neutralization(VN) assays;\n-\tpromote the understanding and application of Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI) and Neuraminidase (NA) assays as tools for the evaluation of influenza vaccines; \n-\tdevelop selective new assays which might potentially used for future clinical trials for influenza seasonal vaccine evaluation\nFLUCOP Consortium and Project Impact: The FLUCOP consortium brings together 26 groups from 7 European countries, and includes contributors from the academic, governmental, non-for-profit and pharmaceutical sectors. As a whole, the consortium has a balanced array of expertise and each group has been carefully selected to avoid overlaps in research activities and to collectively address the planned objectives. FLUCOP is expected to have a significant impact to improve and standardize the existing immunological assays and develop new assays to better evaluate influenza vaccines. This will contribute to the future clinical trial evaluation and possible establishment of correlates of protection Through a public-private collaboration FLUCOP will reach a common agreement on assays and methods to be used by all groups both from the public and private sector for testing influenza vaccines in humans. These efforts are expected to aid evolution of the regulatory guidelines and the practice of the pharmaceutical industry following the application of the methods to efficacy studies.\nProject plan: To reach the proposed objectives, the FLUCOP project is composed of five focused interconnected work packages(WP).\nWP1:Standardization of HAI and VN assays.\nObjective: HAI and VN assays are commonly used to quantify influenza specific antibodies but they show to be highly variable between laboratories. Moreover different protocols are in use in different laboratories, which may contribute to the variability of the assays. This WP aims to improve the standardization and harmonization of these assays and also preparation and qualification of critical reagents.\nMethodology: Adult and paediatric pre and post influenza vaccination serum samples will be available to consortium partners who are recognized as leading experts in serological analysis of influenza vaccine responses.

Together with EFPIA partners our aims will be to set policy & guidance and deliver robust information technology tools to address the potential for the reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through mobile applications and the recognition of drug safety signals from user comments in social media and the internet. The policies, guidance and tools delivered through WEB-RADR will be underpinned by extensive academic research and user testing to ensure the project meets the needs of all stakeholders, including patients.\n\nBackground\nReporting by healthcare professionals and patients by means of mobile devices and social media platforms to National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and marketing authorisation holders with subsequent transmission to EudraVigilance is a new, unexplored concept. The amount of information generated through social media requires a structured, scientific approach for monitoring, reporting, analysing and evaluation of ADRs. Whilst there are numerous benefits of the use of social media, the impact on healthcare professionals and patients and their behaviour towards the use of medicines needs to be further analysed. WEB-RADR will address these areas.\n\nLeadership\nWEB-RADR will be managed by the MHRA\u2019s project management team that are also leading the EC Joint Action (Strengthening Collaborations for Operating Pharmacovigilance in Europe, SCOPE). This will enable the alignment and consistency of the two projects. The MHRA has extensive experience in managing successful pharmacovigilance and IT projects (E2B compliant web-forms for ADR reporting; integration with EudraVigilance; drug and medical dictionary mapping; integration with NHS electronic health records) as well as being a leading regulatory agency, helping to shape the current legislative framework.\nEstablishing clear policies and guidance for stakeholders in the use of these technologies, in line with legislative requirements, is of paramount importance to regulators and industry. The EMA will provide leadership in this area, supported by colleagues from MHRA, HALMED & LAREB. As the central regulatory agency for medicines policy in the EU it is natural for the EMA lead in this area as the outputs of WEB-RADR will have a direct bearing on future operations affecting EudraVigilance, Good Vigilance Practice (GVP) guidance, signal detection and risk communication. Expertise from a national perspective together with EFPIA input will also be essential.\n\nTechnical Platform\nThe development of technical platforms for both the reporting of ADRs via a mobile application and recognising drug safety issues from social media will be led by Epidemico who already offer a number of products through an ongoing partnership with the FDA. Working with SRDC and EFPIA sponsors, WEB-RADR will produce an online dashboard and data feed of data identifying ADRs from social media in multiple languages. A mobile app for direct reporting of ADRs to national authorities in E2B(R2) Individual Case Safety Report compatible format will be developed. To achieve this we propose to expand the prototype MedWatcher Social platform to include social media monitoring in the EU and the MedWatcher App for reporting ADRs.\n\nAnalysis\nLed by UMC and working with SRDC, WEB-RADR will ensure the technical platform for gathering drug safety data from social media delivers meaningful and useable data in the EU pharmacovigilance setting. It is essential that data collected use standardised drug, product and medical terms. Mapping of the terms to ensure compatibility with EudraVigilance and NCA databases will be carried out so that terms in the Article 57 database and MedDRA are the basis for analysis. It is essential to detect and manage duplicate reports. A major effort in WEB-RADR will be the advancement of new methodologies to meet this challenge.

During the past decade, annual fossil fuel CO2 emissions have sharply increased at a rate of 3%/yr, almost doubling the rate of the prior three decades. To a big surprise, the corresponding increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were relatively modest during this time frame. This coincidence has led to the hypothesis that the sharp rise in fossil fuel emissions and increase in sink strength especially since early 2000 may be a result of carbon sink processes that are controlled by the increasing emissions themselves, namely increased nitrogen deposition and a larger fraction of diffuse versus direct solar radiation from increased sulfate aerosol emissions.\nThe objective of the proposed work is to estimate changes in global terrestrial carbon uptake over the last decades and attribute their cause(s) through a combination of observation-based and modelling approaches. We will investigate three main hypotheses in regards to increased terrestrial carbon uptake during recent decades, including (i) a progressive relaxation of climatic constraints on plant productivity including warming in northern temperate, boreal and tundra ecosystems and increases in rainfall rates over tropical savannas, (ii) increases in the fraction of diffuse/direct radiation associated predominantly with East Asian sulfate aerosol emissions that spurred plant photosynthetic rates, and (iii) increases in nitrogen deposition from East Asian fossil fuel burning that increased carbon plant uptake.\nThis research is designed to improve our knowledge about carbon cycle feedbacks under climate change, a first-order uncertainty in climate models, leading to more credible projections of future climate.", 80663.0, 80663.0, "IRACCS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.leeds.ac.uk", null, "fp7_186931_999975426"], ["9JT", "Next Generation Driving Behaviour Models", "University of Leeds", "Microscopic traffic simulation tools which replicate individual driver decisions and combine them to deduce network conditions are popular tools for evaluating transport planning and management options.

However, faster growth has been seen in the revision market, where prosthetic joints are replaced, than in primary interventions.

Further, it has been demonstrated that adverse or extreme loading has a detrimental effect on implant performance. Thus, device failure still occurs too frequently leading to the conclusion that their longevity and reliability must be improved. The premise of this proposal is to realise that wear and corrosion are an inevitable consequence of all implant interfaces within contemporary total joint replacements. To overcome this problem our novel approach is to use silicon nitride coatings in which the combined high wear resistance of this material and solubility of any silicon nitride wear particles released, reduce the overall potential for adverse tissue reactions. In this work a variety of silicon nitride based coatings will be applied to different tribological scenarios related to total hip arthroplasty.

Increasing evidence indicates that the progressive accumulation of these protein aggregates in cells or tissues is linked to disease pathology.\n\nDespite the broad spectrum of amyloidosis-related diseases and the unrelated function of the proteins that get misfolded, the resulting aggregates have a common fibrillar structure. This similarity implies that different diseases may manifest from similar mechanisms of cytotoxicity.\n\nWith this in mind, the EU-funded 'Membrane activity of amyloid fibrils: unravelling cell killing mechanism' (AMYLOID) study set out to investigate the impact of amyloid fibrils on cell function. In particular, researchers concentrated on the association of protein aggregates with cellular membranes. To this end, they used beta2-microglobulin (b2m), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily as a model system of amyloidosis. Misfolded b2m is seen in dialysis-related amyloidosis, a rare disorder affecting 700 000 patients worldwide.\n\nUsing fluorescence spectroscopy, researchers found that b2m fibrils disrupt cell membrane lipids, thereby hampering membrane integrity and rendering it permeable to water-soluble molecules. With the aid of an electron microscope, they visualised membrane damage and subsequent formation of small vesicles at the nanometer level. The extent of cytotoxicity depended on fibril fragmentation and interestingly, amyloid fibrils exhibited an enhanced affinity for lysosomal membranes. This result provided an explanation of the dysfunction of lysosomes in amyloidosis-related diseases.\n\nTo address the issue of protein aggregate sequestration, scientists tested biomolecules (glycosaminoglycans and polyphenols) known for their ability to modulate fibril formation. Among the compounds screened, heparin proved to be the most powerful in suppressing fibril-induced membrane damage.\n\nCollectively, the results of the AMYLOID project provide a deeper understanding of fibril-membrane association and the mechanism behind fibril-mediated pathology.

The concept is applicable to Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) in terms of domestic political and policy reforms. New members accept European values either because they must, or because those values are seen to be best. The EU-funded project 'International development policies of the New Member States \u2013 Europeanization and future directions' (INTDEPNEW) explored such changes. Over one year to August 2013, the study aimed to illuminate the emerging Europeanisation of international development policies of CEECs.\n\nThe project addressed four main research areas. Has Europeanisation occurred in development policies of CEECs? Aside from the EU, what factors affect construction of the policies? How do non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in CEECs differ from development NGOs elsewhere? What do aid-receiving countries think about the re-emergence of CEEC donors? \n\nRegarding the first two questions, the team studied CEEC policies towards assistance for developing countries. Effectively, the EU required such policies of its new members, though without hard rules. Hence, Europeanisation in the area of aid seems limited and superficial; in practice, CEECs have little interest in aiding other countries and do the minimum. Furthermore, the project showed that foreign policy goals drive such aid that CEECs provide. Typically, CEECs send aid to their former Soviet eastern neighbours. In some cases, the financial crisis meant dramatic cuts to aid levels, made possible because of the low public interest.  \n\nINTDEPNEW showed that NGOs in CEECs faced similar challenges to those elsewhere, though with particular challenges. The difficulties included managing relationships with government, how to organise effectively, and maintaining and building resources.  \n\nLastly, the project showed that aid-receiving countries prefer CEEC donors. Reasons include the lack of colonial associations, and that CEECs understand transitional issues. Interviewees stressed the importance of the latter, which leads to superior rapport in spite of the lack of professionalism compared to traditional donors.  \n\nThe INTDEPNEW project contributed an improved understanding of development aid policy issues to interested parties, including aid organisations.

DNA methylation is a primary epigenetic mechanism mediated by a family of methyltransferase enzymes. Maintenance function of DNA methylation is well conserved among plants and animals, based on the structural similarity of their methylation proteins. In contrast to plants, however, mammals do not tolerate loss of methylation, making it difficult to study. The model plant Arabidopsis offers a powerful test system for plant and mammalian methylation, because its methylation mutants are viable and fertile, and methylation patterns are not erased via developmental demethylation/remethylation cycles. Plants experience more extreme environment than mammals, and the evolution of plant methyltransferases may have favoured improved stress adaptation, while in mammals, it may lead to more stable establishment and resetting phases during development.\nOBJECTIVES: 1) To exploit Arabidopsis as an experimental system for mammalian epigenetic studies; 2) to elucidate the evolution of epigenetic diversity by defining differences and conserved function of plant and mammalian methylation regulators; 3) to assess how methylation affects plant stress adaptation.\nMETHODOLOGY: Re-methylation efficiency in methylation mutants and prevention of methylation loss in plants by mammalian transgenes will be tested by bisulphite sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Hybrid constructs between the plant and animal proteins will be used. Methylation mutants will be exposed to abiotic variables to compare their stress adaptability.

To achieve this goal we will develop quantitative models that can capture these complex dynamics, obtain relevant parameter values and validate the models by testing them in suitable in vitro, animal models and in clinical settings. We will address three main areas (A-C) in 11 different work packages. A. Formation and emergence of resistant bacteria (WPs1-5). The rate of formation of resistant mutants is one major determinant that influences how rapidly resistant mutants will appear in response to antibiotic use. Depending on the type of resistance mechanism factors such as rates of mutation, recombination and transfer of plasmids will be important. In WPs 1-5 we will experimentally determine these rates for different combinations of bacterial species and resistance mechanisms. B. Survival and persistence of resistant strains (WPs 6-8). A key factor that affects the survival and persistence of resistant strains is the impact the particular resistance mechanism has on bacterial physiology, including bacterial growth rate and virulence. We want to determine the effect of various drug resistance mechanisms on cellular physiology and fitness to establish a link between the molecular alteration and potential effects at the cellular level. C. Transmission of resistant strains (WPs 9-11).

BACKGROUND: Cilia are microtubule-based, centriole-derived projections from the cell surface. They transduce extracellular signals and regulate key processes in which signals of the extracellular environment are translated into a cellular response, such as cell cycle control, Wnt signalling, Shh signalling and planar cell polarity. Disruption of cilium-based processes by mutations can cause very severe disorders. Many of these ciliopathies have overlapping phenotypes. There is evidence, that ciliary proteins are organized in cell/context specific complexes and/or in shared regulatory circuits in cilia of affected tissues. Yet, knowledge of the composition, wiring, dynamics and associated signaling pathways of the corresponding molecular building blocks and associated protein networks remains very limited. APPROACH: We propose here that ciliopathies can be considered systemically as specific perturbations in a versatile dynamically regulated multifunctional molecular machine. Mainly based on the comprehensive description of the ciliary interactome, quantitative functional assays as well as human genetic data derived from ciliopathy patients, we will generate a comprehensive stream of content-rich quantitative data towards systemic analysis of ciliar function. These data will be used to generate and validate discrete models that describe functional modules and regulatory circuits in the ciliome as well as predicting biological context specific features of cilia as well as perturbations leading to ciliopathies.

Motile cilia propel fluid, for example to remove mucus and dirt by lung epithelial cells. Alternatively, immotile or primary cilia serve as antennas for receiving and transducing signals, for example by the sensory cilia of retinal photoreceptors.\n\nDysfunction of cilia gives rise to a group of hereditary disorders with overlapping clinical symptoms, known as ciliopathies. As a result, it is vital to understand how they contribute to human disease in order to develop novel therapies.  \n\nThe key objective of the EU-funded 'A systems biology approach to dissect cilia function and its disruption in human genetic disease' (http://syscilia.org (SYSCILIA)) project is to investigate the function of ciliary proteins in health and disease. For this purpose, they used a systems biology approach and set out to develop models capable of predicting the outcome of ciliary protein perturbations.\n\nAs a first step, partners analysed the ciliary proteome, which consists of over 1\u00a0000 proteins, found key motifs and stored the data on a central resource system.

In another partnership, SEP3 forms a complex with SEEDSTICK (STK) that controls the gene VERDANDI, which has an important and direct role in fertilisation.\n\nAgain, looking at SEP1-4, AP1 and STK, the genes act in a partly overlapping, yet sometimes targeted fashion, depending on the stage of reproduction and flowering.

State of the Art and beyond: The first generation of targeted therapies in chronic inflammatory disease used RA as prototype disease for clinical development. These therapies are now also used in other inflammatory disorders. Although treatments have been developed that are effective in a proportion of patients, they are aspecific, relatively toxic and do not mediate cure. Currently, it is unknown which molecular effects need to be induced and/or targeted to prevent induction or persistency of RA. However, this is within reach through a strong international consortium of world-leading European groups that cover both basic- and translational research.  Work plan: The general strategy for the project is to enable parallel studies that are focussed on critical switch moments in the biological processes that drive chronicity of inflammation. As the consortium consists of a multidisciplinary team with basic- and clinical expertise, translational research will be conducted to delineate the molecular basis of dysregulated inflammation, the RA-specific autoimmune-response and organ specific pathobiology.  The final aim is to develop novel- and specific anti-inflammatory therapies.

However, about 78\u00a0% of patients sought help too late due to gradual onset of RA symptoms, believing that their symptoms would resolve spontaneously. To ensure early intervention in RA, 'early arthritis recognition clinics' were opened in Europe. These clinics provided insight into onset of RA symptoms through donated blood serum samples.\n\nResearch into biological mechanisms demonstrated an auto-antibody response increasing in magnitude and complexity shortly before the onset of arthritis. Such an abnormality might serve as an early indicator of risk for RA-development, providing a window of opportunity to initiate early treatment and prevent disease onset.

Meeting this requirement necessitates a commitment to substantial investments into appropriate facilities, specialized equipment and extensive training of personnel, which has been realised by the establishment of the I3-project EUPRIM-Net in the 6th framework programme. The aim of EUPRIM-Net is to contribute to European science by improving the ability of its participants to provide the best services, support the best science that meets the highest ethical standards for primate-based animal research.\nWith the funding of EUPRIM-Net II we will build on the successes of the starting phase of EUPRIM-Net to focus on the following overarching core objectives:\n\n- advancing the 3Rs (refinement, reduction, replacement) in primate research\n\n- develop, refine and ensure best practice in primate research\n\n- extend the network in Europe to include commercial partners and extend the network to include non-European primate centres to insure a global sharing of available resources.\n\nAdditionally, EUPRIM-Net places a focus on moving away from EU funding and implementing self-sustaining structures.", 523359.0, 7616096.0, "EUPRIM-NET II", "Advancing 3R standards for primates", "Non-human primates (NHPs) are essential for biomedical research.

EUPRIM-NET\u00a0II has also trained four primate veterinarians, organised a web-based exchange module and offers an ongoing rotation programme. A lecture series is now available in seven European languages.\n\nTools developed for primate health include a Luminex-based serology assay for respiratory viruses and polymerase chain reaction assays for rapid detection of the main intestinal microbes. For determination of immune responses, the group has identified multiplex immunoassays and differences in T\u00a0cell populations and messenger RNA in monkeys infected with GBV-B (hep\u00a0B) and herpes\u00a0B, respectively.\n\nTelemetry, using wireless recordings, for measurements of physiological data reduces incidence of handling and restraining.

Errors introduced by these readings accumulate over the lifetime of such systems, preventing many of them from running for more than a few hours. By autonomously modelling spatio-temporal dynamics, our robots will be able run for significantly longer than current systems (at least 120 days by the end of the project). Long runtimes provide previously unattainable opportunities for a robot to learn about its world. Our systems will take these opportunities, advancing long-term mapping, life-long learning about objects, person tracking, human activity recognition and self-motivated behaviour generation.

Of particular importance are their effects on driver behaviour and strategies, and their impact on the operation and safety of the traffic system.  The aim of the proposed project is to develop and validate a unified model of driver behaviour and driver interaction with innovative technologies in emergency situations. This model will be applicable to and validated for all the surface transport modes. Drivers\u2019 age, gender, education and experience and culture are factors that will be considered together with influences from the environment and the vehicle.  A unified model of driver behaviour will be of great use when designing innovative technologies since it will allow for assessment and tuning of the systems in a safe and controllable environment. At the concept stage, the model could guide designers in identifying potential problem areas whilst at the prototype stage, the model could inform on the scenarios to be used in system evaluation. In this way the systems will be better adapted to the drivers before being available on the market and will provide better support to the driver in emergency situations. Along the same lines, the model could be of use for authorities as a guide in assessing and approving innovative technologies without performing extensive simulator experiments or large scale field trials.

Sophisticated sensors, technical improvements and more robust materials are all being developed and integrated into cars, trains and boats. However, the EU wants to ensure that all these advances are as effective and useful as their developers promise.\n\nTo address this concern, the EU-funded project 'IT for error remediation and trapping emergencies' (Iterate) developed a model of driver behaviour to develop, assess and validate innovative technologies. The model was designed to consider driver interaction with support systems and help in refining new technologies that support drivers in critical situations. It can also be used by authorities to approve new technologies without the need to conduct large-scale experiments and field trials.\n\nThe model is based on the principle that the underlying factors influencing human behaviour, like age, gender and culture, are constant between transport modes. This has enabled the project team to produce a unified model of driver behaviour. In addition, the team developed a resource from results of experiments it conducted during the project so that the research community can benefit from its use.\n\nTo achieve its aims, Iterate built two portable simulators with LCD screens that were used in experiments aimed to test the model with  183 car drivers and 110 train drivers in 5 countries. It found that the newly developed small-scale portable simulators were as effective as their large-scale counterparts in studying driver behaviour. The project then fine-tuned the simulators even further and carried out experiments aboard sea-faring vessels as well. Although the technology did prove useful aboard ships as well, the team concluded that it was more effective in road transport vehicles.\n\nOverall, the Iterate team produced a solid theoretical model of driver behaviour that applies to different transportation modes. It completed the database of simulator experiments and developed a viable simulation tool for driver behaviour. Other project deliverables include a new book on 'Human modelling of assisted transportation', and more than 20 publications based on the project's work.\n\nTeam experts strongly believe that the simulation tool can help develop better advanced driver support systems and contribute to both safety and mobility aspects of driving behaviour. The project's results are slated to impact traffic safety positively and lower road fatalities by supporting the development of more viable and cost-effective systems that improve safety.

Lipid nanodiscs will be evaluated as a novel hydrophobic drug carrier and the versatility of the scaffold protein for these discs will be explored by assessing its capacity to form similar complexes with synthetic block copolymers. Multicompartmental, size-limited nanostructures will be developed by using the self-organisation of functional amphiphiles into anisotropic subunits as building blocks for superstructures of greater complexity and functionality. The basic building blocks explored will consist of liposomes, polymersomes and hydrid lipopolymersome structures as well as protein-stabilised lipid nanodiscs. This project will also explore incorporating quantum dots into these nanoarchitectures as an added imaging modality.

High grade brain tumors are extremely difficult to treat due to tumor cell invasion, plus resistance of tumor cells to DNA-damaging therapy. This cellular aggressiveness within brain tumors has been attributed to a subpopulation of tumor cells that possess stem cells-like features.\nUnlike differentiated tumor cells, brain tumour stem cells (BTSCs) possess the ability to self-renew, to withstand DNA-damaging therapy, and to give rise to new tumor mass. Therefore, targeting BTSCs is expected to improve the efficiency of anti-brain cancer therapy. In particular, targeting pathways that sustain the undifferentiated state of BTSCs is a novel strategy to treat aggressive brain tumors. However, this approach is hampered by a poor understanding of appropriate targets promoting the BTSC phenotype.\nRecently, we have demonstrated that the adapter protein TRRAP maintains BTSCs in an undifferentiated and highly tumorigenic state. Consistently, elevated expression of TRRAP in human brain tumors has a strong negative effect on patient survival. Therefore, we aim to provide a basis toward the development of an effective therapeutic strategy against the malignant function of TRRAP in BTSCs.\nTo this end, we will use our established BTSC assay system and BTSC in vivo models in combination with differential proteomics to characterize TRRAP protein domains and TRRAP-protein interactions that critically promote the BTSC phenotype. Moreover, we will investigate the role of TRRAP during brain tumor invasion and potential additive effects between DNA-damaging therapy and inhibition of TRRAP function in vivo.\nOverall, these interrelated approaches will validate TRRAP as a brain tumor target.

The identification of molecular markers predictive of progression from preinvasive to invasive cancer is the key to develop successful screening tools. Genomic alterations are particularly suitable molecular markers of cancer. The most common genomic abnormality in SCC is gene amplification on chromosome 3q. Despite several candidate oncogene(s) having been identified in this region, due to limits of resolution of current techniques, the minuscule amount of tissue from preinvasive lesions and the fact that most studies were done before the human genome sequence was available, the relevance of these genes in the etiology of SCC is controversial and the precise target(s) of 3q amplification remains ill defined.

In cancer, the immune system can be both cause and cure; it contributes to chronic inflammation that promotes tumour development, but it can also provide the ultimate weapon against metastatic disease. Thus, the development of ways to harness, direct or restrain immune responses has great potential for enhancing human health. Understanding the mechanisms that control the abundance of different lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell) subsets is key to therapeutically targeting immune responses.

Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a field that excels in its ability to simulate human systems and has therefore become a popular tool for simulating disasters and for modelling strategies that are aimed at mitigating developing problems. However, the field suffers from a serious drawback: models are not able to incorporate up-to-date data (e.g. social media, mobile telephone use, public transport records, etc.). Instead they are initialised with historical data and therefore their forecasts diverge rapidly from reality.\n\nTo address this major shortcoming, this research will develop dynamic data assimilation methods for use in ABMs. These techniques have already revolutionised weather forecasts and could offer the same advantages for ABMs of social systems. There are serious methodological barriers that must be overcome, but this research has the potential to produce a step change in the ability of models to create accurate short-term forecasts of social systems.

Global forests hold enormous amounts of carbon in their biomass, which has absorbed about 20% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions over recent decades. Whether the size of this sink will persist, intensify, decrease or even become a source is highly uncertain, yet knowing this is crucial to the calculation of carbon emission budgets consistent with limiting global temperature rise. One of the most compelling explanations for this uncertainty is a lack of knowledge of how tree mortality affects forest carbon storage on a global scale. Mortality rates and mechanisms are closely tied to forest structure and composition, and thus the storage of carbon in biomass, but mechanistic complexity and the difficulty of measurement have hindered understanding, resulting in a striking lack of consensus in existing assessments. TreeMort will remedy this, combining newly available sources of data with appropriate conceptualisation and innovative modelling, to provide quantifications of the rates and causes of tree death, and their relation to environmental drivers, that set new standards for robustness, comprehensiveness and consistency at the global scale.

Both sedimentary and seawater OC are derived from living organisms, and should therefore be easily degraded. Their persistence is therefore profoundly puzzling. Quite simply we do not know how or why OC is preserved. A long-standing hypothesis suggests that protection of OC inside minerals might account for the vast OC stores preserved in sediments. In a NEW hypothesis, based on recent work by the PI and proposed here for the first time, the interaction of OC with minerals might ALSO account for the even larger stores of dissolved OC preserved in seawater.

SAYSO will address these shortcomings and pave the way for the development of innovative European cost-effective Multi-Stakeholders SA Systems (MSSAS) which will provide practitioners with user-friendly solutions, providing a clear picture of the situation at hand with relevant advices. Addressing both the technical and human aspects of technology implementation, SAYSO will define the specifications of future MSSAS on the basis of practitioners\u2019 requirements and specify the corresponding Reference Architecture to support the integration of various data into a common operational picture. This architecture will support interoperability and allow the integration of legacy and future SAS. It will also be customisable to practitioners\u2019 needs and safeguard adequate privacy protection and data security levels. SAYSO will pursue the agreement and sustainable involvement of a community of practitioners, relevant suppliers and potential procurers, institutions and policy makers to obtain widely accepted results and prepare future procurement actions at EU level.

Thanks to the background, unique facilities and tools available among the consortium participants, CCHFVaccine will deliver tools for countering the threat of this infection in Europe and endemic areas of the world. This work program will attempt to fill gaps in CCHFV virus research on immunology and vaccinology. To achieve this overall aim, an intensive work plan will be put in place with the following specific objectives: i) to produce vaccine candidates, ii) to bring several unique animal models into front line vaccine research, iii) to validate and bring the most promising vaccine candidates to clinical trials, iv) to ensure that an immune mediated protection is adequately understood, v) to perform clinical trials at Phase I and ensure a strategy for the effective deployment and utilization in resource-poor countries, and vi) to link this project to public health bodies, NGOs and vaccine companies. \nThe proposed CCHFVaccine project will succeed in bringing together selected competitive advantages such as: operating capacity with appropriate facilities (state-of-the-art BSL-4s) and the only animal BSL-4  -with capacity to challenge domestic animals in Europe, highly experienced researchers in the development and evaluation of vaccine candidates, authorities and entities of human and animal health, clinical samples from endemic countries, and an international network proven to be functional by the previous EU-funded CCHFever and EDENext.", 303336.0, 5229640.0, "CCHFVaccine", null, null, null, null, "http://www.dh.gov.uk", null, "h2020_207211_986454887"], ["9JT", "Mid- and far-IR optoelectronic devices based on Bose-Einstein condensation", "University of Leeds", "Optoelectronic devices typically operate in the weak coupling regime between light and matter, for example in conventional lasers relying on population inversion to achieve optical gain.

In semiconductors, exciton-polaritons have been the most widely studied type of strongly coupled system. Recently a new phenomenon has been realized exploiting intersubband transitions. The resulting excitations are called intersubband polaritons, and they have two remarkable properties: (i) a bosonic character that is maintained up to high carrier densities since they are not restricted by the Mott transition limit; (ii) large Rabi splittings. Although the scientific community has explored the basic science of intersubband polaritons, their potential for future and innovative optoelectronic devices has been entirely untapped.\nThe MIR-BOSE project will realize this potential, and demonstrate disruptive optoelectronic devices operating in the strong coupling regime between light and matter.

This proposal aims to introduce high conductive nanoparticles (NP) to improve the stability and thermo-physical properties of conventional PCMs for solar energy storage, termed as NPMSSES. Molten salts will be used as the matrix, and NPs (i.e., nickel, graphite platelet nanofibers and graphene) or expanded graphite (EG) will be introduced. It is a highly challenging yet exciting project that unites and advances the boundaries of three state-of-the-art disciplines: functional nanoparticles / nanocomposite, solar energy storage, and multiscale modelling. This work will address four main tasks: i) synthesis and characterization of NP-PCMs with good stability ii) identification thermo-physical properties of NP-PCMs under high temperature; iii) investigating their operational and heat transfer characteristics in a LTES system, including shell-tube and fluidized bed types, and iv) multiscale modeling thermo-physical properties of composite PCMs. My strong experience in experimentation with PCM and heat transfer and the vast knowledge on advanced nanomaterials synthesis and characterisation, and multiscale modelling of the host university will create the optimal environment to deliver the objectives of NPMSSES.

Due to the robust political commitment to technological progress in environmental policy and related path dependencies, modern societies and organisations are increasingly contingent on technological systematizations. The development and adoption of increasingly advanced technological products and processes are taken for granted, and policies persist largely unquestioned. For instance, in the context of agriculture, the development and implementation of new technology is considered to be central in the future of food production and particularly critical in support of sustainable modes of agricultural production.\n\nCurrent governmental incentives and management models are to encourage inertia rather than transitions towards sustainable agricultural production. Despite several ecological benefits of less intensive farming methods and the rising consumer demand on sustainable produce, market shares of non-conventionally produced food remain small. The often-higher, short-term productivity of intensive agriculture, as an outcome of greater use of external input factors, such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides, is too attractive to farmers struggling with profitability.\n\nThis study hypothesises that in addition to the lack of organisational resources of the farmers (including economic capital, knowledge, and awareness of the ecological challenges) and public policies, a more fundamental barrier to developing sustainable modes of production might prevail, namely technological optimism.

This hope awaits clinical confirmation, since the strategies that are currently under investigation to target Myc function or expression have yet to enter the clinic.
