Therefore, up-to-date regional air pollution information and means of emission control for the main pollutants are important for China. Especially, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River and the Pearl River deltas are known as three focal regions with serious air pollution where air quality policies are very important.\nWithin the FP6 project AMFIC atmospheric environmental monitoring over China was addressed by a team of both Chinese and European scientists. Within AMFIC it was concluded that modelling of air quality and therefore the forecast capabilities are hampered by the rapidly changing emissions due to economic growth. In addition, air quality measures could not directly be related to changes in emissions.\nTherefore, within the follow-up proposal - MarcoPolo - the focus will be on emission estimates from space and the refinement of these emission estimates by spatial downscaling and by source sector apportionment. Air pollutants cover both anthropogenic and biogenic sources. A wide range of satellite data will be used from various instruments. From these satellite data, emission estimates will be made for NOx, SO2, PM and biogenic sources. With various state-of-the-art techniques emission inventories will be created and intercompared. By combining these emission data with known information from the ground a new emission database for MarcoPolo will be constructed. Due to the strongly growing economy in China regular emission inventories are quickly outdated. Within MarcoPolo we will have a monthly update of the emissions based on the latest satellite observations. The improved emission inventory is input to regional air quality models on meso-scale and urban-scale.

We have high levels of SEN (33%), free school meals (78%) and EAL (87%). We are an increasingly popular school with a growing roll. Pakeman was named National Primary School of the Year in the 2013 Pupil Premium Awards for raising the attainment of disadvantaged pupils.  We have high expectations of all our pupils and are not complacent. We are constantly striving to improve what we do. Our children achieve well in relation to national expectations at L4+ at KS2. However, our school priority remains to increase the numbers of children attaining higher levels, especially disadvantaged pupils.  Many of our children have very low attainment levels on entry and we have a broad range of provision on offer to support those children who are working below age-related expectations.  However, we would like to match the quality of provision on offer for higher ability pupils to what is already offered to their less able peers. We are always keen to share best practice and to learn from the practice of others. To this end, to date, we have worked collaboratively with a large number of schools, both locally (we are part of a cluster of 17 primary and secondary Islington schools) and nationally.  However, we feel that we lack an international perspective, and this has been highlighted during recent visits to our school by a number of Norwegian schools.  We have helped these schools to organise their visits, to ensure they meet their objectives and stay within their budgets.  We are committed to sharing best practice with other schools, and do this already through providing courses, visits and consultancy.  Having a more European perspective would enable us to better offer this kind of support to other schools.   \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop a greater awareness of what international schools are doing and for participants to learn from these schools' best practice in order to raise the attainment of our more able pupils, especially those who are disadvantaged.\r\nThis project will allow us to send 20 teachers from across the school (including school leaders) to four European countries (Norway, Sweden, Portugal and Spain) to observe good practice with a view to implementing more effective strategies at Pakeman and to developing opportunities for the children in our classrooms to connect with children in the classrooms of other European countries.  We would offer the opportunity for the schools we visit to undertake return visits to us. 16 teachers will be split into 4 groups of 4, accompanied by one of our senior leaders (20 in all), with each group visiting one of the four countries.

Thus, a committee was created by 3 directors in order to standardize Work-Placement Training in EU.  \r\n-2014, the committee was formed with 9 people and worked on the proposal for KA102 (9 mobilities, 4 partners, 3 countries) and the Erasmus Charter for Higher Education Application. Both of these projects have been APPROVED by the competent authorities.\r\n-2015: the previous year formed committee continues working on new partner acquisition; planning and writing of KA102 project (12 mobilities, 6 partners and 5 countries); 2 new English-speaking countries; planning and writing of KA103 (10 mobilities).\r\n-2016: keeping the committee and working on KA102 and KA103 project, receiving students from Europe as a hosting partner, mobilities for teachers in order to be provided with training and teaching.\r\nWork-Placement Training, carried out in companies, is part of these Cycles.

Those obstacles are met when the information is not accessible in their first language: sign language. However the EUDY is an unique ENGO providing fully accessible trainings for deaf young people in Europe in this language.\r\n\r\nAfter a successful training course organised in 2013 on media for deaf youth participants, the EUDY decided to reiterate this training, this time with the NDFU and for a specific public: the deaf youth workers involved in the national deaf youth member organisations. \r\n\r\nThe main activity is a training of deaf youth workers responsible of media and external communication in their deaf youth organisations. The training takes place in the context of the increasing importance of media, of the democracy and freedom of speech debates and of the European citizenship and values that arise in the daily life of youth organisations. The scope of the training does not only address the learning of media technical skills but also the understanding of the European issues as well as the role the deaf youth workers can take through media and lobbying in their youth organisations. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to promote the inclusion of deaf youth workers who face greater obstacles in their access to information; to increase their capacities in using media tools and in participating at the European, national, regional and/or local levels; to support their professional development in the acquisition of competences with a view to improve the quality of youth work in the deaf youth organisations as well as to fight against discrimination and to promote the fulfilment of the human rights of each deaf young person in the EU and in the EU neighbouring countries. \r\n\r\nThe training will take place in the buildings and facilities of \u00c5l Folkeh\u00f8yskole og Kurssenter for d\u00f8ve located in \u00c5l, Norway for a period of twenty (20) days, excluding two travel days. Twenty-five (25) deaf youth workers aged between 18 and 30 years old will participate in this training on behalf of their youth organisation. They will be selected by their national youth organisations based on their experience as deaf youth workers responsible for media issues. \r\n\r\nThe training will allow the participants to improve their technical skills, but they will also gain a broader understanding of the media principles, the power of media, the differences between different forms of media, the right media production processes, and the role they can play in the media. They will acquire understanding in the history, the functioning of the European institutions as well as their instruments and European values. They should also be able to develop lobbying tools with the help of the media and be able to identify opportunities for their youth organisation. They will take into account their role in providing high quality alternative media in sign language to complement the accessibility gaps due to lack of sign language use in the mass media and to ensure that deaf young people become citizens in a multiplying effect. \r\n\r\nThe methodology used during the training is based on the non-formal education methods. The participants will be provided tools by experienced trainers in the field of media and in European actions. Transition between the trainers regarding methods will be ensured by the NDFU and the EUDY and they will coordinate to guarantee that there is non-formal education methodology and tools provided to participants. They will have the opportunity to discuss with other participants through debates, self-reflective workshops, and identification/development of strategies based on good practice examples they experienced as youth workers. Participants will also be asked to work on practical assignments to use the tools and get the chance to develop their skills. Finally, time will be provided to the participants to develop some movie products themselves and to experience the research, creativity and production processes on their own. \r\n\r\nThe expected impact on immediate participants and their youth organisations is that they gain professionalism in their external communication thanks to improved skills and competences in media and that they get more opportunities to promote European values and concepts at the local, regional and national levels. Thanks to the dissemination of videos produced by the participants, the expected impact on deaf youth in Europe is that they gain awareness about the European themes as well as awareness on the importance of media and external communication in any deaf youth organisation at the local, regional and national levels.

They will also get the opportunity to meet with a deaf Member of the European Parliament as well as to visit the staff of the European Youth Forum, both experiences allowing them to face real-life situations of youth workers and to develop skills in networking. \r\nAt the end of the seminar, participants are expected to gain knowledge on human rights instruments and develop an attitude of multiplier in the human rights education processes happening in the EU and neighbouring EU countries. Finally the participants should develop an understanding of their potentialities and of the opportunities for improved youth work in their country. They will be encouraged to adopt appropriate strategies and behaviours to fulfill their role as youth worker for less advantaged minorities, such as the deaf young people.

The fact of carrying out the mobility in an English speaking country fulfils the objective double of improving the skills in the specific field of their studies, administrative procedures, and at the same time to improve their English level, knowledge by means of this linguistic dip, which will contribute to the CV of the participant a great added value because of the importance of this language in the current labour market.The organization of the mobilities will be carried out by the centre, helped by several foreign partner contacted with this purpose, and with whom has already have been in contact by e-mail and Skype. The center will organize the diffusion of the project, so much before to the mobility to announce the project to students and the whole educational community, as once finished the mobilities, to announce the results and to incorporate these to the methodology of the centre.

In 2015, it was awarded by the Management System with the European Seal of Excellence 500+ points. In 2013, a new Strategy Plan was written whose main purpose was to modernize and internationalize VET.\r\nOur landmarks can be described as follows:  \r\n-2013: a committee was created by 3 directors to standardize Work-Placement Training in EU.\r\n-2014: a committee was formed with 9 people and worked on the proposal for KA102 (9 mobilities, 4 partners, 3 countries) and the Erasmus Charter for Higher Education Application.

We increased our partners; planned and wrote the KA102 project (12 mobilities, 6 partners and 5 countries) and KA103 (10 mobilities) with 2 new English-speaking countries.  These projects were APPROVED.\r\n-2016: the same committee continues working on the project. KA102 and KA103 projects were planned and written following the steps of the previous year.

These exchanges are aimed to give this target population the skills needed to run their own business as an alternative way to seek employment opportunities. But at the same time, the exchanged skills must empower them to transform their social awareness in a social company.The goal of empowering Young People by means of providing them with entrepreneurial skills to foster social enterprise initiatives gives an answer to the need of empowering young qualified people who might have been marginalized by the economic crisis and are being excluded from economic and social life due to their lack of job opportunities.Priority will be given to those young people with a university degree/tertiary education diploma, holding initiatives or ideas aimed to cover social needs related to education, employment and wellbeing, young population under risk and the protection of the environment.SEYE\u2019s objectives are :1.

To provide the participants with a multicultural experience aboard, so that they are able to know how social companies and initiatives operate in another country, which are the Youth policies and needs in some other MS, and which business ideas that are being evolved in other countries could be transferred to their own home countryEEXPECTED RESULTS1. The participants will gain competences (skills) related to entrepreneurship, which constitute a crucial part of the gap between their formal qualifications and the skills they need to initiate a business. Moreover, they will gain skills related to international relations, and soft skills such as interpersonal communicative skills and critical thinking. Also, they will improve verbal skills in a foreign language, and they will eventually have a better understanding of Youth policies across the EU. 2. The partners will gain skills to act in an international environment, being able to improve their management skills and to develop internationalization strategies in the near future. They will also gain knowledge on innovative strategies to recruit the most suitable candidates for programs oriented to improve the skills of young people and/or workers interested in social business initiatives3. The companies that will be hosting the participants will also gain international experience. They will have improved the international dimension of their business activity, and they will have had access to information aimed to design innovative solutions to Youth needs.IMPACT.SEYE expects to have a long-term impact in at least these dimensions:1. Exchanges of experience and information about the avenues through which young people can help to handle and give a solution to social needs, from the most traditional forms of volunteering to more innovative forms of social entrepreneurship.2. Through the activities developed, we expect to contribute to bridge the gap between formal competencies these young people already hold, and the soft competences needed to foster an initiative of social entrepreneurship.3. Young people involved in the exchange will be able to improve their language skills, and they will gain international experience.

Starting from this confrontation and sensitization activity, a need analysis has been carried out. It made it clear, then, that the tourist sector is one of the greatest factors of development: although it is historically and structurally relevant in the local and in the Italian context, it still needs to be strenghtened  by means of updated  and reinforced professional competences for the recent graduates and the staff of VET organisations. Carrying out traineeships and training abroad represents a way of acquiring such competences. To guarantee the compliance of the project with the needs observed and to contribute to make the competences acquired by the participants during the mobility experiences more spendable on the labour market, Essenia has been strenghtening its network of local partners, reinforcing also the collaboration with the bodies in charge of implementing the approaches and of adopting European methodologies and tools for the certification and validation of the formal and informal competences (ECVET).Besides the acquisition of professional competences related to the touristic sector, the project contributes to strenghten the  European identity and to enhance linguistic and intercultural competences, developing in the participants a set of personal and transversal skills  which are indispensable to be included in an increasingly globalized and constantly evolving  job market. Therefore, Essenia has planned to realize, during the linguistic and cultural preparation phase, linguistic training courses aimed at reinforcing the knowledge of the sectorial languages.

Our students come from a medium-low socioeconomic background, often disadvantaged, and almost completely devoid of the least incentive to get in contact with foreign countries or different cultures. This background is also marked by a very strong presence of immigrants. All of this has led us to look for complementary paths to traditional ways of teaching, paths that can give students a chance to grow, not only on a professional level, but also on a human level, allowing them to interact and engage with contexts very different from the usual ones and with multicultural and multiethnic realities.

Participants will be divided into six flows, three for the fifth year and three for the fourth year (the fifth year will go to Malta and to the UK, the fourth to Belgium and Spain). The mobility programmes will take place between December 2017 and June 2018. The participants' selection criteria are based not only on achievement at school, but also on motivation, personal attitudes, and the degree of reliability and the capacity of the students to adapt themselves to different contexts. After a period of preparation based on linguistic and cultural reinforcement held by our teachers at school, and after doing a course on risks in the workplace before leaving, the learners will carry out internships in high-profile companies selected by our foreign partners in the host countries. During the internship the students will deepen and broaden the knowledge, skills and competencies related to their areas of specialization. The students with special needs will participate in all activities but with a reduced workload in terms of schedules and with closer monitoring. For them, however, the objectives of the acquisition of social and behavioural skills, autonomy and self-esteem will be given greater importance. The methodology used for all will be that of \"Modelling\" and \"Fading\", with a gradual acquisition of autonomy in working activities. The learning outcomes are part of the EQF framework, level IV. The mobility programme will be considered as valid for completing the total hours of \u201cAlternanza scuola-lavoro\u201d (Work-linked training), related to the 2017-2018 school year, in accordance with Italian Law 107/2015.

We increased our partners;  wrote the KA102 project (12 mobilities, 6 partners and 5 countries) and KA103 (10 mobilities) with 2 new English-speaking countries.  These projects were APPROVED and 9 internships successfully managed.\r\n-2016: the same committee continues. Projects KA102 and KA103 were APPROVED and 12 internships successfully managed.\r\n-2017: the same committe continues working together. We are managing 22 granted mobilities. Projects KA102 and KA103 have been written.\r\nWork-Placement Training, carried out in companies, is part of these Cycles. Traineeships carried out in the EU must have the validity as in our country since Vocational Training is an instruction assessed by competences. Thus, no additional procedure shall be required.\r\nThe main purpose of our project is that 12 students in Intermediate Vocational Training have the opportunity to carry out their traineeships in different EU countries. In our fourth incursion, we have chosen well experienced partners in mobilities, located in 4 countries: Italy, Malta, the United Kingdom and Czech Republic.\r\nWe consider our students as priority in terms of participation in Erasmus+ in order to foster interculturality, cooperation, competences and to offer experience and integration into the labour market.\r\nThus, the school will draw up a shortlist of qualified candidates in order to ensure the quality of our students\u2019 training in work placements, in a transparent and fair way, taking into account equality, their academic merits and abilities.\r\nWith the participation of our students in Erasmus+, this proposal will aim to achieve the following results:\r\n\u2022 Improving the quality and attractiveness of Vocational Education and Training.\r\n\u2022 Increasing our students\u2019 job opportunities in the international labour market.\r\n\u2022 Promoting the sense of initiative and the entrepreneurial spirit.\r\n\u2022 Strengthening linguistic, technological and cultural skills.\r\n\u2022 Increasing EU knowledge and values.\r\n\u2022 Raising enterprise\u2019s awareness and the importance of lifelong learning.\r\nRegarding the practical and logistical preparation, we can conclude with the following comments:\r\n1.

With those theatres, actors and actresses had a lot of opportunities to meet each other and to travel to international festivals (for either deaf and hearing people). But those theatres were existing only because of subsidies and grants and one by one those subsidies have been cut off, until there are only a handfull of theaters left. In a personal view, Teater Manu in Norway is the strongest theater company, receiving hundreds of thoundands euros of subsidies for their theater production and employing at least ten staff members. Other theaters in Sweden, Finland and France are somewhat moderate. But all of them have one similar issue: there are very few actors and actresses who are young. According to the theaters it is because those young people are not interested in theater anymore, but according to those young people, it is because young people do not receive the opportunities to train to become an experienced actor. \r\n\r\nTheatre as a form of art do bring people closer: shy people develop social skills to engage themselves with other people, people with a strong personality develop an understanding for other people and develop skills to be a leader and a role model. Theatre develops skills, but it is also a platform to show culture and language. As Deaf theatre does have different aspect than mainstream theatre, it is the perfect place to play with sign language and to show what Deaf culture is made of. With the closing of different theatres, there have been fewer and fewer places to experiment with different forms of sign language and having a place to expose Deaf culture.\r\n\r\nThat is why those of the few Deaf young actors would like to ignite the spark across Europe to bring theater closer to Deaf young people, giving them something to think about and giving them a chance to discover hidden talents. And at the same time a network will be developed, so there could be international links to (future) theater companies, as talents could be borrowed from each other. Giving Deaf young people the opportunity to learn about theater and building a stronger network will most likely to contribute to a broader audience, as it is likely that theater made by Deaf young people will also attract Deaf young people to watch. \r\n\r\nSo this project will have two activities (alongside with an APV), the first one will be a training in theatre arts in its various forms, in Norway. Established actors will come to facilitate those trainings in: Visual Vernacular, poetry, story telling, and body language. Everybody will get a taste of each form and when the end is approaching, they will engage themselves in a challenge to set up a short performance of maximum 10 minutes. As there will be four smaller groups, there will be four performances. They will receive feedback from Teater Manu, the Deaf theatre company in Norway. \r\n\r\nThe second activity will be in Paris, where they will develop their skills further and start preparing on the final draft of the performance. This is also the time the participants will think about what will happen after this project: will they be enterpreneurs in theatre and will they be able to set up a network of Deaf (young) actors? At the same time they rehearse, they will receive tools to give and receive feedback. \r\n\r\nThe biggest expected impact for those participants, is that they finally get the chance to develop theatre skills, which established or non-existent Deaf theatres have been neglecting to do so. With those skills they will build a network of Deaf young actors to support and empower each other and to start a dialogue with older actors.

The six-month internships have been planned in those national contexts (Spain and United Kingdom) where have already been carried experiences that in many cases have resulted in the occupation of the recent-graduates.\r\nAFOL COMO will adopt by the end of July 2017, the ANNUAL PLAN of mobility, already defined in general terms, which will detail the different operating phases of the European and International actions, in an integrated way to the school calendar.\r\nThe calendars of internships and destinations for students have already been defined in a meeting of tutors.\r\nThe annual plan provides, for each target, the time schedule, according to the following steps:\r\n- ANNOUNCEMENT AND INFORMATION\r\n-SELECTION\r\n- PREPARATION OF THE PARTICIPANTS\r\n- REALIZATION OF MOBILITY '\r\n- MONITORING AND EVALUATION \u2013 FOLLOW UP\r\nPlanned actions:\r\n- N \u00b0 50 \u00b0 mobility for students in 5 destinations.

In the 5th raid we have selected partners with long experience in mobilities, in 3 countries: Italy, Malta and United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nWe consider participation in the student mobility program as a priority for internships in companies-Erasmus + to promote interculturality, cooperation, skills, and insertion of our students in the labor market.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the quality of the students' interships, the institution will make a selection of them through a fair, transparent and inclusive process following the principles of equality, merit and ability.\r\n\r\nWith the participation of our students in the Erasmus + program, we intend to achieve the following results:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Improve the quality and attractiveness of VET.\r\n\u2022 Improve the employment possibilities of students in the international market.\r\n\u2022 Enhance the sense of initiative and the entrepreneurial spirit.\r\n\u2022 Improve the linguistic, technological and cultural skills of the participants\r\n\u2022 Improve the knowledge of the European project and the values of the EU.\r\n\u2022 Increase the awareness of European companies on the importance of lifelong learning.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the preparation of practical and logistical issues, project management and preparation of the participants, we can conclude with the following:\r\n\r\n1. Previously to the start of the mobility:\r\n\u2022 We will sign a collaboration agreement with the internship companies (host partner).\r\n\u2022 Both entities will plan an individualized training program that details the skills and abilities that students should acquire during the internships.\r\n\u2022 We will carry out an insurance for each of the participants.\r\n\u2022 We will be responsible for managing air transport.\r\n\u2022 The intermediary partners will manage the accommodation and the welcome process at the airport.\r\n\r\n2.

The proposal is part of the already launched and consolidated process of internationalization that sees the Institutes involved in many projects in cooperation with other schools or public and private organizations, aimed at fostering the European dimension of formal and non-formal learning for an employment policy addressed to the international context.\r\nThe project originates from an analysis of the training needs expressed by the Veneto manufacturing sector in relation to the introduction and progressive affirmation within the production processes and to the organization of work of changes related to Smart Manfacturing.\r\nTo fully exploit the potentials related to the enhancement of the local territory, the Consortium members need to support a new development cycle based on the principles of competitiveness, technological innovation and quality that can only be successful with adoption of a strategy focused on an international vision of the didactic-training actions.\r\nThe project therefore intends to offer an answer to the increasingly urgent challenges that affect the regional territory:\r\n- increasing the technical and professional skills of the new professional profiles required in the Smart Specialization sectors\r\n- contributing to the employability of young people by offering training experiences to develop communication skills in foreign languages and interpersonal skills in multicultural contexts.\r\nThe above is consistent with the Research and Innovation Strategy for the Smart Specialization of the Veneto Region which promotes the development of human resources and their international mobility also through the establishment of skills ecosystems.\r\nIn this perspective, the project aims to provide 131 students with the opportunity to undertake a 4-week period of training mobility abroad recognized as ASL (in line with the provisions of Law 107/15). Technical-technological (Mechanics / Mechatronics, Electronics, Informatics, Logistics) and economic (AFM, RIM and SIA) study curricula are involved and targets industrial profiles and related support services. The destinations in the UK, IE, FR, DE, ES and FI are confirmed and a new country and partner has been introduced in Poland, extending the opening to the East already started in 2016.\r\nThe mobility flows will be preceded by an intense phase of pedagogical and linguistic preparation. The language communication skills will be exercised both in curricular programs and through awareness-raising of the participants towards commitment and self-learning (through the use of the OLS), but alsowith strengthening activities within the educational offer.\r\nThe scouting activity will be carried out in collaboration with foreign partners in the different countries through the involvement of companies operating mainly in Smart Specialization fields belonging to the Consortium's already consolidated network and new companies intercepted also through the CCIAA network abroad. The Consortium will provide students with constant support during their stay. The high percentage of underage beneficiaries requires the involvement of carefully selected accompanying persons who will play a key role in facilitating the socio-cultural integration in the host country and supervision and monitoring of activities.\r\nThe project also envisages 7 mobilities in the UK addressed to the staff of the Consortium Institutes in order to offer not only a linguistic update, but also innovative didactic approaches tailored to the identified needs. The primary need is to have access to continuous training in the areas of new learning environments, networking, development of new teaching techniques and CLIL.\r\nAs outlined in the European Development Plans and in line with the 2016-2019 PTOF, the Consortium members intend to renew and reinforce their training offer in the direction of a European perspective, continuing to promote and implement international activities. The Erasmus + 2017-1-IT01-KA116-006044 project for 125 students and 6 teachers is currently being implemented.

The training offer of AFOL COMO has assumed an international characterization not only through the Erasmus + program but also through other international initiatives, diversified in the purposes and sources of funding, but all aimed at implementing the international dimension of both training activities and employment services.\r\nIn relation to the Erasmus + program, The Strategy adopted by AFOL COMO provides for the creation of mobility for three target categories within the organization: \r\n- N \u00b0 50 \u00b0 mobility for students in 5 destinations. Such mobility include the presence of accompanying persons as they involve minor students. According to the organizational model adopted, in each destination will alternate two teachers, one accompanying the first half, the second for the second half of the stage.\r\n- No. 5 mobility for recent graduates of six-month\r\n- No. 5 mobility for teachers, lasting three days\r\nThe general objectives are as follows:\r\n1. Implement and bring into force the European characterization of the training offer of AFOL COMO, with a view to guaranteeing a quality training offer, oriented to the employability of young people;\r\n2. Consolidate the European relations activated \r\n3. Introduce elements of innovation of the training processes and the development of the skills of the FP\r\nteachers\r\nThese general objectives are pursued through the following actions:\r\n- Adoption of interventions on educational planning aimed at characterizing the Center's educational offer in an internationally way\r\n- consolidation of the organizational model described in the Internationalization Strategy for the management of mobility activities\r\n- Implementation of the Mobility Quality Management Model with operational procedures and management and evaluation tools\r\n- Consolidation and implementation of relations, both in the international partnership and in the local network of contacts with companies and institutions\r\n- Interventions of didactic innovation, with particular regard to the dual system, to be realized through the comparison with the European reference models for the training in alternation (Germany and France in the first place)\r\nThe international partnership is largely confirmed, as the partner institutions involved have so far actively collaborated on the organization of mobility and the different national contexts have proved to be interesting from the professional and cultural point of view. Two French partners are added: the Center de Formation Professional de Saint Michel Mont Mercure and Les Compagnons du Devoir in Paris. With both these partners, AFOL COMO has already started a collaboration with excellent results within the \"European Apprenticeship Ambassadors\" initiative, a pilot project funded directly by the European Parliament which aims to promote the mobility of young people. Thanks to this project, in fact, AFOL COMO was able to enter 6 new graduates in French companies, hired with an apprenticeship contract. In fact, mobility activities are strongly oriented towards job placement. In this logic, the six-month internships have also been planned in those national contexts (Spain and the United Kingdom) where experiences have already been carried out that in many cases have ended with the occupation of the recipients. Due to the consolidated experience in the two territories and the continuity of relations with the host partners, no preparatory visits are planned.\r\nThe destinations of the five mobility courses for trainers have been defined on the basis of methodological innovation objectives, linked to the introduction of alternance training for apprentices in AFOL, and have therefore been assigned to France and Germany, two countries that have a consolidated tradition in training of the apprentices.\r\nThe duration of the teachers mobility has been reduced by one day compared to the current project, to allow a simpler integration of the mobility with the teaching activities of the teachers.\r\nAFOL COMO will adopt, within the month of July, the ANNUAL PLAN of the mobility, already defined in the general lines, which will detail the different operational phases of the European and international actions, in an integrated and synergistic way to the school calendar.\r\nThe annual plan includes, for each target, the detailed time schedule, according to the following steps:\r\n- NOTICE AND INFORMATION\r\n-SELECTION\r\n- PREPARATION OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n- MOBILITY REALIZATION\r\n- MONITORING", "http://www.sagittertraining.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA116-006514_3"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["8QJ", "Inspiring Enterprise and Growth", "London Training and Employment Network", "The project equips potential entrepreneurs and fledgling SME and social enterprises in London with skills and competences to become more enterprising, start up new businesses and to ensure their sustainability.
