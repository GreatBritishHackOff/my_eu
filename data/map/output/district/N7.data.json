Therefore, up-to-date regional air pollution information and means of emission control for the main pollutants are important for China. Especially, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River and the Pearl River deltas are known as three focal regions with serious air pollution where air quality policies are very important.\nWithin the FP6 project AMFIC atmospheric environmental monitoring over China was addressed by a team of both Chinese and European scientists. Within AMFIC it was concluded that modelling of air quality and therefore the forecast capabilities are hampered by the rapidly changing emissions due to economic growth. In addition, air quality measures could not directly be related to changes in emissions.\nTherefore, within the follow-up proposal - MarcoPolo - the focus will be on emission estimates from space and the refinement of these emission estimates by spatial downscaling and by source sector apportionment. Air pollutants cover both anthropogenic and biogenic sources. A wide range of satellite data will be used from various instruments. From these satellite data, emission estimates will be made for NOx, SO2, PM and biogenic sources. With various state-of-the-art techniques emission inventories will be created and intercompared. By combining these emission data with known information from the ground a new emission database for MarcoPolo will be constructed. Due to the strongly growing economy in China regular emission inventories are quickly outdated. Within MarcoPolo we will have a monthly update of the emissions based on the latest satellite observations. The improved emission inventory is input to regional air quality models on meso-scale and urban-scale.

Our students come from a medium-low socioeconomic background, often disadvantaged, and almost completely devoid of the least incentive to get in contact with foreign countries or different cultures. This background is also marked by a very strong presence of immigrants. All of this has led us to look for complementary paths to traditional ways of teaching, paths that can give students a chance to grow, not only on a professional level, but also on a human level, allowing them to interact and engage with contexts very different from the usual ones and with multicultural and multiethnic realities. Participants in the mobility programme will come from the fourth and fifth years and will be selected from the four departments of our school (food and wine, dining room and sales, bakery and patisserie, tourism and hospitality). 42 students will take part in this mobility programme, 21 from the fifth year and 21 from the fourth year. 38 of these students will stay abroad for four weeks of training, and will be accompanied throughout their stay by an Italian tutor, chosen from the teachers of our institute. There will also be a company tutor and a representative of the partner organizations in the host country. Among the 42 learners there will be 4 students with special needs, with moderate cognitive disabilities, supported by a specific tutor throughout their internships that will last two weeks. Host countries are: Belgium, Spain, the UK and Malta. Participants will be divided into six flows, three for the fifth year and three for the fourth year (the fifth year will go to Malta and to the UK, the fourth to Belgium and Spain). The mobility programmes will take place between December 2017 and June 2018. The participants' selection criteria are based not only on achievement at school, but also on motivation, personal attitudes, and the degree of reliability and the capacity of the students to adapt themselves to different contexts. After a period of preparation based on linguistic and cultural reinforcement held by our teachers at school, and after doing a course on risks in the workplace before leaving, the learners will carry out internships in high-profile companies selected by our foreign partners in the host countries. During the internship the students will deepen and broaden the knowledge, skills and competencies related to their areas of specialization. The students with special needs will participate in all activities but with a reduced workload in terms of schedules and with closer monitoring. For them, however, the objectives of the acquisition of social and behavioural skills, autonomy and self-esteem will be given greater importance. The methodology used for all will be that of \"Modelling\" and \"Fading\", with a gradual acquisition of autonomy in working activities. The learning outcomes are part of the EQF framework, level IV. The mobility programme will be considered as valid for completing the total hours of \u201cAlternanza scuola-lavoro\u201d (Work-linked training), related to the 2017-2018 school year, in accordance with Italian Law 107/2015.

With those theatres, actors and actresses had a lot of opportunities to meet each other and to travel to international festivals (for either deaf and hearing people). But those theatres were existing only because of subsidies and grants and one by one those subsidies have been cut off, until there are only a handfull of theaters left. In a personal view, Teater Manu in Norway is the strongest theater company, receiving hundreds of thoundands euros of subsidies for their theater production and employing at least ten staff members. Other theaters in Sweden, Finland and France are somewhat moderate. But all of them have one similar issue: there are very few actors and actresses who are young. According to the theaters it is because those young people are not interested in theater anymore, but according to those young people, it is because young people do not receive the opportunities to train to become an experienced actor. \r\n\r\nTheatre as a form of art do bring people closer: shy people develop social skills to engage themselves with other people, people with a strong personality develop an understanding for other people and develop skills to be a leader and a role model. Theatre develops skills, but it is also a platform to show culture and language. As Deaf theatre does have different aspect than mainstream theatre, it is the perfect place to play with sign language and to show what Deaf culture is made of. With the closing of different theatres, there have been fewer and fewer places to experiment with different forms of sign language and having a place to expose Deaf culture.\r\n\r\nThat is why those of the few Deaf young actors would like to ignite the spark across Europe to bring theater closer to Deaf young people, giving them something to think about and giving them a chance to discover hidden talents. And at the same time a network will be developed, so there could be international links to (future) theater companies, as talents could be borrowed from each other. Giving Deaf young people the opportunity to learn about theater and building a stronger network will most likely to contribute to a broader audience, as it is likely that theater made by Deaf young people will also attract Deaf young people to watch. \r\n\r\nSo this project will have two activities (alongside with an APV), the first one will be a training in theatre arts in its various forms, in Norway. Established actors will come to facilitate those trainings in: Visual Vernacular, poetry, story telling, and body language. Everybody will get a taste of each form and when the end is approaching, they will engage themselves in a challenge to set up a short performance of maximum 10 minutes. As there will be four smaller groups, there will be four performances. They will receive feedback from Teater Manu, the Deaf theatre company in Norway. \r\n\r\nThe second activity will be in Paris, where they will develop their skills further and start preparing on the final draft of the performance. This is also the time the participants will think about what will happen after this project: will they be enterpreneurs in theatre and will they be able to set up a network of Deaf (young) actors? At the same time they rehearse, they will receive tools to give and receive feedback. \r\n\r\nThe biggest expected impact for those participants, is that they finally get the chance to develop theatre skills, which established or non-existent Deaf theatres have been neglecting to do so. With those skills they will build a network of Deaf young actors to support and empower each other and to start a dialogue with older actors. Deaf young actors want to be involved and they should get the chance.

They commit themselves to their organisation and are seeking to improve themselves when it is about Deaf young children. \r\n\r\nSo from 8 to 10 June 2017 SAKMN and EUDY will train youth workers in various topics such as team work, raising awareness about children with a migration background (as this will be the theme for the youth exchange), first aid services, inclusion and many more. The participants will contribute to a leader's handbook, with tools and tips to be the best group leader as possible. This will be very useful for the upcoming youth exchange, but also on national and local level for Deaf youth organisations, who can use the handbook to implement this in exchanges. \r\n\r\nThe program contains different lectures and activities within the non-formal education principles, meaning those lectures will be minimalised and the activities maximalised. Participants will analyse, play roles, study cases, etc. \r\n\r\nThe training will be held in Prasnik, Slovakia. Every participating organisation will send two youth workers and the total amount of participants, including the trainers and facilitators is foreseen at 49.", "http://www.bda.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SK02-KA105-001292_12"], ["6PA", "European Deaf Youth Capital 2017: Kulturutbyte Genom Teckenspr\u00e5k", "British Deaf Association", 23370.0, "We in Stockholm Deaf Youth Council (SDUR) have been honored to organize European Deaf Youth Culture 2017 here in Stockholm, at the same time we celebrate our 80th anniversary and DUKiS, a youth recreational center has its 25th anniversary.
