Therefore, up-to-date regional air pollution information and means of emission control for the main pollutants are important for China. Especially, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River and the Pearl River deltas are known as three focal regions with serious air pollution where air quality policies are very important.\nWithin the FP6 project AMFIC atmospheric environmental monitoring over China was addressed by a team of both Chinese and European scientists. Within AMFIC it was concluded that modelling of air quality and therefore the forecast capabilities are hampered by the rapidly changing emissions due to economic growth. In addition, air quality measures could not directly be related to changes in emissions.\nTherefore, within the follow-up proposal - MarcoPolo - the focus will be on emission estimates from space and the refinement of these emission estimates by spatial downscaling and by source sector apportionment. Air pollutants cover both anthropogenic and biogenic sources. A wide range of satellite data will be used from various instruments. From these satellite data, emission estimates will be made for NOx, SO2, PM and biogenic sources. With various state-of-the-art techniques emission inventories will be created and intercompared. By combining these emission data with known information from the ground a new emission database for MarcoPolo will be constructed. Due to the strongly growing economy in China regular emission inventories are quickly outdated. Within MarcoPolo we will have a monthly update of the emissions based on the latest satellite observations. The improved emission inventory is input to regional air quality models on meso-scale and urban-scale.

Sphere members also reported that notions of place and conceptions of gender are closely related to changing or enduring political and cultural alignments, while 'race' or ethnicity are heavily tied to with culture shifts and identity formation.\n\nIn seeking to determine the cultural and identity-related impact of regeneration policies in de-industrialised regions, Sphere findings stand to provide valuable insight to policymakers across Europe. This is also important when considering whether new identities have emerged and if new notions of being and belonging are being articulated through an emerging sense of 'Europeanness'.", "http://www.sphereeurope.eu/", "http://www.londonmet.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2011-07/45377.jpg", "fp7_87593_999601394"], ["8DB", "Combating social exclusion among young homeless populations: a comparative investigation of homeless paths and reinsertion programmes for young men and women of different ethnic and migrant statuses", "London Metropolitan University", "This research project meets the EU guidelines for youth policy and the Lisbon strategy by focusing on socially excluded youth \u2013 homeless young people and those at risk of homelessness - and through promoting a dynamic understanding of their life-trajectories. It takes into account gender, ethnic minority and migrant status and its policy outcomes and programme recommendations will also apply to those with low education qualifications, and poor employment and social integration prospects. It involves the active participation of young people as co-researchers.  Levels of youth homelessness vary between European countries in relation to the patterns of support available to young people and within countries in relation to gender, ethnic minority group and migrant status. However, even Mediterranean societies, with strong family support systems, have begun to experience youth homelessness amongst local as well as migrant populations.  In Northern Europe interventionist programmes have been developed designed to:  a) structure case work with hostel dwellers (the Netherlands 8-Steps Programme); b) prevent youth homelessness among those at risk through a cluster of local services (the  UK Safe Moves programme).  Working with NGOs, CSEYHP will:   (1) Study the life trajectories of homeless youth populations in different national contexts, identifying risk, processes of social exclusion and points of reinsertion;  (2) Introduce and investigate the use of the 8-Steps and Safe Moves programmes with NGOs working with homeless youth in NL, UK, P and CZ; (3) Investigate the roles of trusted adults, lead professionals, peer mentors and family members in delivering reinsertion strategies; and  (4) Develop the concepts of risk, social exclusion and shelter exclusion both theoretically and practically.  Expected impacts include change in the working practice of NGOs, empowerment for young people and national and EU recognition of the issue of youth homelessness.", 214959.0, 867131.0, "CSEYHP", null, null, null, "http://www.movisie.com/cyh", "http://www.londonmet.ac.uk", null, "fp7_88909_999601394"], ["9DP", "Innovative Low-Mass Tanks for a Low-Cost European Micro-Launch Vehicle", "Orbital Express Launch Limited", "Small satellites (smallsats) are playing an increasingly significant role in space. Smallsats currently fly to space via ride-sharing \u2013 taking spare capacity on a large launcher. Rideshare has numerous issues, including lack of availability, severe launch delays, and unsuitable orbits.\n\nOrbEx is developing an EU-based orbital micro-launch vehicle with a uniquely innovative advantage that eliminates the issues of rideshare and mitigates the cost of a dedicated launch for smallsat operators. The vehicle exploits the properties of dual-cryogenic propellants to create an innovative, lightweight, low-cost tanking arrangement that reduces the inert mass of the launch vehicle by as much at 30% over traditional designs. \n\nThe small satellite launch market is well established and growing rapidly. The market for smallsat launch services is projected to grow from US$0.89B to US$2.52B by 2022, a CAGR 23.2%. \n\nThe benefits of developing this tanking system for a European micro-launch vehicle include:-\n\n\u2022 Lowering cost of space access, including logistics/integration\n\u2022 Reduced delay in time-to-market\n\u2022 Enabling faster revenue generation for smallsat business models\n\u2022 Shortening launch procurement & integration lead time \n\nOrbEx staff have designed & realized a prototype tank, and subsequently drafted a patent for the technology.

With Europe\u2019s ageing population the demand for assistive hearing devices is likely to rapidly increase. While the technology has dramatically advanced in the last 25 years since the commercialization of the first digital hearing aid, the new functions are often unexploited or inaccessible, particularly for children and older adults. Producers of hearing aid devices find that individuals prefer to use simpler less flexible devices even though functionality offered by miniaturised digital devices can considerably improve hearing in different acoustic environments (e.g. classroom, office, restaurant, street) leading to greater confidence, improved social interaction and more significantly inclusion back into society. 3D Tune-In aims to exploit existing, overlooked or neglected hearing aid functionalities to greatly improve people\u2019s quality of life and their interactions with other people and their surrounding environment.
