Although up to 80% of premature deaths are preventable through early prognosis and treatment the associated costs are significant with global estimates of \u20ac41tn in the next 25 years. There is an increasing focus on making care more patient-centric which could save \u20ac99bn in healthcare costs in the EU annually. \n\nCurrently the only medically acceptable method of monitoring a CVD condition includes a trip to the hospital, a complete 12 lead \u2018wet\u2019 electrocardiogram (ECG) and a follow-up with a doctor.  This process is time-consuming, costly to hospitals and provides only a snapshot of a patient\u2019s heart health. \n\nAt Smartlife, we have developed wellwatch; a wearable technology garment with our patented textile sensors built in and our unique contactless electronics hub that transmits signals to a mobile application for remote monitoring by patient and clinician. Our technology can be truly disruptive \u2013 assisting in the diagnosis of early onset or predictive heart conditions. \n\nTo gain first mover advantage in the challenging medical market we must secure our supply chain, fully develop the care pathway and present an attractive value proposition to licensees and suppliers. We expect our initial route to market will be through private healthcare, as historically they have a faster uptake of novel solutions.  The primary aim of our overall innovation project is to develop a clinically and economically validated wellwatch platform for self-monitoring of CVD. The objective of this feasibility study is to develop our business model for successful commercialisation of wellwatch.\n\nThe market size of smart textiles in medical applications is forecast to be worth \u20ac0.9bn by 2021; our growth projections for wellwatch are to achieve  a 5-year ROI of 250% for Smartlife following market entry in 2019, based on our estimated project costs this equates to an ROI of 770% to the EC.", 42733.0, 61048.0, "wellwatch", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_207089_954734238"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["4RR", "Kamnik Students Beyond Borders 2017", "Tiny Signers", 59632.0, "Rudolf Maister Grammar  and Secondary School Kamnik is joining Erasmus+ programme with the mobility project for students and teachers titled Kamnik students Beyond Borders 2017. With the help of our partner organisations from Portugal, Great Britain and Austria we are preparing 5 different fourteen-day-mobilities for students. The students will be accompanied by two mentors, except in Austria, where the mentor will be present at the beginning and at the end of the mobility.\r\nThe main theme of the mobility is the field of professional training in economy and pre-school education. The learning outcomes have been prepared in accordance with ECVET system.\r\nBy developing the pre-school education field we are even supporting one of the key goals of Erasmus+ programme. Skills, connected with such specific field such as sign language, are hard to obtain in our environment. Therefore our partner organisations have prepared the programme made for our students. We have included an intermediary organisation in the project, which we prepare the practical training for students of economics with. \r\nBefore leaving for the mobility, the students will take part in the preparations, especially language, cultural, psychological and logistics preparations. The students in Portugal will have practical training at a similar school, carrying out the economics programme.\r\nFor the first time we are preparing five-day-the observations for teachers of different subjects in Great Britain, Latvia and Romania. Their receiving organisations are experienced European project applicants.\r\nThe school will provide for the whole documentation, Europass, organisation of the journey and insurance. The main goal of the mobility is professional growth of the students and specialising in the above mentioned fields, which will enable them better employability. We are following the Erasmus+ programme goal of reducing the decrease in enrolment of the students with the interesting programme and student inclusion into extracurricular activities. Many of the students prove themselves at our out-of-school activities and through developing different talents they gain their self-esteem and their self image improves as well as the feeling of belonging, all of which decrease the possibility of dropping out of school.\r\nWe believe that by choosing good candidates, preparing a good programme and with a good dissemination of the project we will spread the results on a regional, national and European level. The main goal for teacher mobility is to enable the teachers\u2019 personal and professional growth, which has not been done here before.

We are a school with tradition and achievements, as well as ambitions. We want to provide our students with contemporary knowledge, develop their critical and logical thinking and we aim towards democratic relations based on mutual respect and responsibility.\r\nThere is more than 60-year tradition of preschool education program at our school and we have devoted our attention to the quality of education of the future preschool education professionals. With innovative approaches and variety of teaching methods, we want our students to develop into professional, open, mature and responsible persons willing to follow current changes in the field of preschool education and also looking forward to continuing their professional development.\r\nWith this international mobility we would like to enable 64 2nd and 3rd year students to acquire intercultural experiences, enrich their professional experiences and competences, while also developing their self-esteem, autonomy and personal maturity.\r\nThe substantial part and the basis of the project will relate to sign communication with children and familiarization with European preschool education systems and traditional games of European countries.   \r\nReasonableness for sign communication with children in preschool period is to develop students\u2019 skills for encouraging early communication and pre-literacy in children. We want for our future preschool assistant teacher to acquire the necessary skills to provide a suitable environment in kindergarten, promote early learning and provide the necessary differentiation and individualization of children. Sign communication has also emerged as a meaningful implementation in to kindergartens which are highly intercultural. \r\nPlay, on the other hand, is the primary and predominant activity of a preschool child. It is culturally determined but it is also universal. With improving the knowledge of European preschool education systems and with integration of traditional games in these systems, the students will be able to identify professional and theoretical differences in views on the system of preschool education in different cultures and thereby gain the width of an international perspective on their field of expertise. This will allow them the insight into the Slovenian preschool education system and will also give them the possibility of introducing qualitative changes in their work.\r\nSign communication and play will be used as a bridge between foreign languages, between different cultures in this project, thereby expanding the importance of sign communication in a multilingual environment and play as the basic and the main activity of preschool children.\r\nWith this project we aim to:\r\n\u2022 Broaden and enrich the expertise of students (in the field of work planning, monitoring the child's development, comparing different technical approaches to preschool education).\r\n\u2022 To expand students' knowledge in the field of organizational systems of preschool education in Europe and thereby acquired the width of an international perspective on their area of expertise.\r\n\u2022 Develop critical thinking \u2013 with analyzing and comparing different systems of preschool education, both through theoretical frameworks and through individual experiences.\r\n\u2022 To develop interpersonal and intercultural skills with getting to know and function in a culturally different environment, with the involvement of sign communication as touchpoint.\r\n\u2022 To develop personal maturity of the individual student, his responsibility, autonomy, flexibility and ability to work in a team.\r\n\r\nThe desired effect of the project is to promote a broad linguistic diversity and intercultural awareness and raise awareness of the importance of sign communication with children and the cultural diversity of preschool education systems in Europe and their traditional games.
