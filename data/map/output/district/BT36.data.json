The consortium for this project is made up of partners from Ireland (T.E Laboratories and Dublin City University),UK (University of Southampton, Williams Industrial Services), Turkey (Kalite Sistem) and Italy (R.T. Environment).\n\nThe AQUAWARN device will be used for monitoring importantwater quality parameters in wastewater and environmental waters. Under environmental legislation such as the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) and related Directives on Dangerous Substances (76/464/EEC), Groundwater (80/68/EEC), Drinking Water (80/778/EEC) and Urban Wastewater Treatment (91/271/EEC); there is an increasing requirement to monitor the quality of wastewater and water bodies.\n\nThe AQUAWARN device will be low-cost, transportable and deployable; it will provide high quality data and field-worthy equipment. The environmental monitoring system will be linked to a process control device and auto-sampler. In addition, data and/or an alarm will be sent to a mobile phone/laptop. The device will allow environmental agencies, industrial bodies etc. to monitor and respond efficiently to spatial and temporal changes in water quality.\n\nAquawarn will run for 2 years for a budget of \u20ac1.1M. The consortium involved in the AQUAWARN project will achieve its objectives and exploit the results. The RTDs have strong research expertise and the SMEs have a clear commercial interest in this topic. The global market for environmental sensing and monitoring technologies was worth $13 billion of economic activity at present with a projected average annual growth of 5.4% through to 2016 (BCC Research, 2011). All four SMEs involved in the project recognise the potential benefit of owning the IP of the AQUAWARN prototype and are in the position to benefit from and exploit the prototype IP commercially.", 175165.0, 1000183.0, "AQUAWARN", null, null, null, "http://www.aquawarn.com/", "http://www.wis-ni.com", null, "fp7_110697_972232359"], ["4PY", "NAPES - Next Generation Analytical Platforms for Environmental Sensing", "Williams Industrial Services Limited", "GOALS:\nThe current state-of-the-art for autonomous environmental instruments monitoring the chemical and biological status of our water is based on flow systems that employ conventional approaches to sample/liquid handling, which makes them prohibitively expensive (often >\u20ac20K per unit) in terms of up-scaling deployments. This project will investigate ways to deliver revolutionary advances in liquid/sample handling combined with new approaches to performing sensitive in-situ analytical measurements.  Our goal is to drive down the unit cost of these instruments by orders of magnitude to levels that can create a tipping point, at which the technology becomes ubiquitous.\n\nOUTCOMES:\n\u2022\tNovel technologies that will contribute significantly to the realization of next generation autonomous analytical instruments for distributed environmental monitoring.\n\u2022\tNew services based on the information generated by these instruments in real deployment scenarios.\n\u2022\tPhotoactuated polymer valve structures fully integrated within microfluidic channels\n\u2022\tHighly sensitive detector integrated with microfluidics sample preparation\n\u2022\tPhotocontrolled functions such as filtering, preconcentration, uptake and release, surface activation/passivation\n\nPrototype components will be integrated with existing autonomous sensing devices, and after lab based trials deployed at wastewater treatment plants and in the general environment. This strategy will enable risk to be managed by testing the novel biomimetic fluid handling components with existing detectors (e.g. colorimetric methods for nutrients). In a similar manner, a novel E coli sensor will be assessed using validated fluid handling technologies in the existing devices.  This strategy will allow the biomimetic fluid handling and advanced detector elements of the research programme to advance independently, or collaboratively, depending on progress.", null, 3592335.0, "NAPES", null, null, null, null, "http://www.wis-ni.com", null, "fp7_111018_972232359"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["4PE", "Moving Forward \u2013 Moving On", "EXTERN GROUP", null, "ESF", 810527.0, 1246964.0, "esf_ni_33"], ["4PE", "Externworks", "EXTERN N.I.", null, "ESF", 3138876.0, 4829044.0, "esf_ni_53"], ["4PE", "Moving Forward- Moving On", "EXTERN GROUP", null, "ESF", 311991.0, 779977.0, "esf_ni_94"], ["4PE", "Externworks", "EXTERN NORTHERN IRELAND", null, "ESF", 1321546.0, 3303866.0, "esf_ni_95"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["6EW", "MERCURY INSIGHTS LIMITED", 809.0, "Other management expenditure (09.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_34119", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT36"}
