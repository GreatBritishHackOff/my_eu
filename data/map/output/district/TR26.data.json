A profound theoretical and practical education and training in the field of tourismas well as a  competent language skills in English and Italian forms a comprehensive educational framework for this goal. \r\n\r\nPart of this work-oriented education are obligatory practical trainings of 12 weeks.  \r\nIn the past two years the interest of the students and graduates of the HLW Lienz in doing a practical training abroad has risen enormously. In order to facilitate all the work regarding practical trainings abroad for all people involved (students, parents, teachers, partner enterprises) two teachers got in charge of co-ordinating the entire Erasmus+ programme for the school and founded the  Verein der HLW / HF Lienz zur F\u00f6rderung von Auslandspraktika in the school year of 2015/16.\r\nWith this additional offer of training places abroad as well as the entire co-ordination of the Erasmus+ programme organised at the school, the internationalisation and the quality management of the two schools could be intensified and the positive reputation of the schools as a contact point for international work experience was established.  Due to the positive  feedback regarding the Erasmus+ programme by students and their parents as well as teachers of secondary schools we can also assume that the option of doing a practical training abroad has already become one of the main reasons why these students choose our schools their next educational step. \r\n\r\nAdditionally to the strong co-operation with the partner enterprises, based on mutual visits and a regular communication and contact throughout the whole year, the Erasmus + programme was promoted at the school and in the whole area with a vast amount of information about it. This included informational meetings as well as a buddy project with former trainees, information evenings for parents and students, permanent information boards introducing the Erasmus+ programme as well as all the parntner enterprises at the school, articles and blogs about the project on the homepage of the school, presentations about it at the parents' day and all secondary schools of East Tyrol etc..  Through this advertising of the programme as well as the personal networking of the trainees regarding this project other schools have already been inspired to consider practical trainings abroad for their students and the news about Erasmus+ programmes is spreading.\r\n\r\nCurrently 33 students are involved in this project. All of them have already signed their placement contracts as well as Learning Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding with the partner enterprises in England and Italy. All the training places have been chosen by the students themselves. They all got a positive reply for a practical training after their application including Europass CVs, motivation letters and personal job interviews. As all partner enterprises only have had positive experiences with trainees from our two schools, this co-operation has turned out to be a win-win situation for both: our schools profit from this additional international offer and the training places can rely on polite, helpful, dedicated and competent trainees for the most hectic period of work.\r\n  \r\nBesides an improvement in practical knowhow, intercultural knowledge and linguistic competences, which all lead to better resuls in the final exams as well as the A-levels, a practical training abroad is especially important for the positive development of all personal and social skills, especially an enhanced self-esteem of the trainees. This huge step in their personal development obviously also has a great impact on their further career at the school and in their later life.  Their career prospects do not only increase because of this international work experience but also due to their - often newly gained - openness, flexibiltiy and professional appearance which they get during an international internship. A large number of students who have done a practical training abroad plan a longer placement abroad after their final exams and they are much more confident and sure about their future plans when they start applying for jobs in international companies. This naturally makes them become role models for many others.\r\n\r\nDue to this project an international way of thinking, working and evaluating has been established at the HLW / HF Lienz and has made it a more modern and  more attractive place of education.", "http://www.carbisbayhotel.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA102-034653_4"], ["2NP", "TirolerInnen auf der Walz 2017", "Carbis Bay Hotel Ltd.", 316627.0, "\"TirolerInnen auf der Walz 2017\" -  \u201eTyroleans on the Road 2017\u201c\r\n\r\nThe project objective is to promote the transfer of Tyrolean students in vocational education and Tyrolean apprentices to European companies, offering them possibilities to gain work experience and to improve language skills. During their vocational training learners will increase their professional qualification and employability.\r\nWe intent to send about 200 students and apprentices of Tyrol to companies in Europe. The average training period will be between 4 and 20 weeks. During their placements trainees will improve their language skills, professional and social competences such as flexibility, persuasiveness, ability to handle work pressure, contact to colleagues/senior staff/external people. They will also obtain an insight in other cultures, mentalities and enterprises. \r\n\r\nThe project consists of a network of European intermediaries, receiving enterprises, sending partners of regional companies and vocational education schools (e.g.: secondary schools and colleges) such as the HLW Reutte, HBLA West, Zillertaler Tourismusschulen, Villa Blanka, Ferrarischule, HLW Landeck and Tyrolean companies for example: Swarovski Optik KG or TH\u00d6NI Industriebetriebe GmbH.\r\nThe planned project (scheduled for 24 months and starting in June 2017) is a long-term strategy in order to offer ongoing EU-granted placements to young Tyroleans. The demand on the part of students in vocational education is increasing, also the number of apprentices taking part. The project is managed and coordinated by the Local Agency Tyrol and it\u00b4s experienced staff, in close with the sending institutions as well as with the regional Chamber of Labour and the Tyrolean Government. The special character of the project is the use of expertise of previous projects and established links with social and regional partners.\r\n\r\nThe projects\u00b4 information and awareness activities will continue all over the project period, in form of e.g.: press releases, facebook www.facebook.at/bewegdeinleben, entries in (partner) websites etc.", "http://www.carbisbayhotel.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA102-034832_22"], ["1QG", "working together for a better future in Europe", "Kidz R Us", 128661.0, "The \"Rudolf Steiner Schulverein im Raum Baden\" is coordinating the project WORKING TOGETHER FOR A BETTER FUTURE IN EUROPE, which offers work placements for more than 100 pupils aged 15 to 18 of the Waldorf Schools Sch\u00f6nau, Linz, Graz, Klagenfurt, Innbruck and Salzburg. Vocational orientation is an integral part of the Waldorf School curriculum in Austria, therefore the aim is to offer high quality work placements in Europe as a part of quality development in this field of the upper grades of the Waldorf Schools.\r\nThe participants do a 2 to 8 weeks work placement (agricultural training, industrial placement, social placement).  Waldorf Schools are comprehensive schools with a wide range of knowledge from upper secondary school level to pupils with special needs. The receiving partners (SME, large company, NGO, Charity organisations) are situated in at least 9 countries (Germany,  Ireland, United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, Iceland, Portugal) and choosen with  focus on sustainability. The partnerships are evaluated through the project reports of former Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus+ projects and by personal contacts. New partners could join the project due to the students interests. We paid attention to geographical and language variety to offer a wide choice. In the field of project management the coordinators at the sending schools are working close together.\r\nIn the schools they support the pupils prior, during and after the mobility. They arrange Learning Agreements with the receiving partner and the student and are responsible for the validation of the learning results. At the regular project meetings problems are discussed, and any organisational questions are clarified. The evaluation meetings with the students are also organised then.\r\nWe expect good progress in the field of language skills, intercultural awareness, learning, initiative and especially personal development like increasing independence and self reliance and creativity. In the long term it enables the student to be an active part of society with a positiv effect  on employability and life long learning.", "http://www.kidzrus.net", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA102-034842_11"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["2BS", "RJ8", "EDWARD HAIN HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TR26"}
