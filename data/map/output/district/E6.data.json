As our society is becoming increasingly dependent on Critical INfrastructures (CIN), new technologies are needed to increase our detection and response capabilities. Detecting and responding to such attacks by a highly motivated, skilled and well-funded attacker has however been proven highly challenging. One of the most vulnerable and high-impact CIN is the Smart Grid. Smart Grid is considered as the next-generation power system, which promises self-healing, resilience, sustainability and efficiency to the energy Critical Infrastructures (CIN). However, securing smart grids against cyber-attacks is of vital importance for National Security and Public Safety, since the collapse of an energy production utility may cause human lives, millions of euros, denial of a very important and common good such as energy and days or even months of recovering. To this end, the SPEAR proposal aims at a) detecting and responding to cyber-attacks using new technologies and capabilities, b) detecting threat and anomalies timely, c) developing all-in-one security detection solutions, d) leveraging advanced forensics subject to privacy-preserving, e) confronting Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) and targeted attacks in smart grids, f) increasing the resilience of the smart grid innovation, g) alleviating the lack of trust in smart grid operators and h) empowering EU-wide consensus. Within SPEAR, four proof-of-concept Use Cases are planned in order to validate and assess the implemented security and privacy tools.", 94290.0, 2583229.0, "SPEAR", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_214857_911278723"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["6ER", "European Connections", "Newham College of Further Education", 118804.0, "The last 16 years Aventus invested much into sustainable relations with European partners. Reciprocal projects and knowledge exchange especially concerned:\r\n- Improvement of the quality of preparation and tutoring of international work placements by both Aventus and the foreign training companies.\r\n- Building up (formal) European networks of partners designing policies as to contents and validation of international work placements\r\n- The structure and curricula of the courses and innovative projects/routes resulting in European Job Profiles with units of learning outcomes, such as: European Management Assistant, European Import and Export Assistant, European Transport & Logistics Assistant, European Green Automotive Energy Mechanic, European Fashion Designer, European Fashion Production Coordinator, European IT System Administrator, European Application Developer, European Marketing Assistant, European Private Security Assistant.\r\n- Monitoring of the trainee\u2019s learning process during the international work placements while accomplishing growth with linguistic and intercultural competences\r\n- Connecting assessments of growth of intercultural competences (within the  international work placements) with career guidance of participating students \r\n- Introduction of ECVET proof \u201cEuropean Job Profiles\u201d for Welfare and Health care courses\r\n-DUAL learners\r\nThe last 4 years ECVET instruments were implemented, such as the Memorandum of Understanding, Learning Agreements and Units of Learning Outcomes. The translation from work processes into \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d was completed within the first 10 European Job Profiles. The outcomes of international work placements have become more transparent and valid. \r\nAventus has become a member of the following \u201cEuropean Job Profile\u201d networks: NETINVET (International Trade and Transport & Logistics), EUrFASHION (Fashion), EURO-AST (Management Assistant), EEE (green car technology), Shaping IT (IT System administrator, Application Developer and Media shaping), AEHT (Hotel and Tourism) M&C (European Marketing Assistant) and NOKAS (European Private Security Assistant). Aventus believes that for the next few years it is of great importance to cooperate with European partners by using ECVET instruments to create more clarity about the learning outcomes of international work placements and to get to a fitting assessment system for them. In order to do this Aventus is an active member of both formal and informal networks that are based on  \u201cEuropean Job Profiles\u201d. Aventus aims at exchanging expertise, experiences and best practices as to assessment and validation of professional tasks during international work placements of students, innovations and tested recipes to complicated educational issues together with its partners within these networks.  All project partners within this project offer many ideas for realising  learning goals for the individual students derived from the European Job profile concerned. As a learning organization Aventus will submit this application both from the perspective of the individual student and the qualifications they aim at with a new focus at level 1 and 2 with the \u201cProfessional Orientation\u201d and at level 3 and 4 with assessments of professional units of learning outcomes and last but not least validation of these meaningful learning experiences for the participants at all 4 levels. The effect for the students will be that the professional as well as the personal learning goals like \u201cself reliance\u201d and the status as a Europan Citizen, in which cultural differences are recognized and accepted. The effect for the entire partnership is that in determining a fitting international work placement the current curriculum, the job profiles and the connection to the European labour market will be reviewed. Both Aventus and the participating students will be stimulated to invest into flexibility of the work force, so that European citizenship also gets a wider European labour perspective. In designing the \u201cProfessional Orientation\u201d international work placements the main focus will be on determining how the connection between current curriculum and foreign language learning can be made. The effect for the corporate world lies in extending their own European network by participating in the EUROCON project and reciprocal projects of Aventus\u2019 European partners and getting to know new, sometimes innovative approaches. The ECVET-instruments that will be used in this project are \u201cMemorandum of Understading\u201d, \u201cUnits of learning outcomes\u201d and the \u201clearning agreements\u201d. These learning experiences will be endorsed bij the development of the extra course 'Internatinalisering\" I and II, bij offering Cambridge language courses and courses at the Goethe Institut.
