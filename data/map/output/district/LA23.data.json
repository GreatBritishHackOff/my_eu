It will contextual this in Global, European, national, regional and local arenas. The Action Plan involves refining Case Studies of replicable and scalable SiS activities for children with an associated pan European benchmarking and mutual agreement process, which will provide vehicles for strategic and political alignment, as well as shared assessment tools.\nThese core WPs will be enriched by WPs which systematically engage three critical groups: young people, students and Key Players. The focus will be on children with ability, who are currently least likely to progress to study science in post secondary education. It will also combine the science and society agenda with the social inclusion agenda through entrepreneurship as well as considering the ethics of activities.\nThe capturing the mutual learning will be priortised and robustly disseminating and communicating this in regional, national, European arenas and beyond, specifically targeting newcomers. The totality of the activities of the consortium will be externally evaluated and all actors will be assisted to reflect on the \u2018Partnership Learning\u2019 that has occurred. This will be captured as an example of mobilising mutual learning for future European initiatives.\nKey to the project will be the active participation of young people, exploring their perceptions and understanding of science. Learning from them as the scientists of the future. The Action Plan will be systematically promoted in Europe and beyond, with the goal of having at least 20 Ministers for Education presenting the same certificates to children in 20 countries in the final year and a Children\u2019s Gateway to the website of every University in the World", 15871.0, 3810332.0, "SIS CATALYST", "Empowering children as societal actors", "European researchers sought to identify how children can be change agents in the science and society relationship, and subsequently catalysts in longer-term solutions to the grand challenges facing society.", "The http://www.siscatalyst.eu/ (SIS CATALYST) (SiS catalyst: Children as change agents for the future of science in society) project was a Mobilisation and Mutual Learning (MML) Action Plan which created mechanisms to help address societal challenges. MMLs are a part of the European Commission's Science in Society (SIS) Work Programme, and the project-specific focus was on the identification, capture and dissemination of mutual learning.\n\nA diverse range of actors examined how children can be included in the dialogue between society and the scientific community. Their work was guided by the idea that children must be included in the decisions of today since they will live with their consequences in the future.\n\nA primary objective was to mainstream SIS activities for children by developing guidelines linked to mobilisation of the political processes needed to bring about change. Project work involved four phases: 'Think Big - Building on Best Practice', 'Start Small - Capacity Building \u2013 piloting', 'Scale Fast - Roll out' and 'Keep Going \u2013 Sustainability'.\n\nWork was based around established activities, such as children's universities and university outreach programmes. The team developed best practices informed by young people, students and key players. SIS CATALYST tools include the Listening and Empowering Toolkit for science communicators, Ethical Guidelines on Children and Student Involvement in SIS Activities, and two Ethical Advisory Reports.\n\nAnother deliverable was the Strategic paper for sustaining and embedding strategy; \u2018Children as societal actors for a sustainable future'. This was used as a basis for a series of policy seminars and the development of a Children's Consultation Event.\n\nDissemination activities included four Policy Practice Interface Conferences, four Strategic Development and Embedding Conferences, and twenty We Recommend Events. These events involved young people from around the world presenting their hopes, aspirations and recommendations for change.\n\nSIS CATALYST has provided tools supporting institutional change and the modernisation of higher education across the EU. The work and its outcomes directly support the Europe 2020 strategy and its emphasis on the social dimension and increased public through the recognition of children as societal actors in their own right.
