AquaMMS will be suitable for use primarily in land-based aquaculture industry, but other markets are also relevant including environmental monitoring sector and the water supply industry. This technology will provide the fish farmer with advance warning of a broad range of potential pollutants, like toxic metals, phosphates, nitrites, nitrates, hydrogen sulphide and geosmins. These pollutants can otherwise inflict chronic stress on the farmed fish resulting in disease outbreaks and/or poor product quality, which means lost profit to the fish farms. Most of these parameters are at present technically challenging to measure accurately on a regular basis and may only be analysed when problems arise on the farm and samples are sent for more comprehensive analysis at external laboratories. Q-technologies (UK) has successfully developed miniature mass spectrometry (MMS) technology for the oil and gas industry, and has seen the need and potential in developing and marketing a similar system for the aquaculture industry. Therefore, they have taken the initiative to propose the AquaMMS project by combining forces with the  SMES, Faaltech (Ireland) and BAMO (Germany). Together, these SMEs will form the production and distribution chain of the product post project. Anglesey Aquaculture Ltd (UK) and Telemarks Roye as (Norway) will take part in the project representing the end user community and will act as a test sites for the developed technology. Anglsey Aquaculture and Telemarks Roye will benefit from improved production by using AquaMMS ahead of its competitors. The RTDs, University of Liverpool (UK), Teknologisk Institutt (Norway) and Cork Institute of Technology (Ireland) have been invited to perform the RTD work needed to reach the objectives.", 17079.0, 1173813.0, "AQUAMMS", "Mass spectrometry for higher fish yield", "An EU project will produce a new real-time, online multi-sensor monitoring device for the aquaculture sector. The device will use mass spectrometry and optical technologies to measure water quality in fish farms, particularly in recirculating aquaculture systems (RASs).", "Sustainable expansion of the aquaculture sector depends on reliable monitoring and rapid analyses of water quality. The EU-funded AQUAMMS (Development of a portable miniature mass spectrometer to monitor important, but technically difficult parameters in aquaculture) project is developing an innovative monitoring system that can support or replace equipment currently on the market.\n\nIn recent years the use of RASs has increased throughout Europe and around the world. This is due to its numerous benefits, which include reusing a large percentage of the water, thereby reducing water use, controlling effluent and minimising environmental pollution. These benefits can help give higher yields of fish.\n\nHowever, unexpected water quality problems can develop as a result of using RAS technology. These include pH decline, rising carbon dioxide concentrations, and an increase in phosphate and nitrate levels or toxic metals.\n\nTherefore, the new AQUAMMS technology will provide an immediate advance warning of potential harmful substances. This will enable appropriate action to be taken instantly, such as increasing oxygen flow or employing a particular water treatment to rectify the problem.\n\nAQUAMMS will develop miniature mass spectrometer (MMS) technology and use it in conjunction with existing know-how on specialised membrane inlet and sensory technologies. This will enable the consortium to develop sensors with unique and wide-ranging capabilities, which can detect low concentrations of important contaminants and pollutants.\n\nThe system will contribute to organic production since actions influencing growth conditions can be taken before any pharmaceuticals or other chemical treatment is needed. This will enable farmers to promote a higher value organic product with the aid of eco-labelling, giving it an edge over imported products. Moreover, by producing more farmed fish, aquaculture will help to take the pressure off of wild stocks.\n\nLand-based fish and shellfish farms, particularly those using RASs, represent the main market for the AQUAMMS system. However, a secondary market also exists, including municipal water supply and treatment, environmental regulators, food and beverage processing, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, horticulture and power generation.", "http://www.aquamms.com/", "http://www.angleseyaquaculture.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-08/161243.jpg", "fp7_111211_952927807"], ["8SN", "Development of sustainable and cost effective water quality management technology for the aquaculture industry", "Anglesey Aquaculture Limited", "The proposers of RAZone have identified a new market opportunity in enhancing the productivity of the aquaculture sector and minimizing risks associated with application of ozone for water quality management in hatchery and ongrow farms that use RAS technology. This will be achieved by developing improved ozoneflotation technology that is cost effective, user friendly and safe both for stock and farm staff.  The innovations of RAZone include novel ozone feeding system that ensures enhanced gas dispersion in water and maximizes contact between gas and water for separation of fine particles and dissolved organics in recirculated water. In addition, the development of RAZone includes innovative flotation chamber where fine particles that make up 70% of suspended substances and dissolved organics are efficiently removed. For optimum dosage of ozone and minimizing risk of stock mortality due to toxicity directly from inefficiently dispersed ozone or from generated by products, an intelligent process control unit will be created.\n\nDespite the recognized potential of ozone in RAS, there remains a significant lack of equipment and knowledge in the industry related to cost effective and safe use of the technology. Application of ozone via protein skimmers has become a costly component of RAS operation due to poorly designed equipment for ozone feeding, inefficient configuration of skimmers and lack of controlled ozone dosage combined with poor understanding of process. This may result in either avoidance of ozone technology altogether or inefficient application to achieve desired aims in addition to associated risks.  By redressing existing limitations in the application of ozone, the SME participants of RAZOne expect significant economic benefit from a superior technology that will improve management of water quality resulting in reduced stock mortality, improved produce quality and increased  production as well as increased employment in the industry.", 16754.0, 1208440.0, "RAZONE", "Ozone cleaning for aquaculture", "Ozone has the potential to be a cost-effective tool for removing fine organic particles and dissolved compounds from commercial aquaculture systems. A new project is fulfilling this potential by developing a standardised ozone-dosing system for aquaculture.", "Ozone represents an easy and effective solution for breaking down particulate matter in recirculation aquaculture systems (RASs) but its use in RASs is limited. This is due to a lack of scientific knowledge on how ozone works, especially in seawater,  to remove particulate matter, as well as a lack of standardised equipment.\n\nFunded by the EU, the http://www.razone.eu (RAZONE) project aims to develop ozone technology for improved water quality in RASs that is cost-efficient and safe for stock animals. The technology will allow farmers to increase the number of animals in a system without increasing health risks.\n\nAn initial review of the literature on ozone technology revealed methods of controlling the size of ozone micro-bubbles, the most important parameter. Researchers also showed that ozonation of fresh water and seawater resulted in different minerals being removed from the system.\n\nResearchers have now designed and built an ozone dispersion unit, which includes a micro-bubble generator and a gas liquid-dispersion device. The device has performed well in early trials.\n\nA reaction chamber is currently being designed, and the design of an overall control system has started. Further work will focus on finalising the design and building a prototype ozone flotation device to remove particles.\n\nOnce complete, RAZONE will have a major impact on commercial aquaculture by improving the health of stock animals and the efficiency of RASs.", "http://www.razone.no/", "http://www.angleseyaquaculture.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140725552.jpg", "fp7_105966_952927807"], ["8SN", "The development of a deammonification treatment to remove nitrogen from recirculated water used in aquaculture", "Anglesey Aquaculture Limited", "The aquaculture industry has been very slow to adopt denitrification methods. Present practice is to convert the toxic metabolic waste product ammonia via nitrite to nitrate in a nitrifying bio-filter. This microbial process demands oxygen and reduces the pH, requiring expensive buffering treatment. The accumulating nitrate is generally flushed from the farm into recipient waters without pollutant removal. The DeammRecirc proposal is based on the recent experiences and success of using deammonification to convert ammonia to nitrogen gas in other waste water treatment applications. This method will in the proposed project be adapted for use in recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS) for fresh- and marine water species. By using a deammonification reactor within RAS, ammonia will be converted to nitrogen gas in one step. Deammonification bacteria enriched in granules will be adapted to RAS water qualities. The advances compared to current SoA include reduced oxygen use, reduced cost for buffering chemicals, lower carbon footprint, reduced levels of nitrate rich effluent released to the environment, reduced pumping cost and treatment need of new exchange water. The project includes 11 participants, of which four are industrial SMEPs, which will produce, develop and distribute the DeammRecirc system post project, one is a large enterprise end user, one participant is from S.

Therefore, the sector is seeking ways of becoming more environmentally friendly.", "A rapidly expanding human population is putting increasing pressure on populations of wild caught fish. Aquaculture is therefore crucial for supplying fish for human consumption and protecting fish stocks in the wild.\n\nA recirculation aquaculture system (RAS) can dramatically reduce the amount of effluent and water used in fish farming. Current practice for removing the ammonia excreted by farmed fish relies on the use of a nitrifying biofilter. This microorganism-based process needs oxygen and reduces PH, thereby requiring expensive buffering treatment.\n\nThe EU-funded DEAMMRECIRC project developed a deammonification reactor to convert ammonia into nitrogen gas in a single step. The process is for use in a RAS, and is suitable for both freshwater and marine species.\n\nResearchers also developed sea salt-adapted inoculums from European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) waste. A methodology was then developed that enables fish farms to grow their own inoculums. The inoculum was used in the pre-treatment prototype reactor developed by the consortium.\n\nThe RAS system water and sludge were mixed and partial denitrification (nitrate to nitrogen gas) took place, transforming nitrate to nitrite. The effluent was then pumped to an anammox reactor containing the inoculum sludge where nitrite and ammonium react to form nitrogen gas (the anammox process). Denitrification also takes place in this reactor.\n\nDEAMMRECIRC therefore converted nitrate in water to nitrogen gas in the air using both anammox and denitrification processes. This reduces the amount of nitrate entering recipient water bodies from RAS fish farms, at the same time providing treatment for the waste product, fish sludge.\n\nThe technology developed by the project partners will result in lower costs for buffering chemicals, lower carbon footprint and reduced levels of nitrate-rich effluent released into the environment. These improvements will help EU aquaculture to become more competitive in the global market place and help to protect the environment.", "http://www.deammrecirc.com", "http://www.angleseyaquaculture.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/144106.jpg", "fp7_97519_952927807"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LL58"}
