To ensure maximum impact, the TURaS project has developed an innovative twinning approach bringing together decision makers in local authorities with SMEs and academics to ensure meaningful results and real change are implemented over the duration of the project.  11 local authorities or local development agencies are involved as partners in the project and they will orient research and development from the outset towards the priority sustainability and resilience challenges facing their cities. 9 leading academic research institutions and 6 SMEs will work with these cities helping them to reduce their urban ecological footprint through proposing new visions, feasiblity strategies, spatial scenarios and guidance tools to help cities address these challenges. The specific challenges addressed in TURaS include: climate change adaptation and mitigation; natural resource shortage and unprecedented urban growth.\nOver the five year duration of the project, the feasibility of these new approaches will be tested in selected case study neighbourhoods and new measures to enable adaptive governance, collaborative decision-making, and behavioural change towards resilient and sustainable European cities will be tested. The impact of these new approaches will be measured and results compared between participating cities before a final set of strategies and tools will be developed for demonstration, dissemination and exploitation in other European cities.  SMEs are highly involved in all work packages of the project and specific measures have been put in place to ensure the optimal economic impact of the project is achieved.", 186629.0, 7107348.0, "TURAS", "Greener, friendlier, resilient cities", "An EU project is developing, testing and sharing innovations for sustainable urban living. The team has created several planning tools, documented case studies involving urban green space experiments, and defined mechanisms for adaptive management.", "Over half of all people worldwide live in cities, and this figure will surely rise. Yet, cities affect their residents and the broader environment and thus a major planning challenge is transitioning to something less impacting while balancing all interests.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.turas-cities.eu (TURAS) (Transitioning to urban resilience and sustainability) project is working with urban stakeholders to face sustainability challenges. Interested parties, including 11 local authorities, have been developing, sharing and testing novel ideas relating to building urban resilience. Specifically, the consortium is addressing climate change adaptation and migration, green infrastructure building and urban growth. The 32-member group runs for 5 years to September 2016.\n\nThe latest development of spatial tools to support of the project's engagement with communities has resulted in the TURAS City Viewer. Other tools include on-line applications for urban communities, guidelines for local authorities and demonstration of novel innovations.\n\nThe team has established several field experiments and began feeding the results into real-world case studies. In particular, TURAS established the 'Green Living Room' \u2013 an experiment in urban green walls intended to provide habitat and comfort benefits. The project showcased and monitored the results. Similarly, the consortium set up and monitored the Barking Riverside green roof urban biodiversity experiment. Both are causing a lot of excitement and bring new ideas to the market.\n\nIn addition, the project created a series of spatial scenarios for urban neighbourhoods. This involved an extensive and exhaustive review, revealing that innovation at local government levels is not reflected in conventional sources. Instead, local activities are strongly documented in non-academic literature. To utilise such material, the project devised a set of case studies. The studies helped define 11 key mechanisms for adaptive management, plus practical ways of implementation. TURAS is also proposing regulations limiting or reversing urban sprawl, some already being adopted by local authorities. The many outcomes go to support policy formulation aimed at making cities more resilient.\n\nThe TURAS project is bringing together stakeholders in sustainable urban planning. Such work produces positive options for more liveable cities in the future.", "http://www.turas-cities.org/", "http://www.lbbd.gov.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-10/164182.jpg", "fp7_100238_972609883"], ["7BN", "New cooperative business models and guidance for sustainable city logistics", "London Borough of Barking and Dagenham", "Urban areas represent the greatest challenges for freight transport and service trips, both in terms of goods distribution and service allocation performance, and environmental impacts (air emission, traffic congestion, road safety, accidents and noise). The salient scope of the proposal is the enabling of knowledge and understanding of freight distribution and service trips by providing guidance for implementing effective and sustainable policies and measures. This guidance will support the choice of the most optimal and applicable solutions for urban freight and service transport, and will facilitate stakeholder collaboration and the development, field testing and transfer of best governance and business models. \nThis shall be achieved through:\n- The targeted understanding of urban freight and service trips, fostered by data collection on city logistics;\n- Field testing and implementation of representative city logistics measures;\n- The development and application of a modular, integrated, evaluation framework for the assessment of these measures;\n- The development of a typology between cities and potential city logistics components; and \n- The provision of guidance to cities, shaping consistent implementation channels for successful solutions, all according to the local needs and constraints. \nThese activities will be accompanied by the production of practical tools that could support the take-up impact of NOVELOG project to wider international city and industrial networks and beyond the project's lifetime.
