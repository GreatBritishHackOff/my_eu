Com Limited", "The cost of packaging in microelectronics is around 30% of total production costs, but this is rising at an alarming rate due to the increasing consumer demand for smaller and smarter portable electronic devices. In micro-systems, the costs of packaging can be up to 80% of total production costs. Technological advances to reduce packaging costs are therefore of pivotal importance to maintain the competitive edge of assembly companies. Moreover, with the exodus of high volume packaging and assembly companies to low-wage countries such as China and India, the manufacturing industry in Europe needs to revitalise itself by encouraging design and innovation that will allow European companies to produce assembly equipment and materials of tomorrow that will feed into the Asian market. Our approach of using microwave technology in bonding has significant advantages over technologies made available in the market. In our approach we don\u2019t need a closed microwave oven. Through the open design we can do the placement, alignment and curing at the same time. The use of this technology in reel-to-reel manufacturing will be possible. Due to the higher level of integration and signifcantly shorter cycle times this new technology will give European packaging companies a clear competitive advantage particularly over their US competitors. Quality of the bonds will be improved as well due to better selectivity and special designed materials as well as the precisely adaptable frequency of the microwave. It uses pulsed microwave sources and relies on the selection of a few resonant cavities frequencies that are jittered (mode hopping). The two characteristics permit not only the avoidance of electrical discharges through arcing, but also the accurate curing of the paste at the location of interest, i.e. at the interface between a die and the substrate for example in the case of DCA. The project is driven bei 6 SME-IAGs who want to create this clear competitive advantage for theirmembers.", 160156.0, 1998796.0, "FAMOBS", "New bonding technology for microelectronics", "EU-funded scientists unveiled an innovative microwave system not to heat food, but for use in the semiconductor industry to improve materials bonding quality.", "The cost of packaging in microelectronics accounts for 30\u00a0% of total production costs. However, this is rising at an alarming rate because of increasing consumer demand for smaller and smarter portable electronic devices. Technological advances to reduce packaging costs are therefore of crucial importance to maintain the competitive edge of EU packaging and assembly companies.\n\nMicroelectronics packaging often makes use of thermosetting polymer materials such as encapsulants, underfills or electrically conductive adhesives. Initially, thermosetting polymers are liquid or paste-like and are hardened through a curing process. An alternative approach to conventional heating methods is the use of microwave energy that results in substantially shorter curing times.\n\nIn the EU-funded project 'Frequency agile microwave bonding system' (http://www.famobs.eu/ (FAMOBS)), researchers developed a novel tool that uses pulsed microwave radiation and selects a few cavity frequencies to improve the bonding quality. Possible applications include curing underfill materials, bonding components to a printed circuit board or even reworking defective components.\n\nThis tool is an open-cavity bonding system that allows point selective heating. As such, it can be integrated into a precision placement machine to allow processing single components in a whole printed circuit board. Furthermore, the open design enables simultaneous placement, alignment and curing. Reel-to-reel processing is another application of this technology.\n\nCompared to a convection oven, the material is heated from the inside, which results in shorter curing times. It is thus possible to cure certain materials 10 times faster. The system has a process accuracy of less than 10\u00a0micrometres.\n\nWith the exodus of a high volume of packaging and assembly companies to low-wage countries, it becomes clear that the European manufacturing industry needs to revitalise itself. Due to the significantly shorter cycle times, this newly developed technology is expected to provide European packaging companies a clear competitive advantage. It should also allow them to produce assembly equipment and materials that will feed into the Asian market.", null, "http://www.rfcom.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/153658.jpg", "fp7_95601_975200462"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["4SY", "Moving Docs", "SDI PRODUCTIONS LTD", 108852.0, "The objective of Moving Docs is to engage urban and rural audiences across Europe through regular and simultaneous screenings of the best European and international documentary films.

We strive to support learners to reach their full potential in everything that they do.  Our staff have varied knowledge, skills and confidence in French from complete beginner to University level.  Until this year French was taught solely to primary 6 and 7 by a specialist teacher.  During this academic year we have embraced the 1+2 approach with a focus on embedding modern languages and including opportunities for cultural and topic related learning where possible.  Staff are enthusiastic and keen to increase their experience to improve the quality of learning opportunities for the children resulting in many of them dedicating their professional development hours towards improving their French.  Despite this positive start all staff feel their confidence in teaching French can be increased and so we are keen to pursue every opportunity to support this and language learning in France where we can interact with native speakers would be a fantastic opportunity.  By attending a LFEE course in France our staff would become more confident to develop and deliver high quality learning experiences for our children which would help us meet our School Quality Improvement Plan target.  An increase in confidence would allow them to become champions for modern languages; supporting colleagues and pupil support assistants and spreading enthusiasm.  By ensuring several staff members attend the training we will increase our ability to support and sustain change.  Sending 8 staff members, including a member of the senior management team, could mean a French champion at each stage plus support in policy making and sharing with the community.  Commitment to professional development would be clearly evidenced.  The LFEE courses introduce attendees to new and motivating resources and demonstrate how to adapt ideas for different ages.  They balance language learning with cultural activities.  There is an opportunity to network with like-minded individuals encouraging sharing and supporting perhaps with moderation in France and on our return to Scotland.  The opportunity to gather cultural resources to encourage comparison between Salignac and Lyon and Edinburgh are huge and naturally encourages global citizenship.  Even to share with our learners that we went to France as part of our job could be enlightening for them!  The expected impact of this training opportunity is that all staff will increase confidence and skill level in French leading to their greater ability to teach French.  In turn this will filter through to the rest of the staff through our French champions.  French and France will be promoted and all teaching staff will be enthused.  Able teaching staff will transfer their positivity to their learners leading to success.  An increase in the quality and quantity of French teaching will lead to an increase in the ability of the learners so we will need to produce and source new resources or new ways of using resources.  This will certainly be supported by attending an LFEE immersion course.  Champions will suggest and model resources and they will also have access to resources created by others, friendships formed during the courses will ensure sharing and supporting outwith our school.  Our whole school approach will lead to including a French element in assemblies.  Parents will be included and encouraged to support our efforts at home.  We will be able to share the impact of our progress locally within our community, with our cluster schools and beyond.  We aim to raise awareness of the importance of fostering a love of languages and Europe within school to all.  We have begun investigating eTwinning as another option in building global connections but require further investigation to select a suitable project.  Increasing modern language learning will assist our young people cognitively and give them the ability to compete in today's world.  In turn this will benefit the UK economically.
