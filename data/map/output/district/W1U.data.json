It aims at sharpening the focus of European manufacturing through a number of application experiments, while adopting an innovative approach which ensures comparative performance evaluation. Each challenge is launched via an open call and is structured in 3 stages. 45 Contestants are selected using a challenge in a simulation environment: the low barrier of entry allows new players to compete with established robotics teams. Matching up the best Contestants with industrial end users, 15 Challenger teams are admitted to the second stage, where the typical team is formed by research experts, technology suppliers, system integrators, plus end users. Teams are required to benchmark use cases on standard robotic platforms empowered by this consortium. After a mid-term evaluation with public competition, the teams advance to showcasing the use case in a realistic environment. After an open judging process, 6 Challenge Finalists are admitted to run pilot experiments in a real environment at end-user sites to determine the final EuRoC Winner. A number of challenge advisors and independent experts decide about access to the subsequent stages.

The Grid approach in contrary is about using distributed resources from different domains. The experience made in many recent projects trying to use commercial applications in Grid systems clearly indicates a technological barrier of current licensing mechanisms that must be overcome before the Grid becomes a fully commercial productive environment.<br/><br/>SMARTLM solution is to implement licenses as Grid services thus providing platform-independent access just like other Grid resources.

Depending on the level of trust signed or encrypted, agreements will be used to transport licenses through the Grid to the resource to which a user has been granted access to execute his application tasks.
