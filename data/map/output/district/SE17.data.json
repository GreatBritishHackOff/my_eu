The majority of its 400+  pupils are from minority ethnic backgrounds  with English as an additional language.   \r\n\r\nSince 2014 when Ofsted inspected the school and awarded us the rating of 'Requires Improvement', our staff and parents and pupils have worked hard to improve every aspect of our school.  In 2016 when we were inspected again, we were judged to be 'Good' in all categories.  \r\n\r\nHowever, Ofsted noted 2 areas where we still need to improve. One was in our teaching of French.  And the other was in the general consistency and creativity of our teaching to ensure continuous outstanding learning by our pupils.  \r\n\r\nThe objective of this application is to obtain the funding that we need to address these needs identified by the Ofsted Inspectors.  \r\n\r\nAs part of our School Improvement Plan, we intend to send 6  key staff from our all of our Key Stage 2 year groups (Years 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6)  to France for one week immersion training in both 2018 and 2019.  The provider is a long standing French Language Training Centre in Antibes that has provided training for staff from other schools in our borough over many years with good results.  We believe their courses, which include pure language and teaching methodology training, as well as contact with local French teachers and cultural immersion, will raise the confidence and capability of our teaching team to deliver French much better.  \r\n\r\nSecondly, over the 2 year period of this project, we want to send 6 Key Learning Leaders from our staff to courses in each of the Algarve, Portugal and Jarfalla, Sweden to experience a different education context and to compare and contrast how we deliver our teaching.  We believe this will give us new ideas and the chance to think analytically about our own teaching practice in a way that can be disseminated throughout our staff and lead to ongoing improvement.  Our borough has links with both these regions, having coordinated 2 year Comenius Regio projects with both areas previously.  Although  we were not part of those projects, the 2 partners abroad that would deliver our training were -- a Teacher In-service Centre in Lagos, Portugal and the Local Authority in Jarfalla, Sweden.  So we know they are able to teach us new approaches.  \r\n\r\nOur key language teaching staff at Key Stage 2 will be involved in the first training type.   Our Senior Leadership and Learning Leaders will take part in the second.   All learning outcomes will be recorded and then analyzed and disseminated throughout our school, with the aim being that Ofsted notes significant improvement in our teaching performance at their next inspection.  \r\n\r\nWe expect significant personal and professional development to result for our staff and our teaching to improve as a result of these training activities.      We also think that our school needs these experiences to improve our international links and our connections to the wider world.  It will boost our European dimension which has not been as strong as it could be in the past and which will bring new ideas and understanding of our place in the world and the way we teach and learn to both our staff and pupils.", "http://www.englishmartyrsrcprimary.co.uk", "ENGLISH MARTYRS' CATHOLIC PRIMARY SCHOOL", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035566_coordinator"], ["3BQ", "I Act: for equality, democracy and solidarity", "Woodcraft Folk", 7840.0, "This individual EVS project involves a volunteer from UK spending one year in Brussels to volunteer for the international youth-led organisation IFM-SEI. The main focus of the voluntary year is three-fold; 1) the I Act project for the prevention of sexual violence using the bystander model 2) the On The Move project on migration, refugees, visas and regional youth work, and 3) supporting the development of a global IFM-SEI Pool of Trainers. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n- To provide the opportunity for a young volunteer to develop their educational competencies through volunteering in IFM-SEI\r\n- To connect an EVS volunteer with a global group of local volunteers to prepare and implement a wide range of educational activities together\r\n- To enhance internal communication and raise awareness of Erasmus+ and EVS within our global membership\r\n\r\nThe volunteer will be involved in four key areas: \r\n\r\n1) Working with international volunteers and the office team to run the I Act project and On The Move project. Her role in I Act will be to be involved in the planning team of an international action day on 25 November - supporting member organisations to deliver campaigns, trainings or public actions around the topic. She will also co-develop an educational resource for members and  contribute to the I Act online platform. For the On The Move project, she will support the African and Latin American regional meetings on migration, and help to develop the online visa platform and e-learning course on regional youth work.\r\n\r\n2) Working with international volunteers to contribute as a junior trainer to the development and running of international seminars, above all regional falcon meetings and thematic seminars, looking at topics such as extremism, and queer theory and pop culture. She will also look at supporting the creation of a Pool of Trainers through developing tools, coordinating the members of the pool, supporting the expert team and contributing to theoretical manifestos and policies. She can furthermore choose how she would like to contribute to other training courses run by IFM-SEI during the year \u2013 either as a junior trainer, or only logistically or through communications work.\r\n \r\n3) Contributing to the development of information and communication strategies in IFM-SEI. She will run short information workshops on Erasmus+ during our meetings and activities.  She will also be involved in the current communication and social media strategy by drafting newsletter articles, and developing website and social media content. Together with the communication leads in IFM-SEI and the Project Officer she will further develop our media strategy. \r\n\r\n4) General involvement in activities prepared by the IFM-SEI secretariat. We will also involve the volunteer in other general IFM-SEI activities that she is interested in, e.g. within thematic working groups and statutory meetings, project planning, external representation and camps.\r\n\r\nThe project is based on non-formal education, as this is the core of our movement. Non-formal education is used in all our activities, whether local or international, and we will also lead the volunteer through a carefully structured participatory learning process in her office activities. \r\n\r\nWe expect the young volunteer will complete her EVS full of self-confidence and new competencies to support her in finding fruitful employment and education in the future, and will encourage her to stay engaged on the international level as a volunteer. Furthermore, her volunteering project will impact strongly on her local group in Brighton that will feel stronger connected to the international level through contact to an EVS volunteer who can open their eyes to an intercultural experience. \r\n\r\nIFM-SEI will benefit from new ideas and input from a volunteer who is working on the grassroots level with young people already. Our members will learn about EVS and other Erasmus+ activities from her during short workshops conducted by her. The long-term benefit will be felt on children and young people worldwide through all of these projects that are built with multiplication in mind.", "http://www.woodcraft.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-BE05-KA105-002137_1"], ["3BQ", "\u00a1Internacional\u00edzate!

Delegations of five young people aged 13-18 from 10 countries will come together, along with their group leaders and members of the facilitation team. Participants will come from all corners of Europe: Austria, Belarus, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Lithuania, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey and UK.\r\n\r\nThe participants will take part in outdoor activities, simulation games, debates, role-plays, workshops, media projects and discussions to explore what is internationalism and why it's important, how nationalism can lead to xenophobia and exclusion and how to overcome this and intercultural understanding. Participants will think about their dream international experience and they will think of ways to establish bilateral partnerships and how to bring global to local. The culmination of the youth exchange will be the participation in the 'Esplaiada', a huge gathering of thousands of children and young people from Esplais Catalans, the host organisation, where the youth exchange participants will run activities on internationalism - activities they have created during the week!\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this youth exchange are to:\r\n\r\n- Educate and inform young people about internationalism, their international movement and the benefits of both\r\n- Promote the core ideals of solidarity, diversity, internationalism, freedom and friendship\r\n- Foster creativity, critical thinking and initiative in young people \r\n- Come up with ideas about how to bring internationalism to a greater number of local kids and youth groups \r\n- Engage young people with fewer opportunities and/or marginalised groups in international work \r\n- Inspire and motivate young people to engage in future international activities \r\n\r\nFollowing the youth exchange, the participants will be responsible for taking their learning back home and taking internationalism back to local groups in their organisations.

The aim is to encourage young people to counteract right-wing populist mobilization, nationalist tendencies and contemptuous attitudes, and to work for a democratic Europe of diversity. One of the focal points of the youth exchange is the discussion of the internet as a place of right-wing populist opinion-making. In various media workshops the participants develop answers to online hate speech and how a democratic culture can be implemented online.\r\nFor this, the participants are not only trained in the use of social media and other media interventions but also in the development of educational actions in the web. With the youth exchange adolescents and young people gain skills, methods and competencies that enable them to carry out projects that foster and consolidate democracy and to transfer their acquired knowledge as multipliers.\r\n60 young people and adolescents from ten different countries in Europe and the Middle East will participate in the youth exchange. The internationality of the encounter ensures a variety of different perspectives on the subject and thus makes participants experience difference and diversity. \r\nThis leads not least to the dismantling of one's own prejudices and any fear of contact. The participants of the youth exchange are all active members in the partner organizations of the project. They will become peer educators by presenting their work to the others and discussing the transferability of the respective best practice. This makes them actively acting against right-wing populism, racism and discriminatory attitudes and for a democratic Europe of diversity.
