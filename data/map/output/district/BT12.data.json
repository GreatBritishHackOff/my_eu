One reason for success is the use of materials with good vibration-damping capabilities and minimal or similar levels of thermal expansion. These features significantly reduced short-term instabilities. \n\nTo improve accuracy and shorten acquisition times, scientific complementary metal\u2013oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) camera technology were combined  with application-specific read-out schemes.

Advances in coaching delivery and tactical analysis will be used to improve the teaching skills of the mobility participants. \r\n\r\nMobility learning outcomes for VET learners will prioritise technical and tactical competences including football skills, soft skills and life skills. \r\n\r\nMobility outcomes will result in players achieving a greater degree of maturity, confidence and independence which will dramatically reduce the dropout rate among those elite Club NI players who are offered professional contracts with clubs in England and Scotland. The immersion of young (15-16 year old) VET Learners from Northern Ireland in the Spanish football programme for a two week period will provide them with the skills and competences to progress to a full-time professional playing career and enhance their prospects of achieving full international status.\r\n\r\nFor VET staff, the specific objectives relate to their professional development through increased employability, reduced risk of subsequent unemployment, and improved job security.\r\n\r\nThis mobility project will lead to a new way of strategic thinking for the participating mobility coaches on their return to Northern Ireland, irrespective of whether they operate at the elite performance, community or grassroots level of the game. It is this area between schools, the grassroots/community coaching framework and the professional clubs where the real benefits of European innovation will be applied by the returning mobility participants to maximum effect. This project will add real value by increasing, on a national basis,  knowledge, skills and competences among VET professionals as a direct result of their participation in European mobility.  \r\n\r\nThis project will enhance talent development in Northern Ireland in men\u2019s and women\u2019s football, and allow the large numbers of young people, male and female, to achieve their maximum potential as a player, irrespective of the level that they participate. European innovations and methods will be introduced to provide more transparent links between the regional coaching centres, the national performance centre and also our International Level Centre. \r\n\r\nThis project will directly address the Lisbon and Europe 2020 Strategies. The Irish FA is a fairly unique entity in its access to the media of publicity and this will prove an excellent dissemination vehicle to encourage other VET Professionals to seek out mobility opportunities. To this end, the Irish FA will allocate a sum equivalent to 10% of the total budget to fund dissemination before, during and after the mobility period.", "http://www.irishfa.com", "IRISH FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION LTD", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036074_coordinator"], ["5JL", "FRAY LUIS DE LE\u00d3N IV", "Foundation (Northern Ireland)", 98501.0, "The Consortium promoter of this proposal, coordinated again by the Provincial Development Board of the Council of Cuenca, and shaped by other 19 VET organisations, both public and private bodies, presents the project \u201cFRAY LUIS DE LE\u00d3N IV\u201d thanks to their extensive experience in mobility projects.\r\n\r\n\u201cFRAY LUIS DE LE\u00d3N IV\u201d intends to continue with the training and work activities that have brought many benefits to the youth of the province through projects developed mobility (especially linked to its predecessors, \u201cFRAY LUIS DE LE\u00d3N\u201d, \u201cFRAY LUIS DE LE\u00d3N II\u201d and \u201cFRAY LUIS DE LE\u00d3N III\u201d), thanks to which these young people have gained valuable work experience, combined with the cultural and linguistic experience.
