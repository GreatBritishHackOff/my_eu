Thus, the goal of the REMEDI project is to explore the possibilites of novel light microscopy techniques, which overcome the diffraction limit of visible light and extend the range of observation to the molecular level of proteins in tumour cells and analyze their interaction and spatial distribution. This proposal aims at the use of single-molecule-microscopy of cancer tissue samples with ultra-high sensitivity, simplified handling and increased speed of analysis. This shall be accomplished by the development of a novel resolution-enhanced microscopy platform with an integrated novel CMOS camera and an adequate image acquistion and analysis software.

Researchers worked on improving stability by either ensuring constant temperature for all the device components or a feedback system to allow realignments in real time.\n\nREMEDI  developed an effective innovative concept for such a microscope. One reason for success is the use of materials with good vibration-damping capabilities and minimal or similar levels of thermal expansion. These features significantly reduced short-term instabilities. \n\nTo improve accuracy and shorten acquisition times, scientific complementary metal\u2013oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) camera technology were combined  with application-specific read-out schemes. The large sCMOS camera chip size allows the side-by-side projection of 2 images with good vertical position accuracy down to 20\u00a0nanometres. \n\nScientists successfully validated these methods using two types of microscope applications. Diagnostic or experimental pathology is applied in the case of breast cancer and tumour immunology for lymphoma cells. \n\nSuccessful commercialisation of this microscopy system will revolutionise medicine by enabling cell-based clinical diagnostics for early detection of diseases like cancer.
