However, faster growth has been seen in the revision market, where prosthetic joints are replaced, than in primary interventions. The major cause of these revisions is that all joint replacements are prone to wear leading to loss of implant function. Further, it has been demonstrated that adverse or extreme loading has a detrimental effect on implant performance. Thus, device failure still occurs too frequently leading to the conclusion that their longevity and reliability must be improved. The premise of this proposal is to realise that wear and corrosion are an inevitable consequence of all implant interfaces within contemporary total joint replacements. To overcome this problem our novel approach is to use silicon nitride coatings in which the combined high wear resistance of this material and solubility of any silicon nitride wear particles released, reduce the overall potential for adverse tissue reactions. In this work a variety of silicon nitride based coatings will be applied to different tribological scenarios related to total hip arthroplasty. The coatings\u2019 suitability in each scenario will be assessed against target profiles. In particular, it is important to consider coating performance within each of these applications under adverse conditions as well as those outlined in internationally utilised standards. To accomplish this, cutting-edge adverse simulation techniques, in vitro assays and animal models will be developed together with a suite of computational assessments to significantly enhance device testing in terms of predicting clinical performance. Data will inform new standards development and enhance current testing scenarios, and will provide 5 European enterprises with a significant market advantage, whilst providing data for a regulatory submission which is aligned with Dir 93/42/EEC.", 1014264.0, 14907410.0, "LifeLongJoints", "Artificial lifelong joints can become a reality", "Joint replacement procedures constitute a medical market calculated in billions per year, increasing with the ageing population. As joint replacements are prone to wear, leading to loss of implant function, it is important to extend their lifetime to avoid repeated surgeries.", "Previous attempts to increase the functional lifetime of hip and knee artificial joints focused on using wear-resistant materials. The project \u2018LifeLongJoints: Silicon nitride coatings for improved implant function' (http://www.lifelongjoints.eu (LIFELONGJOINTS)) explores a different concept. It aims to develop a harder wearing coating that also produces soluble debris with decreased impact on surrounding biological tissues. New silicon nitride low-wear coating for articulating surfaces and interfaces will result in implants with improved wear characteristics.\n\nLIFELONGJOINTS hopes to achieve longer-lasting and more robust implants and reductions in implant failures. The 5-year effort, to be completed in 2018, involves a consortium of 15 centres of excellence within the European research and technology community.\n\nIn addition to design and characterisation of a novel wear-resistant silicon nitride-based coating for articulating and non-articulating bearing surfaces, the project has several other objectives. These include development of advanced methodologies for simulating activities of daily living using mechanical and software systems, which predict wear and allow the pre-clinical testing of a series of prototype devices. These newly developed tests will challenge the coating beyond the current standards and will include activities such stair climbing and stumbling. Laboratory studies will also address the effects of silicon nitride on living cell to ascertain whether there are any toxic effects. It is expected that silicon nitride coating will also reduce corrosion, decreasing adverse biological responses.\n\nDuring the first year, LIFELONGJOINTS partners identified deposition process parameters with regards to silicon nitride coating properties. Silicon nitride-coated cobalt chromium samples were then tested. Testing included adhesion, roughness, hardness, wear resistance and tribocorrosion. The scientists investigated the reasons leading to failure of implants, specifically the fretting wear around the taper junction of the hip implants. State-of-the art simulators are currently being developed that mimic the 'real-life' cycles that cause adverse loading and motions.\n\nThe project has had a promising start. The new coatings should lead to improved therapeutic outcomes of joint replacement procedures and increased patient benefits.", null, "http://www.prosim.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/155638.jpg", "fp7_106919_959882319"], ["4JZ", "Assistive Technology Rapid Integration & Construction Set", "Sensory Software Ltd", "More than 2,6 million people in Europe have problems with their upper limbs and therefore many of them depend on Assistive Technologies (AT).
