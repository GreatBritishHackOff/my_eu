However, faster growth has been seen in the revision market, where prosthetic joints are replaced, than in primary interventions. The major cause of these revisions is that all joint replacements are prone to wear leading to loss of implant function. Further, it has been demonstrated that adverse or extreme loading has a detrimental effect on implant performance. Thus, device failure still occurs too frequently leading to the conclusion that their longevity and reliability must be improved. The premise of this proposal is to realise that wear and corrosion are an inevitable consequence of all implant interfaces within contemporary total joint replacements. To overcome this problem our novel approach is to use silicon nitride coatings in which the combined high wear resistance of this material and solubility of any silicon nitride wear particles released, reduce the overall potential for adverse tissue reactions. In this work a variety of silicon nitride based coatings will be applied to different tribological scenarios related to total hip arthroplasty. The coatings\u2019 suitability in each scenario will be assessed against target profiles. In particular, it is important to consider coating performance within each of these applications under adverse conditions as well as those outlined in internationally utilised standards. To accomplish this, cutting-edge adverse simulation techniques, in vitro assays and animal models will be developed together with a suite of computational assessments to significantly enhance device testing in terms of predicting clinical performance. Data will inform new standards development and enhance current testing scenarios, and will provide 5 European enterprises with a significant market advantage, whilst providing data for a regulatory submission which is aligned with Dir 93/42/EEC.", 1014264.0, 14907410.0, "LifeLongJoints", "Artificial lifelong joints can become a reality", "Joint replacement procedures constitute a medical market calculated in billions per year, increasing with the ageing population. As joint replacements are prone to wear, leading to loss of implant function, it is important to extend their lifetime to avoid repeated surgeries.", "Previous attempts to increase the functional lifetime of hip and knee artificial joints focused on using wear-resistant materials. The project \u2018LifeLongJoints: Silicon nitride coatings for improved implant function' (http://www.lifelongjoints.eu (LIFELONGJOINTS)) explores a different concept. It aims to develop a harder wearing coating that also produces soluble debris with decreased impact on surrounding biological tissues. New silicon nitride low-wear coating for articulating surfaces and interfaces will result in implants with improved wear characteristics.\n\nLIFELONGJOINTS hopes to achieve longer-lasting and more robust implants and reductions in implant failures. The 5-year effort, to be completed in 2018, involves a consortium of 15 centres of excellence within the European research and technology community.\n\nIn addition to design and characterisation of a novel wear-resistant silicon nitride-based coating for articulating and non-articulating bearing surfaces, the project has several other objectives. These include development of advanced methodologies for simulating activities of daily living using mechanical and software systems, which predict wear and allow the pre-clinical testing of a series of prototype devices. These newly developed tests will challenge the coating beyond the current standards and will include activities such stair climbing and stumbling. Laboratory studies will also address the effects of silicon nitride on living cell to ascertain whether there are any toxic effects. It is expected that silicon nitride coating will also reduce corrosion, decreasing adverse biological responses.\n\nDuring the first year, LIFELONGJOINTS partners identified deposition process parameters with regards to silicon nitride coating properties. Silicon nitride-coated cobalt chromium samples were then tested. Testing included adhesion, roughness, hardness, wear resistance and tribocorrosion. The scientists investigated the reasons leading to failure of implants, specifically the fretting wear around the taper junction of the hip implants. State-of-the art simulators are currently being developed that mimic the 'real-life' cycles that cause adverse loading and motions.\n\nThe project has had a promising start. The new coatings should lead to improved therapeutic outcomes of joint replacement procedures and increased patient benefits.", null, "http://www.prosim.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/155638.jpg", "fp7_106919_959882319"], ["4JZ", "Assistive Technology Rapid Integration & Construction Set", "Sensory Software Ltd", "More than 2,6 million people in Europe have problems with their upper limbs and therefore many of them depend on Assistive Technologies (AT).

In 2013, we completed expansion to become a two-form entry school.\r\n\r\nOne of our many strengths is our continuous commitment to achieve the very best education for our children. We have high aspirations for our children, and amongst many of the values that we endeavour to encourage is to be knowledgeable, and thus develop critical understanding of topics of global importance.\r\n\r\nNorris Bank has been involved in a previous Erasmus+ project with five mobilities to Spain, which ended in 2016.  Based simply upon the participant reports the project was an overwhelming success and has gone a great way towards meeting the overall aims outlined in our initial application. All participants increased their ability to communicate in the main foreign language used in the mobility activity, in this case Spanish, and there was a clear agreement that cultural awareness and expression had been furthered. These were the first set of key elements for us at Norris Bank.\r\n\r\nFollowing on from the success of our previous project, we aim to continue to follow our vision to offer language learning and enhance inter-cultural awareness across our school from EYFS to UPKS2. We were delighted to observe the success in our young learners\u2019 enjoyment, enthusiasm, skills and knowledge. Additionally, staff involved in the project have continued to maintain enthusiasm for Spanish and there is clear evidence of greater teaching, ideas sharing and staff support across the whole school. \r\n\r\nWe now need to build upon this impact, to make sure that we do not lose the momentum and hard work that was achieved. We do not currently we have the skills and experience to sustain our current model of language teaching and learning. We currently rely on two members of staff to teach Spanish to Years 3, 4, 5 and 6. Teaching staff will be enthused, motivated and skilled to deliver lessons to pupils and embed Spanish as the key FL at our School.\r\n\r\nWe have a skills shortage in teaching languages, and believe that this project will help overcome this so we can deliver high quality teaching and learning of Spanish at our school. We plan to send 8 people to Spain over the next two years on immersion courses to develop language and intercultural skills. \r\n\r\nThe FL Coordinator will lead the project and ensure that all participants are fully prepared and briefed throughout the project. The project lead will report to SLT, and the wider Board of Governors to ensure that they are fully informed of all project developments and proceedings.\r\n\r\nWe will take part in preparation activities in advance of the course including baseline assessments of our current provision and individual preparation to ensure that participants get the maximum benefit from the visits. We will organise regular meetings with participants who have taken part in previous projects to share advice and ideas about how to make the most of the experience on the course and also how to ensure this has the greatest impact on our school and local community.\r\n\r\nThe immediate impact will be to raise the profile of languages within the school and to create a buzz about language learning. We hope this will lead to an increase in uptake of languages as our pupils understand the importance and relevance of language learning, and language becomes an enjoyable experience that many more pupils will wish to take advantage of. Pupils will have more learning opportunities and access to more languages through the development of extracurricular provision.\r\n\r\nWe will use a range of methods to conduct the evaluation, these will include:\r\n\u2022 Observation of lessons\r\n\u2022 Evaluation of quality of lesson planning and assessment\r\n\u2022 Measures against baseline data charting progression in language learning\r\n\u2022 Surveys to gauge opinions of all key stakeholders \u2013 teachers (including those who did not take direct part in the project); SLT; parents; members of the community; Governors; other cluster schools\r\n\u2022 Discussions with children regard teaching and learning Spanish, both before and continuously throughout the project\r\n\u2022 Monitoring changes in our curriculum and impact on other subjects.", "http://www.norrisbank.stockport.sch.uk", "Norris Bank Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036066_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SK4"}
