Furthermore students have participated in internships in Argentina, Mexico, China, Hong Kong, the USA and Canada without EU funding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apprenticeship aims at students performing secretarial tasks in the service and trade sector and in manufacturing industries. They should acquire the competencies which are necessary in the field of business and be reliant in the use of the English language, orally and in writing. Intercultural competencies are necessary to adequately deal with business partners from other cultural backgrounds on a sustainable basis. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe companies are very much in favour of the foreign internships and sometimes even add a participation in such an event to their work contracts with the students. Specific contents of the foreign internships are laid out in the training regulations and the framework curriculum. The educational regulations of the two year full time courses mandates an internship as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third group of participants consists of teachers of the KSM. At least two teachers are supposed to travel to one of the partner countries on a yearly basis, to improve their language skills, gather intercultural knowledge and cooperate with the local partner companies to evaluate and advance the projects. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe KSM has added the internationalization of teacher training to their school programme, to prepare apprentices and students for taking over responsibility in global contexts and in an increasingly multicultural society.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProfile of participants\r\n\r\nThe participants of the project are apprentices doing a three-year dual apprenticeship according to BBiG: management assistants in foreign trade, management assistants in freight forwarding and logistics, administrative assistants in public service and students taking part in a two-year full-time vocational course: foreign language secretaries and office assistants. Participants are usually 17 to 23 years old. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nActivities and objectives of the work placements\r\n\r\nThe interns should \r\n\r\n-develop competencies on the job (dual apprenticeship)\r\n\r\n-get practical experience on the job (full time courses)\r\n\r\n-achieve the learning goals set by their training regulations\r\n\r\n-improve language skills \r\n\r\n-increase intercultural competencies\r\n\r\n-improve knowledge of, and interest in other EU countries\r\n\r\n-learn how to communicate and do business effectively in other countries  \r\n\r\n-deal with commercial correspondence and documents in another language\r\n\r\n-get in contact with foreign business partners  \r\n\r\n-take a major step towards becoming a mature individual\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected long term benefit\r\n\r\nStudents with a foreign background have the chance to use their language skills and improve their chances on the domestic job market. Young people from rural or deprived backgrounds get the chance to broaden their horizons and break out of their situation, where transnational mobility was  previously unknown or viewed sceptically.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProcedure\r\n\r\nThe results of the internships, the experiences of the interns and the impressions of the cooperating companies and organizations are monitored in regular meetings and documented on a regular basis.", "http://www.fgmclaymore.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000197_10"], ["4HN", "B\u016bk saugus vandenyje", "The Royal Life Saving Society UK", 6113.0, "BE SAFE IN THE WATER\r\n\r\nBackground. Around 150 people needlessly drown in Lithuania every year and thousands more suffer injury, some life changing, through near-drowning experiences. This problem is very painful when it comes to children, the youth and working age people. According to the statistics for 2010-2015 period, there were 1361 fatal drowning cases in Lithuania, among them 92 were minors. In 2015, 146 people have drowned: 6 percent of them were children and teenagers under the age of 19, 72 percent \u2013 working age people from 20 to 60 years old. Drowning is the first leading cause of unintentional injury death cause in children under the age of 10. Due to inadequate parental care in 2010 - 2015 drowned  27 children the age of 1 to 5. Lithuania takes the leading position by the number of drowning deaths in Europe. Many of these deaths can be avoided by proper public education.\r\n\r\nObjectives. The aim of our project is to gather more information about drowning and drowning prevention, to develop skills to rescue drowning victims. We are going to achieve it through visiting European organisations that successfully work in the field of drowning prevention and lifeguarding. Resultantly to prepare adapted drowning prevention, water safety and rescuing program for Lithuania on the basis of obtained new approach, knowledge and skills furthermore to introduce the new training course \"Be safe in the water\" for Lithuanians.\r\n\r\nParticipants. Participants of the project are two PI \"Svarbus zingsnis\u201d founders and first aid lecturers. We are the authors of the first-aid courses aiming to reduce the number of the sudden deaths that occur outside the hospital. We successfully organize this courses for already seven years, taking the leading role in the field.\r\n\r\nActivity description. To make a good analysis of the theoretical material about drowning and rescuing situation in Lithuania following by three mobility visits to the partner\u2019s organization for job shadowing and by two other  mobility visits we take courses for drowning prevention, drowning rescue and survival organised by partner\u2019s organization in order to gain practical work experience. After the visits we prepare adapted training program how to avoid drowning and how to help a drowning person for Lithuania and present it in the final event for parents raising minor children and in the article in our web page www.svarbuszingsnis.lt. \r\n\r\nThe final result of the project is the event for parents. It will be implemented on the basis of non-formal education for adults principles, using creative, unconventional techniques for presentation.\r\n\r\nResults, expected impact and potential long-term benefits of the project. \r\nThis project is conceived in order to raise drowning awareness, provide specific knowledge on how to avoid drowning, how to identify person who is drowning and how to help him. The project is expected to improve the drowning statistics in Lithuania and Europe.\r\nMobility participants expand their management, teaching, organizing knowledge and acquire new skills in the field of drowning prevention, which they will be able to use for various activities of \"Svarbus zingsnis\u201d organization.\r\nParticipating organization PI \"Svarbus zingsnis\u201d will be able to create the new drowning prevention \u201cBe safe in the water\u201d program as a result of participation in this project. Additionally, the comprehensive separate learning course, how to avoid drowning accidents and to help drowning victims, will be developed on the basis of this program. Also, \u201cBe safe in the water\u201d program will be added as a part of courses for parents and people working with children and the mandatory first aid courses, that PI \"Svarbus zingsnis\u201d currently organizes. This will contribute to the strategic PI \"Svarbus zingsnis\" development.\r\nParticipant of the project\u2019s final event, parents who raise minor children, will have an opportunity to get very important information about drowning and drowning statistics, prevention, how to identify the person who is drowning and how to help him. Also, they will have a chance to practice how to resuscitate a drowning victim on PI \u201cSvarbus zingsnis\u201d available equipment.", "http://www.rlss.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-LT01-KA104-034934_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B50"}
