We place great emphasis on improving the confidence and desire of our students to be unrestrained by self and locally-imposed barriers to their ambitions. Our aim is to encourage the personal mobility of students throughout Europe as a means of improving their life opportunities and enriching social integration.  \r\nUtilizing the previous  Leonardo da Vinci funding opportunities in past years to great effect, we are now hopeful of achieving similar success with the Erasmus+ programme. This bid is for Key Action 1 Mobility of Individual.  It is applying for participant numbers of IVT AND TRADES:  \r\n\u2022\t48 Level 3 Business Studies students;\r\n\u2022\t48 Level 3 Information Technology students;\r\n\u2022\t24 Level 3 Childcare students;\r\n\u2022\t20 Level 2 Engineering students; \r\n\u2022\t20 Level 2 Motor Vehicle students;\r\n\u2022\t24 Level 2 Hairdressing students;\r\n\u2022\t24 Level 2 Beauty students;\r\n\u2022\t24 Level 3 Travel and Tourism students;\r\n\u2022\t20 Level 1 Construction students; and\r\n\u2022\t20 Level 2 Construction students.\r\nThe overarching objective of this bid is to provide a coherent platform for participants to experience work placement in Germany, linguistic development, cultural awareness and improved motivation and self esteem.  The experience has the benefit of being able to fulfill major requirements of the Advanced Welsh Baccalaureate qualification that the participants are working towards and thus provides for formal qualification accreditation of many of the mobility action requirements.  \r\nThe AIM of the project is to offer two-week practical work experience in Germany. The visits will involve structured and accredited work experience with German companies to help the students prepare for the UK and European labour markets.  The project idea complies with Ldv Mobility National Priorities 2015 for both:\r\n1. Applications which primarily target participants who are facing particular difficulties in the labour market and\r\n2. Applications which work primarily with apprentices and which can evidence labour market/sectoral need for their support.\r\nThe mobilities are planned to take place between November 2015 and June 2017.\r\nNEEDS ADDRESSED:\r\n1. The target group lacks professional experience in European training institutions and employers for the work placement.\r\n2. The students\u00b4 poor linguistic proficiency in German will be improved, as the project will foster the learning of German (general and sector-related terminology).\r\n3.

The consortium, which consists of the Childcare and Education department and the upper secondary schools Rekarnegymnasiet, Rinmangymnasiet and S:t Eskils gymnasium, have previously had an Erasmus + KA1 VET project (2014-2016) and they also have an ongoing KA1 VET project (2016-2018). In these projects, the results have been very good and the cooperation with our partner organizations has expanded and deepened. Our goal and intention is to continue to develop this work so that more and more students have the opportunity to do training abroad because it leads to so many positive aspects.\r\n\r\nThis project includes the vocational programs Childcare, Health care, Restaurant, Trade (retail) and Administration, Vehicle maintenance and Transportation, Construction, Tourism as well as Hairdresser.   During 2018-2020, a total of 120 Students will do practical training at our partner organizations in Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Malta for 2-5 weeks. The training is consistent with the objectives of the different programs and courses and therefore the students gain more knowledge in their field. It gives the students an opportunity to practice what they learned at schools and at their local placements, but in a different context from what they are used to. Students will also be able to learn other methods or techniques, which they may not have learned at school or at their internship at home. They get a chance to discuss and compare what they learn. This is beneficial also to other students in the program because there is a large degree of dissemination of the students\u2019 experiences and knowledge once they come home.\r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the practical training abroad helps make the vocational programs more popular.  For many years Eskilstuna had a decreasing number of applicants for the vocational programs.  However, since 2016, we have seen a turnaround as many of the programs have received a larger number of applicants. It is important that this continues, because Eskilstuna and the rest of the country have a need for skilled labor.  \r\n\r\nThe training can also act as a motivator for students to attend classes and be responsible about the school work, and thus decrease the risk of their becoming drop-outs.  The experience strengthens the students and makes them more confident.  It contributes therefore to the students having the strength and ambition to finish their studies.    The students develop their problem solving skills, their ability to become responsible and their courage because they have to learn how to handle new situations and express themselves in a different language.  This is important for their future, for their ability to finish their studies and start new ones and also to find employment.  The youth unemployment rate of Eskilstuna is 15.5% and our goal is that the students will be more willing to commute and  look for work in other places, if needed- which is something they perhaps wouldn\u2019t have had the courage to do or wouldn\u2019t have thought of otherwise, if they hadn\u2019t done the training abroad.   \r\nDuring the training the students also develop their language ability (especially English) which is essential in a labor market which becomes more and more global, where companies need to have staff who can communicate with clients and other companies around the world.  \r\n\r\nOur municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, and the consortium has a need to always work with these issues, to increase the tolerance and and empathy for others.  The students\u2019 practical training in other European countries contributes to a larger intercultural understanding since they can experience a different culture and meet people of a different background than themselves.  It also contributes to an understanding for how it might feel to arrive in a foreign country, and to have difficultites expressing oneself.  There are many newly arrived studentens in our schools and our hope is that these training periods can contribute to a greater understanding for them and their situations.  \r\n\r\nThis project also includes job shadowing activities in France for 6 teachers at the Vehicle/Transportation program.  The teachers want to develop their language ability, discuss pedagogics, didactics, curriculum and lesson plans, and thus have an opportunity to get new ideas and inspiration, learn new techniques etc from a program similar to their own.  The teachers want to plan for further collaboration with the partner school, and this collaboration will be beneficial to the whole program.", "http://www.merthyr.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA102-038808_13"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CF48"}
