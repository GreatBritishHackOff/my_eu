The volunteers will be based in South Wales, and will be engaged in various different kinds of youth works with clubs and schools in the area. The projects will focus on themes such as cultural awareness, non-formal learning, community cohesion, land mangament, ICT and youth work.  All the projects will engage with young people in the South Wales area with a focus on promoting promoting diveristy and intercultural understanding. \r\n\r\nThe activities (EVS) will be long term (11 months) to allow the volunteers\u2019 time to really get involved with the Youth Centre & schools and the work that they do, as well as having the opportunity to develop their own personal projects. Through non-formal and informal learning methods the volunteers will increase their knowledge and experience in international youth work. The project will allow young people from Europe to interact, share ideas, exchange cultures and learn about each other in a safe and supportive environment.  The volunteers will be fully integrated into the activities of the hosting organisation and will be given the opportunities to focus on elements that most interest them and to develop new skills, experiences and knowledge that will enhance their employability and personal professional development.\r\n\r\nVolunteers will be encouraged to bring ideas and opinions from their countries of residence to the UK to share with each other, to break down international barriers, as well as take new ideas back to input into their society, thereby creating a wider European Community.\r\n\r\nAlongside their project work, the volunteers will also attend common days each month where they can share their experiences and participate in workshops and training focusing on diversity, racism, xenophobia, migration and active citizenship. Through the common day activities, the volunteers shall obtain tools and knowledge that they then bring back into the communities they are volunteering in to actively promote diversity and create more welcoming and open minded communities in South Wales.  This will promote active citizenship and will help to foster engagement in the local community whilst bringing to light both global and local issues.", "http://Merthyr.gov.uk", "UNA Exchange", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-035999_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CF48"}
