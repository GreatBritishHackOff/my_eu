It has a strong interest in developing the school library as a learning center and teaching information skills.  The school has hosted many international visitors including European assistant teachers and JobShadowing visitors. \r\n\r\nThe title of the project is \"The Skills of Tomorrow for the Children of Today\" which sums up the objectives quite well: the aim is to acquire skills and knowledge that enables teachers and school assistants to help our pupils as well as our whole organization gain the agility needed in the rapidly changing world.  \r\n\r\nThe development plan derives from the requirements of the new National Curriculum.  We have defined the following components being essential for the future skills:  \r\n1. Skills for international collaboration: languages, multiculturalism and cultural awareness\r\n2. Active citizenship and equal opportunities\r\n3. Learning to learn and being autonomous learner\r\n\r\nThe planned 12+4 mobilities take place during a period of 24 months. They are targeted to give added value to the development of the whole organization as well as the individual needs in professional development. According to our European Development Plan this grant will enable 10 teachers and 2 school assistants in teams of two or three to take part in 5 different professional development courses which were selected to meet our goals. The content of the intended  courses include: development of one's own language skills; digital tools and new methods in the classroom; teaching thinking skills and creativity, and how to prevent at risk and/or disadvantaged learners from being marginalized. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we have planned JobShadowing visits to two partner schools which have exemplary practices in our special interest areas: First, pupils' active citizenship at school (student councils and environmental work) and second,  developing school library as learning center.  We have already established collaboration with these schools and the school visits will further intensify the cooperation. Both visits will be carried out by two person teacher teams. \r\n\r\nWe expect that the well-being of the pupils and staff members will increase. Teachers will master new skills and methods that  improve their professional ability.  Pupils will gain skills needed in future.", "http://www.edenderryps.co.uk/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FI01-KA101-046802_1"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["3HA", "Work Routes", "REED IN PARTNERSHIP", null, "ESF", 343620.0, 859050.0, "esf_ni_107"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT32"}
