With rising energy prices and greater focus on energy efficiency the building sector offers the single largest potential for energy savings.  This is reflected in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, EPBD, 2002/91/EC. This Directive strongly encourages the use of passive heating and cooling techniques such as thermal mass in building construction and refurbishment. Passive techniques such as thermal mass offer the potential to save up to 50% of energy used in heating and cooling. However, there is a barrier to its effective implementation. In order for thermal mass to work effectively the concrete and brick surfaces must be in contact with ambient air and kept free of insulation, including conventional mineral wool type sound absorbers. The acoustics reverberations (echos) however caused by this can affect the health and work efficiency of inhabitants and in some severe cases rendering the building uninhabitable. Whilst there are some high end solutions to the problem, primarily thick polymer or metal panels, these are too expensive in all but high end applications. There is an urgent and growing need for a low cost, high performance acoustic absorber that allows thermal mass techniques to work effectively yet is at a price comparable to low end mineral wool solutions. The SMEs in this proposal have come together as a supply chain to develop just such a new type of sound absorber, for public and commercial non-residential buildings, Echo2eco. This solution will use an array of laser cut micro slits, of width 100 micron in 200 micron film.

An alternative solution for countering noise in buildings is micro-perforated panels, but they are too expensive for widespread use.\n\nHowever, a cost-effective sound-absorbing polymer film was developed under the auspices of the ECHO2ECO (A novel sound absorption technology to enable energy efficient construction techniques and promote the health and wellbeing of occupants) project. The film can solve problems associated with room acoustics and does not pose a barrier to the use of thermal mass in a building.\n\nThe ECHO2ECO initiative developed a new type of sound absorber for public and non-residential buildings. The low-cost, high-performance sound absorber comprises a 200-micron-thick polymer film with an array of laser-cut micro slits a mere 100\u00a0microns wide. The slits facilitate passive heating and cooling in buildings, and the material is translucent so that natural light can pass through it.\n\nResearchers investigated different polymer materials and conducted screening tests on a number of different polymers with regard to their physical and mechanical properties. Tests were also carried out to ensure that the material could be laser processed with no loss to the product's performance. Scientists studied different aspects of the laser machining process, including laser wavelength and power, material absorption, speed, and quality of cut or polymer formulation.\n\nKey acoustic dampening properties of the film were identified, modelled and tested. The different acoustic properties were successfully determined. Researchers also developed a number of experimental protocols for characterising prototype materials and carried out work to improve the performance of the film structure. The end result of the ECHO2ECO project was an extremely thin sound-absorbing film that can be applied to ceilings, walls and windows, and which can also improve energy use in buildings.\n\nThe EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) requires governments, designers and clients to take steps to reduce energy use. This includes the application of passive heating and cooling techniques such as thermal mass. Moreover, the EPBD states that attaining good energy performance must not compromise the quality of the indoor environment.\n\nThe polymer fill developed by ECHO2ECO will allow buildings to comply with these regulations by providing a low-cost solution for sound absorption in public and commercial buildings.

Earthquake Induced Liquefaction Disasters (EILDs) is responsible for tremendous amounts of the structural damages and fatalities; with experiences from recent events giving example of where approx. half of the economic loss was directly caused by liquefaction. Liquefaction is a phenomenon, with previously a low profile until recent earthquake events, in which the stiffness and strength of soil is reduced by seismic activity. With the causes of Liquefaction being known, it is important to recognize the factors that contribute to its occurrence; as well as the resulting hazards. The theory on how to address the subject has been comprehensive, as well as the engineering to reduce its consequences of liquefaction already developed; however, recent findings and advances need to be accurately examined in order to implement mitigation strategies practically. A systematic approach is needed for assessing the possibility of liquefaction on a site, prior to construction, then implementing the most appropriate liquefaction mitigation techniques. However, the variability of circumstances, invariably translates to multiple approaches of implementation, based on the susceptibility of the location to liquefaction, as well as the type and size of structure. The LIQUEFACT project addresses the mitigation of risks to EILD events in European communities with a holistic approach. The project not only deals with the resistance of structures to EILD events, but also, the resilience of the collective urban community in relation to their quick recovery from an occurrence.
