This school is unique in Austria regarding its curricular emphasis on economics and environmental issues, leading up to the A-level exams after 5 years of schooling. A further unique aspect, in addition to the curriculum, are voluntary additional qualifications, a tight co-operation with international schools and the local economy.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the five years, it is obligatory to do a three-month internship, in which the pupils have to gain practical experience in fields relating to the curriculum: laboratory work, office work, and production work. These internships can be done locally or abroad. In order to give all pupils, also those from financially weaker families, the chance to do their internship abroad, we are trying to get support from the Erasmus+ project. Regarding the partnership with Erasmus+, the HLUW can look back on years of successful co-operation comprising 11 Erasmus+ (and formerly Leaonardo) projects with 38 companies in 11 different countries.\r\n\r\nThis year, there are 11 pupils from our third form are hoping to realise their internships abroad with the help of Erasmus+. Suitable partner companies have been found in Ireland, Great Britain, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands. 9 of 11 pupils have already signed learning agreements with the partner companies at this moment of applying for support from Erasmus+ - thus enabling us to ensure a suitable quality of the internships.\r\n\r\nThe project always starts long before the application with informing the parents and pupils in September. After finding suitable partner companies, the framework of conditions is defined together. Yet also during the internship stay, we constantly try to maintainthe quality of the training by adopting parts of the ECVET. After constant supervision by a contact person, a Personal Transcript and a Europass are compiled.\r\nThe aim of the project is, for one, a further improvement of the competences required by our curriculum. Due to the wide scope of our curriculum, the practical emphasis in the various internships will vary, with this year\u2019s activities focussing on office tasks and science and sustainability. By doing the internship abroad, further aspects gain importance: improvement of linguistic competence (this year especially in the first foreign language English), improvement of personal and social competence (due to the need for acting independently abroad and organising a journey and stay without the immediate help of adults, as well as due to experiences with human resources management), increasing knowledge of different approaches to and ways of work and, quality management, and a strengthening of the idea of a common Europe. These diverse aspects are expected to increase the competitiveness and employability of our pupils and thus, indirectly, the competitiveness of Europe as a whole.\r\n\r\nBesides the positive effects on the pupils, the school itself and its partner companies are also expected to profit from the cultural and technical exchange, since international internships are supposed to increase the transfer of knowledge and thereby the quality of the training at our school as well as the competences within the partner companies. By the means of a thorough documentation of this project and the spreading to the knowledge about it (project reports, publication in the school yearbook and on the school\u2019s homepage as well as  - possibly - in local newspapers, project presentations to other pupils and their parents as well as a presentation of the results on our school\u2019s open doors days) the results of these projects and the idea behind Erasmus+ will be made more widely known.", "http://www.scouts.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-AT01-KA102-004792_4"], ["7QW", "London IRL", "The Scout Association", 23467.0, "Project is made by an english scout group and a Finnish youth organisation, whose members have scout background.

Improve the competences of managers in policy formulation and implementation 2. Empower individual consortium member organisations to support dyslexic and dyscalculic learners by equipping staff to use relevant tools, teaching strategies and materials.3. Develop the skills and ability of staff so they are able to engage and motivate learners to embrace digital learning including social media in learning, and their daily lives.4. Equip staff with the skills to embed the global dimension and reflect intercultural issues in teaching and learning,5.

The training course is dedicated to young spokespersons of youth organisations, treating topics connected to the field of external relations, media relations and public speakingThis project will help to strengthen the international dimension of the organisations involved, media literacy and intercultural competence of the participants. It will also prevent prejudices and stereotypes as the participants will be given the opportunity to share their own opinions and experiences. The project seeks to address the above mentioned issues, as well as the following needs:- enhance the visibility of youth organisations from rural areas, as they are lacking the skills and knowledge on how to pitch stories towards media and external partners;- support youth workers and young members in developing their knowledge on how to deliver coherent and solid messages that adhere to the real vision of their organisation- support youth organisations to reach out to young people from disadvantaged backgrounds or areas: they need to have access to this information and to know about the existence of such entities. The \u201cSpeak it Up!\u201d project is designed to help youth workers maximize opportunities to educate the media, gain visibility for their activities and learn how to communicate the vision and mission of their organisations to the external world.In line with this, the objectives of this project are as follows:O1.Increase the skills and capacities of young spokespersons in working with the media and external relations, and thus it increase their chances on the labour market;O2. Raise public awareness about specifics and challenges of youth work in all partner countries;O3. Increase competences of young spokespersons in establishing long-lasting and close relations with the media;O4. Enhance intercultural learning and understanding;O5.

Help ensure a consistent message related to youth work, its impact and the issues it is facing is delivered to the media so that it can be used to influence the public opinions and policies on education and youth work. In what concerns the impact on the participants, we expect to see that they will gain and/or improve their knowledge and skills in relation to external communication, public speaking and ethic in media relations (e.g. how to provide unbiased visibility to the activities of your organisation, how to deliver solid and newsworthy messages, how to fight stereotypes related to Scout activities) and how to raise public awareness on the value of youth organisations. The participants will grow as professional youth workers, who are aware of the impact on society their work can have and will be able to exert more self-reflection on their media relations. In what concerns the parnters, the participating organisations will get new experience of management of an international project and long-term cooperation of these organizations will be thus strengthened. Since the main target group of the project are young spokespersons, the expected long-term effect of the \u201cSpeak it Up!\u201d project is the achievement of an effective and newsworthy media coverage for youth organisations.

Its value is however increasing as we see young people becoming detached from their natural environment and facing more challenges with the traditional school system. Outdoor centers and non formal educators have a role to play in todays school system. The centers can provide an important connection with nature and a way for kids to reconnect. They can also provide traditional educators with training and tools so that they can better use non formal education to reach there students.The school camps and outdoor centers face a challenge today. They are few and far between which makes them isolated. To be able to  share ideas and grow there program they need to meet. The centers also need a platform to be able to share their knowledge outside there group. This project brings together the two elements. The first half of the project brings together outdoor and non formal educators from 5 different European countries. All the partners have a long history of outdoor education and non formal education but in their own setting. By bringing them together we are able to share knowledge and practices and make all the centers better. The second half of the project also puts a positive pressure on the first half. Because the partners are organizing a seminar for traditional educators from very different backgrounds (schools, play-schools, after school activities, higher education etc.) they have to focus their sharing in such a way that it would be beneficial to an outsider that can have little or no knowledge of outdoor or non formal education. This structures the conversation and makes the partners look at their work from a fresh perspective. The second half of the projects is a two day open seminar in outdoor education and non formal education. It brings together traditional educators and outdoor and non formal educators. The seminar will be a mix of lectures and workshops that will aim to bring outdoor and non formal education closer to the traditional school system. If the project is successful it can be a model for similar events in other European locations. The project will use non formal methods in planing and executing. Participants will take turns in directing workshops in the first and second half of the project. Each partner will sent 2-4 participants that will meat up with 10-12 participants from Iceland. The aim is to have 28 participants from 5 partners. In the second half of the project the participants will host and manage a two day walk in seminar for about 100 educators. The goal is both for the participants to practice their non formal eduction techniques and for the visiting educators to learn about non formal and outdoor education. The impact can be great for such a small project since the partners and participants directly engage with thousands of young people every year, from different backgrounds. But the potential is even greater since the second half of the projects gives the partners the opportunity to reach an even greater audience. With a positive impact on educators from the traditional school system the long term benefits can be great. Non formal education is not just something to use in the non formal setting.

The project will bring together 49 participants from 22 European countries,  with experience in this field, and 6 experts, plus a number of external speakers to share their experience and learn together. \r\nThe project aims to gather Scouts organisations from all over Europe that are having similar needs in order to share best practices and be trained on new tools and methodology existing in youth work and training area. They will be able to share experiences and learn from each other in an international environment, supported by experienced facilitators. \r\nDuring the four days of the event, the participants will follow an interactive programme. They will attend sessions where they would be given inputs that can be used as a knowledge/ discussion basis. They will then work in small groups to develop new ideas and approaches for the development of Rover/Venture programme schemes and curriculas. \r\nThe objectives of the \"Youth-led Youth Work\" seminar, stated below, come as an answer to the needs identified through previous consultations of National Scout Associations:\r\nFacilitate the sharing of best practices for youth yorkers in charge of developing Educational Programme for young people aged from 16 to 22 years old (Ventures and Rovers). (example of topics: quality of the educational programme, maximising youth engagement, develop initiative and entrepreneurship in the youth sector, diversity and inclusion etc.)\r\naddress the challenge of youth employability through the further dissemination of existing recognition and self assessment tools of the skills acquired in scouting. Work with participants to reflect on the needs of their organizations related to programme development for Rovers and Venturers and youth workers training (targeted at youth workers working with these age sections): Support the participants to translate those needs into action plans.\r\nexplore the impact of using e-learning tools in supporting the preparation of young people engaged in mobility projects in order to maximise the outcome of such enterprises\r\nexplore the possible answers that non-formal education can provide to youth workers in the area of diversity and inclusion through their work (immigration, minorities, rise of extreme right, ec.)\r\nFacilitate the development of new trans-national project and the future co-operation at European level\r\n\r\nThe profile of the participants is that of key youth workers (staff or volunteers) which are in charge of supporting the last age section (i.e. Rovers) and/or the 16 \u201318 age section (i.e. Venture Scouts) for the entire organisation. \r\n\r\nThe project has one main activity: the \"Youth-led Youth Work\" seminar. The seminar will take place in Zagreb, Croatia between 21-24 March 2019. Focusing on the quality and relevance of educational programmes proposed to young people aged 16 to 22, the seminar  will use non formal education methods such as: team-tasks, workshops, case studies, peer to peer learning, audio-visual presentations, a resource center, educational games, role-play and others to reach its objectives. \r\nThe foreseen results and outcomes the project cover the following: strong knowledge sharing between scouting organizations across Europe, recognition and validation of non-formal learning, introduction of new methods and tools in respect to the learning paths of Rovers and Venturers (e-learning, long-distance learning), increased quality in educational programmes for young people aged 16-22.", "http://www.scouts.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-HR01-KA105-047270_11"]]}}, "outwardCode": "E4"}
