The supply-side of seafood markets is limited from both sea fisheries and aquaculture. At the same time demand for seafood products is increasing. In a globalised economy, the conjunction of these two trends should generate high opportunities for any seafood production activity. However, both fisheries and aquaculture companies are facing key challenges, which currently hinder them reaping the full benefits of seafood markets expansion, and even question their sustainability. As a whole, the EU fisheries sector remains at low levels of profitability and sustainability. The SUCCESS project will examine two strategies to improve the competitiveness of the sector: (i) increasing demand for EU seafood products, especially improving the awareness of the advantages of European production (including sustainability requirements and adjustment to market evolution); and (ii) cost reduction in certain production segments. For both strategies development on world markets as well as consumer preferences and awareness will be analysed. Additionally, SUCCESS will explore the different sectors along the value chain (from fisheries and aquaculture producers via processing companies, wholesalers, retailers to direct marketing to mobile fishmongers and restaurants) and their potential for improvements in competitiveness. These analyses also include long term predictions about the viability of certain production systems and will be considered in specific case studies on for example mussel production, shrimp fisheries, whitefish, traditional pond aquaculture and new aquaculture production systems.", 127931.0, 4240446.0, "SUCCESS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_193322_951115750"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1DS", "G.A.L.I.L.E.O.: Getting Ahead in Language,ITC,Learning and European Opportunities -   The Key to Europe", "IBD Solutions Limited", 21018.0, "Project G.A.L.I.L.E.O is the outcome of careful examination of student results in the year 2012/13, from which emerges the need to develop new teaching methods to counteract demotivation, failure and early school leaving. Through international mobility our school plans to share innovative teaching methods with other European schools  and to implement existing practices. The aim is to develop and improve the professional and personal skills of our teachers, in particular by consolidating their linguistic proficiency in EU languages, by promoting an inclusion-oriented attitude, by enhancing the use of ICT in teaching and in transferring the knowledge, strategies and techniques acquired.\r\n\r\nThanks to the exchange of best practices and innovative teaching methods, as well as a better knowledge of European systems of work-related learning, the Vasari school plans to train a teaching staff who will disseminate the outcomes of the project activities across the school, locally and nation-wide. The participants will study school systems in which experiences regarding work and education are in perfect synergy in order to reproduce methods and benefits in our own school. For this reason it is necessary to improve the ability to relate to pupils and to help them develop their problem-solving skills, also through laboratory activities. The 8 European key skills will be implemented as well as ICT knowledge. By improving their proficiency in foreign languages, participants will be able to teach non-linguistic subjects in a foreign language, thereby enhancing CLIL teaching.\r\n\r\nThere will be a public notice of competition and a special Selection Committee, with representatives of the school,of the world of work and of the local institutions, will be set up. Eighteen teachers will be selected from various subject areas among those with experience in team work and in counteracting early school leaving. Priority will be given to permanent teachers who guarantee their presence for at least 3 years, in order to create a permanent project team. Each participant will study the Education System and the territory in which the partner school is located. Once abroad, the teacher will observe the best practices adopted to contrast failure and early school leaving to assess the results. According to the mobility agreement, a network among schools will be established, in which a permanent team will plan, learn and disseminate the new practices, using various tools of communication, both direct and online.\r\n\r\nThe impact expected on pupils is to improve learning, to reduce by 10% the number of failures (in 3 years), to put our students' competences and skills on level with those of Europe and those requested by employers. The best practices will be discussed and elaborated by all the teachers in the various workgroups of our school.

So far Sequa has always applied for the Leonardo funding for these projects though. The concept of the project provides four-week work placements for dual apprentices. Young skilled workers (in the first year after finishing the apprenticeship) or learners from classified professional training courses (during their training and in the first year after the final exam) will also be accepted but they will be the exception. The particpants will be learners from different professions (the majority admin-related). Most of them will be employed by member-companies of the IHK Siegen, we will accept exceptions though. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMobilities will be organized in groups or individually, we are planning to send 50 persons throughout the programme period. The participants will go through work-placements at mostly small or medium-size organizations in the Portsmouth region. Host companies will be provided by our British partner IBD. The accommodation will be organized with host families (half-board). IBD will also organize the introductory day (including city tour and cultural and work preparation) and will be supporting and monitoring the participants throughout their stay. The IHK Siegen as the sending institution will be responsible for the coordination and administration of the project.

We will also organize a preparational meeting and an evaluational meeting (including a Europass ceremony) at the Chamber. Throughout the project the IHK will be communicating continuously with the participants and the receiving partner. Each participant will sign a contract including a learning agreement which will contain the training programme. The learning agreement will also be signed by the receiving organization. Ways to communicate with the participants and partner during, before and after the project will be by phone, email or personally. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dissemination of the project results will mainly be based on press work, the Chamber magazine, personal contacts with employers, schools and apprentices and informative meetings. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of our project are: The participants should improve their personal, intercultural and language skills in order to improve their position on the job market.

They can also contribute to enhance the image of the participating company which helps to arouse the interest of potential apprentices. On the other hand it is a fact that a lot of our local companies, especially the smaller ones, tend to make use of these advantages only if there is a concrete offer like our project to organize and finance these measures. Participating companies will also benefit from qualifying their junior employees for international tasks. Export forms a great part of the activities of our local businesses. Employees who are able to deal with international clients and suppliers in a professional way are an important asset for their employers. In the long run we aim at contributing to a growing culture of mobility in Vocational Educational Training.

Integration and implementation of work-based learning into the school curriculum is one of the most important step to a successful professional life. The workplace offers diverse and rich learning opportunities that enable learners to develop their skills, knowledge and competences that they need to become fully qualified and flexible professionals. Vocational education needs to adapt to the situation on a labour market. It should offer students not only options for better employment chances, but it should also motivate them for a further study. There is no doubt that internationalisation influences our lives in many ways and so it should be implemented in vocational education too. That\u00b4s why we feel extremely important to develop international cooperation between institutions and encourage new approaches to teaching, learning and training with the emphasize on foreign languages and practical skills. We would like to offer vocational education that is built on quality, relevance and attractiveness. The main objectives of this project is through a traineeship in companies enable our students to develop their personalities and improve their professional skills and abilities that are necessary for their future working lives. \r\n\r\nBy developing this project we would like to fulfill the following objectives:\r\n\r\n- to improve the quality and efficiency of vocational education and to enhance its attractiveness and relevance\r\n\r\n- to promote and increase mobility in Europe\r\n\r\n- to enhance creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship\r\n\r\n- to promote equity, social cohesion and active citizenship\r\n\r\n- to use and promote European transparency tools such as ECVET and Europass \r\n\r\n- to give an international dimension to the learning content\r\n\r\n- to promote studying foreign languages, especially English\r\n\r\nThe target group of this project are the students of ICT field - computer network mechanic, economic informatics.

We have about 120 students of ICT field in our school and we are planning to send 60 students for traineeship abroad within this project. The graduate of ICT field is a qualified worker who has the knowledge and skills in the field of management and transmission of information, use of information technology, hardware, computer software and computer networks. Graduates are able to work independently as well as in a team. Their knowledge and skills are to use not only for the operation of the equipment for the processing of information, proposals and implementation of communication systems, but also to make diagnosis and check or repair defects and deficiencies on the devices. They have knowledge in the field of business, management and marketing too so after graduating they are well prepared for starting their own business. The graduates have a wide professional profile with the necessary general education and practical and professional skills and abilities. \r\n\r\nThe participants involved in the project focus in their study and practical training on the knowledge and skills in the field of ICT hardware, , software and computer network. They specialize in working with networks according to requirements and configuration as well as PC upgrading, diagnostics and repair, installation of operating systems, setting up the environment. During their study they devote to the protection and security of PC installation and supply management, data design and installation of PC networks and subnets. They are also taught to use alternative operating systems (Linux), advanced use of Office (office, OpenOffice), algorithm and programming (Pascal, Delphi, C), working with graphic and design software (AutoCad).

Furthermore a second activity is to send 5 teachers of our own company or cooperative enterprises abroad for the purpose of teaching, job shadowing or company visits.\r\nParticipants of both activities receive their scholarship after receiving their application documents and having an interview with them. While teachers (personal mobility) organize their stay abroad mostly themself, the trainees are prepared (together with the training managers) in individual talks about the content and organization of the stay abroad. In collaboration with partner organizations in the target countries suitable placements are searched, stays at the destination organized and support ensured. The trainees are supervised in the placement companies of training managers who accompany the content and technical progress of trainees and evaluate it. The students continue their record books during the internship  and at the end of their stay abroad they create a final report that is used for the evaluation and dissemination of project results. The teachers / training manager who go abroad with the people mobility, will plan and organiz their activities usually by there own in accordance with the agreement of the company. This can be lectureships, company visits, internships, job shadowing etc. After the return of the participants they will write a final report and judge their stay abroad in a feedback session with the Academy of Economics. During the implementation of the activities, the Academy of Economics will follow the steps described before: Application - Selection and Information - Preparation - Implementation - Monitoring - Evaluation. The measures for unforeseen situations and of quality assurance are integrated in the sequence.\r\nThe financial management of project funds will be managed by the Academy of Economics Schleswig-Holstein, which is set up for this purpose a particular cost unit. The payment of project funds takes place by the Academy of Economics Schleswig-Holstein. The software provided by the managing national and European authorities of the ERASMUS program based systems for payment of the project, participants collection and maintenance / reporting, Euro CV and Euro mobility pass passport is used during the implementation of the project.\r\nTrainees and employees of companies should improve their own linguistic, social, intercultural and technical skills to the effect compared to Europe to be more open and internationalize more their own thinking and acting. The impact on the daily work will result into the fact that companies will focus even more international, remain competitive and develop common standards, which are aced with Europe-wide. The activities which include trainees with disabilities should lead diversity in workforce planning of companies into a more important role.", "http://www.ibdpartnership.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-002063_9"], ["1DS", "We can and we will", "IBD Solutions Limited", 34320.0, "WCAWW is a mobility project that provides two weeks traineeships for 16 recent graduates from Macedonia in three partner organizations from Portugal, UK, Greece and Croatia.

The trainings range from the 9th grade to the HND.\r\nWe are actively taking part in the international field.\r\nIn 2008, we opened a European branch for two main reasons. First, we were aware of the necessity to bring back together our students and the learning of foreign languages, especially English. Also, we felt the need to offer them a window on the world.\r\nConsequently, a group of teachers and the board of directors decided to enrol in a mobility approach. Since 2009, we successfully carried out several mobility projects.\r\n- 5 \u201cL\u00e9onardo\u201d,\r\n- 6 \u201chosting a Comenius assistant\u201d two effective hosts,\r\n- 1 \u201cComenius multilateral\u201d with one visit to study the project, \r\n- 1 \u201cComenius teacher mobility\",\r\n- several trips to England and Ireland,\r\n- 2 partnerships with American high schools,\r\n- exchange of trainees (Sweden, Norway).\r\nWe got more and more organised and structured : an international team of about 20 persons was formed, with a consistent assignment of tasks, according to each person\u2019s skills and wishes. This sharing of tasks is visible on an organization chart. Also, we have created a working schedule based on our previous experiences and this programme constitutes our guide for the school year.\r\nRegarding our investment and the continually growth of our actions, our headmaster appointed a referent for the mobilities and granted 5 hours a week for this person. He also provided the team an office with a computer and a phone.\r\n\r\nThanks to our experience, we know that we can trust the seriousness and the efficiency of our partners who are with us from the beginning of this adventure. However, we are constantly trying to improve our existing collaborations and we are always looking for new partners.\r\nThe mobilities are intended for the first-year-students who joined the \u2018European section\u2019 of our school for the school years 2014 or 2015. The number is estimated at 63. These volunteers have 2 more hours a week in their timetable : one hour for an English class and one hour for the Non linguistic subject. Therefore they practise their English more intensively and they are more sensitive to the international opening. Most of the time, they are not familiar with trips abroad and often they are not very academic so they live up this experience as a real opportunity which leaves a long-term mark.\r\nAs they are in a vocational school, they must undergo several periods of work placements. We thought it would be interesting for them to experience an immersion through a work placement in a company related to their studies. The 2nd year is the most appropriate moment, for they would have gained the professional autonomy necessary to work.\r\n\r\nGenerally we organized this mobility on 5 weeks (3 in Norway), including a period of adaptation to their new environment. The participants will attend language lessons: about a dozen of initiation hours, either within our school, before the mobility (for the Norwegian and Swedish partnerships) or on site (for the other partners) so that our students get familiar with the technical English they will need during their work placement. We encourage them to open up to the host culture (visit museum, take part to different events such as Easter...). Then, they rapidly integrate the company which was attributed according to their professional field, curriculum vitae and cover letter. Then, they must fit in the working team, do the tasks expected by the tutor and the teacher.\r\n\r\nWe aim at several objectives but the main ones are focused on our pupils.

A direct benefit arising from the training of the administrative staff will enable the Institute to exploit better models and best practices used in Europe but adapted to the local context. Besides, an improvement of the language, communication and management skills will enhance a major awareness about cultural diversities as an enriching opportunity leading to w renewed collaborative spirit towards foreign partners.On a long-term view, it is noteworthy mentioning that a modernized teaching system with positive repercussions on the educational and training offer will lead to cause benefits on the preparation of the students themselves that will show more developed skills that are in line with the demand of the labour market, that shows to have a more competitive profile (combining both theoretical and practical knowledge) and that are willing to travel and work in European contexts whether for studying or working (thanks to the improved language skills).

The selection of the participants is carried out in close cooperation with the training places and the vocational school and happens in several stages.A learning agreement between trainee, training place and work placement abroad must be agreed and signed by each party. Monitoring with questionnaires, weekly reports, feedback meetings and regular conversations with the participants and the hosting organization are the basis for our process and to ensure quality during the whole project period.

Many different developments mean that the European and international markets continues to grow together. In the future, more and more small and medium-sized companies are required to act in the international / European market.To obtain these competencies as an educational institution at this level or rather develop, measures are to be planed and conducted in medium- and long-term; measures to increase employee skills (social, technical, methodological, language skills, etc.) in their own companies and foreign companies, wishing to acquire international experience in the learning mobility. Trainees from the commercial sectors need for their daily dealings with customers increasingly knowledge of foreign languages, intercultural skills and a particularly high mobility readiness. Both from the perspective of companies which are active in international markets, as well as from the professional perspective of trainees, the need arises to acquire these skills. In this two-year project 75 trainees in total from the companies described above (increased from rural areas) should be mediated in appropriate internships directly or through our partner organizations. As in the former project we want to give apprentices to disabled persons (in total 2, one apprentice for seriously disabled person). Participants receive their scholarship after receiving their application documents and having an interview with them. In collaboration with partner organizations in the target countries suitable placements are searched, stays at the destination organized and support ensured. The trainees are supervised in the placement companies of training managers who accompany the content and technical progress of trainees and evaluate it. The students continue their record books during the internship  and at the end of their stay abroad they create a final report that is used for the evaluation and dissemination of project results. After the return of the participants they will write a final report and judge their stay abroad in a feedback session with the Academy of Economics. During the implementation of the activities, the Academy of Economics uses a project management tool to plan and control the following steps described before: Application - Selection and Information - Preparation - Implementation - Monitoring - Evaluation. This leads to a target-oriented project management which integrates measures for unforeseen situations and quality assurance. The financial management of project funds will be managed by the Academy of Economics Schleswig-Holstein, which is set up for this purpose a particular cost unit. The payment of project funds takes place by the Academy of Economics Schleswig-Holstein. The software systems provided by the managing national and European authorities of the ERASMUS+ program for accounting of the project, participants registration and maintenance, reporting, Europass-CV and Europass mobility are used during the implementation of the project. Trainees of companies should improve their own linguistic, social, intercultural and technical skills to the effect compared to Europe, to be more open and to be more internationalize in thinking and acting. The impact on the daily work will result into the fact that companies will focus even more international, remain competitive and develop common standards to act Europe-wide.

The partners of the project (IHK Siegen/Germany, The IBD Partnership/UK) have already been working together successfully on similar projects in the past. So far Sequa has always applied for the Leonardo funding for these projects though. The concept of the project provides four-week work placements for dual apprentices. Young skilled workers (in the first year after finishing the apprenticeship) or learners from classified professional training courses (during their training and in the first year after the final exam) will also be accepted but they will be the exception. The particpants will be learners from different professions (the majority admin-related). Most of them will be employed by member-companies of the IHK Siegen, we will accept exceptions though. Mobilities will be organized in groups or individually, we are planning to send 60 persons throughout the programme period. The participants will go through work-placements at mostly small or medium-size organizations in the Portsmouth region. Host companies will be provided by our British partner IBD. The accommodation will be organized with host families (half-board). IBD will also organize the introductory day (including city tour and cultural and work preparation) and will be supporting and monitoring the participants throughout their stay. The IHK Siegen as the sending institution will be responsible for the coordination and administration of the project. We will also counsel the apprentices and their German supervisors, we will select and prepare the participants. We will also organize a preparational meeting and an evaluational meeting (including a Europass ceremony) at the Chamber. Throughout the project the IHK will be communicating continuously with the participants and the receiving partner. Each participant will sign a contract including a learning agreement which will contain the training programme. The learning agreement will also be signed by the receiving organization. Ways to communicate with the participants and partner during, before and after the project will be personally,  by phone or email.The dissemination of the project results will mainly be based on press work, the Chamber magazine, personal contacts with employers, schools and apprentices and informative meetings. The main objectives of our project are: The participants should improve their personal, intercultural and language skills in order to improve their position on the job market. We also feel that mobility of young people contributes to a positive attitude towards Europe and improves their relations with foreigners. For our regional companies mobility projects become a more and more important way to improve the quality and attractiveness of the dual apprenticeship system. They can also contribute to enhance the image of the participating company which helps to arouse the interest of potential apprentices. On the other hand it is a fact that a lot of our local companies, especially the smaller ones, tend to make use of these advantages only if there is a concrete offer like our project to organize and finance these measures. Participating companies will also benefit from qualifying their junior employees for international tasks. Export forms a great part of the activities of our local businesses. Employees who are able to deal with international clients and suppliers in a professional way are an important asset for their employers. In the long run we aim at contributing to a growing culture of mobility in Vocational Educational Training.

During the following years, we would like to expand this project as you can read in our European Development Plan.In our priority plan we want to focus mainly on the training of skills needed to function and thrive in an increasingly flexible labor market. These attitudes and competences will be an essential factor  throughout the entire school curriculum. Planned activitiesDe project will be supported by a team in which each member has their own task (dossier, budget, internal and external communication, marketing and PR, press\u2026). The leading  partner in this venture will get a free hour to dedicate fully to the project.  The people responsible will present this project to the students\u2019 at the end of their fifth year. Students can choose whether they want to take part. Prospective participants are to apply (written and orally) and will be selected according to motivation and qualification. The chosen students will prepare this internship  intensely over a longer period of time. Our current contacts and partner companies abroad have proven themselves to be very helpful over the last few years and will remain very important in this process. Results and impact from this programTime and time again, we have noticed the benefits from an internship abroad. It builds confidence and independency and prepares them excellently for higher education and professional life. All players in this project will be assessed and interviewed, both personally and online. We will digitalize these results and process them statistically. This will give us a convenient manual for colleagues within our school community \u00e0nd later generations who want to venture abroad. The results will also be communicated externally through press releases and study days. To optimalize the project we will screen the results in an objective way as we want our students to become real entrepreneurs. We are often contacted by former students of our school to help them with their Erasmus internship in college.http://sui.campussintursula.be/", "http://www.ibdpartnership.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-BE02-KA102-017206_1"], ["1DS", "EMTK \u00f5pir\u00e4nded Euroopasse", "IBD Solutions Limited", 46500.0, "Estonian Massage and Therapy School (EMTS) with the legal name M.I.

Since the autumn of 2016 we receive students with special educational need (dysgraphia, dyslexia, hearing problems). As of 1.01.2016 there are 161 students and 29 teachers.The international cooperation with foreign partners started in 2012, when students had practice abroad in a spa in Switzerland, and has developed further on every year. Since 2013 we have organised mobilities within the framework of life-long learning program supported by Archimedes Foundation and carried out successful cooperation with partners in different European countries. In 2013 we organised 5 mobilities for 10 teachers of EMTS into 5 European countries within the framework of Leonardo da Vinci program and one mobility for 2 teachers to Iceland within the Nordplus Adult program. In 2014 we received a grant from  Archimedes Foundation for a 2-year Erasmus+ mobility project, during which 14 students went to 7 countries and 6 employees to two countries. The 2-year project \u201cMobility in Europe of  M.I. Massaa\u017eikool \u201d is in progress during which 12 students are going to five European countries. Today we have partners and  practice bases in Malta, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Germany, Cyprus, Greece, the UK and Iceland. The goals of the current project \"EMTS\u2019s Mobilities in Europe\" are based on the strategy of the school\u2019s development plan, which foresees among other things the development of students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 international mobilities, cooperation networks and the development of the curriculum and guaranteed flexible learning possibilities.The participation in the project enables to improve the learning process in EMTS and the implementation of the ECVET system used all over Europe.  Via the expansion of international cooperation we support the principles of students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 life-long learning and develop the acquisition of professional skills. We want to find innovative opportunities of carrying out practice and develop cooperation with the current foreign partners.  The achievement of the project goals and the acquisition of new skills enhance the sustainability of the school. During the project from 2016-2018 we intend to send 13 massage/spa therapy students, 3 students with special educational needs, 8 PTA/massage students to mobilities in Malta, Spain, Italy, Portugal and the UK.  We are planning to send  2 EMTS teachers to teach in  Malta.EMTS student mobilities last 14 or 30 days. Massage and spa therapy students are going to stay in the institution providing massage service and treatments, become familiar with the efficiency, local standards, the administration of the structure unit pursuant to the service and together with the team while working as a massage or spa therapist. The PTA-s are going to stay in the rehabilitation institution and help the physiotherapists to assist rehabilitation procedures.Teachers\u2019 mobility lasts for 1 week. Our 2 teachers are going to teach Thai orthopaedic massage, kinesiology and manual muscle testing at partner\u2019s school in Malta.The students obtain experience by working in a multi-cultural environment; develop their professional competencies and self-discipline, punctuality in the performance of their work assignments, foreign language skills, analytical skills and tolerance. The obtained skills enable the students to acquire learning outcomes on the international level, (via the implementation of  ECVET system) and enjoy the advantages when competing at the international job market.  The EMTS teachers improve their professional skills via teaching in English and working within an international environment in order to ensure the sustainability, develop as a person, become more self-confident, more motivated and tolerant.As project result the obtained experience, knowledge, skills and the new ideas are implemented in practice and in the educational process of teaching the massage/spa therapy students and PTA-s.   Also  the curriculum of massage therapy and teaching process for students with special educational needs are developed. Conditions are created for  PTA-s to complete the practice abroad, which broadens the learner\u2019s general knowledge in regard to the possibilities, the content and the quality of the physiotherapy service. The project results enhance further cooperation between different massage schools, spa and rehabilitation centres on international level. The teachers exchange from different schools is going to be more active.

The adverse demographic development  and lack of interest in studying especially in technical schools leads  to the fact, that pupils with weaker academic results are accepted, and usually with inadequate knowledge and skills. They lack the ability to think creatively and logically present context. In the group there are also students from the Roma ethnic group who live in disadvantaged environment and do not have suitable conditions to prepare for teaching at home. That has an impact on early school leaving. The competencies of our teachers are good, most of them completed training for the use of various modern technologies in teaching.

Pupils in concrete and lucrative realities will get more familiar with the most important rules applicable to artistic creation  in a certain period of time and some marginal areas.This will enable them to better understand the architectural disposition, plan and altitude range of constructions , arrangement volume, mass or composition. We want the students of the  graphic digital media sector to focus mainly on working with different application software for creating graphics, websites, editing photos, videos and electronic publications. The students of the mechanic electrician sector will focus on improving their knowledge in the field of design, production and testing of printed circuits, programming of the machines etc.Students of the branch of car mechanic  will focus on basic activities like the assembly and disassembly of motor vehicles, for example. gear, exchange cylinder head, steering and braking systems. The school wants to help to deepen , improve the  training and the preparatione of its students by involving them in the project. For success at work, but also in life, in addition to professional knowledge and skills it is often important to an individual's ability to work well and communicate with other people.The mobility of pupils  enables the students  not only to learn about modern technologies, workflows, but they will  gain a realistic attitude to  solving problems and to adapt to a foreign work environment.

The project is understood as one of the ways how to make the whole educational and pedagogical process more effective and how to help our future graduates to start their professional career and personal development.Under the terms of free labour market in the EU, those internships abroad are a significant contribution which can enable our students while seeking and applying for jobs in other member EU countries, and at the same time it gives them the first opportunity to use their Europasses and ECVET.All conclusions of ECVET are implemented on all project processes.", "http://www.ibdpartnership.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-CZ01-KA102-022966_1"], ["1DS", "Jedeme na praxi do Anglie a Irska", "IBD Solutions Limited", 78439.0, "The project will enable the pupils of our school to gain work experience in companies and organizations in England and Ireland.

The students taking part in the internships will be from all the three fields of study taught at the school, i.e. Business Academy, Economic Lyceum, and Public Administration. For this reason we are going to place the students into companies focusing on production, business, and services; also in governmental and financial institutions, social security administration and other public administration institutions. The internships abroad will result in students' improvement of their specialized and language competence and the students will learn about the running of firms and companies in one of the EU countries and this knowledge they will take advantage of in their future job.The project objective , as far as teachers are concerned, is improvement in the quality of teaching the specialized subjects in our school and adaptation to the international job market requirements.

Activity A3 is especially devoted to the students of the last year in business and administration, who did not succeed in their final practical exam (Projet Int\u00e9gr\u00e9 Final - PIF): the LN offers them the possibility to do an internship abroad to improve both their language and practical knowledge and prepares them for the second session of the final exam.PHILOSOPHY OF THE PROJECTThe huge demand in the labour market together with the growing internationalization of our national companies, make it very important for schools to promote European student exchanges to encourage their students to become more flexible and open-minded. With this project, these young people who will soon enter a labour market marked by a large and aggressive competition, are incited to try a new experience outside their familiar environment. Staying abroad on their own favours their personal development and makes them become more independent and self-confident. The fact of having been abroad for an internship can also be very profitable for the students in their further job application. They have to learn to work in a group and become a team-player; both qualities that are often demanded by employers. It shows employers that they are uncomplicated, committed and flexible.Activity A3 is especially devoted to those, who are tempted to resign their studies because they failed their final exams. By doing an internship abroad, students shall be motivated for a retry. The internship also enables them to get a good practice of what is really demanded by a secretary or an employee in a company. They are able to put the theory learnt during their lessons in school into practice.The obtained competences and abilities are certified by a national certificate as well as by the delivery of the Europass- mobility.Every partner for this project is also trying to- organize cultural and social activities,- organize visits of the regional area and its touristic attractions,- organize meetings between the student\u2019s school and the partner schoolsThe constant search of new partners for this project, as well as the close cooperation between schools and professional partners \u2013 as it is not only about the simple exchange of students for an internship - is another aim of this project and favours the collaboration between experts of the professional world and school.AIMS OF THE PROJECTThe internship gives the students the possibility to- improve their language skills,- make them aware of the importance of practical experience and international flexibility in the pursuit of an employment,- make them more flexible and open to the world,- improve their team-spirit in an international working-environment- discover other countries, languages, ways of life and culture,- improve their communication skills and develop their personality,- grow in experience.WHEN DO THE EXCHANGES TAKE PLACE?STUDENTS A1 (6 weeks): - 12th class of the Business and administration section (professional): January/February- 13th class of the Business and administration section (professional): May/June , - 11th and 13th class of the ICT and Computer technologies section (professional) January/February, TEACHERS A2:- Visit in autumn 2016 in Presov/Slovakia to organize the activities of this project, - Job shadowing of companies where students are doing an internship,- Meetings with other teachers of our partner schools in Halle, Lappeenranta, Strasbourg, Bastogne, Martigues, Presov. - Job Shadowing in the partner companies of the aforementioned schools.

The project meets the need to improve the students\u2019 professional skills through 1 \u2013month  traineeships abroad in companies operating in the field of urban and territorial regeneration (innovative technologies and materials for planning, sustainable mobility, energy saving, cultural and social participation and integration, knowledge sharing).\r\nIn fact the applicant consortium seeks to raise the students\u2019 professional skills (in the fields of digital technologies, urban development, chemistry, environment) and to reinvest such competences/smart skills in the innovation process that involves territorial and urban regeneration. The Abruzzo region is undergoing major changes (hydrogeological risk, weakening of the road network and public and private buildings) with a progressive fragility of production and social systems. This  is leading to a redefinition of the traditional designing and urban planning systems. In order to face such change, qualified young human resources are needed.  The  work experience through traineeships in foreign companies, provided for in the \u201cTo Be Smart\u201d project , has been designed to facilitate the development of language and professional skills, and to enhance the underway processes of urban and territorial regeneration . The project promoting Consortium acknowledges the pillars which the EU has placed in the Agenda 2020 and  implements them offering to the Mobility beneficiaries the opportunity to support the development of smart, sustainable and inclusive communities. Through the TO BE SMART project, the Consortium, in line with the objectives of the Erasmus plus and with the objectives of the European Strategy 2020, intends to: 1) contribute to reduce the rate of youth unemployment, 2) increase the employability of young people both in Italy and abroad, 3) raise the quality of professional resources that operate in the sector of technological innovation, 4) encourage  investments of human resources in the research and development field 5) reduce the rate of early school leavers 6) increase the fight against poverty and social exclusion in Abruzzo and in the wider national and European context.

The economic and geographic characteristics are the same in all the territory. It is an area supplied with interesting features: its natural landscapes  (e.g. the mountains overlooking the sea), its wide range of 20 DOP and IGP products, that is the highest at a national level,  its strategic position close to the best artistic towns of  Tuscany, reachable in less than an hour. Despite this, tourism is not so diffuse and the main kind of tourism activity is related to the sea and the beaches, while the number of farm stays is the lowest of Tuscany. Obviously, the territory needs to be adequately protected but it is also necessary an important action to promote and enhance it. However, this area presents different problems and weaknesses connected to the environment: the unsustainable development, based on a bad extraction of the marble, the abandonment of outlying areas, although their great historical interest, the climatic changes and the particular morphology that amplifies the effects of atmospheric agents (e.g. floods).\r\nStarting from this context, the project is addressed to 90 students of 6 High Schools related to the agricultural and tourist sector, located in the Bioregion of Alpi Apuane (15 participants per school). Participants must be enrolled in the last year of school or graduated within 12 months after graduation.\r\nThe project aims to transfer the right skills to improve and protect the environment, providing a good option to the current development model.

In addition, a recent study by Eurostat points out that  the creative ability of a company is inversely correlated to the  age of its employees. The under-40 produce about the 70 percent of innovations. In line with the demands of the market and the reform of the educational system that imposes a growing bond between schools and businesses, the Lepido Rocco always develops close cooperation and strict relations with the world of work and in particular with the companies of reference of its based  students, many of which have foreign branches. The participation of entrepreneurs in defining and planning of training promotes the desired continuous modernization of the offered profiles. Businesses often complain of young people, their lack of flexibility and adaptability, entrepreneurship and personal autonomy. The project EN.PASS therefore assumes great importance since it allows beneficiaries to a direct comparison with situations linguistically, culturally and technologically different from their local context stimulating their curiosity and self-study, in an international dimension. The opportunity to experience completely new experiences even in terms of personal commitment, is a unique opportunity for the 150 students: it will substantially affect on their future professional life, given their location in an area (particulary VENETO-FVG-SICILIA Region), subject to strong pressures for change and in need of new ideas and initiatives which are geared to sustainable development model. Today, the young must be Industrial, capable of fitting in different realities, very productive and characterized by a rapid evolution, both from a technological point of view and of the organization of work. \"Emotional intelligence: Is what the companies really  need\".

Practical training of the learners and trainees, as well as the professional development and growth of the staff are the priorities set by IVVEC.  We have set the task to be trainee-focused and we wish to study the best practices. The HR policy at IVVEC supports learning both in Estonia and abroad. Our staff members analyze their work at the end of a school-year and plan their learning activities according to their needs. Traditionally individual meetings are held by the school administration with each of the staff, where they discuss the plans and needs for retraining and advancement. A training program is made up at IVVEC every school-year. The participation of the staff in EU mobilities is vastly supported by the school administration. IVVEC has long-term international experience in organizing mobilities for both staff and learners.  \r\nThe objective of the project is to implement a two-year project of high-quality mobilities which will enable the learners and staff of IVVEC to be more competitive. Both in Estonia and abroad the Centre will be positioned as one offering the best learning conditions to students and supporting the professional growth of its staff. Besides, the international cooperation grows more active.      \r\nThe learners, participating in the project, are the best second- and third-year students in 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 academic years in the following vocations: multimedia, junior software developers, IT system specialist, chef, pastry-chef, tourism management, carpenter, welder, machine-tool worker, electrician, auto technician, mechatronic, automatic, finishing works in construction, hair-dresser, logistics. 110 trainees are placed for practice at enterprises, 38 trainees \u2013 at VET schools and 38 VET workers will go learning / job-shadowing at the partner schools and companies. The partners for this application are in the following states: Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Sweden, the UK, Hungary, Germany, Portugal, France, Austria, Spain and Slovenia. IVVEC has cooperated with most of the partners for many years.   \r\nThe preparation of the project has been carried out by a project team who has worked very closely and intensively with the partner organizations. The project application has been prepared in cooperation with the partners and the mobilities have been planned in accordance with their best learning conditions.\r\nThorough planning definitely serves a solid ground for successful project implementation. If funding granted, the project management team will be made up to implement the project in cooperation with the partners. The selection of the best candidates is carried out in accordance with the special procedure adopted at IVVEC. The staff members have already expressed their wish to study abroad. All the activities are documented which also guarantees the project implementation in case of unexpected changes in the project management team.\r\nThe opportunity to undertake independently a training placement abroad for students who come to study at IVVEC after both basic and secondary schools, enables them to grow more competitive both in Estonian and European job markets and gain more foreign language skills. The opportunity to have a practice placement abroad motivates the first- and second-year students to study harder. The knowledge and skills of the participating staff grows as well as their competence in advancing the apprenticeship system at IVVEC, which definitely have positive effect on the learners' motivation to study and reducing the drop-out rate.  Being abroad the participants have a great opportunity to get acquainted with foreign culture which brings to higher tolerance and respect towards it.   \r\nAll the mobility participants are issued a Europass Mobility and all the learning outcomes and assessments in different learning environments are taken into account and properly registered at IVVEC.\r\nThe successful international projects and their implementation make vocational education more popular in the region, creates a solid ground to raise the quality of education and attract more basic school graduates to study at IVVEC.

This enables them to get a better view of what their students are doing during their internship and so they can adapt their courses to the real practice in companies.

This makes theory come closer to reality. \r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHY OF THE PROJECT\r\n\r\nThe huge demand in the labour market together with the growing internationalization of our national companies, make it very important for schools to promote European student exchanges to encourage their students to become more flexible and open-minded. \r\n\r\nWith this project, these young people who will soon enter a labour market marked by a large and aggressive competition, are incited to try a new experience outside their familiar environment. Staying abroad on their own favours their personal development and makes them become more independent and self-confident. \r\n\r\nThe fact of having been abroad for an internship can also be very profitable for the students in their further job application. They have to learn to work in a group and become a team-player; both qualities that are often demanded by employers. It shows employers that they are uncomplicated, committed and flexible.\r\n\r\nThe obtained competences and abilities are certified by a national certificate as well as by the delivery of the Europass- mobility.\r\n\r\nEvery partner for this project is also trying to\r\n- organize cultural and social activities,\r\n- organize visits of the regional area and its touristic attractions,\r\n- organize meetings between the student\u2019s school and the partner schools\r\n\r\nThe constant search of new partners for this project, as well as the close cooperation between schools and professional partners \u2013 as it is not only about the simple exchange of students for an internship - is another aim of this project and favours the collaboration between experts of the professional world and school.\r\n\r\nAIMS OF THE PROJECT\r\n\r\nThe internship gives the students the possibility to\r\n- improve their language skills,\r\n- make them aware of the importance of practical experience and international flexibility in the pursuit of an employment,\r\n- make them more flexible and open to the world,\r\n- improve their team-spirit in an international working-environment\r\n- discover other countries, languages, ways of life and culture,\r\n- improve their communication skills and develop their personality,\r\n- grow in experience.\r\n\r\nWHEN DO THE EXCHANGES TAKE PLACE?\r\n\r\nSTUDENTS A1 (6 weeks): \r\n- 12th class of the Business and administration section (professional): January/February\r\n- 13th class of the Business and administration section (professional): May/June , \r\n- 11th and 13th class of the ICT and Computer technologies section (professional) January/February, \r\n\r\nORGANISATION OF INTERNSHIPS FOR OUR PARTNER SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nEvery year, the coordinator of the LN organizes the internship for 10-12 students of our partner schools here in Wiltz.", "http://www.ibdpartnership.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-LU01-KA116-037236_7"], ["1DS", "TECH utbildningar", "IBD Solutions Limited", 115339.0, "We educate students to lead and navigate in a technology-oriented future.\r\nThe education industry is the next industry that will undergo a paradigm shift where digitization, new technology and new teaching methods are crucial to the quality of education.

Working in partnership forms a support network that will overcome the individual difficulties of each school and will allow us to design collective solutions that are more efficient and effective.\r\nThe project will create collaborative work dynamics based on a dynamic management of training and action research, with the implementation of innovative ideas in curriculum management, teacher training, organization of physical spaces, schedules, offers made available and work in partnership with the local community. The aim is to advance to new models of teacher training that are capable of replicating methodologies, burning bureaucratic steps and using models of diversification of strategies implemented and validated by practical and theoretical research, in a perspective of integrated quality projects in the territory.

For the project term from 2014 to 2016 the funding was applied by our own hands, also for the project term from July 2016 to June 2018. The concept of the project provides four-week work placements for dual apprentices. Young skilled workers (in the first year after finishing the apprenticeship) or learners from classified professional training courses (during their training and in the first year after the final exam) will also be accepted but they will be the exception. The participants will be learners from different professions (the majority admin-related). Most of them will be employed by member-companies of the IHK Siegen, we will accept exceptions though. \r\n\r\nMobilities will be organized in groups or individually, we are planning to send 25 persons throughout the programme period. The participants will go through work-placements at mostly small or medium-size organizations in the Portsmouth region. Host companies will be provided by our British partner IBD.

IBD will also organize the introductory day (including city tour and cultural and work preparation) and will be supporting and monitoring the participants throughout their stay. The IHK Siegen as the sending institution is responsible for the coordination and administration of the project. We also counsel the apprentices and their German supervisors, we select and prepare the participants. We also conceptualise and organize a preparational meeting and an evaluational meeting (including a Europass ceremony) at the Chamber. Throughout the project the IHK will be communicating continuously with the participants and the receiving partner. Each participant will sign a contract including a learning agreement which will contain the training programme. The learning agreement will also be signed by the receiving organization. Ways to communicate with the participants and partner during, before and after the project will be personally, by phone or email.\r\n\r\nThe dissemination of the project results will mainly be based on press work, the Chamber magazine, personal contacts with employees, schools and apprentices as well as information events and trade fairs. \r\n\r\nThe main objectives of our project are: The participants should improve their personal, intercultural and language skills in order to improve their position on the job market. We also feel that mobility of young people contributes to a positive attitude towards Europe and improves their relations with foreigners, because European cohesion and values of freedom, democracy and tolerance will be immediately tangible and comprehensible. The project helps young people to open their minds, to extend their social, professional and cross-cutting skills, acquire taste for innovation and initiative and to develop a sense of civil behaviour in Europe.\r\nFor our regional companies mobility projects become a more and more important way to improve the quality and attractiveness of the dual apprenticeship system. They can also contribute to enhance the image of the participating company which helps to arouse the interest of potential apprentices. On the other hand it is a fact that a lot of our local companies, especially the smaller and medium-sized ones, tend to make use of these advantages only if there is a concrete offer like our project to organize and finance these measures. Participating companies will also benefit from qualifying their junior employees for international tasks. Export forms a great part of the activities of our local businesses. Employees who are able to deal with international clients and suppliers in a professional way are an important asset for their employers.\r\n\r\nIn the long run we aim at contributing to a growing culture of mobility in Vocational Educational Training.

These industries benefit especially from the European Economic Area and have concrete prospects of integration because of the impending shortage of skilled workers. The apprentices and their companies will be supported by qualified BWHW professionals. The apprentices can be sent individually for a four to six week internship in suitable foreign partner companies in order to gather new practical experiences, additional job related qualifications and personal as well as professional key skills.

This applies\r\nequally to commercial staff in international companies. Both from the perspective of the companies that are active in international\r\nmarkets, as well as for the professional perspective of the trainees, the need arises to acquire these skills.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nLearners should use and deepen their professional knowledge during the stay abroad. Furthermore, they should increase their social\r\nand international expertise. In a pre-agreed contract between the partners the working areas will be set; Eg. participants are used in\r\nhotel trades in the \"reception\" and in commercial occupations in the \"Shopping / Sales Export\". After training, the learners become\r\nmore flexible by their increased mobility readiness, so that their career prospects will improve. In addition, participants will learn\r\nmore about the current and historical culture of the country.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nAn essential part is to demand and support and to raise awareness of a growing Europe. Significant results are improved language\r\nskills of the participants, as well as the better cultural understanding of all involved with each other.

By the work placement and the experience abroad, they will have more chances finding a job.\r\n\r\n-To support the interest for languages. In Europe it is a must to know 2 or even more lanuages. That improves the chances on the job market.\r\n\r\n-And to improve experiences in the vocational area.

The school conducts Higher Vocational Education in Travel & Tourism and Hospitality, Accounting and Finance, Health and Welfare, Retail, and IT. The number of students at the school is just over 700, there are 22 permanently employed staff, and 60 to 80 contracted staff working with education. The project is linked to the EU\u2019s educational policy goals; at least 40% of all 30-34 year-olds should have completed tertiary education. The project is timely with regard to EU goals \u2013 Higher Vocational Education in Sweden has never before been allocated so many places. The political direction is clear \u2013 there is a strong commitment to HVE. \r\n \r\nThe aim of the project for staff is to obtain more knowledge about EU tools, and to gain better insight into the overall goals set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy for Higher Education. Knowledge is needed about SeQF, EQF and how ECVET can be implemented concerning credit transfer. Staff will gain knowledge by learning how tasks are performed, taught and assessed in Europe within the professional roles that students are educated for at Frans Schartau. Further aims of the project are to see how the European dimension can be reflected in the curriculum. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the project for students is to provide them with international professional experience, and increased language skills as requested by the labour market. One consequence of mobility is that employability increases while strengthening the student\u2019s ability to work in an international labour market. Through exchange, students get the opportunity to acquire key competencies such as communicating in another language, learning new technologies that increase digital skills. Living in another country leads to the development of social, personal and cultural skills, and by participating in exchange projects a person\u2019s capacity to take initiative is stimulated. \r\n \r\nThree members of staff with experience of international cooperation will organise the project. Well-established activities and methods have been planned for some time. After starting up the project and implementation with staff and students, work will progress according to the Activity Plan that also includes theme days, help with writing CVs, and that each participant prepares themself by examining specific areas in the recipient country. \r\n\r\nFive different professional areas of work at the school will be represented among the 14 employees participating in mobility to obtain a comprehensive result. Staff should be in the position to immediately apply their new skills to benefit students and promote work on internationalization at the school. The 25 students participating each year will be selected to achieve a good spread across the various areas of work. Students must have a good communicative ability to be able to pass on what they have learnt after their Work Placements. After selection, mobility goals will be anchored with the host organization or company and the Learning Agreement written.\r\n\r\nThe intended outcome is that the school should be at the forefront of internationalization work. There will be more knowledge within the organization about professional roles seen from a European perspective. The knowledge acquired will give courses and teaching at the school an international dimension, increase knowledge of SeQF, EQF and ECVET as well as ensuring that international Work Placements maintains high quality.\r\n\r\nThe school is part of the City of Stockholm, which organizes education at all levels so that circulation of results will be via the City's Intranet and in the newsletter. The companies (about 100) linked to the school\u2019s various steering groups as well as industry organizations within the various fields of education will be invited to participate in breakfast meetings and theme days in order to gain access to the school\u2019s internationalization work. All niche companies that the school works with will have access to a workforce that has international experience.\r\n\r\nOnce the entire project has been completed, Frans Schartau Business Institute will have strengthened international cooperation in Higher Vocational Education in Europe, which will facilitate future work on implementation of ECVET. If the project is carried out full-scale, in addition to the contacts made through staff skills development, it will also have included supervisors from 40 companies in Europe whereby knowledge and insights are spread further.

Working life requires more and more international cooperation, which we need to develop our students and staff. In order to continue developing our vocational programs, students and staff, we need to take another step and it is against internationalization. The retail and IT industry includes many international relations and English as professional language. Students will have the whole of Europe as a labor market, so it is important to study the working environment, culture and customs during there education so that they can work more easily in other countries and to gain a better understanding of cultural differences and how English is used as a technical language. VET and job shadowing abroad give our students and staff both the understanding and familiarity with an international labor market.\r\n\r\nWorkmanship\r\nThe purpose of this project is that several schools and students will be able to do a few weeks of their workplace-based learning in another country with another professional culture, professional identity and professional community, and teachers will be able to develop their professional profession through job shadowing. Participants also get to know and learn new professional skills based on an internationalization perspective in their future profession and in their present professional profession. This enables the students to achieve a deeper goal achievement and understanding described in the rules for Gy11 and approaching the diploma objectives for vocational education and training, and the teachers develop their teaching, which creates higher quality in the students' vocational education. Assessing competense based learning and the silent knowledge of a profession results in the best quality at a visual meeting and therefore we want to create the conditions for our vocational teachers to conduct tripartite conversations in place or through digital technology.\r\n\r\nEfficiency\r\nFinding partner organizations, applying and creating procedures and processes to enable VET abroad is resource-intensive. By centralizing resources in a consortium, the schools in the consortium will be able to send their students abroad to do parts of their VET and teachers for job shadowing. Each school can then develop at its own pace with a few students where they can work on internationalization and continue work on developing local routines and processes with the support of centrally developed materials and key persons. Using period placement schedule as a resource allows the flow of students to be evenly distributed over the academic year and receiving partners can maintain a good quality over time and our organization can handle the amount of students who then continuously can send smaller number of students and increase the number over time.\r\n\r\nInnovation\r\nIn the IT- and retail industry, new technologies are being developed both nationally and internationally. To give our students the opportunity to work with problem solving and explore materials and techniques in another country can provide students with innovative ideas.

The school wants to focus the training content mainly in areas where it is able to provide quality training, or work experience for students. The school lacks workshops for professional practice for students of a construction sector, or a modern laboratory where students could perform tests of materials.

We want the students of the  graphic digital media sector to focus mainly on working with different application software for creating graphics, websites, editing photos, videos and electronic publications. The students of the mechanic electrician sector will focus on improving their knowledge in the field of design, production and testing of printed circuits, programming of the machines etc.\r\nStudents of the branch of car mechanic  will focus on basic activities like the assembly and disassembly of motor vehicles, for example. gear, exchange cylinder head, steering and braking systems. The school wants to help to deepen , improve the  training and the preparatione of its students by involving them in the project.

They will be doing their work placement during their 2nd year (at the spring of 2019 or 2020). These volunteers are attending 2 extra hours of English class a week. Therefore they practise their English more intensively and they are more sensitive to the international opening. Most of the time, they are not familiar with trips abroad and often, they are not very at ease with communicating in English. So they live up this experience as a real opportunity which leaves a long-term mark.\r\nAll along their degree course, these pupils have to undergo several periods of work placements, and we noticed there was a real need to bring back together our students and the learning of foreign languages, especially English. Also, we felt the need to offer them a window on the world. Consequently we thought it would be interesting for them to experience an immersion in a company through a work placement related to their studies for a 5 week-period\r\nThe 2nd year of their school curriculum is the most appropriate moment for they have gained the professional autonomy necessary to work thanks to their previous work placements and they are not so much involved in the preparation of their exam and their course choice.\r\nOn the first week of the mobility, one of the teachers will stay with the candidates. This person will make sure they are well integrated to their new environment and to their company. Again, at the end of the stay, they will have the visit of a teacher who will, this time, assess the students in the companies and with the partners. \r\nTo get an insight into the culture of the country they are staying in, and to improve their knowledge in technical English, they will be offered about 10 hours of English. As for the Norwegian stay, the students will get lessons of Norwegian for beginners before they go. These spending are financed on our own account.\r\nThey must integrate the company which was attributed according to their professional field, curriculum vitae and cover letter. Then, they must fit in the working team, do the tasks expected by the tutor and the technical teachers.

On their baccalaureate diploma, they will get an added value thanks to the obtaining of the European distinction and the optional mobility unit. Finally, this experience will certainly give them more opportunities as for their course choice after the \u2018baccalaur\u00e9at\u2019 diploma and a better professional integration.\r\nThese mobilities have also a positive impact on our high school which is considered as a go-ahead school in terms of international opening: our recruitment is getting better, labels such as \u2018Lyc\u00e9e des M\u00e9tiers\u201d and \u201cQualyc\u00e9e are renewed, links with the local companies are stronger.

Practical training of the learners and trainees, as well as the professional development and growth of the staff are the priorities set by IVVEC.  We have set the task to be trainee-focused and we wish to study the best practices. The HR policy at IVVEC supports learning both in Estonia and abroad. Our staff members analyze their work at the end of a school-year and plan their learning activities according to their needs. Traditionally individual meetings are held by the school administration with each of the staff, where they discuss the plans and needs for retraining and advancement. A training program is made up at IVVEC every school-year. The participation of the staff in EU mobilities is vastly supported by the school administration. IVVEC has long-term international experience in organizing mobilities for both staff and learners.  \r\n\r\nThe objective of the project is to implement a one-year project of high-quality mobilities which will enable the learners and staff of IVVEC to be more competitive. Both in Estonia and abroad the Centre will be positioned as one offering the best learning conditions to students and supporting the professional growth of its staff. Besides, the international cooperation grows more active.      \r\n\r\nThe learners, participating in the project, are the best second- and third-year students in 2018/2019 academic years in the following vocations: junior software developers, chef, carpenter, welder,  hair-dresser, logistics, CNC operators. 26 trainees are placed for practice at enterprises and 8 VET workers will go job-shadowing at the  companies. The partners for this application are in the following states: the UK, Austria, Italy, Spain and Slovenia. IVVEC has cooperated with most of the partners for many years.   \r\n\r\nThe preparation of the project has been carried out by a project team who has worked very closely and intensively with the partner organizations. The project application has been prepared in cooperation with the partners and the mobilities have been planned in accordance with their best learning conditions.\r\n\r\nThorough planning definitely serves a solid ground for successful project implementation. If funding granted, the project management team will be made up to implement the project in cooperation with the partners. The selection of the best candidates is carried out in accordance with the special procedure adopted at IVVEC. The staff members have already expressed their wish to study abroad. All the activities are documented which also guarantees the project implementation in case of unexpected changes in the project management team.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity to undertake independently a training placement abroad for students who come to study at IVVEC after both basic and secondary schools, enables them to grow more competitive both in Estonian and European job markets and gain more foreign language skills. The opportunity to have a practice placement abroad motivates the first- and second-year students to study harder. The knowledge and skills of the participating staff grows as well as their competence in advancing the apprenticeship system at IVVEC, which definitely have positive effect on the learners' motivation to study and reducing the drop-out rate.  Being abroad the participants have a great opportunity to get acquainted with foreign culture which brings to higher tolerance and respect towards it.   \r\nAll the mobility participants are issued a Europass Mobility and all the learning outcomes and assessments in different learning environments are taken into account and properly registered at IVVEC.\r\n\r\nThe successful international projects and their implementation make vocational education more popular in the region, creates a solid ground to raise the quality of education and attract more basic school graduates to study at IVVEC. According to the youth who enter IVVEC to study, as well as their parents, the opportunity to practice abroad is of utmost importance. The staff also highly estimates the opportunity to learn from colleagues at partner schools.   \r\nWe adhere to the principles of Skills Year 2017: value the skills, mastery, vocational education and lifelong learning.

Les Compagnons du Devoir have always given priority to a long life learning and make every effort to value on-the-job training and mobility, mainly through shared experiences, human relations and the sharing of knowledge. \r\n\r\nLong term mobility projects (1 year) have always existed in our association. Part of our \u201cTour de France\u201d syllabus gives the opportunity for our journeymen and journeywomen to have a one-year work experience abroad. Since 2011, it has become compulsory and more than 6700 of our young professionals have benefitted from such an experience.\r\n\r\nWe have also had the opportunity to allow, since 2004, almost 16100 apprentices to benefit from a 3 week mobility project within the European Union, combining all trade sectors (industry, construction, baking, leather and textiles trades). \r\n\r\nIn order to institutionalize our actions, we manage to officially integrate the 3 week mobility project in to the learning annex of the apprenticeship contract for all our level 4 apprentices since 2009. \r\n\r\nFor 2018-2020, we would like to maintain this momentum and keep the objectives shared under our strategic development plan by sending again more than 1000 apprentices on group mobility projects together with their VET trainer (110 groups in total), 180 post-apprentices for a long term mobility (one year), 108 apprentices for 3-months to 9-months individual mobility \u2013sharing time between a company and a VET center in the host country, 60 post-apprentices on 2-week technical training courses and manage two different job-shadowing.\r\n\r\nTo carry out these actions Les Compagnons du Devoir are continually aiming to improve and since 2016 we have put in place our own quality management processes developed through the ISO 9001 certification. \r\n\r\nThe quality of our mobility projects relies greatly on the developed teaching skills of our partners, who suggest precise programs compatible with the apprentices\u2019 syllabus in France and with the specificities of the host country. This approach guarantees the relevance of our programs and reassures the employers of our apprentices, who could be concerned about the benefit of a mobility outside France.\r\nThese projects will allow the participants to acquire language, intercultural and cross-disciplinary skills as apprenticeships and trades are different from one country to another. Travelling is also a way to develop adaptability and flexibility, two qualities required in the labor market. \r\n\r\nOur partners involved in these projects are VET centers, companies, social partners, consular chambers and intermediate organizations in over 20 countries. Mobility is more and more recognized in these countries, therefore most work placements will be renewed year after year. \r\nYears of experience with our partners allows us to organize our projects with mutual trust and better prepare each participant for their mobility.\r\n\r\nEach participant\u2019s skills and competences gained abroad will be validated by the European partner and the French VET trainer on our online training platform \u201cAquisav\u201d. We also would like to use ECVET system. With this in mind, our partners have already signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). \r\n\r\nAs part of this project our International Department will maintain relationships with partners, prepare and coordinate the monitoring and the validation of each project. They will also help their VET centers, in France, with the practical organization of the mobility projects for apprentices (short-term and long-term) and support post-apprentices following technical training or going abroad for one year (individual mobility).\r\n\r\nThis ambitious project couldn\u2019t be organized without the considerable investment of VET centers, in particular our VET trainers and administrative teams.", "http://www.avantages.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA116-046192_22"], ["1DS", "Starptautiska pieredze n\u0101kotnes iesp\u0113j\u0101m darba tirg\u016b", "IBD Solutions Limited", 94156.0, "In Project \u2018\u2019  International experience for future opportunities in labor market\u2019\u2019 school year 2017./2018 international practice in modern Europe schools and companies will be done by 4 Kuldiga Technology and tourism technical school teachers and 34 students who will work in Germany , Sweden, Estonia, Italy, Finland,United Kingdom, Portugal and Slovakia .
