The supply-side of seafood markets is limited from both sea fisheries and aquaculture. At the same time demand for seafood products is increasing. In a globalised economy, the conjunction of these two trends should generate high opportunities for any seafood production activity. However, both fisheries and aquaculture companies are facing key challenges, which currently hinder them reaping the full benefits of seafood markets expansion, and even question their sustainability. As a whole, the EU fisheries sector remains at low levels of profitability and sustainability. The SUCCESS project will examine two strategies to improve the competitiveness of the sector: (i) increasing demand for EU seafood products, especially improving the awareness of the advantages of European production (including sustainability requirements and adjustment to market evolution); and (ii) cost reduction in certain production segments. For both strategies development on world markets as well as consumer preferences and awareness will be analysed. Additionally, SUCCESS will explore the different sectors along the value chain (from fisheries and aquaculture producers via processing companies, wholesalers, retailers to direct marketing to mobile fishmongers and restaurants) and their potential for improvements in competitiveness.

The project meets the need to improve the students\u2019 professional skills through 1 \u2013month  traineeships abroad in companies operating in the field of urban and territorial regeneration (innovative technologies and materials for planning, sustainable mobility, energy saving, cultural and social participation and integration, knowledge sharing).\r\nIn fact the applicant consortium seeks to raise the students\u2019 professional skills (in the fields of digital technologies, urban development, chemistry, environment) and to reinvest such competences/smart skills in the innovation process that involves territorial and urban regeneration. The Abruzzo region is undergoing major changes (hydrogeological risk, weakening of the road network and public and private buildings) with a progressive fragility of production and social systems. This  is leading to a redefinition of the traditional designing and urban planning systems. In order to face such change, qualified young human resources are needed.

Practical training of the learners and trainees, as well as the professional development and growth of the staff are the priorities set by IVVEC.  We have set the task to be trainee-focused and we wish to study the best practices. The HR policy at IVVEC supports learning both in Estonia and abroad. Our staff members analyze their work at the end of a school-year and plan their learning activities according to their needs. Traditionally individual meetings are held by the school administration with each of the staff, where they discuss the plans and needs for retraining and advancement. A training program is made up at IVVEC every school-year. The participation of the staff in EU mobilities is vastly supported by the school administration. IVVEC has long-term international experience in organizing mobilities for both staff and learners.  \r\nThe objective of the project is to implement a two-year project of high-quality mobilities which will enable the learners and staff of IVVEC to be more competitive. Both in Estonia and abroad the Centre will be positioned as one offering the best learning conditions to students and supporting the professional growth of its staff. Besides, the international cooperation grows more active.      \r\nThe learners, participating in the project, are the best second- and third-year students in 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 academic years in the following vocations: multimedia, junior software developers, IT system specialist, chef, pastry-chef, tourism management, carpenter, welder, machine-tool worker, electrician, auto technician, mechatronic, automatic, finishing works in construction, hair-dresser, logistics. 110 trainees are placed for practice at enterprises, 38 trainees \u2013 at VET schools and 38 VET workers will go learning / job-shadowing at the partner schools and companies.

Further research showed that this is quite a general trend, as in a lot of the EU28 countries the participation rate to non-formal activities of persons who have difficulties in performing basic activities is about half the one of the ones who are not facing these difficulties (Eurostat).

Staying abroad on their own favours their personal development and makes them become more independent and self-confident. \r\n\r\nThe fact of having been abroad for an internship can also be very profitable for the students in their further job application. They have to learn to work in a group and become a team-player; both qualities that are often demanded by employers. It shows employers that they are uncomplicated, committed and flexible.\r\n\r\nThe obtained competences and abilities are certified by a national certificate as well as by the delivery of the Europass- mobility.\r\n\r\nEvery partner for this project is also trying to\r\n- organize cultural and social activities,\r\n- organize visits of the regional area and its touristic attractions,\r\n- organize meetings between the student\u2019s school and the partner schools\r\n\r\nThe constant search of new partners for this project, as well as the close cooperation between schools and professional partners \u2013 as it is not only about the simple exchange of students for an internship - is another aim of this project and favours the collaboration between experts of the professional world and school.\r\n\r\nAIMS OF THE PROJECT\r\n\r\nThe internship gives the students the possibility to\r\n- improve their language skills,\r\n- make them aware of the importance of practical experience and international flexibility in the pursuit of an employment,\r\n- make them more flexible and open to the world,\r\n- improve their team-spirit in an international working-environment\r\n- discover other countries, languages, ways of life and culture,\r\n- improve their communication skills and develop their personality,\r\n- grow in experience.\r\n\r\nWHEN DO THE EXCHANGES TAKE PLACE?\r\n\r\nSTUDENTS A1 (6 weeks): \r\n- 12th class of the Business and administration section (professional): January/February\r\n- 13th class of the Business and administration section (professional): May/June , \r\n- 11th and 13th class of the ICT and Computer technologies section (professional) January/February, \r\n\r\nORGANISATION OF INTERNSHIPS FOR OUR PARTNER SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nEvery year, the coordinator of the LN organizes the internship for 10-12 students of our partner schools here in Wiltz.", "http://www.ibdpartnership.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-LU01-KA116-037236_7"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PO5"}
