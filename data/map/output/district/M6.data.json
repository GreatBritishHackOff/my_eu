The types of building for retrofitting will include detached, semidetached and terrace houses, and flats of different ages. Methods for measurement of building performance before and after retrofitting will include leakage test and thermal imaging to determine the major areas of building envelope for improvement, in addition to smart energy metering for individual technologies and building as a whole. The buildings will be retrofitted to at least the latest national building standards for new buildings. The type and number of technology deployed will be optimised using life cycle energy analysis for each type of building.\n\nThe work programme will involve development of computer models for optimising technologies and solutions, analysing dynamic energy demand of buildings and predicting microclimate indoors, development and testing of technologies and solutions under laboratory conditions, retrofitting and monitoring residential buildings in different climatic conditions, and a socio-economic analysis.\n\nThe above outcomes will be delivered through innovative solutions developed by a Consortium comprising leading companies, universities and public institutions from 10 European countries.", 146465.0, 6821858.0, "HERB", "Green solutions for old buildings", "An EU-funded project is working to develop sustainable refurbishment solutions for residential buildings.

Although building new homes according to the demanding energy efficiency regulations is essential, it will take several decades before such houses become a significant proportion of the stock.\n\nThe major challenge is to retrofit energy-inefficient buildings to meet 21st century standards. The EU-funded project 'Holistic energy-efficient retrofitting of residential buildings' (http://www.euroretrofit.com/ (HERB)) has been initiated to develop and demonstrate new and innovative energy-efficient technologies and solutions for retrofitting older buildings. These will be installed in a number of typical residential buildings in EU countries and their performance will be monitored.\n\nHERB is selecting and integrating the best available technologies, following a truly holistic approach.

Energy-efficient solutions will also be deployed, including energy-efficient lighting, heating, ventilating and air conditioning as well as renewable energy systems. The proposed solutions will be affordable, durable, easy to install, and compatible with existing building functions and aesthetics.\n\nThe types of building for retrofitting include detached, semi-detached and terrace houses, and flats of different ages. HERB will use various methods for measuring the building performance before and after retrofitting. These will be leakage tests and thermal imaging to determine the main parts of the building envelope that need to be improved. Furthermore, smart meters will be used for each technology to measure energy savings.\n\nSo far, project members have developed computer models for optimising components for each technology and each combination of technologies for retrofitting various types of buildings. Additionally, they have developed models for simulating energy demand and supply as well as the indoor environment in residential buildings.\n\nHERB is providing a holistic approach for retrofitting homes, allowing them to achieve the energy efficiency levels of new buildings.

Together through this project the partnership is looking to draw out models of how they can democratise the cultural expertise of outdoor arts spectacle by capacity building their local creative talent. EOAA will develop and deliver five \u2018Schools of Spectacle\u2019 that end with five public facing outdoor arts events, equipping up to 125 creative practitioners from seven European countries with the skills and experience needed to build their international careers and strengthen the outdoor arts sector in small cities that have cultural excellence at their heart. Further, by testing this model across four European cities that span the four corners of Europe, the EOAA partnership will gain an understanding of the potential for outdoor arts to develop audiences through participation, celebration and spectacle across a diverse set of cultures, and resource challenges.
