NATEX will develop aligned textiles from natural fibres suitable for use as high strength reinforcing fabrics to produce structural composite parts using bio and oil based thermoplastic and thermoset resins. This will include the use of orientated woven natural fibres in bioderived thermoplastics and thermosets, to produce high-tech products with high added value from entirely renewable resources. The main innovations will be: \u2022 New chemical/enzymatic treatments to tailor the fibre surface chemistry and to modify its cell wall polymers, to obtain the desired interface properties when combined with the polymer matrix \u2022New chemical/natural treatments for the yarn during the wrapping process, new method for low twist yarns production, film stacking and commingling development for natural fibres, to increase the mechanical properties of the yarns \u2022Development of new weaving techniques to improve impregnation and to obtain innovative 3D textiles \u2022Resin viscosity control using thermal conductive additives, increasing their compatibility with natural fibres by using coupling agents and surfactant additives Besides, a large range of resin processing methods will be adapted to suit them to the characteristics of the modified fibres: Vacuum Bagging, Vacuum Consolidation, Compression Moulding, Continuous Compression Moulding, Infusion and Resin Transfer Moulding. Basic research on joining technologies as hot welding over natural fibre composites will be also performed. As result, aligned natural fibres with improved properties will be combined with thermoplastics and thermosets, increasing the mechanical properties of biocomposites and introducing them in structural applications in different sectors: transport, energy, agricultural machinery and shipbuilding", null, 3698214.0, "NATEX", "Innovative biocomposites for structural applications", "The NATEX study focused on the fabrication of composites with aligned natural fibres and thermoplastics or thermosets. These hybrid materials illustrated enhanced mechanical properties, making them suitable for structural applications in the transport, energy and shipbuilding sectors.", "Polymer composite materials consist of at least two elements \u2013 a bulk material also referred to as 'the matrix', and a reinforcement mainly in fibre form. The ultimate goal in developing composites is to improve the properties of each element mainly to increase the strength and stiffness of the matrix.\n\nWhen using natural fibres in biocomposites with thermoplastic biopolymers, the resultant materials bring improvements in terms of biodegradability, disposal and mechanical properties. However, this technology is not yet available for use in structural applications.\n\nTo address this, the EU-funded 'Aligned natural fibres and textiles for use in structural composite applications' (NATEX) project focused on the development of composite structural materials that consisted of thermoplastic or thermoset resins and natural fibres. It was envisaged that the new products would compete in applications where materials from non-renewable resources like steel, aluminium and reinforced plastics are used today.\n\nThe key objective of the NATEX consortium was to develop and optimise techniques for modifying the fibre surface, and for spinning and weaving the fibres in order to improve their impregnation in the matrix polymer. Additionally, a range of resin-processing methods and joining technologies were tested and adapted to improve the compatibility of the polymers with natural fibres.\n\nInnovative two- and three-dimensional fabrics from blends of thermoplastic and natural fibres have also been successfully prepared and characterised. The processing of thermoplastic biocomposites gave reinforced mechanical properties to the resultant materials, thereby increasing their prospective use in structural applications.\n\nNATEX products are envisaged to be able to compete in industrial applications, including automotive and energy systems, for the construction of agricultural machinery and for shipbuilding.", "http://www.natex.eu/", "http://www.hemcore.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2011-02/54904.jpg", "fp7_89319_998798331"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["8HP", "RDE", "PATRICK STEAD HOSPITAL"], ["8HP", "RGP", "PATRICK STEAD HOSPITAL"], ["8HP", "RMY", "PATRICK STEAD HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "IP19"}
