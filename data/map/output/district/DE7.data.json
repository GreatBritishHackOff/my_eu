A 5% substitution of these materials using Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) applications would reduce over 300.000 tons of non renewable plastic packaging wastes disposal. Packaging used in MAP is usually based on multilayer plastic materials that are usually disposed as waste, approximately 300.000 Ton. ADCELLPACK consortium has identified that materials based in cellulose can be an outstanding alternative to substitute materials currently used in MAP.\n\nChanging consumer habits and motivations have benefited cheese consumption, and sliced cheese is an increasing market (>300kton/year), producing a huge quantity of packaging wastes. That is the reason for the selection of cheese as the fresh food product of ADCELLPACK.\n\nADCELLPACK new solution will provide a readily thermoformable tray mainly composed of cellulose (up to 90% in weight), with improved properties using modified pulp fine fraction. However, it is needed a barrier layer in a porous, hygroscopic medium such as paper. To overcome this limitation, a blend based in polylactic acid (PLA) will be used. PLA lacks of the barrier to oxygen and water needed for modified atmosphere packaging. Therefore, to decrease costs and increase properties, blends with Polyglycolic acid will be considered to produce a coating and a lid for the tray.

The wrapper on your food has different purposes. The purpose may be to separate it from another brand, make it look more high-quality, or sell its weight-loss virtues. Whatever the goal of the packaging, it may include ink, glue or other materials that frequently make recycling these materials expensive and sometimes impracticable. \n\nIn the EU-funded project 'Advanced cellulose packaging' (ADCELLPACK), researchers have been testing advanced cellulose packaging on the packaging of ready-to-eat cheese slices. Changes to ingredients in a manufacturing process called 'thermoforming' will allow the trays to be 100\u00a0% recyclable.

The CLIPP Recycling System for printed and laminated plastic fraction, will contribute to the post-industrial waste management goal of this new century: the development of intelligent solutions that are technically and environmentally innovative, and economically viable. The project proposal is based on the elimination (90% w/w) and compatibilisation of the paint contaminants in packaging by the synergetic combination of CO2 in super-critical-conditions (sc-CO2) with innovative high performance filters (micro-filters) and suitable coupling agents as a dispersion-aid. The sc-CO2 is a promising technology in the plastic processing industry due to its special properties such as polymer viscosity reduction and dispersion and removal of low molecular weight substances. The advantageous physic-chemical properties of CO2 compared to conventional organic solvents are capacity of mass transfer and more environmentally friendly operation. Three machine configurations will be studied and scale-up using one-step process by combining different types of extruders and devices in order to improve the quality of the pellet, increase remain contaminants dispersion and matrix-filler compatibilization and reduce CO2 foaming problems: 1) A two consecutive single screw extruder (Tandem extrusion process), 2) MRS (Multi Rotation System) and 3) Tandem extruder system with a MACD (Multiple Annular Channel Device).

An EU project has produced improved-quality recycled plastics from printed plastic packaging.", "Some plastics can be recycled, but transparent film plastics are presently not considered worth reclaiming from landfill. An EU project aimed to change that, promoting flexible painted and laminated plastic film (commonly used for food, toys, cosmetics, and industrial parts) as a valuable recycling resource. The project planned to make a similarly transparent plastic recyclate of equal quality and safety to the non-recycled version. Since the new plastic would be \"infinitely\" recyclable, that kind of waste could be virtually eliminated, helping EU industry to achieve the packaging-reduction directives set by the EU parliament.\n\nThe 'Study of recyclability of printed or laminated plastic packaging films using supercritical CO2 technologies' (CLIPP) project consisted of nine European companies and research organisations. It aimed to develop an innovative process to make a continuous film of high-quality transparent plastic.\n\nThe process relies on stripping ink, adhesives, and contaminants using supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) as an industrial solvent. Supercritical is an intermediate physical state combining the flow properties of liquid with the expansion properties of gas; supercritical CO2 is an effective and environmentally safe industrial solvent. In conjunction with the CO2 system, the CLIPP process uses systems for micro-particle filtering, which remove impurities, plus a series of innovative extruders. The resulting system allows smooth production of a translucent film.\n\nFull transparency has not yet been achieved with the method tried. However, CLIPP modified its interim goals, aiming instead to make a plastic as transparent as possible, also having low-odour properties.\n\nThese efforts successfully produced a translucent material of suitable quality, including low-odour, appropriate for various non-food packaging purposes. An additional translucent recycled material, in conjunction with a barrier layer, proved suitable for sunflower seed packets. Economic analysis indicates that these developed products can be profitably used in value-added manufacturing, and work has begun on full commercial implementation.\n\nProject results have further increased the expertise of EU plastic recycling industries. That may lead to further steps towards the original manufacturing goals.

Paper properties will be enhanced following a three steps approach. 1) To increase paper moisture barrier, blends of waxes and resins will be applied. 2) Main moisture barrier improvement will rely on a composite based in PHA.

Such packaging usually consists of multilayer plastic materials that are not fully recyclable. BIOACTIVELAYER intends to substitute MAP with a multilayer biodegradable structure based on paper, particularly for the dried baby-food market.\n\nResearchers enhanced the external paper layer's moisture barrier by coating it with a blend of waxes and resins. For the main moisture-barrier layer, they used a composite containing polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), which is a biodegradable plastic naturally produced by bacterial fermentation.\n\nFinally, to create an oxygen-barrier layer to prevent food spoilage by oxidation, researchers selected materials with low permeability to oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapour. They also added oxygen scavenging molecules, which \u2018absorb\u2019 oxygen to reduce its levels inside the packaging.\n\nWhile researchers have improved the moisture- and oxygen-barrier properties of the multilayer packaging, other requirements still need to be satisfied before it reaches the market. These include being heat sealable, fat resistant, light resistant, and sufficiently inert to not interact with food and endanger human health.\n\nOnce developed, however, BIOACTIVELAYER could have a substantial political, economic, societal and environmental impact.
