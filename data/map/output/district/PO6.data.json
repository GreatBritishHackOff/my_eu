Based on the methodologies of a service-oriented architecture and the results of previous projects CRYSTAL focuses on an industry-driven approach using cross-domain user stories, domain-specific use cases, public use cases, and technology bricks. This shall have a significant impact to strengthen European competitiveness regarding new markets and societal applications.\n\nIn building an overall interoperability domain \u201cembedded systems\u201d, CRYSTAL will contribute to establishing a standard for model-based systems engineering in a certification and safety context which is expected to have global impact.\n\nBy bringing together large enterprises and various industrial domains CRYSTAL will setup a sustainable innovation eco-system. By harmonizing the demands in the development of safety-relevant embedded systems including multi-viewpoint engineering and variability management across different industrial domains, CRYSTAL will achieve a strong acceptance from both vendors and the open-source community.\n\nCRYSTAL will drive forward interoperability towards a \u201cde facto\u201d standard providing an interoperable European RTP.\n\n\nApproved by the JU on 15-03-2016", 96040.0, 64061823.0, "CRYSTAL", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ibm.com/uk", null, "fp7_111278_975524442"], ["3AU", "Virtual Materials Market Place (VIMMP)", "Ibm United Kingdom Ltd", "VIMMP facilitates and promotes the exchange between all materials modelling stakeholders for the benefit of increased innovation in European manufacturing industry. \n\nVIMMP will establish an open-source, user-friendly, powerful web-based marketplace linking beneficiaries from different manufacturing industry sectors with relevant materials modelling activities and resources. To enable a seamless and fully integrated environment, VIMMP is built on solid taxonomy and metadata foundations, including those centred on materials models, software tools, communities, translation expertise and training materials. VIMMP is a true marketplace, offering a substantial boost to all providers of tools and services; integrating modelling platforms based on Open Simulation Platform (OSP) standards that will be pursued in collaboration with the EMMC. Thus, any software owner can easily integrate models and certify codes to adhere to OSP standards. The Translator function will be supported by novel, collaborative tools that use metadata to combine models on an abstract logical level. OSP standards enable Translators and End User to build and deploy workflows quickly. \n\nVIMMP contributes novel avenues for coupling and linking of models, which will be validated in the context of three overlapping industry applications: personal goods, polymer nanocomposites and functional coatings. Data repositories relevant to modelling will be developed and integrated in VIMMP, including a novel input parameter repository for mesoscopic model, also materials properties and associated validation data. VIMMP will comprise a full set of education and training resources relevant for a wider range of manufacturing industry.
