This unique approach, moving on from the current state of the art using rigid cell or film based PV materials and batteries, will allow development of large-area deformable products, including agricultural shading, automotive soft-tops, building facades, rollable shades, curtains and roofing, aerospace fabrics, and outdoor goods.\n\nThe key challenges are:\n\u2022\tFormulation of PV and energy storage materials to be applied as flexible thin coatings on monofilament fibres. SME materials suppliers Cyanine (PV dyes) and PPC (polymer coatings) will work with universities, EPFL (PV) and Brunel (storage) who are leaders in these fields.\n\u2022\tDevelopment and application of fibre spinning and coating methods to make the two multi-layer fibre types, followed by generation of a textile combining the two. Fibre and fabric manufacturers Sefar, CeNTI (SME) and VDS weaving (SME) will work with textile and coating experts, Centexbel and TWI.\n\u2022\tIntegration of the two fibres, requiring end preparation to reveal conductors, interconnect and micro-circuitry, followed by attachment to a load device. Materials joining and smart textile experts, TWI, Cetemmsa and Ohmatex (SME) will work on this.\n\u2022\tDemonstration activities which will involve a small-scale autonomous airship by Lindstrand (SME), and agricultural textiles by BTF, both strong innovators in their fields.\n\nThe 6 innovative SMEs, 2 LEs and the RTOs with extensive links in solar power, microsystems and textiles industries, are well placed to quickly exploit the project developments and provide extensive exposure of the ideas into a wide variety of markets requiring a continuous, fully autonomous and truly flexible pow", 125088.0, 4378156.0, "Powerweave", "Textiles that generate and store electricity", "Imagine incorporating photovoltaic technology with energy storage in flexible fabrics for convertible car tops, tents, awnings, curtains and greenhouse covers. EU support is making it possible.", "Rigid photovoltaic devices can now be seen on rooftops and solar farms around the world. Flexible fabrics that do the same work could easily exploit the exact places where the Sun is most intense and shade is desirable.\n\nNovel fibrous materials to harvest sunlight and store electrical energy are under development by EU-funded scientists within the scope of the project \u2018Development of Textiles for Electrical Energy Generation and Storage\u2019 (http://powerweave.eu (POWERWEAVE)) . The technology combines photovoltaic fibres based on dye-sensitised solar cell technology and rechargeable energy storage fibres exploiting thin-film battery or supercapacitor technology. Fibres are knitted or woven together into a photovoltaic textile for significant benefits of reduced weight, flexibility, ease of storage and transportation.\n\nScientists have already produced small samples of fibres for the photovoltaic cell that exceeded performance objectives. Innovative sensitiser dye formulations have scored a world record efficiency of 11.1%. Energy storage research has produced amazing results with single-wire supercapacitors up to 10 metres in length successfully woven into a fabric without loss of performance.\n\nWork is now focused on the development of industrial-scale production techniques for the two types of multi-layer fibres. Researchers are also developing a fabric prototype that can integrate photovoltaic and energy storage functions. Preliminary tests of various design concepts and optimisations will be integrated to yield a simple and reliable foldable fabric power supply.\n\nThis light-weight fibre-based technology facilitates production of systems with large surface area to address areas where heavy infrastructures are problematic such as on roofs. With development of both generation and storage technologies, it should be possible to produce 100% generation or 100% storage materials or a combination of both. Finally, these systems would aim to require minimal installation, just a roll out and plug in.\n\nPOWERWEAVE technology will be a welcome addition to large markets for both commercial and consumer applications. Besides currently targeted sectors, this technology could also be applied to sectors such as commercial greenhouses, aircraft, clothing and areas without access to electricity grids.", null, "http://www.lindstrandtech.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140725919.jpg", "fp7_103712_985246364"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9BX", "Anerkennung von Ausbildungszugangsvoraussetzungen und -abschl\u00fcssen durch l\u00e4nder\u00fcbergreifende Zusammenarbeit von Berufsbildungseinrichtungen f\u00fcr heilp\u00e4dagogische Berufe", "Hope House Children's Hocpice", 9623.0, "Summary:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe private academy for special education  ( Fachakademie f\u00fcr Heilp\u00e4dagogik) provides education and training for staff of social work with disadvantaged people. It is under the rules of the catholic organization \u201eKatholische Jugendf\u00fcrsorge der Di\u00f6zese Augsburg e. V.\u201c which is a recipient of institutions for children and youth services, vocational training and hospitals. For both, the private academy for special education and the Katholische Jugendf\u00fcrsorge Augsburg, it is a concern to educate and train well-qualified professionals of social work for the European labor market. On the other hand they want to get well-qualified professionals for their own areas of responsibility and to get their offered jobs occupied.\r\n\r\nBy the increasing mobility within Europe former trainees und students request the private academy for special education to describe and confirm the skills acquired in their training in order to obtain the recognition of their formal training abroad and get proper access to the labor market at their trained level and according to their degree. At the same time the organization \u201eKatholische Jugendf\u00fcrsorge der Di\u00f6zese Augsburg e. V.\u201c and their institutions get more and more applications of foreign professionals. The employability of them is difficult, because their testimonials, degrees  and certifications are scarcely comparable to the local requirements. \r\n\r\nIn  discussions with our Europe partners there are inquiries how interested young people can have access to education and training abroad according to the different levels of education in different European countries and according to their level of certification and testimonials after school. Here, too, the private academy for special education is asked again to identify the conditions of access to training and education,  to register the similarities and differences and to develop the necessary educational modules for conformance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to this topics it is the question how to accomplish quick and easy acceptation of the access to training requirements, the recognition of different certifications and degrees and the necessarity of post-qualification educational offerings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this project and the  conversations with the staff of the social work field it is aimed to  get to know the professions and work fields within social and health care and special education. Another outcome of this project is to identify the training courses and their conditions of access, to compare them and to analyse the differences and similarities. According to these results it is a possibility for all project partners to develop qualifiying education moduls ( possibly by another project) in order to get mutual recognition and therefor access to the labor market in European countries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the project it is also intended to get to know the professions which can be compared to those within the working field for special needs in Germany and their fields of special functions, duties and activities in our partner countries. In conclusion to this we can compare the level of  management for these professions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it should be a result of this project to recognize forms of vocational training for the profession  which ist comparable to the German \u201eHeilp\u00e4dagoge\u201c ( edcuational staff for special needs).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of lifelong learning in this project it is also intended to faciliate the permeability between the post-secondary and tertiary education qualifications between the countries. According to the linguistic and cultural varity in an open Europe the project helps to strenghten the intercultural and linguistic competences. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll three participants of the project are responsible for training issues of the Katholische Jugendf\u00fcrsorge der Di\u00f6zese Augsburg e. V. The head of the academy for special education organizes the vocational training according to the contents and methods. The Manager of the Department for Organization and Development has to coordinate training and staff development for all employees within the organization \u201eKatholische Jugendf\u00fcrsorge Augsburg\u201c. The head of Department for all schools ( vocational schools and special schools) is responsible for planning and coordination of the staff development for all professionals working in these schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy visits, internships and intensive discussions with the staff of the partner organizations ( vocational training institutions and schools, institutions within social and health care and institutions within the field of special needs) participants and partners of this project get to know different access requiries, training contents und training degrees and certificates, learn more about the competences needed in the fields of practice and are able to compare.\r\n\r\nA long-term benefit is the mutual recognition of education and an expansion of permeability in the European labor market in relation to the working field of special education.", "http://www.hopehouse.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000499_1"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "hospitalName"], "data": [["7AG", "RL1", "The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SY10"}
