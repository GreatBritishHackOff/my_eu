We apply a novel design approach, which includes modular data center design, fresh air cooling system combined with evaporative cooler apparatus, using solely harmonic free renewable energy, and using less UPS capacity. Thanks to our solution, we can offer a sustainable data centre building, which is energy and resource efficient throughout its lifecycle, cheaper to build and operate and brings jobs and knowledge to remote places.\n\nThe special objectives are to:\n- validate that this innovative data centre concept meets the energy efficiency, financial, reliability and other targets in near operational and real operational environments,\n- validate and improve the design software tools for modelling and simulating the operation of the facility and cooling equipment as well as the associated capital and operational costs,\n- demonstrate the results in a \u201cliving lab\u201d in a real environment to customers, end-users and other stakeholders,\n- demonstrate through accurate simulation that Boden Type DC can be replicated in other European states with less favourable climatic conditions.", 158471.0, 2698417.0, "BodenTypeDC", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_212134_915837723"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["6RE", "ECOCOOLING LTD", 158313.0, "Making the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system (32.04.03.01)", "fts_2017_14564", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "IP28"}
