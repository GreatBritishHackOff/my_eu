According to the European Wind Energy Technology Platform publication \u201cO&M strategies are based on periodic inspection; fault statistics from existing stock is either unavailable or insufficient; maintenance needs to be minimised through preventative strategies and tools like conditional monitoring; performance of offshore farms is severely impacted by poor reliability leading to major production losses.\u201d Turbines are not achieving a design life of 20 years with failure rates of >1/turbine/year, remote tall structures mean that maintenance and inspection is costly and difficult. Replacing a \u20ac3000 bearing can turn into a major \u20ac165,000 cost involving cranes, crews etc. For on-shore turbines operation and maintenance costs 10-15% of income over 20 years, rising for offshore to 20-25%. Intermittency of wind power also requires standby generation by open cycle gas turbines (aero-derivative units) in order to attain rapid start-up and load following capability. These units have markedly lower MTBF compared with steam and gas turbines. This consortium wish to develop a means to perform prognosis, diagnosis and root cause analysis of rotating machines via new time-frequency analysis techniques (based on higher order spectra) to the machine vibration signature during transient operation. This differs from classic techniques which have been applied to stationary signals. Thus we overcome the problems that components cannot be excited during steady state operation and precise resonance frequencies are not known. Our project will enable the prediction of component life based on measurements, not calculation even with the problematic nature of wind loads and through preventative maintenance dramatically reduce the maintenance costs within the industries mentioned.", 398242.0, 1140968.0, "MONITUR", "Preventive medicine for wind turbines", "Recent research demonstrates that, on average, wind turbines fail at least once per year causing tremendous loss of income and delivered power.

Current turbines are not reaching their design life of 20 years and operation and maintenance costs during those 20 years are prohibitively high. The EU-funded project http://www.monitur.eu (MONITUR) is developing improved condition monitoring technology to ensure European wind turbines make the grade.\n\nScientists are focusing on new time - frequency analyses and algorithms for rotating machines that differ from classical approaches applied to stationary signals. The novel methodology will enable more accurate prediction of component life based on experimental measurements rather than on calculations, dramatically reducing maintenance costs.\n\nThe team has created a special setup for shaker experiments that ensures vibrations are passed from shaker to blade without any interference or anomalies. A laser vibrometer measures blade velocity and an accelerometer on the shaker provides feedback for control.  A wind turbine widely used in Europe was purchased and assembled for in-field tests. The team has also developed a finite element model to extract blade frequency information.\n\nResearchers have now developed the MONITUR signal analysis algorithms for diagnosis, prognosis and root cause analysis. The open system architecture software platform exploiting these has been designed and tested. In parallel, the team has conducted research to identify dissemination and marketing opportunities and prepared a draft delineating patent (intellectual property rights) potential.\n\nThe equipment and services sector related to wind power is largely dominated by big companies. MONITUR intends to exploit opportunities for small- and medium-sized enterprises to make significant progress on well-defined problems with such online monitoring technology for wind turbines.

While these technologies offer some attraction to large scale enterprises, the ability of SMEs to afford this technology makes them an impractical solution. Furthermore these new heat treatment methods affect the chemical and physical structure of the timber, making it more brittle and reducing its physical strength while chemical preservation means that timber can only be used in external applications. We propose the development of a cost effective 2 stage system, firstly, the heat treatment process which will preserve the timber will use a novel microwave based technology to directly heat the timber. Secondly the development of a natural oil formulation to be applied directly to the hot timber within the heating chamber which will restore the natural mechanical and physical properties and maximise the opportunities.

Drilling processes are lubricated by a viscous oil/water invert emulsion known as drilling mud. Although Water Based Muds, (WBM), mostly are used in the top hole sections, down in the drilling/bore holes where temperatures can reach 200\u00baC, the mud used is still Oil Based Muds,( OBM) (mixture of 45% oil, 45% water and additives) or Synthetic Based Muds (SBM). The waste from the drilling process is a heavy sludge of rock, clay, sand and drilling mud (oil and brine). In 2004 the total amount cuttings from OBM and SBM generated on the Norwegian Shelf was nearly 250 000 tonnes cuttings and 45 000 tonnes drilling oil brought onshore. Recent operations in sensitive regions in the Barents sea even requires that WBM cannot be dumped and must be treated on-shore.

The market need for (HMW) products is currently served by Hyaluronic acid (HA) and cheaper alternatives derived from cellulose with properties inferior to HA. The manufacturers have currently to rely on few suppliers of the high-quality raw materials i.e. roosters bred on a special diet. The animal nature of the raw materials makes the SMEs particularly vulnerable in light of a bird flu outbreak, creating the threat of losing up to an entire year supply of the raw material with a single outbreak in the region. In addition, using raw materials of animal origin in humans requires compliance with existing EU regulations (EC 1774/2002 and Directive 90/426/EEC, and also Directive 86/609/EEC, 3 R\u2019s Declaration, and REACH).

Some of us have sent students and apprentices abroad for a couple of years and managed to build a reliable network of workplaces and strong partnerships (UK, Finland, Spain, Germany). Experienced and willing to make mobility accessible to a greater number of students, we want to encourage the expansion of the other members thanks to our network thus allowing more young people from modest backgrounds to go on work experience placements.\r\nOur mobility actions are aimed at vocational baccalaureate students and apprentices in Commerce, Customer Services, Sales, Logistics and vocational baccalaureate students in Business & Administration, Beauty & Care, Clothing Design and Metal Work. All the students are part of our European classes. They wish to gain professional and cultural skills in a foreign environment and raise their language level. Mobility experiences are real life experiences and assets to complete their training, adapt to the demands of the labour market and continue their studies.\r\nWe have planned to send 90 students and 30 apprentices, aged 17 to 20, over the next two years. We will send different groups of selected students together according to their lines and types of training. The baccalaureate students will stay for 4 weeks whereas the apprentices for 2 weeks owing to the legal obligations binding them to their employers in France. We will inform, advise and prepare them to live a comfortable work experience abroad. Our challenge will be to mix and gather the different types of students during linguistic, cultural and professional preparation sessions by pooling the teaching staff of our colleges (teachers, language assistants and civic service voluntary workers).

The teachers will organise and coordinate the students\u2019 stays by keeping close contacts with their tutors and the college partners. They will also accompany them on their trips and will pay on-the-spot visits to assess the students\u2019 progress along with their different partners. We will use and complete both national evaluation documents (official grids based on vocational baccalaureate frameworks) and the Europass assessment forms to validate the different skills acquired.
