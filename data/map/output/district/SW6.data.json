The innovative research strategy of obtaining epidemiological information from sewage has been pioneered by members of the SEWPROF team, and, although still in its infancy, is currently used to determine illicit drug use trends at community level via the analysis of urinary biomarkers in sewage. SEWPROF aims to advance knowledge of the epidemiology of (illicit) drug use and to bridge gaps in the available expertise with the ultimate goal of applying this cutting edge interdisciplinary approach within epidemiological studies of societal health. This conceptually simple but methodologically sophisticated epidemiological approach could become an early warning system for outbreaks of disease and a unique tool for the identification of hot-spots for pandemics.

The profile of the participants are youth workers from Ngo\u00b4s and public bodies who are involved in sexuality/relationships issues and advising all kinds of youngsters. \r\nThe training course is the developed further from the first edition of the training course Navigate your inner compass that was implemented in Munkviken, Sweden between the 3/ 4-10/ 4-2015.  we want to offer this developed version of the training course to more youth workers who wants to work around sexuality/norms and identity as a youth worker. \r\n\r\nInformation and facts about sexuality and the human body are essential for young people and play an important role in the learning process of sexuality. Nonetheless, information is not enough. Questions and issues regarding sexuality and relationships are essentially a question of identity. With this training course we want to extend the subject of sexuality beyond information and widen the perspective of the matter and connect sexuality to identity and discover values and norms in connection to sexuality on a societal, European, national and personal level. It is important for youngsters to think about and process their values, thoughts and knowledge in the area of sexuality and relationships. Further youth workers can play an important role in establishing a context and making life comprehensible for young people. From our approach a positive view on sexuality is crucial. Youth workers should avoid stigmatizing youngsters questions and concerns regarding the topic. In order for youth workers to create the safe environment were young people dare to ask questions in connection to sexuality, youth workers need to reflect on their own values. In addition, youth workers needs to try to be conscious about the messages, norms and moral stands which are given to young people in the topic of sexuality.\r\n\r\nAim:\r\nThe overall aim of the TC is to increase awareness among youth workers of the inner process and inner compass from a holistic approach (body, mind and heart) in connection to sexuality and identity, and to develop the capacity in supporting young people to explore this.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n-Discover which norms we have in connection to sexuality and identity  \r\n- Investigate how society and myself sees sexuality and how it influence young  people\r\n- Raise awareness of your own identity and your body in general and resources\r\n- Learn how to express  sexuality in words/communication and attitude\r\n- Explore how sexuality is seen in different European cultures\r\n- Share knowledge  and experience within the group about methods and tools for sexual education for young people.\r\n\r\nThis training course will be based on non-formal and informal education with a self-directed learning approach. The training course will be developed from the expectations and needs of the participants and the experience and knowledge from the trainers. The training course will be characterized by highly participatory, interactive and experiential methods. The activitied  will include case studies, working in pairs and small groups, nature-based activities, team building activities, discussions, workshops developed by the participants, reflection and self-assessment.\r\n\r\nAfter the first edition of this training course, we are convinced that this TC can really make an impact on the participants both on a personal and professional level. Further, after the TC the participants will be better prepared for questions from youngsters about sexuality/identity and relationships.The participants, will provide better guidance and support for young people and will become more resource from themselves, from their own feelings and experiences without the urge of telling about their private lives.

Bringing together for 6 days 28 representatives, with great knowledge and experience, from different countries will enrich the entire group energy and may extrapolate the results obtained to the specific context of the entities of the different participating countries. \r\nThey will engage in a variety of activities, focused on workshops in music and media, to apply in unemployment so that the young people can get to some ideas themselves through debates, discussions, which we believe will be very enriching, given the diversity of the participants.\r\nDebates , roundtables , exhibitions etc ... all of which will be made in a way where organizations can share their experiences and express doubts may be resolved with the group.\r\n\r\nThis first part with the youth workers will take place for 6 days and will act as a training for the second part that will be for the participants to create the actual music projects focusing on unemployment.\r\nIn the second activity (A2) , 38 young people from the 7 countries who attended the study visit , participate in a youth exchange that will take place in London, During the 7 days we will have very dynamic activities which will help the integration and enhance the presentation of the different groups , knowledge games , role playing , workshops , debates , planning, creating, visits to other local organizations and associations ...\r\nThese activities will include discussions and debates on the unemployment topic, issues surrounding its causes and possible solutions that each counties' participants are taking or planning to take and the positive and negative effects on young people and society and mainly will look at the unemployment problem in Europe and the music industry in today society. In addition, introduction and evaluation meetings will be held and, in the evaluation meetings we will try to arrive to a common possible solution that would suit all countries in Europe, so that we can promote at the same time the Union among European countries.\r\nCollaboration for a common goal such as participation in planning together will help many youth feel more empowered to make decisions , to interact and to look and or create work opportunities.\r\nTheir impressions, visions, experiences, activities and final show will be documented by music videos, and photos and presented in a documentary made by and for the youths.\r\nThe aim of the project is to provide young people with an opportunity to voice and share their opinions, as well as learning new skills while creating original items that reflect their own identity and individual cultural influences, focusing on the way their countries fight this problem. We also consider that after this project, the participants will achieve professional skills which will help them in their professional development, and improve their employability.

Important parts of our education are the various practical trainings. In these practical trainings our students get to know different areas of social work and also acquire social skills. Our students take the A-level exam and acquire practical, social and economic education. The objective of the project is the possibility to support 37 students to do their internship abroad. By participating in this mobility project, the students will expand their own abilities and skills, and hopefully gain financial support. At the time of the participation in this project our students already have at least 200 hours of practical work experience in an Austrian social institution and so they already have a good level of training. This allows the students to broaden their professional and personal horizons and to strengthen their language skills for working life. They also get to know a variety of innovative concepts and methods of social work in other European countries.

Though Gender Equality is more than ever becoming reality there is a long way to go. Women continue to earn and decide less and there is only one area where women count more than men - in the records of victims of violence. Women are still underrepresented, they earn less, and, worst of all, one in three women in the European Union has experienced physical and sexual violence. Also regarding the rights and acceptation of homosexuality and transsexualism there is still a long way to go.  The European Union deserves credit for having tackled these issues for a long time, however, the gender equality situation both in the EU and the Neighboring countries, especially in Eastern Europe and Caucasus remains unsatisfactory. Conservative, discriminating values are hard to tackle, with clearly defined roles for men and women, gender stereotypes and issues with the expression of gender identity and sexual orientation.  It is very important to enable youth workers and young leaders to feel and reflect about the power of gender and gender roles by giving them space to discuss, debate and learn more about the topic that often remains undiscussed. That is why with this Training Course we would like to tackle these issues and look for solutions in our organizations and daily lives.

It will take place in Tatev, Armenia. Through the participation in different scale of activities as discussions, presentations, field visits, participants will exchange their skills and experiences on gender mainstreaming, gender discrimination, gender violence and gender perspectives in different parts of Europe and will know more about realities in Eastern Europe and Caucasus region. This will be unique platform for sharing practices and exchanging realities. Developing further projects and strategies for the promotion of Gender Equality on European and national levels will be the main outcome for the organizations involved in the project. Furthermore, we will discover what has been done so far and the role of youth work and youth organizations in the promotion of Gender Equality.

The LAB offers time and space for research, mapping, bodily experiences, lectures, brainstorming and evaluation to develop new ideas and to strengthen competences and skills and knowledge of workers and management in the social- and cultural organisations for further use.By getting an insight and personal experiences on several artistic disciplines and their perspectives participants will get experiences in communication beside our language, to express what is not possible through words or equal to different languages. They will sensitize perception on themselves, colleagues and situations. Experiencing pleasure during the process of learning will motivate them to carry on with skills learned and to motivate young persons to detect their interest.

It is our belief that it is quite important to have a cultural and social connection with the neighbours around the EU in order to contribute to more understanding. Thanks to the meetings between young people and active youth workers, they can learn about the ways of living in other countries and different ways of thinking. In this way we can overcome differences and fight together against prejudice and xenophobia. That is why with this Training Course we target both the EU and non-EU countries. The training course will take place in Yerevan, Armenia and will involve 34 youth workers from Programme Countries (Lithuania, Croatia, Czech Republic, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom) and Neighbouring Partner Countries (Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, FYR Macedonia, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine). During the Training Course we will look deeper into the issues of extremism, migration, discrimination, nationalism, intolerance and intercultural misunderstandings. The Training Course will support young people and active youth workers to learn about the ways of living together, accepting differences and fighting together against prejudice and xenophobia in these turbulent times. In all participating countries, xenophobia and discrimination form a big problem. Especially economic crisis contributes to this situation, when immigrants are blamed for stealing jobs, etc. The refugee crisis even further complicated the situation. However, it doesn\u2019t matter if you come from the EU or non-EU country, what language you speak or which religion you follow, there is discrimination and extremism everywhere. This project aims at finding ways to combat it, by sharing experiences and by learning new tools. Our working methodology will be based on non-formal education. With this Training Course we aim to empower youth workers and youth leaders with skills, knowledge and attitudes to play an active role towards an intercultural society. Our objectives are the following:\u2022 To analyse today\u2019s multicultural society in different countries;\u2022To gain knowledge on key concepts, such as stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination, extremism, intolerance;\u2022 To understand the causes of extremism and where they develop; \u2022 To analyse the European values and how they can be used in contrasting those phenomena.\u2022 To discover the right attitudes towards an intercultural society;\u2022 To promote \u2018theatre of the oppressed\u2019 and \u2018the human library\u2019 as a tool;\u2022 To promote active citizenship, international dialogue and non-formal education. \u2022 To overview the European programs and create new projects related to the topic.Through exercises, discussions, presentation of examples of good practices, youth policies in the field of combating discrimination and promoting multiculturalism, we want to encourage peer learning and inspire youth workers to discuss follow-up and take action in their own countries following the Training Course. Moreover, during the TC special attention will be paid to developing skills and competencies of the participants that are needed when working with young people, especially people with fewer opportunities and empowering them to make real change in their local communities and societies.", "http://www.nicolaarts.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-LT02-KA105-004542_6"], ["1BU", "Act Social, Think Global!", "NEW INTERNATIONAL COMPANY OF LIVE ARTS", 39352.0, "Act Social - Thik Global! is a project composed of two activities: Evs mobilities and PBA.It deals with the following main themes: volunteering and intercultural learning in social and educational contexts.

The PBA will be useful also to plan future collaborations. Since the PBA will be in Sciacca, the impact within the local community will be strong and relevant to let the locals better understand all the opportunities related to Erasmus+ and it will also raise awareness about Evs opportunities and all the others mobilities chances offered and promoted by the Programme.

The project idea originates from the constant contact and confrontation with students, recent graduates, VET staff, companies, stakeholders and public and private Institutions.The strong information activity on the learning and mobility opportunities offered by European Programs, carried out at national level, through seminars, infodays and meetings, permitted  Essenia UETP srl to understand the needs of the job market and the education world as well. Starting from this confrontation and sensitization activity, a need analysis has been carried out. It made it clear, then, that the tourist sector is one of the greatest factors of development: although it is historically and structurally relevant in the local and in the Italian context, it still needs to be strenghtened  by means of updated  and reinforced professional competences for the recent graduates and the staff of VET organisations. Carrying out traineeships and training abroad represents a way of acquiring such competences. To guarantee the compliance of the project with the needs observed and to contribute to make the competences acquired by the participants during the mobility experiences more spendable on the labour market, Essenia has been strenghtening its network of local partners, reinforcing also the collaboration with the bodies in charge of implementing the approaches and of adopting European methodologies and tools for the certification and validation of the formal and informal competences (ECVET).Besides the acquisition of professional competences related to the touristic sector, the project contributes to strenghten the  European identity and to enhance linguistic and intercultural competences, developing in the participants a set of personal and transversal skills  which are indispensable to be included in an increasingly globalized and constantly evolving  job market. Therefore, Essenia has planned to realize, during the linguistic and cultural preparation phase, linguistic training courses aimed at reinforcing the knowledge of the sectorial languages. The partnership of the project is composed by organizations with whom Essenia has solid relationships, as well as new members, included to favour Essenia's European and international dimension. In the project Portugal has been identified as one of the Countries with which to activate sinergies, according to the internationalization strategy.

These radical activities are carried out by young extremists who have been educated in democratic societies and whose ascendancy comes, in most cases, from North Africa. These young people are captured by organisations to commit radical acts in the name of religion once they have abandoned their democratic ideas. This is the result of social issues such as unemployment, marginalization or economic difficulties.\r\n\r\nNowadays, this phenomenon is expanding rapidly among young groups and the UN warns of this serious problem as it poses a significant threat to international peace and security. Here, youth organizations play an important role in spreading ideas, promoting a good reasoning and fostering anti-radical behaviours. Their objectives are as follows: to encourage a democratic recovery, to promote media education and a critical thinking, to define conflict resolution patterns, to respect others' views, and to decode fanatical and radical attitudes for religious reasons.\r\n\r\nThe project will take place in Madrid, Spain, from 10th to 15th July 2017, and 28 young people who work with youngsters susceptible of being captured will participate. We will invite a total of 13 countries from Europe, including partners from Mediterranean Area\r\n\r\nThe prevention and decoding of attitudes and behaviours connected with religious fanaticism among young Europeans, the exchange and development of good practices creating a network of international associations with different competent bodies that could serve as a multiplying effect will be promoted.\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC OBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nTo promote reasonable judgments and objectivity against religious fanaticism, promoting peace, harmony and respect between different cultures.\r\n\r\nTo improve and disseminate proposals on the risk posed by the radicalization of the European youth and to inculcate ideas that prevent these young people from being captured and recruited by extremist networks.\r\n\r\nTo learn best practices for the drafting of new projects aimed at young people at risk of being radicalised, with the support of the Erasmus+: Youth in Action programme.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo create a network of organisations to work together, both in the long and in the short term, from an anti-religious perspective. The goal will be starting a multiplier effect in order to strengthen and improve their role at the local, national and international level.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo reinforce the democratic thinking and behaviour among all young Europeans.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these objectives are among the priorities of the Erasmus+ programme, which supports hate speech initiatives that are essential for living together in a peaceful and harmonious society.\r\n\r\nThe methodology will be based on interactive learning, as well as in personal and social autonomy skills, together with a mix of theoretical contents and practical exercises, evaluations, group and plenary debates, video presentations, informative talks, documentaries, personal experiences, brainstorming, etc. Learning will come from the experience and reflection of each participant, as well as from the group work. This project will be structured on theoretical and practical contributions according to the experimental learning, supported by different sessions in which the competences acquired will be evaluated - i. e., the participants will receive feedback. At the same time, we will share tools and establish foundations to make an impact at the local, regional, national and European level.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course activities will be based on the principles and values of non-formal education taking into account the needs, motivation and experience of the participants. The expected result is the establishment of an international network that works and collaborates in the creation of new values and attitudes against religious anti-radicalism among young Europeans.

We will bring together 30 18-to-30-year-old young people, 7 group leaders with no age limit, 2 trainers and facilitators from Tunisia, United Kingdom, Jordan, Italy, Turkey, Macedonia and Spain. The purpose of the project is to support and strengthen the contributions being developed in the field of social inclusion among young people through the promotion of physical education and sports as an integrating element of a democratic and multiethnic European society.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe social integration of young immigrants is a necessity for all nations, because borders are closer and closer every day, and societies are more pluralistic (especially in cities where a large number of migrants live, such as Madrid or other cities of the world). Therefore, it is important to channel that demand.\r\n\r\nAdministrations invest a great amount of money and resources in the social insertion of young immigrants, but from our point of view, this is not very effective. The results are practically zero, as can be seen in the \"ghettos\" established in different neighborhoods of main cities.\r\n\r\nThe ERASMUS + program: Youth in Action can be an alternative and effective way to contribute to the resolution of this conflict and to a real social inclusion solution at the local, national and international level. We consider that both sport and physical education can be an integrating element among young people because of the following factors:\r\n\r\n.- It encourages socialization, which helps youngsters share experiences in order to experience a common activity.\r\n.- It serves as a channel for improving self-esteem and mood.\r\n.- It increases the value of effort and improvement.\r\n.- It contributes to good health and a healthy life.\r\n.- It promotes the resolution of problems and setbacks among young people.\r\n.- It contributes to reinforce personal values and gratification.\r\n.- It contributes to the learning of the language of the host country, which is one of the main difficulties that they face.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work methodology is based on non-formal education, guided by the group leader, which allows all participants to play an active role in acquiring good practices, promoting knowledge enhancement and setting up new participatory networks so all young people are socially integrated.\r\n\r\nThe program will consist of workshops, conferences, physical and sports activities, debates, talks, video-making activities, role plays, day visits, etc.\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\r\nRaise awareness among all young people between the ages of 18 and 30 about the importance of social integration of multiethnic people in modern and democratic societies using sports and physical education as a channel.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES \r\n.- To promote partnerships and communication strategies to give greater visibility to the ERASMUS + program: Youth in Action as an effective means to support the social integration of all young people. \r\n.- To support the recognition of the problem, the need for the social integration of young people, analyze the problem and give it the importance that it has to later implement the necessary corrective measures. \r\n.- To create a balanced network of cooperation at the local, national and international level in order to spread European values. \r\n.- To raise awareness among youth policy-makers and those in charge of sports centers of the importance of sports for the social integration of all young people. \r\n.- That the good practices learned serve to create new sports and integrating alliances in clubs or other sports centers. \r\n.- That this project serves to benefit from all the values and benefits offered by physical activities and sports. \r\n.- That this project helps to enhance the knowledge of the language through the promotion of social relations or literacy activities. \r\n.- To serve as a link for the channeling of new activities of social inclusion of immigrants within sports centers and clubs in all partner countries participating in the project, creating, in turn, new initiatives.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve all the objectives, the level of participation of all the partners in each one of the phases of the project will be stimulated.

Its main objectives are the AWARENESS of the need to eradicate the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM), the promotion of the HUMAN RIGHTS OF WOMEN and their EMPOWERMENT.\r\nFemale ablation is a priority issue for United Nations and in its resolution; WHA61.16 of December 2012 prohibits its practice. According to the latest Unicef data, it is estimated that at least 200 million women and girls worldwide have suffered. In Africa, it is still practiced today in 26 of the 46 countries in a standardized and cultural way. It is a violation of the human rights of women and poses a serious threat to their physical and psychological health.\r\n\r\nFGM is still socially accepted in many countries, especially among the most disadvantaged ones, where cultural traditions are deeply rooted. The same social and family group puts pressure on them, in fact, if they do not practice it, they will be rejected from the society.\r\nThe implementation and design of this project is a support and reinforcement of other initiatives carried out in this field by international organizations such as the work of CONEMUND in Egypt in defense of the rights of women and girls.\r\nFor this reason, we have chosen partners from Euromed countries and other EU, in order to produce a feedback of good practice.

It can also impact on person\u2019s ability to join in everyday activities. Communication is the main way we interact and express our needs, likes and dislikes. If communication is a problem, it can be very frustrating for the person and may result in challenging behaviour. Challenging behaviour is often seen in people coming from a difficult background  or in people with conditions that affect communication and the brain such as learning disabilities and mental health problems.  \r\n\r\nA person with challenging behaviour is not a \u2018problem\u2019 to be fixed and is not doing something \u2018wrong\u2019.

It is not always easy to identify this lacuna making it difficult for the professionals working with them. In fact, the issues of challenging behaviour and how to deal with it were continuously brought up during our last project. The youth workers and youth leaders expressed the need to be given a new and fresh approach on how they should tackle young people with challenging behaviour. Often, the youth workers and youth leaders are faced with questions such as Are there new ways to include our young people with challenging behaviour? Can we find an alternative to exclusion? and How should a relationship with young people with challenging behaviour be?\r\n\r\nIndeed, FABRIC: Fresh Approaches to Behaviour and Relationship when working with young people with challenging behaviour aims to provide a practical guide to successful innovative strategies for improving behaviour and strengthening relationships for young people with challenging behaviour. What this training course aims to achieve is to equip youth workers with new skills that go beyond a rewards and sanctions approach to behaviour. In fact, our focus will be on those young people for whom rewards and punishments do not always work and who, most of the times, confuse those that work with them. We aim to take a relationship-based approach and to give participants an opportunity to think more deeply about why young people do the things they do and what our parts as adults is in creating, sustaining and changing these behaviours.\r\n\r\nThe training will thus give participants opportunities to reflect on their attitudes and practice in relation to young people\u2019s behaviour and relationship-building. Through innovative tools and methods, the participants will understand positive behaviour change and how this can be used to work with young people who are normally difficult to work with. Our aim is to empower youth workers and to inspire and uplift them through practical tips and techniques. This will be done by addressing the following objectives:\r\n\r\n- Reinforce and affirm good practice\r\n- Re-energise, stimulate and challenge thinking about inclusion of young people with challenging behaviour\r\n- Increased understanding about behaviour and emotions\r\n- Increased confidence in managing young people with challenging behaviour\r\n- Access to a wider range of practical strategies to impact on behaviour challenges\r\n- Opportunity to  reflect on professional attitudes\r\n- Learn new skills and processes\r\n\r\nThis training course will take place in Malta between the 5 - 11 November 2017.
