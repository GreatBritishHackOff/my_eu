The innovative research strategy of obtaining epidemiological information from sewage has been pioneered by members of the SEWPROF team, and, although still in its infancy, is currently used to determine illicit drug use trends at community level via the analysis of urinary biomarkers in sewage. SEWPROF aims to advance knowledge of the epidemiology of (illicit) drug use and to bridge gaps in the available expertise with the ultimate goal of applying this cutting edge interdisciplinary approach within epidemiological studies of societal health. This conceptually simple but methodologically sophisticated epidemiological approach could become an early warning system for outbreaks of disease and a unique tool for the identification of hot-spots for pandemics.

Those organizations have extensive experience in the design and implementation of programs promoting   intercultural policies for young people in various educational, professional and social fields.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\n A wide variety of experiential and interdisciplinary methods will be used: workshops, simulations, role-play, exercises, getting to know-interactive games, thinking aloud processes, reflective questions, reconstructing information,e.t.c\r\n\r\nIT IS EXPECTED:\r\n 1. Workers to familiarize with young people, under the principles of human rights and equal opportunities, in order to motivate, inspire and inform the youth in diversity issues, \r\n2. To acquire basic advocacy and assertion skills of their rights (self-advocacy), \r\n3. To broaden their knowledge in conflict management, prevention and response to violence / delinquency (therapeutic justice),\r\n 4. To foster the \"getting to know each other\", the expression and sharing of feelings, the altruistic behavior so as \r\n5. To make modern society friendlier to the \"diverse \", whether it is disability or ethnicity.\r\n\r\nFINALLY, all public participating organizations and NGOs, by focusing not only on one person\u2019s but as well as on the team\u2019s self-regulation capacity, will be given the possibility to act as social mediators and multipliers and shape through time those attitudes and behaviors that characterize the active citizen (informed citizen, critical thinking, creative flair, respect towards the laws and the human rights, strong sense of responsibility, social justice, acceptance, tolerance, etc \u2026..)", "http://www.nicolaarts.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-EL02-KA105-002989_13"], ["1BU", "JOVENES EUROPEOS, !ABRID LOS OJOS!", "NEW INTERNATIONAL COMPANY OF LIVE ARTS", 16692.0, "\u201cYOUNG EUROPEANS, OPEN YOUR EYES!\u201d is a training course that stems from the need to eradicate the serious wave of terror attacks and the behaviour of extremists, which can be identified all over Europe and are related to religious radicalism activities. These radical activities are carried out by young extremists who have been educated in democratic societies and whose ascendancy comes, in most cases, from North Africa. These young people are captured by organisations to commit radical acts in the name of religion once they have abandoned their democratic ideas. This is the result of social issues such as unemployment, marginalization or economic difficulties.\r\n\r\nNowadays, this phenomenon is expanding rapidly among young groups and the UN warns of this serious problem as it poses a significant threat to international peace and security. Here, youth organizations play an important role in spreading ideas, promoting a good reasoning and fostering anti-radical behaviours. Their objectives are as follows: to encourage a democratic recovery, to promote media education and a critical thinking, to define conflict resolution patterns, to respect others' views, and to decode fanatical and radical attitudes for religious reasons.\r\n\r\nThe project will take place in Madrid, Spain, from 10th to 15th July 2017, and 28 young people who work with youngsters susceptible of being captured will participate. We will invite a total of 13 countries from Europe, including partners from Mediterranean Area\r\n\r\nThe prevention and decoding of attitudes and behaviours connected with religious fanaticism among young Europeans, the exchange and development of good practices creating a network of international associations with different competent bodies that could serve as a multiplying effect will be promoted.\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC OBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nTo promote reasonable judgments and objectivity against religious fanaticism, promoting peace, harmony and respect between different cultures.\r\n\r\nTo improve and disseminate proposals on the risk posed by the radicalization of the European youth and to inculcate ideas that prevent these young people from being captured and recruited by extremist networks.\r\n\r\nTo learn best practices for the drafting of new projects aimed at young people at risk of being radicalised, with the support of the Erasmus+: Youth in Action programme.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo create a network of organisations to work together, both in the long and in the short term, from an anti-religious perspective. The goal will be starting a multiplier effect in order to strengthen and improve their role at the local, national and international level.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo reinforce the democratic thinking and behaviour among all young Europeans.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these objectives are among the priorities of the Erasmus+ programme, which supports hate speech initiatives that are essential for living together in a peaceful and harmonious society.\r\n\r\nThe methodology will be based on interactive learning, as well as in personal and social autonomy skills, together with a mix of theoretical contents and practical exercises, evaluations, group and plenary debates, video presentations, informative talks, documentaries, personal experiences, brainstorming, etc. Learning will come from the experience and reflection of each participant, as well as from the group work. This project will be structured on theoretical and practical contributions according to the experimental learning, supported by different sessions in which the competences acquired will be evaluated - i. e., the participants will receive feedback. At the same time, we will share tools and establish foundations to make an impact at the local, regional, national and European level.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course activities will be based on the principles and values of non-formal education taking into account the needs, motivation and experience of the participants. The expected result is the establishment of an international network that works and collaborates in the creation of new values and attitudes against religious anti-radicalism among young Europeans. The level of involvement of participants and partners will be actively stimulated in all phases of the project through the \"give and take\" principle and through participatory learning methods of non-formal education. The communication will be made possible through social networks and will last after the completion of the project. The main language to be used during the project will be English.

We will bring together 30 18-to-30-year-old young people, 7 group leaders with no age limit, 2 trainers and facilitators from Tunisia, United Kingdom, Jordan, Italy, Turkey, Macedonia and Spain. The purpose of the project is to support and strengthen the contributions being developed in the field of social inclusion among young people through the promotion of physical education and sports as an integrating element of a democratic and multiethnic European society.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe social integration of young immigrants is a necessity for all nations, because borders are closer and closer every day, and societies are more pluralistic (especially in cities where a large number of migrants live, such as Madrid or other cities of the world). Therefore, it is important to channel that demand.\r\n\r\nAdministrations invest a great amount of money and resources in the social insertion of young immigrants, but from our point of view, this is not very effective. The results are practically zero, as can be seen in the \"ghettos\" established in different neighborhoods of main cities.\r\n\r\nThe ERASMUS + program: Youth in Action can be an alternative and effective way to contribute to the resolution of this conflict and to a real social inclusion solution at the local, national and international level. We consider that both sport and physical education can be an integrating element among young people because of the following factors:\r\n\r\n.- It encourages socialization, which helps youngsters share experiences in order to experience a common activity.\r\n.- It serves as a channel for improving self-esteem and mood.\r\n.- It increases the value of effort and improvement.\r\n.- It contributes to good health and a healthy life.\r\n.- It promotes the resolution of problems and setbacks among young people.\r\n.- It contributes to reinforce personal values and gratification.\r\n.- It contributes to the learning of the language of the host country, which is one of the main difficulties that they face.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work methodology is based on non-formal education, guided by the group leader, which allows all participants to play an active role in acquiring good practices, promoting knowledge enhancement and setting up new participatory networks so all young people are socially integrated.\r\n\r\nThe program will consist of workshops, conferences, physical and sports activities, debates, talks, video-making activities, role plays, day visits, etc.\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\r\nRaise awareness among all young people between the ages of 18 and 30 about the importance of social integration of multiethnic people in modern and democratic societies using sports and physical education as a channel.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES \r\n.- To promote partnerships and communication strategies to give greater visibility to the ERASMUS + program: Youth in Action as an effective means to support the social integration of all young people. \r\n.- To support the recognition of the problem, the need for the social integration of young people, analyze the problem and give it the importance that it has to later implement the necessary corrective measures. \r\n.- To create a balanced network of cooperation at the local, national and international level in order to spread European values. \r\n.- To raise awareness among youth policy-makers and those in charge of sports centers of the importance of sports for the social integration of all young people. \r\n.- That the good practices learned serve to create new sports and integrating alliances in clubs or other sports centers. \r\n.- That this project serves to benefit from all the values and benefits offered by physical activities and sports. \r\n.- That this project helps to enhance the knowledge of the language through the promotion of social relations or literacy activities. \r\n.- To serve as a link for the channeling of new activities of social inclusion of immigrants within sports centers and clubs in all partner countries participating in the project, creating, in turn, new initiatives.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve all the objectives, the level of participation of all the partners in each one of the phases of the project will be stimulated. The results of this youth exchange will serve as a multiplier effect between participants and all young people in general terms to use sports as an instrument and means of socialization, as well as to enable the social integration of people at risk of social exclusion and facilitate the insertion of marginal and disadvantaged groups in society.", "http://www.nicolaarts.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES02-KA105-009163_5"], ["1BU", "JOVEN, !APRENDE A DECIR NO!", "NEW INTERNATIONAL COMPANY OF LIVE ARTS", 10588.0, "The project \"Young, learn to say no!\u201d is a Training Course whose activity will take place in the municipality of Mataelpino (Madrid) from 4 to 9 December 2017 at the hotel\" BlueSense\".

Its main objectives are the AWARENESS of the need to eradicate the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM), the promotion of the HUMAN RIGHTS OF WOMEN and their EMPOWERMENT.\r\nFemale ablation is a priority issue for United Nations and in its resolution; WHA61.16 of December 2012 prohibits its practice. According to the latest Unicef data, it is estimated that at least 200 million women and girls worldwide have suffered. In Africa, it is still practiced today in 26 of the 46 countries in a standardized and cultural way. It is a violation of the human rights of women and poses a serious threat to their physical and psychological health.\r\n\r\nFGM is still socially accepted in many countries, especially among the most disadvantaged ones, where cultural traditions are deeply rooted. The same social and family group puts pressure on them, in fact, if they do not practice it, they will be rejected from the society.\r\nThe implementation and design of this project is a support and reinforcement of other initiatives carried out in this field by international organizations such as the work of CONEMUND in Egypt in defense of the rights of women and girls.\r\nFor this reason, we have chosen partners from Euromed countries and other EU, in order to produce a feedback of good practice. At the same time, we have signed an internal collaboration agreement to guarantee that the design and the good progress of the project will be effective. \r\n\r\nIt is a 5-day training of education and learning activity.Youth workers from different organizations, two trainers and facilitators will attend.

It can also impact on person\u2019s ability to join in everyday activities. Communication is the main way we interact and express our needs, likes and dislikes. If communication is a problem, it can be very frustrating for the person and may result in challenging behaviour. Challenging behaviour is often seen in people coming from a difficult background  or in people with conditions that affect communication and the brain such as learning disabilities and mental health problems.  \r\n\r\nA person with challenging behaviour is not a \u2018problem\u2019 to be fixed and is not doing something \u2018wrong\u2019. However, behaviour is a sign that something is not working. It shows that there is some unfulfilled need or a problem with communication. It is not always easy to identify this lacuna making it difficult for the professionals working with them. In fact, the issues of challenging behaviour and how to deal with it were continuously brought up during our last project. The youth workers and youth leaders expressed the need to be given a new and fresh approach on how they should tackle young people with challenging behaviour. Often, the youth workers and youth leaders are faced with questions such as Are there new ways to include our young people with challenging behaviour? Can we find an alternative to exclusion? and How should a relationship with young people with challenging behaviour be?\r\n\r\nIndeed, FABRIC: Fresh Approaches to Behaviour and Relationship when working with young people with challenging behaviour aims to provide a practical guide to successful innovative strategies for improving behaviour and strengthening relationships for young people with challenging behaviour. What this training course aims to achieve is to equip youth workers with new skills that go beyond a rewards and sanctions approach to behaviour. In fact, our focus will be on those young people for whom rewards and punishments do not always work and who, most of the times, confuse those that work with them. We aim to take a relationship-based approach and to give participants an opportunity to think more deeply about why young people do the things they do and what our parts as adults is in creating, sustaining and changing these behaviours.\r\n\r\nThe training will thus give participants opportunities to reflect on their attitudes and practice in relation to young people\u2019s behaviour and relationship-building. Through innovative tools and methods, the participants will understand positive behaviour change and how this can be used to work with young people who are normally difficult to work with. Our aim is to empower youth workers and to inspire and uplift them through practical tips and techniques. This will be done by addressing the following objectives:\r\n\r\n- Reinforce and affirm good practice\r\n- Re-energise, stimulate and challenge thinking about inclusion of young people with challenging behaviour\r\n- Increased understanding about behaviour and emotions\r\n- Increased confidence in managing young people with challenging behaviour\r\n- Access to a wider range of practical strategies to impact on behaviour challenges\r\n- Opportunity to  reflect on professional attitudes\r\n- Learn new skills and processes\r\n\r\nThis training course will take place in Malta between the 5 - 11 November 2017.
