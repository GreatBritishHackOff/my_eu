One approach was to adapt a lean manufacturing concept (meaning to reduce production waste) to rail usage. The concept was applied to key track maintenance processes, including tamping, grinding, and switches and crossings (S&C) maintenance. Initial comparison of best practices of several European rail agencies highlighted potential technologies that could reduce maintenance times.\n\nA second area of focus was inspection technologies. The project concluded that continuous, daily track monitoring was possible using in-service trains running at normal speeds. Project partners developed a laser-based trolley for assessing S&Cs, and the associated algorithms. The project's switch inspection device will also be able to monitor tack geometry. The prototype was shown to be able to assess approximately 130 switches per night, compared with 5 per day using traditional methods. The new method does not disrupt rail traffic and has no safety concerns.\n\nThe project also applied a lean analysis to typical grinding shifts, and identified several efficiency improvements. Measures included encouraging use of track-friendly vehicle designs, setting maintenance targets that address repair longevity, and setting performance standards that do not damage rails. AUTOMAIN also suggested similar improvements to servicing of modular S&Cs, and to planning and scheduling.\n\nInnovative improvements highlighted by the project reduce the maintenance track possession time by up to 40\u00a0%.

Buildings hold a large untapped potential for renewables and energy efficiency in order to decarbonise the EU economy, to ensure security of supply and to provide cost savings to EU households and businesses alike. In this context, Shallow Geothermal Energy Systems (SGES) are a stable, reliable and renewable energy source with some key features compared to many other RES: being available everywhere and being capable of providing not only heating, but also cooling with unparalleled efficiency. Amongst SGES, closed loop systems with vertical Borehole Heat Exchangers enjoy the widest deployment in the EU where the total installed number of GSHP units amounts nowadays to about 1,4 million, representing an installed capacity of about 16.500 MWth. Against this background, there is still a need to remove market barriers and gain competitiveness, but also to develop the next generation of geothermal systems with new materials for penetrating further the market of building construction and renovation. Also the area of District Heating and Cooling needs improved heating and cooling storage technologies which could largely benefit from enhanced Underground Thermal Energy Storage (UTES) technologies. By a smart combination of different material solutions under the umbrella of sophisticated engineering, optimization, testing and on-site validation, GEOCOND will develop solutions to increase the thermal performance of the different subsystems configuring an SGES and UTES. An overall cost reduction of about 25% is the overall aim, leading to a substantial gain in competitiveness. GEOCOND, with a unique consortium of Companies and leading Reseach Institutions in the area of SGES and Materials, will focus on four key development areas in a synergeic and system-wide approach: development of new pipe materials, advanced grouting additives and concepts, advanced Phase Change Materials and system-wide simulation and optimization.", 414379.0, 3457717.0, "GEOCOND", null, null, null, null, "http://www.exergy.uk.com", null, "h2020_209743_958260479"], ["5FB", "Transition paths to sustainable legume based systems in Europe", "Coventry University", "TRUE - (TRansition paths to sUstainable legume based systems in Europe) is a 24 partner consortium covering business and society actors from legume commodity production, processing, and citizens.
