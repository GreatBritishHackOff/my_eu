It has 32 teachers and 250 students\r\nThe project \"New Learners, New Methodologies\" will be developed during two years and it's created because of our students' needs to improve their language skills and their Key Competence. \r\nReading and listening are not only essential to the learning of a language, but to understand all the subjects. It's just the same with writing and speaking.\r\nConsequently, we will work to improve these skills and Key Competences, ataking into account the new law, fostering our students' motivation, trying to improve the results; and paying attention to different learning styles.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will foster the following aims:\r\n\r\n-To develop a motivating and effective methodology\r\n-To improve diversity messures\r\n-To foster the skills and Key Competences of all the students\r\n-T promote the use of new technologies\r\n-To work new methodologies as the Communicative Method, Gamification, Project-Based-Learning, Flipped Classroom, Role-Playing, Visual Thinking and new technologies\r\n-To reduce school-leaving\r\n-To create European contacts and a possible k2 action in the future\r\n-To improve teachers' innovation \r\n-To create a Linguistic Project at school\r\n-Tcompare different  education systems \r\n-To forster tolerance and respect towards other cultures\r\n\r\nA big number of teachers at our school will participate in this project: Geography and History, Biology and Geology, P.E, Music, languages (Spanish, English and French), and reinforcement teachers who attend special needs.\r\nWe will learn theory about new methodolgies and we will go job shadowing to different countries in order to observe examples of Good Practives and to implement them at our school .\r\nAs a result of that, we will motivate our learners, who will continue their formation, reducing school leaving. We will foster key competences, new methodologies and diversity.\r\n\r\nWe wil create a work group to create activities related with these topics; while we follow several specific courses about languages, new technologies and new methodologies. The participants will also do job shadowing in the following places: Finland (Project Based Learning and Gamification, Rumania (Visual Thinking and Role-playing), The United Kingdom (Communicative Language), \r\n Slovakia(diversity) , Bulgaria (Flipped Classroom), Italy (New Technologies).\r\n\r\nThis project will have a deep impact on teachers and learners, improving teaching and results; fostering inclussion and diversity through new methodologies\r\nBesides, the students will be able to take profit of materials from other countries and they will have the possibility of working on future k2 actions.\r\nFinally, we will create a Linguistic Project including all these matters.", "http://www.franklin.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-036099_2"], ["5BQ", "Creative Arts Traineeships for Employment", "Grimsby Institute of Further and Higher Education", 26400.0, "The cultural and creative sector is one of Europe\u2019s greatest strengths: it is a source of values and identity, it contributes to people\u2019s wellbeing and drives economic growth and job creation. The Lisbon Treaty states that the EU \u201cshall contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common heritage to the fore\u201d (Article 167). The creative sector will only flourish with underpinning training and skills, which \u201copen doors to personal fulfilment and development, social inclusion, active citizenship and employment\u201d (EC: A New Skills Agenda for Europe, 2016). Grimsby Institute is committed to both building upon its proud heritage of cultural industries skills training and to strengthening social mobility through education in an area of endemic multiple deprivation. With forecasts of unprecedented skills needs in digital and creative industries by 2025 (Cedefop), and unparalleled number of UK graduates working in creative industries across Europe (UKCES), we are modernising curriculum for Digital and Creative Industries, working more closely with employers and learning from European best practice in order to achieve the best possible outcomes for our students, and ultimately transform lives.\r\n \r\nCreative Traineeships for Employment (CREATE) will raise 12 BTEC Art and Media students\u2019 skills, employability, achievement and aspiration by providing them with practical experience of working abroad and exposure to European language and culture. The CREATE project is designed to provide a \u2018bite sized\u2019 3-week encounter which can be integrated within the 2-year course structure and challenges students to push personal boundaries and develop new perspectives from the baseline of their own personal experience. In Jan/Feb 2018, 6 students will be hosted by a leading VET provider in Malta (MCAST) and 6 students will be hosted by an experienced German VET provider, becoming immersed in European culture through living with host families, being introduced to some of the world\u2019s most important cultural sights and experiencing the world of work through 3-days per week placed in industry. The Maltese mobility will also provide the \u2018once in a lifetime\u2019 opportunity for budding artists to experience Valletta: City of Culture 2018, and support the European creative community through volunteering placements facilitated by MCAST. CREATE will help students to develop the transversal skills that are crucial to \u201cfacilitating the transition into employment maintaining the workforce\u201d (EC: A New Skills Agenda for Europe, 2016). CREATE stands for:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Confidence - self-motivation and ability to generate self-belief in personal capabilities\r\n\u2022 Resilience - the ability to adjust to pressure and adapt to changes in circumstances.\r\n\u2022 Explore and solve problems - the ability to research and select information, think creatively and generate solutions. \r\n\u2022 Autonomy and initiative - the ability to evaluate and calculate risks and identify options for successful outcomes. \r\n\u2022 Teamwork - the ability to collaborate, share knowledge and build team engagement in order to achieve a common goal. \r\n\u2022 Establish, organise, plan - the ability to prioritise, manage timelines, and coordinate tasks.\r\n\r\nCREATE will also benefit up to 400 non-mobile BTEC Art and Design students, who will realise the opportunity to develop their intercultural skills and maintain \u2018virtual\u2019 friendships through mixing with German and Maltese exchange students, who will be visiting the Institute through a reciprocal arrangement shortly before or after the outward mobilities in 2018. \r\n\r\nUpwards of 58% of learners on the Institute\u2019s BTEC Art and Media programmes experience severe financial hardship and/or additional support needs. The potential for CREATE to impact on their academic achievement and personal development cannot be overstated. These mobilities will also open doors for hundreds more students to broaden their horizons through emulating their peers in future programmes and by creating relationships with European students. CREATE will contribute not just to the \u201cflowering of cultures\u201d but also to the flowering of careers and of lives.", "http://www.grimsby.ac.uk", "Grimsby Institute of Further and Higher Education", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036266_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DN34"}
