Two of the largest and most critical components of any mainstream tidal energy converter (TEC) are the power take off (PTO) system (the shaft, bearings and other equipment which connects the turbine blades with the generator) and the electrical generator itself. Experts in the field of turbine and generator testing, the UK\u2019s Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult (ORE CATAPULT) together with SME partners Tocardo International (TOCARDO),Ocean Flow Energy (OCEANFLOW), Minesto (MINESTO) & FiberSensing (FIBERSENSING) and Research (RTD) performing partners the University of Edinburgh (UEDIN) and SINTEF (SINTEF), plan to conduct vital research and concept design activities to determine the optimum design of a  TEC power take off system and permanent magnet generator (PMG). These radically optimised systems will improve reliability, increase power conversion efficiency and facilitate reduction in the cost of tidal power.  In turn, the results of this project will also help SME tidal developers (and their SME suppliers) to be able to offer warranties and guarantees to end customers (European Energy Utilities) and enable large scale roll out of tidal energy in the EU; supporting diversification of the European energy mix and helping to achieve European 2020 renewable energy and carbon emission reduction targets.\n\nThe formation of the consortium has been carefully considered, in parallel with the resource commitments required to support the proposed programme of work. All consortium members have clearly defined roles and responsibilities within the work programme, and have determined that their return on investment is significant, appropriate and is in alignment with their strategic vision.", 136762.0, 1048485.0, "TIDAL-EC", null, null, null, null, "http://www.oceanflowenergy.com", null, "fp7_191798_953689742"], ["1DT", "Floating Offshore Wind Support Platform and Assembly Solution", "Ocean Flow Energy Ltd", "'Project FLOWSPA (Floating Offshore Wind Support Platform Assembly) will demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative floating offshore wind foundation structure \u201cStarfloat\u201d that combines \u201cspar\u201d technology with \u201csemi-submersible\u201d technology to provide a compact and cost effective low motion platform for supporting large capacity wind turbines at deep-water offshore wind farm sites. Energy analysts have predicted that, if a viable and cost effective technology can be delivered, the deep-water offshore wind market in Europe could meet 50% of Europe\u2019s electricity requirement by 2050. Unlike competitor technologies the simple scalable 'Starfloat' is designed for construction at existing shipbuilding facilities with restricted water depth thus opening up construction opportunities for European shipyards that are currently in decline. The innovative floating foundation design and assembly process takes significant cost out of the CAPEX of deep water floating offshore wind projects and removes the need for risky offshore marine operations. 'Starfloat' therefore has the potential to be disruptive to the current perceived limitations of the offshore wind industry by bring floating offshore wind into the same levelised cost of energy (LCOE) as fixed foundation offshore wind. This will allow the project financing of deeper water wind farm sites, where the wind resource is stronger and more reliable, to be exploited using relatively low risk technology with the end result of reducing carbon emissions and reduced dependency for Europe on imported fuels. It also has the benefit of bringing steel fabrication work to declining shipyards and assembly work to deep-water offshore construction sites that are currently seeing a sharp decline in activity with the fall in the oil price and the collapse of the new shipbuilding market.'", 43584.0, 62263.0, "FLOWSPA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.oceanflowenergy.com", null, "h2020_207129_953689742"], ["1JE", "Fisheries Data Capture and Management System", "Succorfish M2m Limited", "The aim of the FiDaCaMS project is to build a new innovative system that enables fishermen to collect accurate and reliable fisheries and related environmental data in an automated and highly efficient form.\n\nOne of the major issues across the marine environment is that increasingly stringent management controls are being implemented requiring clear & hard evidence to support management decisions. In the absence of such evidence the precautionary approach is adopted, creating restrictions for commercial fishing activities amongst others. At the same time the available resources to gather the evidence centrally is being cut, thus widening the gap between the need and availability of evidence. To aid the fishing industry meet the pressing needs they must be equipped with appropriate tools that collect the evidence in a robust and automated form. \nThe successful implementation of FiDaCaMS will provide the technology necessary for the collection and aggregation of the required data and rendering it available through an online platform in multiple formats across diverse media thus facilitating the adoption of the regulations set by the EU and the local governments. \n\nDuring an event held in Brussels on 5th April 2016 - Info Day for Blue Growth, it was expressed that this sector lacks innovation for Blue Economy specifically in 3 areas (a) lack of highly skilled professionals (b) under investment in Knowledge and technology and (c) a slow process from research results to the commercial stage. The FiDaCaMS project aims to contribute towards overcoming all 3 obstacles. (a) Employ and train professionals, (b) invest in R&D to continue to innovate and create new technologies and to (c) accelerate market presence and penetration.\n\nThe FiDaCaMS project is a joint venture between 3 commercial entities each having their own area of expertise to create a fully integrated data acquisition solution from the vessel to the end users", null, 61365.0, "FiDaCaMS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_205093_924674326"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NE30"}
