To achieve this, EPAD will also provide the analytical infrastructure to make correct observations regarding an intervention\u2019s value as an agent for secondary prevention. All this must exist in the right ethical, legal and social context. It must also be sustainable by being of value to numerous partners and stakeholders in the long term. The EPAD Consortium has been carefully designed to achieve the aim of secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nCurrent and recent drug development programmes in AD have been limited through the collection of heterogeneous samples of patients with advanced brain disease and an inability to measure effectively an index of disease course modification.\nRecruiting participants from clinics and the community for AD prevention trials with limited clinical background is both a risky and cost-inefficient strategy. Creating a disease register of people consented to enter secondary prevention trials delivers a degree of readiness that ensures better knowledge of a participants suitability and a more rapid throughput of screening for the trials. The EPAD Consortium has the necessary reach and influence from its partners to develop such a \u2018readiness\u2019 cohort.\nBy delivering an earlier, risk stratified population with run-in data in the EPAD Cohort across both clinical and biological domains; we can ensure a more homogenous population for study. We can also track changes in disease status as the basis for deciding on an intervention or combination of interventions likelihood of success in larger Phase 3 confirmatory trials.\nMost of the scientific community still consider A\uf062 dysregulation as central to AD so targeting this pathological process is a rational first step in what will be a standing trial. Other disease processes can be targeted when candidate interventions and intermediate phenotypes to reflect success are available.\nEPAD High Level Structure:\nThe IMI-EPAD Consortium will form the third part to a proposed IMI\u2013AD Platform (with IMI-EMIF-AD and IMI-Aetionomy) to produce a globally important superstructure for the secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nIMI-EPAD brings together all the major cohorts in Europe purposed for the exploration of disease processes and risks for dementia. In drawing from over 40 cohorts with almost 250,000 participants in 11 countries we have the basis for the EPAD Register from which we can draw the EPAD Cohort. Expertise in basic neurodegenerative sciences, epidemiology, statistics and trial design ensures that the standing proof of concept adaptive trial will have the optimal chance of delivering meaningful and definitive answers on an interventions likely success in confirmatory trials.\nIn establishing the International Scientific Synergy Group (ISSG) we have ensured that our work is visible to similar international initiatives and vice versa hence, through pooling know how and sharing data we can collectively overcome this devastating global disease.\nEPAD Work Packages and National Leadership:\nWe have created 8 work packages with 4 of these bound together in the EPAD Delivery Cluster which includes the scientific bedrock (WP1), the statistical engine room (WP2), the aggregation of suitable subjects (WP3) and trial delivery (WP4). These trial delivery activities are supported by project management (WP5), dissemination (WP6), business model and sustainability (WP7) and ethics, legal and social implications (WP8).

Spaces for participants to share experiences will be provided in order for the participants to be more actively involved in the course.\r\n \r\nAdditionally online live interviews, videos, graphic facilitation and storytelling methods, the way of council and open space activities, will support the flow of the Training Course.\r\n \r\nObjectives\r\n-To provide the necessary competences to include a positive approach to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression in youth work practice.\r\n-To explore the specificities and challenges of working with LGBT+ young people in Education settings and European activities.\r\n-To look at the difficulties that LGBT+ young people face and how practitioners can became facilitators for positive change or growth.\r\n-To provide a framework of action and a series of tools to challenge discrimination on the basis of SOGI.\r\n-To offer a space for inquiry and personal growth of participants. \r\n-To raise awareness and acceptance of LGBTI people across the European Union\r\n-To reach citizens, foster diversity and nondiscrimination \r\n-To support key actors responsible to promote and advance equal rights for LGBTI people in the EU \r\n-To use Erasmus+ programme as a tool to carry out projects that promote LGBTI Rights, Human Rights and equality.", "http://www.leapsports.org", "LEADERSHIP, EQUALITY AND ACTIVE PARTICIPATION (LEAP) IN SPORTS SCOTLAND", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-036254_coordinator"], ["4JR", "Culture vs Entrepreneurship", "Acting Global LTD", 22922.0, "\"Culture vs Entrepreneurship\" is an nine day long European Youth Exchange (Erasmus+KA1) which is fully based on approaches of non-formal education and is developed by young people from UK, Georgia, Turkey, Finland, Moldova and Ukraine.  The project aims to explore and mix the entrepreneurial cultures of these countries through sports, cultural discussions and entrepreneurial activities.  \r\nMost represented organizations are partners since several years, but we have new partners as well who were willing to get involved and contribute. \r\nThis project is a very strong inter-cultural exchange for youngsters (between the age 18-25), which are interested to know more about how different cultures work from the perspective of entrepreneurship, and to discover new friends from those cultures. \r\nMost Part of the project belongs to the participant youngsters. Group leaders of the project lead only the first and the last day of the Project. The rest of the days are divided between countries. Each day belongs to one country and is led by participants from that country, without or with very few involvement of the group leader. To be prepared for this responsibility, participants will get involved in preparatory weekly meetings facilitated by the team leaders of each partner organization in prior especially for this project. \r\nThe implementation of the project is planned for May 2018, in Georgia, particularly in a small rural village Sanavardo, in the local social hostel which was co-initiated by the hosting organization Institute for Democratic Changes and is performing diversity of voluntary activities on its premises for the development of the local community. \r\nThe daily agenda of the program is divided in 3 main parts: \r\n1) In the mornings we practice sports or other healthy lifestyle related physical activities that are most popular in represented countries, or for the represented community of the country, and analyze what makes these particular sports or physical activities most popular in these communities? What influence does it have on people\u2019s culture and what benefits can our entrepreneurial personality gain from adding these practices to our daily lifestyles?  \r\n\r\n2) In the afternoons we use different creative settings and have meaningful discussions or workshops about different components of culture in each country, except cultures of our countries, we also share our individual cultures with each other and find differences and similarities that we have.  We learn from each other how to recognize negative and positive sides of different mass cultures and know how to deal with it. The most important is to rediscover ourselves through our new experience and increased cultural awareness. \r\n3) The evenings are devoted to the topic of entrepreneurship, sharing our knowledge, developing new entrepreneurial skills and attitudes, sharing entrepreneurial cultures of our countries and our individual entrepreneurial cultures. What is our cultural flexibility towards entrepreneurship? Through different simulation games, role plays and other activities we want to ask ourselves critical questions and update our perspectives on cultures through the lenses of entrepreneurship. \r\n\r\nMeeting at this young age is an unique opportunity for participants of the project to build their European identity, become more open minded and value different cultures, improve learning abilities and foreign language skills, increase their self-esteem and in the future improve their entrepreneurial prospects.", "http://www.actinglobal.org", "Acting Global LTD", "erasmus_2017-3-UK01-KA105-046363_coordinator"], ["3DB", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "ROYAL CONSERVATOIRE OF SCOTLAND", 19334.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.rcs.ac.uk", "ROYAL CONSERVATOIRE OF SCOTLAND", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035360_coordinator"], ["4TB", "Solidarity and Volunteering Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Training", "Citywise Mentoring Ltd", 31904.0, "\"Solidarity and Volunteering Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Training\" (SOLVE-IT) is an exchange programme for 43 people from 7 European countries.

During the local phase each of the teams is organizing their own solidarity activities and compiling experiences for the exchange. The Project Summit takes part in Finland, where all the participants will meet. The follow-up phase begins with the compilation of results and outcomes and continues after the project with both local and common activities.\r\n\r\nThe programme has two main mobilities: an Advance Planning Visit in May 2018 and the Project Summit, a one week exchange in Finland at the beginning of September, 2018. Some of the activities that will take part during the Project Summit are: \r\n\r\n- VOLUNTEERING WORKSHOPS where we work in intercultural groups to design solidarity activities. The workshops will be divided in 8 areas: a). stop bulling, b) designing Seasons' campaings, c) designing online solidarity campaigns, d) organising support classes for immigrants, e) tutor programmes for kids from less privileged backgrounds, f) organising solidarity projects to build facilities in developing countries, g) designing open campaigns to involve new people into solidarity activities and h) organising regular visits to elderly houses or to other people that suffer from loneliness.

Even when people do go into the field, they may enter with preconceived notions of what the needs and solutions are. Consequences of it are low participation, not active participation and involvement, not reaching expected results, lack of social innovation, little (or no) impact and almost no sustainability. \r\nFor NGOs innovation brings value, which in turn equals social impact. For decades businesses have used principles of Human Centered Design (HCD) and more specifically Design Thinking methodology (DT) to create solutions for many different types of challenges based on real needs and problems of their target groups. While the method slowly has become known within the US nonprofit sector (Bill & Melinda Gates, Rockefeller and Kellogg Foundations, VisionSpring, Acumen, IDE Marie Stopes International, Population Services International (PSI), Mercy Corps and other organisations), the same is not true among European NGOs. \r\nDesign Thinking is a methodology that provides a human-centered, solution-oriented, collaborative and effective systematic approach to solving problems and to generate ideas with impact. \r\nTraining course aims to make European youth work innovative and get bigger social impact through applying HCD principles in youth work through building youth worker skills and introducing a new innovative method that they can apply. \r\nThus the objectives of the training course are: \r\n1. To train participants on how to apply DT methodology in their work, introduce DT and its importance for quality youth work and innovative approaches. \r\n2. To develop the participants creative, human-centered and solution-oriented thinking. \r\n3. To promote innovative approaches in youth work in order to create social innovations. \r\n4. To resolve more problems young people face and to get significant social impact via youth work. \r\n5. To improve participants\u2019 professional competencies and the quality of participants\u2019 work and activities for the benefit of young people. \r\n6. To increase motivation and satisfaction in participants\u2019 daily work.\r\n7. To inspire the participants to promote DT among their colleagues and other European NGOs. \r\n\r\nTraining course will be implemented in Manchester, UK between 4 - 10 September 2018 with 31 participants including those with fewer opportunities from 5 Programme and 5 Neighbouring countries (UK, Lithuania, Italy, Poland, Turkey, Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia). The participants are project coordinators,  youth workers and youth leaders who are responsible for developing activities/services and products, who wants to learn and apply DT in their work and generally in their organisation, to improve their professional competencies, to improve the quality of the their work with young people and achieve bigger results. \r\n\r\nThere is one activity is the training course \u201cDesign Thinking for innovative youth work\u201d, that will consist of different sessions, which are chosen and will be conducted in a line with the Design Thinking methodology, principles of non-formal education and accordingly the objectives of the training course. The training introduces an existing methodology Design Thinking - One of the most used is five-stage model proposed by the Hasso-Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford (d.school). The main results of the project will be: 1) project coordinators, program managers/officers, youth workers and youth leaders apply DT in their work. 2) the participants developed/improved certain soft skills; 3) the partner NGOs resolve more problems of their youth target groups and get a significant social impact; 4) young people are involved into the process of creating their problems solutions; 5) the partner NGOs create social innovations; 6) the partner NGOs promote DT among their colleagues and other European NGOs. 6) The participants are more satisfied with their work. The training will have impact on the participants, participating organisations and target groups and at the local, regional, national, European levels: 1) the importance of DT is understood and applied in youth work; 2) the real problems of young people are understood and solved; 3) increased number of social innovations in European youth work; 4) European youth work gets a bigger social impact. 5) project coordinators, program managers/officers, youth workers and youth leaders more motivated and satisfied with their work.
