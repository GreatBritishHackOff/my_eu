To achieve this, EPAD will also provide the analytical infrastructure to make correct observations regarding an intervention\u2019s value as an agent for secondary prevention. All this must exist in the right ethical, legal and social context. It must also be sustainable by being of value to numerous partners and stakeholders in the long term. The EPAD Consortium has been carefully designed to achieve the aim of secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nCurrent and recent drug development programmes in AD have been limited through the collection of heterogeneous samples of patients with advanced brain disease and an inability to measure effectively an index of disease course modification.\nRecruiting participants from clinics and the community for AD prevention trials with limited clinical background is both a risky and cost-inefficient strategy. Creating a disease register of people consented to enter secondary prevention trials delivers a degree of readiness that ensures better knowledge of a participants suitability and a more rapid throughput of screening for the trials. The EPAD Consortium has the necessary reach and influence from its partners to develop such a \u2018readiness\u2019 cohort.\nBy delivering an earlier, risk stratified population with run-in data in the EPAD Cohort across both clinical and biological domains; we can ensure a more homogenous population for study. We can also track changes in disease status as the basis for deciding on an intervention or combination of interventions likelihood of success in larger Phase 3 confirmatory trials.\nMost of the scientific community still consider A\uf062 dysregulation as central to AD so targeting this pathological process is a rational first step in what will be a standing trial. Other disease processes can be targeted when candidate interventions and intermediate phenotypes to reflect success are available.\nEPAD High Level Structure:\nThe IMI-EPAD Consortium will form the third part to a proposed IMI\u2013AD Platform (with IMI-EMIF-AD and IMI-Aetionomy) to produce a globally important superstructure for the secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nIMI-EPAD brings together all the major cohorts in Europe purposed for the exploration of disease processes and risks for dementia. In drawing from over 40 cohorts with almost 250,000 participants in 11 countries we have the basis for the EPAD Register from which we can draw the EPAD Cohort. Expertise in basic neurodegenerative sciences, epidemiology, statistics and trial design ensures that the standing proof of concept adaptive trial will have the optimal chance of delivering meaningful and definitive answers on an interventions likely success in confirmatory trials.\nIn establishing the International Scientific Synergy Group (ISSG) we have ensured that our work is visible to similar international initiatives and vice versa hence, through pooling know how and sharing data we can collectively overcome this devastating global disease.\nEPAD Work Packages and National Leadership:\nWe have created 8 work packages with 4 of these bound together in the EPAD Delivery Cluster which includes the scientific bedrock (WP1), the statistical engine room (WP2), the aggregation of suitable subjects (WP3) and trial delivery (WP4). These trial delivery activities are supported by project management (WP5), dissemination (WP6), business model and sustainability (WP7) and ethics, legal and social implications (WP8).

Art in public space is a developing discipline which mixes performance, visual and digital arts, creators and local people, artists and audience. It is an artform built around sharing, where involvement is part of the creative act; a contemporary, contextual artform for a broad audience; a European artform that is increasingly in demand on other continents.Ambition Creativity Transnationality IN SITU ACT has four objectives, based on a shared diagnosis that sees transnational mobility as a need and a strategic response during a period of major upheavals: - Promote artworks which operate with, in and for public spaces.- Test and implement a European model for integrated artistic support, involving artists, producers and the public in the creative process.- Develop an ecology of creation that connects artistic works with the economic, political and social realities in Europe.- Pool our skills and resources and bring together those who locally influence and drive change in public space.Action Cooperation TransmissionSeveral concrete actions are to be implemented:- A collaborative process for supporting artists:  project development seminars, collective mentoring, adaptation residencies, support for mobility and public presentations.- Pilot projects, prototypes for shared creation between authors, organisers and public.- Training modules for young professionals.- Consultancy services for European cities and Capitals of Culture.- \u201dSatellite\u201d partners in non-European countries.- European think-tank bringing together key influencers in urban and territorial development.This is an ACT that will engage thousands of citizens in works presented to a million spectators.This is an ACT to develop a \u201ccloud\u201d model, a horizontal, participatory and sustainable network, drawing on the experience, durability and breadth of the existing partnership", "http://www.uzarts.com", null, "creative_570563-CREA-1-2016-1-FR-CULT-COOP2_9"], ["4QE", "European Children's Film Catalogue & Related Film Literacy Activities", "CREATIVE SCOTLAND", 180043.0, "The main objective of the project is to start a catalogue of European films for children, with accompanying educational materials, and to facilitate educational distribution to reach as many pre-schools, schools and young audiences with these films and learning materials, with as many European partners and in as many European countries as possible. To be able to achieve this, the project needs to run for a minimum of two to three years, as the roll-out of this project, especially to schools, will take more time than one project year. Contacts with the schools need to be established for some, and extended for other partners, awareness of the importance of film literacy has to be raised, and the implementation and roll-out of film literacy programs in the school-year planning and cinema programming needs a minimum of two to three years. Six partners across Europe (Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Scotland, Sweden) have committed to put their children\u2019s film knowledge, film literacy expertise, film industry connections, enthusiasm, and finances into this project. In return, the project will facilitate partnerships and co-operation among European organisations from diverse geographical and cultural backgrounds, that have rarely worked together before; it will enable the transfer of knowledge and working practices; and nurture a European-wide exchange of films, ideas, learning materials, and, importantly, best practice in teaching film literacy.  In Year 1, the most important steps are to make sure that all the partners agree on the film selection, to set a procedure for film selection, to then build a catalogue with a minimum of seven film titles \u2013 whs.ich will amount to at least 26 different language versions of these films (with all the acquisition, print and film materials, dubbing and subtitling implications).  Also, to write, translate, and expand the learning materials, to make them accessible, and to then start with some educational pilot screenings.", "http://www.creativescotland.com", null, "creative_553769-CREA-1-2014-1-NL-MED-AUDEV_3"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["8LU", "LCITP - LUPS Catalyst and Development Support", "Scottish Government", "To increase low carbon investment levered into Scottish businesses by private and institutional investors.
