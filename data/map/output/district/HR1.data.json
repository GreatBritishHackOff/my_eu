Focusing on 'performance' JuxtaLearn will provoke student curiosity in science and technology through creative film making and editing activities. Computational identification of students' barriers to conceptual understanding will be overcome by  scaffolded creative application of concepts in activities juxtaposed to traditional understanding.  State of the art technologies will support students transferable reflections focusing on two pedagogical approaches:  juxtaposition performance and reflective performance.<br/>Juxtaposition performance: JuxtaLearn ICMAs (Interactive Computer Marked Assessments) will support students' identification of threshold concepts that are their own personal barriers to understanding.  Students' understanding will be enhanced by them creating personal performances through application of a theory in a formal activity and then again in a creative juxtaposed activity (e.g. physics used in music DJ-ing, chemistry occurring in kitchens, possible evolution of an alien race).  New media and learning analytics of public video resources will facilitate student creative inspiration and further conceptual insight and understanding.<br/>Reflective performance:  State of the art systems for automated and personalised film making and editing will support curiosity and creative expression.  A deeper understanding will be reinforced through scaffolding reflections on essential elements in applying the theory.  Students will, for example, be supported in instigating reflective decisions on what to film, how to film it and what and where to edit.

The students come from diverse social extraction families: some with university education, others with socio-economic and cultural deprivation situations, ethnic minorities and immigrants. About 22% of the students suffer some type of problem such as school truancy, behavior problems, school mismatch, etc. Our center has for years applied an integrated curriculum that fuses the contents of the British National Curriculum and those of the Spanish Curriculum, derived from the signing of the Agreement between the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science and the British Council. Our aim of center when requesting this action of mobility for 2 years is to promote the enthusiasm of the teachers to continue forming and improving their linguistic and methodological competences to enhance our teaching quality. The objectives set for this purpose are: * To improve linguistic competence through observation and training activities in a more globalized educational and cultural context. * To deep in the knowledge of tools and methodologies that favor the integration of non-linguistic contents using a foreign language as Vehicular language * Know and compare educational models to improve our teaching work and achieve successful teaching-learning experiences, in which students enjoy learning and develop attitudes of acceptance and respect for others, promoting interculturality in our center. The application of new technologies in our teaching practice to motivate students and make them participants in their learning process * Exchange educational experiences with teachers and students of the visited center promoting interculturality through new technologies. The students and teachers the consciousness of belonging to the EU as a site for personal and work development. Our team member in this project consists of 19 teachers of Infantile and Primary Education with different level of linguistic competence, that go from A1 to C1 of English. Through this project we have proposed to work a set of activities such as participation in language training courses, CLIL methodology training courses and new technologies, training courses in Montessori methodology and a jobshadowing process in 3 centers in 2 countries (UK, Denmark). The methodology to be followed throughout the project will be based on experience and direct observation to foster the critical spirit, and will be carried out in a cooperative way  by the whole cloister. This will be achieved through language courses, focused on a communicative approach, and jobshadowing, with which we will cover aspects such as school organization, curriculum, space distribution, ... To take to the classroom everything we learned will use one Methodology based on meaningful learning, starting from the level of knowledge of our students and progressively moving towards more complex learning. It will also take into account the principles of educational intervention (socialization, globalization, family-school collaboration, motivation, intuition, autonomy, ability to learn to learn ...) Achieving the proposed objectives will have a short, medium and long impact Term of the entire Educational Community. In this way the teaching staff will improve the linguistic competence,  we will deep in the new methodologies mentioned above and we will boost the team work, which will result in an increase of the motivation and the improvement of its working system. The improvement of the linguistic competence of the teaching staff will revert to the students, who will participate in active and more motivating methodologies that will imply a greater involvement in their learning process in addition to a greater knowledge of the European dimension and an intercultural reinforcement that will broaden their horizons. In the Center, the Language Program will be strengthened, the team work of the faculty will be strengthened, sharing its knowledge with the rest of the teachers and drawing common lines of work for the application of such learning, thus revalorizing the concept of unity and the image of the Center on the outside. Long-term benefits: create a Strategic Action Plan in the methodological scope with objectives and deadlines for its achievement; Improved English proficiency; Intercultural knowledge or exchange; Awareness of the European dimension and identity; Of continuing teacher training beyond the framework of the project itself and participation in future European projects.", "http://www.mordifordceprimaryschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-036419_1"], ["1DT", "Music-Key: inclusion for the sighted and the visually impaired through music", "LOOK NATIONAL FEDERATION OF FAMILIES WITH VISUALLY IMPAIRED CHILDREN", 11670.0, "\"Music-Key\", organized by the Center for Education and Rehabilitation for the blind in Greece (CERB), is planned as a project in the type of a youth exchange under KA 1 of the Erasmus+ Programme. It will take place from September 2nd until September 10th in Athens, Greece and will gather young visually impaired and sighted people from 6 EU countries: BE, BG, DE, GR, IT and UK.  Every partner will send a group of five people consisting of two sighted and three visually impaired participants (including one who functions as the group leader), which means that there will be 30 participants in this project in total.\r\n\r\nThis exchange is all about choir singing, the Greek culture and discovering the participating countries' cultures together. It will give its participants the possibility of feeling, finding and exploring themselves and their abilities through making music with other participants in a unique way and to experience the strong ability of music to connect and to unite people coming from different countries and cultural backgrounds, living with different abilities and disabilities. In the end of our exchange the participants will perform a big public concert together to present their work and to raise awareness of how enriching the inclusion of the visually impaired/blind into daily life can be. Furthermore, cultural visits and other types of activities related to the group interests will be planned, to enhance team bonds, inspire and honour Greek hospitality traditions.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives will be: (a) sensitizing sighted and visually impaired people to each other for a better inclusion into daily life (through music and common cultural activities) and (b) encouraging the cultural exchange by presenting and sharing national traditions.\r\n\r\nBy taking part in this project, participants will improve their understanding, experiences and knowledge on living together in Europe and accepting each other, no matter if disabled or not, while sharing and enhancing their common interest in music. They will also benefit by showing and sharing their experiences in their home country keeping on making others aware of the importance of being strong together and including everybody into daily life. \r\n\r\nAs the big final concert will be recorded, there will be a lively result of our Youth Exchange that can be presented on-line and used for promoting inclusion and team spirit through music. After the project, our participants and partner associations will also hold presentations and spread reports about the project to share the experiences with as many people as possible (through social media, public media, communication etc.), to continue the realization of our objectives. The Presentation events where the project's outcome will be presented, shown and played will mainly be addressed to young people aged between 18 and 30, to fascinate and inspire them for participating in or even starting other youth projects within the Erasmus+ programme. Further information will be shared on the partner associations channels (such as Websites, newsletters and on Social Media), Web blogs, Mailing Lists and in Facebook groups to keep the people who are interested in the project's main topic working together on other international European topics. In addition, CERB and partner organisations, will be able to use the multimedia material produced for educational purposes, within the context of their general and localised actions.", "http://www.look-uk.org", null, "erasmus_2017-2-EL02-KA105-003383_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "HR1"}
