Computational identification of students' barriers to conceptual understanding will be overcome by  scaffolded creative application of concepts in activities juxtaposed to traditional understanding.  State of the art technologies will support students transferable reflections focusing on two pedagogical approaches:  juxtaposition performance and reflective performance.<br/>Juxtaposition performance: JuxtaLearn ICMAs (Interactive Computer Marked Assessments) will support students' identification of threshold concepts that are their own personal barriers to understanding.  Students' understanding will be enhanced by them creating personal performances through application of a theory in a formal activity and then again in a creative juxtaposed activity (e.g. physics used in music DJ-ing, chemistry occurring in kitchens, possible evolution of an alien race).  New media and learning analytics of public video resources will facilitate student creative inspiration and further conceptual insight and understanding.<br/>Reflective performance:  State of the art systems for automated and personalised film making and editing will support curiosity and creative expression.  A deeper understanding will be reinforced through scaffolding reflections on essential elements in applying the theory.  Students will, for example, be supported in instigating reflective decisions on what to film, how to film it and what and where to edit.

Youth In Action project, ran by CH and IES in 2013. Employment was one of the key issues that young people raised in the reasons why people would leave their rural area. IES and Close House want to bring together young people to look at the world of employment further and how it can positively change an area. Both partners also want to give project participants opportunities and time to explore for themselves the benefits of work, both personally and within a community. The primary purpose of this program is to develop the participants sense of purpose to engage fully in life. 'Work', in the context of the project title, is striving to achieve, rather than employment, although employment may be where participants decide they want to achieve. A mutual enforcing objective, increased confidence, is a further goal. Running this project as an international event we plan to expose young people to varying cultural attitudes about employment, given population change in the relevant localities particularly important, and fulfill our third objective of building cultural understanding.\r\n\r\nThis project will be ran with young people that;  due to their age, geographic location and social circumstances, are at risk of becoming Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET). They are especially in need of developing their sense of purpose and confidence in order to engage fully in their lives. Due to recent population and social change, they are also in need of developing tolerance and understanding with other cultures. The project will take place with equal number of participants from Hereford and Olawa, each party with two supporting staff and eight young people, to make a total of twenty project participants.\r\n\r\nActivities to take place will be centered on self evaluation, developing understanding and exposure to new experiences.\r\nThe first aspect of this will be visits to places of employment. We have four visits planned around the country visiting very different workplaces with differing community impacts. The first stage to employment, forms and interviews, is intimidating to those leaving formal education and this project will show them the exciting possibilities and stories behind what can be an off-putting introduction. Through our workshops we plan to solidify the learning experience of the factory visits and have participants discuss how employment fits in to their lives. \r\n\r\nThe Second aspect is to develop the confidence of participants. This is the background to all the activities and runs through the entirety of the project. As well as having their contributions and work valued within the core activities, participants will be encouraged to actively engage with the project and turn it into their own creation. Ownership of the 'Work Works for Me' project takes many forms.  Surveying members of the general public, the film project to be shown at the end and team games will all be key project moments participants can demonstrate their abilities and grow confident in their achievements.\r\n\r\nThe final aspect of the project is to develop cultural understanding. The young people will be encouraged to work and play in groups that increases interaction between these different cultures, and through these working partnerships and teams, friendships will develop that outlast the longevity of the project. To add to this understanding, participants will have a dedicated night to display examples of their own culture and feel pride in where they are from while appreciating any differences.\r\n\r\nBuilding the participants understanding about the world of work may ultimately make them choose to seek employment, further education or vocational training and all those paths, not only employment, would be justifiable. Through this experience we plan to have participants take time to reflect on their own feelings to make decisions about the path of their life, not necessarily only valuing employment. We also envisage a positive change in community feeling towards new migrants as participants enter back into their communities with positive stories to tell of their friendships formed through the exchange between England and Poland.

This experience would be part of an ongoing partnership between the Royal National College for the Blind in Hereford and the cit\u00e9 scolaire Ren\u00e9 Pellet in Villeurbanne. The aim is to develop an equitable and sustainable partnership lasting twenty-four months with two periods dedicated to internships. Thus , the students/pupils following a B-tech in Business Studies in our vocational school will be able to do their work placements abroad developing both their language and professional skills. A number of activities will be carried out before the internships take place. Visually impaired students need to orientate themselves on new premises so as to be able to find their way, especially in British   public transports . A collaborative study will enable  the students to compare accessibility in public transports in both countries. Peer guidance will be experienced during a stay in Hereford prior to the work placement period. A collaborative study of  legislation concerning disability  in the workplace in both countries will  be carried out. A comparative study of adapted workstations in companies will also be carried out. It will help students change their preconceptions on the working conditions of the disabled in the working world. This will lead us to work in collaboration with our partners  in the Royal National College as they are experts in adapting the workstation. They will install specific material (adapted software, JAWS...) which is indispensable for our students in their work placements. \r\n\r\nThe close working relationship between teachers in the two schools  is necessary for the professional experience of our students as trainees in British companies to be successful.  Working together to help and support visually impaired students in both countries contributes to enriching education and it will help our project to develop successfully.\r\n\r\nA partnership committee including adults and students from the two schools will define the different steps of the programme. It will also plan the assessment of the project.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the programme will benefit both partners, including the local authorities in Herefordshire.

About 22% of the students suffer some type of problem such as school truancy, behavior problems, school mismatch, etc. Our center has for years applied an integrated curriculum that fuses the contents of the British National Curriculum and those of the Spanish Curriculum, derived from the signing of the Agreement between the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science and the British Council. Our aim of center when requesting this action of mobility for 2 years is to promote the enthusiasm of the teachers to continue forming and improving their linguistic and methodological competences to enhance our teaching quality. The objectives set for this purpose are: * To improve linguistic competence through observation and training activities in a more globalized educational and cultural context. * To deep in the knowledge of tools and methodologies that favor the integration of non-linguistic contents using a foreign language as Vehicular language * Know and compare educational models to improve our teaching work and achieve successful teaching-learning experiences, in which students enjoy learning and develop attitudes of acceptance and respect for others, promoting interculturality in our center.

Our team member in this project consists of 19 teachers of Infantile and Primary Education with different level of linguistic competence, that go from A1 to C1 of English. Through this project we have proposed to work a set of activities such as participation in language training courses, CLIL methodology training courses and new technologies, training courses in Montessori methodology and a jobshadowing process in 3 centers in 2 countries (UK, Denmark). The methodology to be followed throughout the project will be based on experience and direct observation to foster the critical spirit, and will be carried out in a cooperative way  by the whole cloister. This will be achieved through language courses, focused on a communicative approach, and jobshadowing, with which we will cover aspects such as school organization, curriculum, space distribution, ... To take to the classroom everything we learned will use one Methodology based on meaningful learning, starting from the level of knowledge of our students and progressively moving towards more complex learning. It will also take into account the principles of educational intervention (socialization, globalization, family-school collaboration, motivation, intuition, autonomy, ability to learn to learn ...) Achieving the proposed objectives will have a short, medium and long impact Term of the entire Educational Community. In this way the teaching staff will improve the linguistic competence,  we will deep in the new methodologies mentioned above and we will boost the team work, which will result in an increase of the motivation and the improvement of its working system. The improvement of the linguistic competence of the teaching staff will revert to the students, who will participate in active and more motivating methodologies that will imply a greater involvement in their learning process in addition to a greater knowledge of the European dimension and an intercultural reinforcement that will broaden their horizons. In the Center, the Language Program will be strengthened, the team work of the faculty will be strengthened, sharing its knowledge with the rest of the teachers and drawing common lines of work for the application of such learning, thus revalorizing the concept of unity and the image of the Center on the outside.
