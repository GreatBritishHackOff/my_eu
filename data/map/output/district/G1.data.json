The idea of which is to take the state of the art in VTMIS which is a passive system providing information and advisories and use this as a basis to actively manage the transit of all vessels in the jurisdiction of the VTMIS. The A-VTMIS must plan provably safe paths for multiple vessels as they arrive from the entrance to the harbour to their berths and ensure that the vessels follow these paths safely without conflicting with the paths of other vessels.\n2.\tThe second system is a pilot aid (SafePilot) which will ensure that crew or harbour pilot can safely and efficiently navigate the courses provided by the A-VTMIS and execute precision docking manoeuvres for large vessels\nIn order to achieve these objectives the accuracy, reliability and SoL aspects of EGNOS are critical. The combination of the accuracy, the availability of the integrity function, and the availability of a single standardised service offer at all European Ports mean that we will be able to develop an A-VTMIS which will be capable of  planning and managing efficient and safe paths for multiple vessels. Additionally, the implementation of authentication mechanisms to support identification and safe recognition of assets in the Maritime operations (e.g. Cargo, ships, vehicles, etc.) as complementary to the SiS authentication provided by SoL services is essential for safety-related operations.

Its global human and economic burden is tremendous and increasing annually. Yet today only a few pharmaceutical companies retain active antibacterial drug discovery programmes. While the elaboration of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action is scientifically complex, the chief challenge is diminishing incentives. Pre-market regulatory requirements and increased control on post-market access, use, and pricing of new antibiotics are strong deterrents to drug development. Meanwhile, healthcare payers are not currently prepared to reimburse antibiotics at prices that would support the cost of development.\n\nApplied to antibiotics, a simple sales-based economic model contradicts the public health mandate to reduce their consumption in order to preserve their efficacy. Alternative models that can create incentives for the discovery of novel antibiotics and yet reconcile these incentives with responsible antibiotic use are long overdue.\n\nThe multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder DRIVE-AB consortium composed of 16 public and 8 private partners from 12 countries will produce new models in a stepwise yet interconnected process.  To achieve this objective, the DRIVE-AB consortium has put together a strong team that comprises both currently active researchers on the antibiotics problem and new researchers who can bring a fresh perspective as well as experience from other industries, economic specialties, and business cultures. The academic team has been enriched by EFPIA members and stakeholders from various backgrounds. With this diverse, yet closely tied team, DRIVE-AB will deliver fresh, sustainable solutions to this complex problem.\n\nFirst, we will develop an evidence-based, consensus definition for \u201cresponsible antibiotic use,\u201d which, with its standardised quality and quantity indicators, will provide the framework for all later steps. Next, data from surveillance systems, antibiotic prescription databases, and published literature will inform estimations of the present burden of antibiotic resistance from both clinical and economic perspectives across varying socioeconomic backdrops. Simulation models informed by these data as well as data from past and ongoing epidemics will estimate future public health needs and impact related to AMR, again in diverse socioeconomic settings. Together these constructs will allow for valuation models that will estimate the true value of existing and new antibiotics from the perspectives of patients, physicians, payers, and society as a whole. These, in turn, will inform the creation of alternative economic strategies and reward models that will promote and sustain the development of new antibiotics while simultaneously bolstering appropriate use of existing antibiotics.

In this frame new thermal shielding and low risk return strategies are defined as European key activities in the future. In Europe the design of spacecraft for high-energetic interplanetary or sample return flights is still performed with big safety margins, which means high mass. This again leads to higher costs and a reduction in scientific payloads or instrumentation.\nAblative thermal protection materials are a key technology for current and future space exploration missions. However, the mission feasibility is determined by the materials available, and the development of new materials is performed, essentially, by an iterative trial-and-error process. This is due to the absence of validated predictive models for ablative material behaviour \u2013 models are tuned to bulk material properties from tests. For each new material, this tuning has to be redone because the models are not of sufficiently high fidelity to be able to make even small extrapolations. This means that materials cannot be designed to a specification to fulfil the needs of a particular mission. The aim of this project is to make a substantial step towards a predictive model of an ablative thermal protection system by incorporating aspects of high fidelity mesoscale ablator physics within a modular framework.\nIn order to successfully develop such physics modules, the understanding of the fundamental processes occurring within the ablative materials must be improved. To this end, existing ablative materials will be tested in the most powerful European long duration high enthalpy facilities using both standard instrumentation and advanced measurement techniques. From the data obtained, and the state-of-the-art knowledge of ablator physical processes, modules for the specific processes of internal gas flow, internal radiation and gas-surface interaction will be developed to fit inside an overall multi-scale ablator modelling scheme. The improvements made in the representation of an ablative material will be validated against the ground testing, and this advanced ablator model will be applied to realistic flight configurations to demonstrate the impact of the enhanced physics on the understanding of real ablator performance.\nThe existence of this capability will allow improvements in the efficiency and cost of developing advanced new ablative materials which are tailored to meet the specifications of Europe\u2019s future mission needs.

During the atmospheric entry phase of the flight the vehicle is exposed to extreme thermal loads. In the dense atmosphere of a gas giant like Jupiter or Saturn these loads can be two or even three orders of magnitude larger than those of an Earth re-entry. The development of more efficient materials is essential for interplanetary missions like ExoMars or sample return missions.\n\nOne way of managing thermal loads on a spacecraft, caused by the enormous speed of re-entry, is to protect its structure with a sufficient thermal protection material. The most efficient method is the thermal ablation process, which blocks the heat transfer due to the phase transformation from solid state to liquid and gas. Gaseous ablation products remove heat from the surface during the outgassing process.\n\nHowever, most ablation materials currently available are the results of research carried out more than 20 years ago. Recently Europe intensified the effort for the development of new generation ablation materials. Main objectives of the EU-funded project 'Advanced ablation characterization and modelling' (http://www.ablamod.eu/ (ABLAMOD)) are better material characterization, improvements in physical modelling and measurement techniques.\n\nThe ABLAMOD team investigated three main ablators based on carbon phenolic, silica phenolic composites and cork. Novel spectroscopic techniques are used to characterise the high enthalpy flow properties and material behaviour under extreme aerothermal environments. Complementary measurement techniques allow the determination of material properties like density, thermal conductivity, heat capacity and thermal expansion at different levels of the ablation process.\n\nThe collected experimental data serves as a starting point for the development and validation of realistic models for ablation processes. ABLAMOD researchers develop modules for gas-surface interaction, transport phenomena and radiation. The modularity of the coupling tool of these modules and the main ablation code allow very flexible simulation with different time scales.

Furthermore, new methods and package codes allowed to achieve the highest precision levels for collisional-radiative models of medium-weight elements.

The goal of this proposal is to develop two complementary approaches that showcase the manufacturing of functionalised biopolymer-based nanoparticles and their subsequent biological evaluation in relation to cellular and subcellular trafficking in the tumour microenvironment. To achieve this goal, I propose two main aims. Aim 1 is to generate drug-loaded silk nanoparticles that can be readily functionlised to target specific cells and cellular compartments. I hypothesise that by using functionalised silk nanoparticles, it will be possible to target and deliver a therapeutic payload to cancer cells, which will lead to improved clinical outcomes in vivo. Aim 2 is to establish a repertoire of subcellular fractionation techniques in order to quantitatively describe the intracellular fate of nanomedicines in vitro and in vivo. I hypothesise that in particular, subcellular fractionation methods will allow a better understating of the fate of nanoparticles in tumour cells and their subsequent intracellular trafficking. Taken together, these studies will demonstrate an integrated approach to the development of next-generation nanomedicines.

The decay of an excited state from a reaction as it falls back to its stable state is accompanied by emission of light.\n\nFor use in rapid diagnosis in the clinic or at point-of-care (POC), the sensitivity of detection in whole blood must be significantly increased.

Quantum dots (QDs), nanocrystals made of semiconducting materials that exhibit fluorescence, were among the molecules studied.\n\nResearchers synthesised QDs and capped them with dimethylaminoethanethiol (DAET). The DAET ligand acts as a surfactant, making the QDs water soluble and preventing them from clustering. The DAET-capped QDs were then incorporated into the polymer Nafion.\n\nTypically, ligand exchange (substitution) reactions such as that required to attach DAET to the QD decreases the fluorescence quantum yield, a measure of emission. In fact, the quantum yield for DAET-QD emission was less than 5\u00a0%. However, when the Nafion/DAET-QD composite films were deposited on glassy carbon electrodes and hydrogen peroxide was used as a co-reactant, the quantum yield was actually greater than that for films of bare QDs.\n\nSubsequent experiments investigated ECL quenching (of emission) by binding with biologically relevant molecules such as glutathione, cholesterol, dopamine and homocysteine. These confirmed the excellent potential of Nafion/DAET-QD composite films as bioanalytical sensors.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the research was detecting analytes in whole blood using QDs incorporated into ECL biosensors.

Composites represent attractive materials and are increasingly used for such applications since they demonstrate low weight, high strength and stiffness and high environmental resistance.

Product design is thus subject to global trade-offs among traditional constraints (customer needs, technical requirements, cost) and new requirements (life-cycle, environmental impact, rules).\nOne of the most important design objectives is to minimise total cost over the economic life cycle of the product, taking into account maintenance, refitting, renewal, manning, recycling, environmental footprint, etc. The trade-off among all these requirements must be assessed and evaluated in the first steps of the design process on the basis of customer / owner specifications. \nAdvanced product design needs to adapt to profound, sometimes contradicting requirements and assure a flexible and optimised performance over the entire life-cycle for varying operational conditions.

These ligno-cellulosic materials originated from rural locations will be upgraded and densified into uniform sizes at source, allowing cost-effective transportation to existing industrial sites. The core enabling technology is superheated steam processing (SHS). SHS has been implemented in diverse drying applications at industrial scales, due to its superior heat transfer properties. At pilot scales, SHS has been proven to torrefy biomass at temperatures up to 300\u00b0C with minimal ligno-cellulose breakdown. Unlike conventional torrefaction techniques, which use flue gases as heating medium, it does not contaminate the torrefied biomass and volatile fractions, allowing economic recovery of chemicals. Moreover, it is also readily scalable for continuous operation. In SteamBio, a transportable demonstrator unit will be operated at five different rural locations where it will be used to torrefy tonnage quantities of six different agro-forestry residues at a throughput of 500 kg/h. The demonstrator unit will be operated at these rural locations throughout the last twelve months of the project to allow for seasonal fluctuations in the composition of the materials being valorised.

Youthpass will be the central recognition tool in STEPS and will support the personal reflection process of participants.\r\n\r\nThanks to STEPS, participants and organizations involved and further NGOs and youth work community will have a tool updated to today's world situation for working on Education for Democratic Citizenship and a frame for lobbying and advocating for Human Rights and Youth Participation.", "http://www.bemis.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE04-KA105-015114_14"], ["1XQ", "Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in Renewable Energy in the Marine Environment", "UNIVERSITY OF STRATHCLYDE", 1828180.0, "The Master in Offshore Renewable Energy is a MSc Joint Degree coordinated by the University of the Basque Country in partnership with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, \u00c9cole Centrale de Nantes and the University of Strathclyde.

Therefore it includes the analysis of curricula and other regulations guiding this training.\r\nIn selected countries both practical and theoretical knowledge and experience about the relation of preschool-education, early -child -education and the implementation of them in the minds and philosophies of the concerned countries should be collected, concerning both participating students and guiding staff.\r\nDuring our \" flows\"  (a placement of student abroad ) students of our academy are sent in order to work in surroundings comparable to what they're trained for here in Germany. They are supposed to cooperate with local staff.\r\n\r\nPersonal experience, intercultural competence and the experience of first time having to use a foreign language for professional purposes should go hand in hand with an insight in structures of professional working abroad. This aspect should particularly be focused on when dealing with local curricula and regulations implemented in the countries our students are sent to  ( e.g. the \" Bornholm -Modell in Sweden )\r\nAs both aspects obviously do depend on ideas and values implemented into societies - the linking of conceptions about early education and the educational practice should be recognised by the students.\r\nThis way curricular regulations of different countries and how they are implemented into daily routine and practice can be compared by our students. \r\n So our students can  both see and \" test \" whether the curricular ideas are being put into practice - or not. Under the newly planned project our student will be able to do this in a more systematic and focused approach.\r\nTherefore  all our \u201cflows\u201d are accompanied by fixed learning agreements and ECVET tools. We'll use our current experiences for this purpose. Our EC-Vet-tools ( see annex ) are available in German, English and French so that they are able be used at all our destinations.\r\nThe single flows of our students are always targeted on the placements and facilities we're aiming at. The students are prepared and well selected according to the demands of the selected countries and placements. In most cases the language performance is important, but practical experience and intellectual capabilities do count as well. In some cases interviews have to decide  about decent candidates.\r\nThe participants have to care for accomodation, flights, etc. - but we do offer assistance in most cases.\r\nOur long- term -aiming is targeting on intercultural experience, change of attitudes towards people or challenges of any kind. As we do have more than half of children born in the Nuremberg area with a migrant background, we do regard these experiences as basic to any kind of teaching of preschool - children back home.\r\nOur new project is going to include working with local staff and their expectance and leading philosophies about preschool- education more than the last one. That's why we emphasize more on staff being sent abroad. This approach should make it possible to enhance the analytical elements of our project.\r\nThe attitudes and values of both local staff and their training abroad should be compared and analysed as leading elements for preschool-education in Europe.\r\nThis is why we are sending more staff of our academy abroad for \u201cstaff \u2013excursions\u201c. During these excursions our staff is able to gain insight into practice and theoretical approach of establishments / facilities at our destinations where we send students to. We had had excursion like that before in Sweden, France, Austria and Ireland and Romania. More of these are scheduled for Scotland, Spain and other destinations being part of our project.\r\nWe included staff from local facilities working together with us in small numbers and think of continuing doing so. \r\nThe staff of our academy is recruited according to demands of local establishments / facilities and qualifications being enhanced or thought about as being part of preparation for our students. So we had had lecturers speaking Romanian in Romania, French in France and Spain ( where our local partner uses that language) etc. Another aspect is expertise being gained abroad for particular subjects being taught or staff specializing on particular demands of curricula development ( Sweden ) at our academy.\r\nSince last year we included staff from abroad coming to our academy in order to learn about teaching practice, curricula, and to talk about the enhancement and experiences they had with our students. These visits are always accompanied  by visits of establishments / facilities in our area \u2013 like e.g. Montessori- Centres \u2013 in order to enable our guests to gain an insight into how preschool- education and similar fields of work is put into practice here in Nuremberg.
