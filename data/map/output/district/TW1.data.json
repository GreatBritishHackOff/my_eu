Depending on the algae species and cultivation environment maximum production rates are achieved with the light intensities between 30 W/m2 and 100 W/m2 - which is around 1/10 of the light intensity of direct sunlight. Furthermore algae are very efficient in absorbing the light that hits them and with fairly dense algae concentrations all light is absorbed in the thin top layer of the algae pond in the order of only few centimetres. These factors make open pond algae cultivation systems inefficient in their conversion of sunlight into algae oil mass.\nPhoto bioreactors are closed systems with controlled light distribution and algae environment. Existing prototypes of photo bioreactors show significant increases in productivity, but are very complex and expensive to build. High capital and operating costs increase overall costs per unit mass of algae oil produced in photo bioreactors over open ponds, even with these significant increases in productivity.\nIn order to achieve the objectives we are presenting innovative concept of hybrid open pond \u2013 photo bioreactor technology that will exploit advantages of both algae cultivation technologies, low capital and operation costs of open ponds with the light distribution system of photo bioreactors for higher productivity, in a new hybrid algae cultivation technology.\nTwo technical approaches will be explored in the project:\n\u2022 open pond with light distribution system and\n\u2022 open pond / photo bioreactor hybrid system with light distribution and low cost closed algae environment system.'", 19955.0, 1233826.0, "SOLALGEN", "Better lighting for algae production", "Although the use of algae in the production of biofuels has enormous potential, the industry is struggling to grow consistent volumes at realistic prices.

Open ponds are shallow artificial ponds typically built in a circular or raceway configuration that use paddle wheels or other mechanisms to continually agitate the water. Algal growth is encouraged through the addition of nutrients and carbon dioxide.\n\nAn alternative method is to use photobioreactors (PBRs), closed systems with controlled light distribution and environment. However, although existing PBRs show significantly increased productivity, they are highly complex and expensive to build. PBRs are artificial closed-system algal growing environments that provide a controlled and measurable process for consistent algal production.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.solalgen.eu (SOLALGEN) project, aimed to build a low-cost light collection and distribution system for increasing algae production. Hybrid open pond-photo bioreactor technology was developed that exploits the advantages of both methods of algal cultivation. It combined the low capital and operating costs of open ponds with the distribution systems of PBRs to create a new hybrid technology.\n\nSOLALGEN's prototype was based on improvements to an existing PBR unit, which included the addition of an open pond unit. Researchers focused on the light/optical system, which was installed on both the PBR and open pond units. In addition, a waste heat exchange system was developed that enables waste heat to be reused. The system was used to improve growing conditions during the cold season.\n\nAll sensors were tested and validated at the laboratory scale and a series of measurements conducted for the main factors affecting algal growth. Parallel experiments were conducted on the PBR and open pond unit, both with and without SOLALGEN improvements in order to determine the impact on production unit yield.\n\nSOLALGEN will help to bring down the cost of algal cultivation, thereby reducing the cost of algae-derived biofuels to the point where they will be competitive with oil.

Specific objectives and activities include: (i) an optical microarray reader based on a disruptive proprietary design combining interferometric lens-free microscopy and proximity CCD or CMOS image sensing; (ii) a microarray plate, in a proper microfluidic cartridge, consisting of a transparent slide with a novel nano-structured surface geometry to increase the detection sensitivity and covered by specific receptors to capture bio-markers; (iii) their integration in a portable and battery powered label free microarray platform potentially capable of measuring more than 1 million bio-targets simultaneously. The developed technology will be capable to detect micro-ribonucleic acids (microRNAs), interleukins and other specific proteins associated to Sepsis using a few microliters of blood or serum samples, in a concentration of a few pg/ml, within 30 minutes (sample to result) and at a cost per patient of less than 50\u20ac. In this way, patients will be put on the right treatment more rapidly, potentially reducing the Sepsis mortality rate of more than 70%, with estimated cost savings of more than \u20ac10 billion per year as a consequence of shorter hospital stays, reduced use of unnecessary drugs and lower associated insurance bills.

The focus and a principal aim is to enhance mineral processing and mining skills within Europe. A medium to long term aim is to reduce the reliance of European Industry and consumers on raw materials that currently have to be imported from outside EU28.\n \nFAME will contribute to the more efficient exploitation of European domestic mineral resources including previously undeveloped resources that have the potential to contribute to the securing of raw material supply by optimising the extraction and processing of ores that include raw materials critical to the economic development of the EU (\u201ccritical raw materials\u201d, CRM) and which occur in widespread deposits across the EU. This project specifically addresses primary ore deposits with skarn, pegmatite and greisen ores as they offer the most promising potential for this purpose.

NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. \nUp to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020. However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. \nThe overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology.
