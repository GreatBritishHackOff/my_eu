New directives push for deep retrofitting efforts, in order to achieve energy efficiency and RES adoption targets for 2020 and beyond. These require acting both on envelope and on energy use systems, mainly heating and DHW equipment that representing 51% of energy use in this sector. Frequently the upgrade of the envelope insulation is subject to constraints (i.e. historical centres, availability of space, need to relocate the tenants, costs and time issues) and acting on the heating plant is the only viable option. Currently solutions are not always suitable or cost effective in existing buildings (radiators, DHW, solar radiation in winter). Therefore to accelerate the improvement in energy efficiency and in the use of renewable energy in the residential building, a specifically designed solution needs to be made available. HEAT4U is an Industry led project whose main objective is to develop a Gas Absorption Heat Pump (GAHP) solution with efficiency on primary energy of 165% (EN12309) to allow a cost-effective use of renewable energy in existing residential building for heating and DHW services. The project is conceived to overcome a number of technological and non-technological barriers which currently prevent GAHP application in single family houses or small multi-storey buildings. HEAT4U main objectives are:\n-i) Development of Appliance with specifications suitable for the residential market (10 \u2013 25 kW); ii) integration of the technology in existing heating and DHW architectures; iii) Development of a decision support system, enabling the optimal design in different building operating conditions; iv) Dissemination activity to promote the awareness of the benefits of the GAHP technology.

The system can work at temperatures down to \u2013\u00a017 degrees Celsius and does not require a back-up boiler.\n\nKeeping the installation simple was a key priority, meaning that no changes to the building construction were necessary. The hydraulic system is separated in a heat generation side and a heat distribution side, allowing integration of the technology with existing heating and DHW architectures. As such, the innovative heat pumps can be integrated with solar heat pumps or biomass boilers, and they can retain high efficiencies even when operating at partial loads.\n\nField tests in 5 sites across Europe demonstrated that the systems use approximately 30\u00a0% less energy than a condensing boiler, enabling households to slash heating costs by 40\u00a0%. Furthermore, the tests indicated that heat pumps produced heat for space heating alone and for space heating and DHW at efficiencies over 150\u00a0% and around 140\u00a0%, respectively.\n\nExtracting heat from ambient air and even the ground is the concept behind the heat pump operation. These are systems that move heat from a cool space into a warm space, making the cool areas cooler and the warm areas warmer. During the winter months, heat pumps draw and extract heat from the outdoor air and move it into your warm house. In the summertime, heat pumps move heat from within your house into the warm outdoors.\n\nThe HEAT4U solution increases the energy efficiency of the buildings, while significantly reducing carbon dioxide emissions compared to conventional condensing boilers. Unlike microgeneration and other power production technologies, this energy-efficient technology based on natural gas avoids the costs of new grid infrastructure and does not require massive and expensive upgrades.
