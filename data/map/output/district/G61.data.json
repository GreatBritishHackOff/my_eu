These upward trends are worrying, as malignant melanoma is one of the most difficult cancers to treat, due to its ability to spread quickly and its resistance to standard chemotherapeutic agents. In order to counteract this trend, targeted therapies that inhibit melanoma metastasis are required. The aim of SYS-MEL is to identify and validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for melanoma, and to model the predictive value of these biomarkers in determining the efficacy of melanoma therapies. The central objective is to bring together four European academic institutes and two SMEs to develop 3 prognostic/predictive biomarker assays for melanoma. 3 core areas of interest are epigenetics, signalling pathways in melanoma and systems biological approaches for predicting chemotherapy responses. SYS-MEL will have three main elements: 1) Epigenomic and protein expression analysis of melanoma tissue, to validate an epigenomic signature initially identified in the FP7-funded programme Target-Melanoma; 2) In silico modelling and prediction of patient responses to decarbazine DTIC using both in vitro analysis of apoptotic pathways and a novel systems biology approach, incorporating mathematical systems modelling, quantitative biochemistry and cell biology; 3) Investigating the components of the P-Rex1 pathway that are involved in driving the migration of melanoblast cells, and thus the progression of metastasis, incorporating a computational system tailored to model complex signalling pathways.

Loss of the APC protein leads to the activation of Wnt signaling target genes such as c-Myc which is required for phenotypes causes by Apc loss.\nHowever, despite the clear importance of APC loss and deregulated Wnt signalling, additional events are required for the development of CRC such as KRAS and P53 mutations.The impact of these changes on the development of CRC and response to therapy is not well understood.

Overexpression of Id proteins in transgenic mice causes cancers. Ids have been shown to inhibit differentiation and promote cell proliferation in a variety of systems. This is achieved through interactions with other transcription factors such as MyoD, E47 and Ets. To date, all of the published targets of Id regulation are genes encoding protein. However we have discovered that Ids can also stimulate expression of short non-coding RNAs that are transcribed by RNA polymerase (pol) III, such as tRNA and 5S rRNA. This regulation appears to be direct, as endogenous Id proteins can be crosslinked in vivo to pol III transcribed genes. We also detect E47, a protein that promotes differentiation of several cell types, at these genes and find that it represses pol III transcription. This is consistent with the established antagonism between Id proteins and E47. It is well documented that pol III transcripts are overexpressed in many tumours. Our data suggests that, direct activation by Id proteins may contribute to this. It may be important, because elevated tRNA expression was recently shown to have proliferative and oncogenic effects in cell culture and in mice.\nThis proposal aims to dissect molecular mechanisms responsible for Id mediated activation of tRNA and other pol III transcribed genes.

This is a pioneering project that brings p53 research into new areas, yet builds on the solid platform of existing knowledge about the regulation and function of p53. State of the art genomic, proteomic, metabolomic and imaging analyses will be used to identify the roles of p53 in the response to metabolic stress caused by nutrient deficiency or excess, and investigate how these activities balance cell survival and cell death. Models will be developed to address how these functions of p53 relate to the control of metabolism and disease in vivo. Understanding how the cellular response to metabolic stress is controlled, and identifying a role for p53 in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis has enormous potential to influence the diagnosis and treatment of disease.
