Furthermore, they strongly support today's information society as inter-system communication enabler.\n\nConsequently boundaries of application domains are alleviated and ad-hoc connections and interoperability play an increasing role. At the same time, multi-core and many-core computing platforms are becoming available on the market and provide a breakthrough for system (and application) integration.\n\nA major industrial challenge arises facing (cost) efficient integration of different applications with different levels of safety and security on a single computing platform in an open context.\n\nThe objective of the EMC\u00b2 project (Embedded multi-core systems for mixed criticality applications in dynamic and changeable real-time environments) is to foster these changes through an innovative and sustainable service-oriented architecture approach for mixed criticality applications in dynamic and changeable real-time environments.\n\nThe EMC2 project focuses on the industrialization of European research outcomes and builds on the results of previous ARTEMIS, European and National projects. It provides the paradigm shift to a new and sustainable system architecture which is suitable to handle open dynamic systems.\n\nEMC\u00b2 is part of the European Embedded Systems industry strategy to maintain its leading edge position by providing solutions for:\n. Dynamic Adaptability in Open Systems\n. Utilization of expensive system features only as Service-on-Demand in order to reduce the overall system cost.\n.

Our work serves a broad range of civil society actors, including marginalised people. Currently our work contributes most directly to three areas: 1. Active citizenship, democracy & participation, 2. Social cohesion, equity and equality, 3. Migration and demographic change.\r\n\r\nWith our focus on education to strengthen civil society and active citizenship, we have found ourselves responding to increasingly prominent refugee and migrant issues. Consequently, for 2017-19 we have identified two key areas of strategic development:\r\n1) Educating for Resilience in Refugee Solidarity Work\r\n2) Transversality and Strategising for Inclusion.\r\n\r\n1) Under the first we want to be better equipped to support adult educators and other organisers and volunteers engaged in refugee solidarity work. We want our own trainers to gain key skills and competences to address new challenges. We also seek to develop our capacity to train others (including educators) in specific topics we have identified as crucial to supporting that work. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we aim for this project to enable staff to acquire skills to work with: burnout; trauma and post-traumatic stress; knowledge and skills from the work of HRDs on security that is transferable; all in support of educators and volunteers working on refugee solidarity.\r\n\r\n2) We recognise that educational work engaging migrants can be greatly enhanced by tools and approaches developed in \u2018Anti-Oppression Pedagogy\u2019. Also, that contributing as adult educators to addressing the many social issues related to refugees and migrants requires strong transversal and civil society cooperation across sectors and movements. Improved strategic thinking and planning is crucial to meet these important challenges. \r\n\r\nTherefore, under the heading of \u2018Transversality and Strategising for Inclusion\u2019, we are planning this project to meet the need to: deepen our understanding of anti-oppression pedagogies and especially more effective ways to help adult educators work with diversity and the challenges of \u2018othering\u2019 as it manifests in themselves and amongst their learners; and deepen our understanding of transversal cooperation within civil society and how that can inform the strategic development of our educational work.\r\nThe project also has aims at the European level, which include: Connecting with organisations and trainers who can support us to meet the above objectives; extending the provision of our educational work and strengthening our connections with networks developing similar work; to share best practice and innovation to increase sectoral capacity.\r\n\r\nDuring 2017 and 2018, 20 members of staff (comprised of a balance of more and less experienced personnel) will attend courses focused on the themes identified in our strategic plan. The learning will be integrated into the work of Transformative Education; shared across the sector; form the basis of developing and delivering new and innovative curricula that will support educators, professionals and volunteers engaged in refugee and migrant solidarity work, as well as refugees and migrants directly.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, staff will see: Increased foreign language competence; Increased opportunities to network and forge connections with European educators and organisations; increased inter-cultural experience; increased sharing and learning of best practice; and new and enhanced skills that will improve their professional development and ability to gain and secure paid employment.\r\n\r\n We have chosen the Ulex Project (run by Col\u00b7lectiu Eco-Actiu) as the training provider because it is possibly unique in Europe as a residential educational centre focused on providing high quality training for civil society organisations to support \u2018social movement impact and resilience\u2019. Their methodological approach is called \u2018Integral Training\u2019, it is participatory, applied and learner-centred. All aspects we value highly in adult education. They complement their in-house facilitation team by bringing together talented international trainers. Together with their efforts to pilot and develop new curricula, this offers access to some of the best and most innovative training in the field.\r\n\r\nThe longer term benefits will include: Increased provision of refugee solidarity education; greater well-being and professional longevity for educators doing this work; enhanced social integration and inclusion; increased excellence in the design and delivery of new and innovative curricula; more effective strategic alliances and cooperation between civil society entities (including those involved in informal adult education); increased trans-European cooperation between educators; and an increase in a sense of a positive and progressive European identity.", null, "Transformative Education C.I.C", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA104-036007_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["9AH", "CERES INTERNATIONAL ALJEZUR LIMITED", 22657.0, "Promoting entrepreneurship and improving the competitiveness and access to markets of Union enterprises  (02.02.01)", "fts_2016_37909", 2016], ["9AN", "CLEAR CONNECTION UK LTD", 1391.0, "Other management expenditure (26.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_37862", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "BS7"}
