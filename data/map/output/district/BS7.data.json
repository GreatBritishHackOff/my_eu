Furthermore, they strongly support today's information society as inter-system communication enabler.\n\nConsequently boundaries of application domains are alleviated and ad-hoc connections and interoperability play an increasing role. At the same time, multi-core and many-core computing platforms are becoming available on the market and provide a breakthrough for system (and application) integration.\n\nA major industrial challenge arises facing (cost) efficient integration of different applications with different levels of safety and security on a single computing platform in an open context.\n\nThe objective of the EMC\u00b2 project (Embedded multi-core systems for mixed criticality applications in dynamic and changeable real-time environments) is to foster these changes through an innovative and sustainable service-oriented architecture approach for mixed criticality applications in dynamic and changeable real-time environments.\n\nThe EMC2 project focuses on the industrialization of European research outcomes and builds on the results of previous ARTEMIS, European and National projects. It provides the paradigm shift to a new and sustainable system architecture which is suitable to handle open dynamic systems.\n\nEMC\u00b2 is part of the European Embedded Systems industry strategy to maintain its leading edge position by providing solutions for:\n. Dynamic Adaptability in Open Systems\n. Utilization of expensive system features only as Service-on-Demand in order to reduce the overall system cost.\n. Handling of mixed criticality applications under real-time conditions\n. Scalability and utmost flexibility\n.

Based on the methodologies of a service-oriented architecture and the results of previous projects CRYSTAL focuses on an industry-driven approach using cross-domain user stories, domain-specific use cases, public use cases, and technology bricks.

For successful implementation of Smart City technologies two main elements are\nconsidered:\n- Cities are the customer: considering local specificities in integrated urban plans and the need to develop monitoring\nsystems to extract conclusions for replication.\n- Solutions must be replicable, interoperable and scalable.\nREPLICATE considers also the complexity of cities, the tangible benefits for citizens, the financial mechanisms and the new\nbusiness models. The 3 pillars implemented in the pilots with the engagement of citizens, private actors and authorities are:\n- Low energy districts: cost-effective retrofitting, new constructive techniques with optimal energy behaviour and high\nenthalpy RES in residential buildings. Include also efficient measures in public and residential buildings: ICT tools, PV,\nshading or natural ventilation; district heating is demonstrated hybridising local biomass, recovered heat and natural gas.\n- Integrated Infrastructure: deployment of ICT architecture, from internet of things to applications, to integrate the solutions in\ndifferent areas. Smart Grids on electricity distribution network to address the new challenges, connecting all users:\nconsumers, producers, aggregators and municipality.
