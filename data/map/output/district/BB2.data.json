During their vocational training learners will increase their professional qualification and employability.\r\nWe intent to send about 200 students and apprentices of Tyrol to companies in Europe. The average training period will be between 4 and 20 weeks. During their placements trainees will improve their language skills, professional and social competences such as flexibility, persuasiveness, ability to handle work pressure, contact to colleagues/senior staff/external people. They will also obtain an insight in other cultures, mentalities and enterprises. \r\n\r\nThe project consists of a network of European intermediaries, receiving enterprises, sending partners of regional companies and vocational education schools (e.g.: secondary schools and colleges) such as the HLW Reutte, HBLA West, Zillertaler Tourismusschulen, Villa Blanka, Ferrarischule, HLW Landeck and Tyrolean companies for example: Swarovski Optik KG or TH\u00d6NI Industriebetriebe GmbH.\r\nThe planned project (scheduled for 24 months and starting in June 2017) is a long-term strategy in order to offer ongoing EU-granted placements to young Tyroleans. The demand on the part of students in vocational education is increasing, also the number of apprentices taking part. The project is managed and coordinated by the Local Agency Tyrol and it\u00b4s experienced staff, in close with the sending institutions as well as with the regional Chamber of Labour and the Tyrolean Government. The special character of the project is the use of expertise of previous projects and established links with social and regional partners.\r\n\r\nThe projects\u00b4 information and awareness activities will continue all over the project period, in form of e.g.: press releases, facebook www.facebook.at/bewegdeinleben, entries in (partner) websites etc.", "http://www.mkillumination.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA102-034832_21"], ["1LH", "\"Pr\u00e1cticas en otros pa\u00edses europeos: llave para la empleabilidad de los alumnos de Tevian\"", "Blackburn College", 10618.0, "Tevian is a center specialized in the Personal Image field. At the moment, we offer technical degrees in hairdressing and beauty therapy. \r\nOur Erasmus experience started in 2009 with our first ECHE (Higher Education) letter. It was complicated, but today we can say that we have established and consolidated links with companies in the sector. Three years ago, we embarked on Erasmus + and two years ago we achieved a goal that we had pending: the approval of our middle grade project, a project that we want to consolidate and improve with this third project.\r\nFor this project we have an intermediary partner EME S.L. (Poland) and two host partner: Blackburn College (UK) and ZDZ Kielce (Poland). In both cases, our students will do their \u201cFCT\u201d(practices in vocational training centers) in the hairdressing salons and the aesthetic installations of these centers.\r\nEME S.L. provides students work placements, internships and travel in other European countries. Normally their exchanges take place between Poland and Spain. We know it from our previous experience as host partners of Polish students. The good results of our first experience and the first phases of our current project have encouraged us to include it in our project. This mobility will take place in ZDZ Kielce, a leading vocational training center in \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie province with a great experience in European programs and where our students will be for 1 month.\r\nBlackburn Mobility will last 60 days (for linguistic reasons and because we have more previous experience as host partners). Blackburn College is a center specialized in the education of youngsters and adults whose offer ranges from \"pre-entry level programs\" to university masters. Among its many facilities are those dedicated to the personal image: a spa, 5 hairdressing salons, 4 aesthetic booths and a makeup studio.\r\nWe request 4 mobilities; 2 for Kielce and 2 for Blackburn. In principle, 2 are aimed at hairdressing and 2 aesthetics. However, since both study partners of the 2 families were available, if there were not enough interested students (a very unlikely circumstance seeing the requests of the last project), that place / s would automatically be transferred to the other department.\r\nThe beneficiaries of this project that will be part of their curriculum and will mark the beginning of their transition to the world of work are our second year students. Their ages range from 17 to 27 years (although the average age is in the 18-19 years) and the majority are women. An important part of our students comes from small urban centers relatively far from Valencia capital and its metropolis. From our internal quality surveys, it is clear that a significant number show a great root for their local nuclei that leads them not to think about labor mobility in the future. However, this trend is decreasing each year, while at the same time there is a feeling of openness to Europe.\r\nAs for the selection process, we would organize an information day, set a deadline for formal application, and then the international department would choose the beneficiaries based on the academic results (35%), English level (30%), And the valuation of teachers (35%). In addition to this information days, there is a need to add more activities before mobility (signing agreements, international meetings, talks with host partners, language training, cultural and Erasmus + training with beneficiaries, etc.) during mobility (meetings / evaluations Weekly study leaders with the tutors of the host partner etc.) and after mobility (evaluation, dissemination of results etc.)\r\nIn terms of impact, students will develop a greater cultural background that will include better language skills and greater openness to other cultures. This baggage will also be academic and professional. When performing their practices in salons linked to VET centers they will know another educational system (we will also do the same with the incorporation of new methodologies) and work and different work techniques specific to the field of hairdressing or beauty therapy. In addition, they will also gain professional contacts and new friendships, autonomy and maturity.\r\nShort-term / medium-term effects include employability (the main objective of this project, which will be reinforced by the cultural, linguistic and attitudinal impacts just mentioned) and the desire to continue to studying. As a long-term impact we find from a future employment in the host country or in any other until we continue to bet on the Erasmus + program and its values as future teachers, entrepreneurs or parents. Finally, it should be noted that the impact and objectives of our project, together with the rest of the participants, could lead to educational reforms.", "http://www.blackburn.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-035765_1"], ["6AE", "Volunteer For Diversity and Inclusion", "Youth Action Ltd", 63823.0, "Youth Action is an award-winning charity supporting vulnerable groups of young people to increase their skills, confidence and employability options.\r\n\r\nWe work on a range of programmes namely volunteering, mentoring, skills workshops, interfaith and intercultural dialogue, sustainable development and community social action.\r\n\r\nThe project, entitled Volunteering For Inclusion, supports the EVS volunteers to come to the UK to take part in, develop and review a range of inclusion, interfaith and intercultural projects which all ultimately bring about more inclusion and break down barriers.
