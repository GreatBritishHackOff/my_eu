Automated processes for DNA analysis of large numbers of samples are now used in many of the EU member states; however the most efficient of these high throughput systems can take 3-5 days to produce DNA database-compliant profiles. In high profile crime and terrorism cases it is crucial to access DNA results promptly to provide intelligence to investigators. Currently a small number of samples can be processed in less than 24 h but the method is labour intensive and expensive. MiDAS proposes a real-time, simple-to-operate and cost effective alternative. MiDAS will build on the current expertise of the consortium to deliver a robust, reliable instrument adaptable to the needs of multiple EU agencies. The design will allow processing of small numbers of samples at the scene of a crime, in an office environment or in the laboratory. Samples will be directly introduced to the device; no further manual involvement will be required. DNA will be extracted using magnetic bead technology and transferred to reaction chambers for quantification and amplification which will be controlled to normalise the DNA profile. The profile will be visualised following analysis through on-cartridge DNA separation and laser induced fluorescence\u2013based detection. Automated data analysis using expert systems will facilitate the timely delivery of a profile. The requirements for implementation of the instrument into the forensic process will be determined, including an evaluation of relevant legislative and data protection requirements.

One aim is also to support the lifelong learning skills like problem solving skills, communication skills, initiative and entrepreneurship.

With the help of the VET staff mobilities also their commitment to develop the mobilities of apprentices increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the project the network partners organise 43 apprentice mobility exchanges in another EU/ETA-country for Finnish apprentices, who are completing vocational qualifications, further or specialist quialifications in different professional fields. The hosting partners in eight countries have been chosen in order to enable a multi-field project. The apprentices have a work contract with their employers and they apply for a work leave for the time of the on-the-job learning period abroad. Also apprentices who work as entrepreneurs are encouraged to participate on-the-job learning abroad. The length of the exchange varies from two weeks to eight weeks due to the fact that the apprentices are in work contract with the training companies.

During the period they strengthen also their personal skills and facilities, which thee need also more widely in the working life and in the society. When planning the periods and during the periods the students get rehearsal in problem solving skills and communication skills in a foreign language. The period develops flexibility and adaptability to work and live in another country and culture as well as the ability to accept the challenges. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the staff training periods abroad the teachers get the possibility to follow and observe the trainng in the partner VET organization and to get familiarized with the working places in their professional field and the life of work in the partner country. Thus the staff mobility periods serve the enlargement of the professional skills of the teachers. Through the staff mobility also the practices of the recognition of the on-the-job learning periods abroad and usage of learning outcomes approach are developed.
