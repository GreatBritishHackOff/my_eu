Automated processes for DNA analysis of large numbers of samples are now used in many of the EU member states; however the most efficient of these high throughput systems can take 3-5 days to produce DNA database-compliant profiles. In high profile crime and terrorism cases it is crucial to access DNA results promptly to provide intelligence to investigators. Currently a small number of samples can be processed in less than 24 h but the method is labour intensive and expensive. MiDAS proposes a real-time, simple-to-operate and cost effective alternative. MiDAS will build on the current expertise of the consortium to deliver a robust, reliable instrument adaptable to the needs of multiple EU agencies. The design will allow processing of small numbers of samples at the scene of a crime, in an office environment or in the laboratory. Samples will be directly introduced to the device; no further manual involvement will be required. DNA will be extracted using magnetic bead technology and transferred to reaction chambers for quantification and amplification which will be controlled to normalise the DNA profile. The profile will be visualised following analysis through on-cartridge DNA separation and laser induced fluorescence\u2013based detection. Automated data analysis using expert systems will facilitate the timely delivery of a profile. The requirements for implementation of the instrument into the forensic process will be determined, including an evaluation of relevant legislative and data protection requirements. Successful forensic validation of the instrument and subsequent validation of the full forensic process designed around the instrument will allow implementation of MiDAS to the forensic community within the partner EU member states, enabling the delivery of early DNA intelligence to law enforcement and security agencies.", 322422.0, 3961447.0, "MIDAS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.gxl.co.uk", null, "fp7_95760_996028011"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1XJ", "Staff Mobility 2017", "Coleg Gwent", 2311.0, "Vocational Staff Training Mobility.\r\nThis will develop a new partnership looking at curriculum for children with additional needs across Europe. It will allow staff to deliver their curriculum in a broader international context.\r\nThe wider aim is to broaden the participants employment opportunities throughout the UK.  To encourage them to look at employment in other EU countries that are desiring English Speaking employees.  To learn the impact of social policy and to experience different approaches to the vocational area to additional learning needs.  The participants will be encouraged to develop their interpersonal soft skills and improve their professionalism during the placement in preparation for their future employment. These are opportunities that not all learners will have the opportunity to access during their life due to socio-economic factors. \r\nThe participants will develop a knowledge and understanding of vocational skills and approaches adopted by other European countries; it will encourage personal development and afford an opportunity to experience an culture.  It is anticipated that this experience will result in increased confidence and motivation for the participants and future recruits.  The success of this will be disseminated to other colleagues and departments with the hope of attracting future participants, broadening the local community and the College.  The potential for long term benefits will hopefully be the successful recruitment of learners to vocational education and their understanding of the EU opportunities for future employment.\r\nThe presentation of the Europass mobility will show that the students had a chance of a courageous adventure in order to enhance their success in their employability in future job markets.", "http://www.coleggwent.ac.uk", "Coleg Gwent", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-035827_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NP15"}
