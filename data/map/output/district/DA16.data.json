The school employs a full time dedicated SEN department to support those students with additional needs. This work has paid off in that the value added score for both SEN students and EAL are actually slightly higher than our non SEN/EAL students.\r\n\r\nThe funding that accompanied designation as a Specialist Language College enabled us to enhance our Language provision throughout the school to become one of the leading schools in the country for the delivery of Modern Foreign Languages. \r\n\r\nThe school's status as a Specialist Language College is still extremely important and a total of seven modern languages are offered to students. \r\n\r\nAlthough the funding ended, its powerful legacy has shaped the school, underpinned our move to the International Baccalaureate Diploma and allows us to remain at the top of this area of the curriculum.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll students must take at least 2 languages to GCSE, and all International Baccalaureate (IB) students in the sixth form must also take a language as part of their course. \r\n\r\nIn September this year, the sixth form will go fully IB. meaning that every student will be required to study a foreign language from year 7 to 13. \r\n\r\nWe teach all our lessons in target language to a high standard, however in a large MFL department of 17 teachers we only have 3 native speakers of their teaching language. We are all very proficient, but as non-natives, raising our level of knowledge of target language and culture is an ongoing requirement.\r\n\r\nWe plan a 2-year project involving MFL staff it will involve 7 MFL teachers taking part in 11 immersion courses in Spain, France, Italy and Germany. They will each visit the country of their main specialism (one taking two mobilities) to further develop and refresh their skills. Three of the 7 would additionally visit the country of their second MFL specialism. This would be a total of 4 mobilities to France, 3 to Spain, 3 to Germany and 1 to Italy.\r\n\r\nThe immersion courses include intensive language learning, cultural immersion and focused cultural activities, language teaching methodology and pedagogy, opportunities for discussion with other MFL professionals and the opportunity for participants to spend time in a European school, sharing practice and developing links.\r\n\r\nWe need to increase our use of target language beyond the confines of the MFL curriculum. We already focus on pupil interaction language and avoid English entirely within our MFL classrooms but would like to really boost our own linguistic abilities in order to be able to deliver an experience which is increasingly authentic.", "http://www.bexleygs.co.uk", "Bexley Grammar School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047006_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DA16"}
