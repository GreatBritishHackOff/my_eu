Conventional coatings are very high in heavy metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), both of which are serious health hazards. Development of novel multifunctional polymer coatings with reduced environmental impact was an important objective of the EU-funded project http://www.transcond.org (TRANSCOND) .\n\nResearchers went much further, though, with sprayable, transparent and permanently conductive coatings employing nano-structured carbon and boasting significantly enhanced technical properties. In just two short years, the partners have developed a range of commercially available coatings that can be obtained through links on the project website. In addition, three of the five products are compatible with the EU's directive on technical requirements for equipment used in potentially explosive environments (ATEX Directive 94/9/EC).\n\nThe coatings are largely water-based for a major relief from VOCs. Depending on the application, they are compatible with glass, plastic and/or metal. One transparent coating is designed for displays, protective screens, oven doors and large areas such as flooring. \nIn addition to traditional scientific dissemination routes, three project videos are available on the project website and on YouTube. A LinkedIn group has also been established.\n\nTRANSCOND's highly innovative electrically conductive coatings will help the small and medium-sized enterprises that have been integral in their development expand their markets considerably.

Misunderstandings between first responders makes decision-making slower and more difficult. However, spread and development of networks and Emergency Management Systems (EMS) has improved emergency responses, becoming more coordinated. Despite improvements made in recent years, EMS have not still solved problems related to cultural, legal and linguistic differences which are the real cause of slower decision-making. In addition, from a technical perspective, the consolidation of current EMS and the limitations of their exchanged data formats offers another problem to be solved in any solution proposed for information interoperability between heterogeneous EMS surrounded by different contexts.\nTo overcome this problem, a two step solution is proposed: (i) As main objective and foundations of this proposal, the development of a common and modular ontology shared by all the stakeholders offers the best solution to gather all stakeholders knowledge in a unique and flexible data model, taking into account different countries cultural, linguistic and legal issues (ii) Taking advantage of  the fact that most legacy Emergency Management Systems are based on Service-Oriented-Architectures (SOA), i.e. they collect information from services offered by other systems (e.g. Geographic Information Systems), the interoperability burden will be addressed by means of transparent SOA mediation algorithms compliant with current data formats and existing solutions.\nTaking into account the heterogeneity and diversity of all existing scenarios in crisis episodes, the potential results of this proposed ontology-based interoperability solution will be validated through the design and development of a realistic prototype scenario actively involving both emergency managers and emergency first responders.", 181681.0, 2934779.0, "DISASTER", "Reconfiguring emergency information", "An EU team is examining the sharing of cross-border emergency information in culturally appropriate ways.

While new emergency management systems (EMSs) may improve communications and coordination, they do not address cultural, linguistic and legal differences given in international context.\n\nSuch factors may hinder emergency response, but special coordination systems using common data formats could eliminate some of the dangers. Such is the goal of the EU-funded project 'Data interoperability solution at stakeholders emergencies reaction' (http://disaster-fp7.eu (DISASTER)).\n\nThe seven-member consortium proposes to develop a common and modular mapping ontology suitable for all the different stakeholders. The system gathers stakeholder knowledge in a model that flexibly adapts to differing cultural circumstances.\n\nFurthermore, the project aims to develop transparent mediation algorithms based on services-oriented architecture, providing seamless integration with current legacy EMSs (protocols and formats).\n\nDISASTER commenced in early 2012 and concludes in January 2015. During the first reporting period, the project defined the detailed technical software development to be undertaken. A namespace has been registered, and the ontology published according to W3C best practices.\n\nThe project's solution was demonstrated with a real mediation scenario, involving a heath fire across the German\u2013Dutch border. In the scenario, the same information was displayed according to the differing needs of two sets of fire fighters. For example, a map of the situation (Common Operational Picture) on one side of the border was shared (translated) with colleagues on the other side. Also, each team uses different icons to represent the situation. The scenario, using two real EMSs, validated the project's concept. Nevertheless, certain technical issues are yet to be resolved.\n\nConsortium representatives took part in a conference uniting all relevant stakeholders. The project demonstrated its research, especially the German-to-Dutch icon translation, and sought feedback from experts.\n\nThe DISASTER project has highlighted an effective interface of legacy EMSs between neighbouring countries, each of which updates the other side in culturally appropriate ways.

The main requirements are: durability, ease of installation, optical appearance, ease of cleaning and low cost maintenance.\nOn the other hand slip accidents are a major source of injury in Europe. The floorings industry is therefore challenged to develop flooring with improved slip behaviour under varying environmental conditions (humidity caused by rain or cleaning can reduce friction dramatically). Besides there is often a conflict of interest between decreasing slipperiness and maintaining ease of cleaning  because conventional approaches to reduce slipperiness imply the macroscopic roughening of the surface resulting in the collection of dirt (problem in hospitals).\nWith new standards and testing methods harmonised in Europe this problem becomes more prominent, requiring substantially new and innovative approaches to address the problem by the flooring industry, like material suppliers, coating technology manufacturers, flooring installers, cleaners and companies developing testing methods.\nSlipSafe involves the key players in the industry in an integrated bottom-up approach. Based on fundamental studies of the tribological phenomena of slip under varying environmental conditions, SlipSafe will develop new intelligent material formulations and processes to gain control of the interface between flooring and shoe. New technologies will allow the use of these new materials in flooring manufacturing as well as in an after-treatment process to renew existing or worn out floorings with anti-slip properties.
