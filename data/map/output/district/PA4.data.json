However, this cell transplantation approach has given inconsistent results, with some patients doing extremely well and coming off anti-PD medication for years, whilst others have shown no or only modest clinical improvements, and in some cases also developed severe, off-state graft-induced dyskinesias (GIDs). The reasons behind this heterogeneity of outcomes, and the emergence of GIDs in particular, need to be better understood, not least in the perspective of the rapid advances that are now being made in the development of stem-cell based therapies. There is therefore an urgent need to revisit the trials that have already been done with fetal VM tissue in PD patients, with the expectation that a critical reassessment can form the basis for an optimised and more standardised procedure that will translate into more consistently efficacious transplants with minimal side-effects. Over the last two years a group of international experts, including the key investigators of the previous European and North American trials, has been re-examining the outcome of these trials as well as reviewing the results obtained from recent and ongoing animal experimental studies, and identified a number of weaknesses that may explain the inconsistent outcome in previous trials. As a result of these discussions, the group has agreed to join forces in a new round of experimental work and cell therapy trials in PD, based on a new jointly developed protocol where all these factors are taken into account. In the first instance fetal VM tissue containing mesencephalic DA neuroblasts will be used, with the expectation that this will pave the way for bigger trials using dopaminergic neurons derived from stem cells.", 141835.0, 13189031.0, "TRANSEURO", "Honing protocols for Parkinson's stem cell therapy", "Current research is fine-tuning stem cell-based treatments to achieve consistent benefits for patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD).", "Motor symptoms of PD are caused by death of dopamine-generating cells in the area of the brain known as the substantia nigra. Currently there is no cure for PD but one of the most successful reparative treatments is the use of foetal dopaminergic (DA) cell-based treatments.\n\nAllo-transplantation of DA neuroblasts obtained from foetal stem cells from ventral mesencephalic (VM) tissue has provided inconsistent results. Some patients do very well and others show only modest improvement of clinical symptoms. In some cases, however, the transplantee develops graft-induced dyskinesis (GID), abnormal involuntary movements.\n\nThe aim of the 'Neural transplantation in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease' (Transeuro) project is to develop a protocol for neural transplantation that would produce more consistent benefits for the patient and less damaging side-effects.\n\nTranseuro project results so far include a method of foetal tissue dissection and preparation that maximises DA cell survival within the transplant. Importantly, the ratio of DA to serotoninergic neuron is kept in favour of DA which minimises the risk of GID.\n\nTo aid information exchange and optimisation of future research, Transeuro set up a foetal tissue dissection database. Dissection parameters between groups can thus be compared which will help in the validation process.\n\nThe researchers have optimised the hibernation media  for tissue derived from VM cells prior to clinical use. All centres are now using tirilazad mesylate as a neuroprotective agent.\n\nStudies on GID have revealed that this side-effect only occurs in animals with pre-existing dyskinesis that is L-Dopa induced. The team also showed that prolonged storage of tissue only affects graft survival and not the development of GIDs.\n\nTranseuro has already started recruitment for the clinical programme where subjects are less than 65 years old and without L-Dopa\u2013induced dyskinesis or other significant cognitive deficits or medical illnesses. After 12 months of monitoring in an observational study, they are eligible for a neural graft.\n\nProject scientists have achieved success in the aims and objectives of the first part of the programme. The Transeuro consortium's goal is to continue to improve stem cell-based therapy for PD patients for whom life can be very difficult, not to mention for carers and family as well.", "http://www.transeuro.org.uk/", null, "/docs/results/images/2012-10/52712.jpg", "fp7_94248_991280055"], ["9RT", "Contamination and defect control for increased yield for large scale R2R production of OPV and OLED", "Teknek Ltd", "While nanotechnology was originally limited to small areas of a few cm2, the quest for lower costs has been the latest years the drive for developing processes utilising larger substrate sizes at increasing throughputs. A typical example is the flat panel display industry where the push to larger gen size and faster processing has resulted in a significant cost reduction. The next challenge here is the move to smaller feature sizes. Large area processing at high speeds is optimal when using roll-to-roll (R2R) processing, able to deliver the ultimate cost reduction. Flexible innovative thin film devices, like organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) for lighting, photo voltaic (PV) and organic photo voltaic (OPV) modules, organic circuitry, printed electronics and thin film batteries, are currently developed using this kind of processing.\n\nThe overall objective of Clean4Yield is the development and demonstration of technologies and tools for nano-scale detection, cleaning, prevention and repair of defects and contaminations in nano-scale layers. The R2R production processes for OLED, OPV, and high-end moisture barrier layers on flexible substrates will serve as development platform for the various methods.

Hydrocarbons can be detected most sensitively in the 3.0 to 3.6 \u00b5m wavelength range. Two particular challenging applications with significant market potential are investigated within the project. Unfortunately there are no application grade semiconductor lasers in this wavelength range yet: On the short-wavelength side of this range interband lasers are available (RT cw operation for emission up to about 3.0 \u00b5m), while intraband quantum cascade lasers were demonstrated on the long-wavelength side (RT cw operation for emission above about 3.8 \u00b5m). An additional complication for applications in gas detection is given by the maximum available tuning range for suitable mono mode laser diodes, which is currently limited to a few nanometers. Concepts for an increased tuning range have so far been predominantly investigated at wavelengths around 1.55 \u00b5m for telecom applications. The aim of the SensHy proposal is to overcome these limitations and to achieve the following goals:<br/>- realize GaSb based laser material enabling RT cw operation in the wavelength range from 3.0 to 3.6 \u00b5m- develop multi-section DFB/DBR Lasers with increased electrical tuning capability- demonstrate highly sensitive hydrocarbon detection making use of widely tuneable lasers and novel digital-signal-processing schemes to identify various gas constituents within a multi-component hydrocarbon gas mixture<br/>In order to reach these goals significant challenges have to be overcome in various fields ranging from epitaxial semiconductor growth via laser design and processing to mid infrared sensor development of the project.
