It has a population of roughly 136,000 people. The council headquarters are located in Irvine, which is the largest town. The area also contains the towns of Ardrossan, Beith, Dalry, Kilbirnie, Kilwinning, Largs, Saltcoats, Skelmorlie, Stevenston, West Kilbride, as well as the Isle of Arran and the Cumbrae Isles. Our schools are in some of the most deprived areas of Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn order to enhance our provision of French and Spanish for our young learners and keep in line with national developments in the field of 1+2 Languages, we would like 53 members of our staff to participate in European mobility projects, namely one week immersion courses held in Lyon or Salignac in France or Malaga in Spain run by Languages for Education Europe and 'shadowing experiences' with partner schools abroad. These staff have been chosen on their individual merits, positivity and enthusiasm. Indeed, through Professional Review and Development discussions, these staff members have been identified as the key individuals who will benefit from the immersion courses/shadowing and make an impact on others in their school upon return. As reflective and forward thinking practitioners, such teachers will take the initiative to push their learning forward and share new ideas. This project will fuel their desire to improve both their own practice and that of others. The 'shadowing' experience would be part of the GTC's standards for Leadership and Management, contributing to our 'strategic vision' for the ethos and aims of our establishment to 'inspire and motivate learners, staff and all members of our learning community and it's partners'. This would be an educational opportunity to consolidate relationships we have already established with schools in France and Spain.\r\n\r\nThe chosen group represent a varied cross-section of our teaching staff to include Nursery, ASN, the Primary and Secondary sector, Language Assistants, Management and Leaders in the 1+2 Language Team.  We have also ensured that applicants are from a cross-section of cluster groups in our education authority i.e. Greenwood, Kilwinning, Irvine Royal, Largs Academy, St Matthew's, Arran High, Garnock, Ardrossan and Auchenharvie. Our Project Team are chosen carefully, so we can target and impact on as wide an audience as possible, in our teaching and learning community.\r\n\r\nOnce our staff members are up-skilled in the language(s) and current teaching methodologies, an action plan will be drawn up to ensure that the professional learning undertaken is recorded, so it can be reviewed and disseminated to other colleagues. North Ayrshire's strong self-evaluation and quality assurance policies will ensure that the learning activities undertaken on this Erasmus+ Project are reflected upon regularly and their impact  reviewed, measured and evidenced through professional review activities and triangulation feedback i.e. we will use multiple data sources when investigating the outcomes of this Project and how it has impacted on our young learners, their families and the surrounding community.\r\n\r\nAs well as benefiting our immediate communities, this European mobility project would provide opportunities to link up and partner with other European communities/schools through eTwinning. A key element of the immersion courses/shadowing experiences chosen is the effective use of ICT. Our schools have recently purchased ipads/tablets to motivate pupils. We will use these to enhance language learning and teaching and create new opportunities for connecting with other schools/communities in Europe, so improving the digital literacy of our learners.\r\n\r\nFinally, the ultimate aim of this European mobility programme, is that by immersing our teachers in languages abroad we will raise aspirations and expectations for pupils who live in areas of high deprivation where expectations can often be low. By raising these goals through our project of Modern Languages, we will help towards closing the attainment gap in our North Ayrshire schools.", "http://www.north-ayrshire.gov.uk", "North Ayrshire Council", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036081_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["8EE", "Ayrshire BG Business Competitiveness Programme", "North Ayrshire Council", "growth support programme which delivers an enhanced suite of business growth products to local SME\u2019s.", "ERDF", 941000.0, 2352500.0, "erdf_scotland_76"], ["8EE", "Poverty and social inclusion North Ayrshire", "North Ayrshire Council", "Support to members of the community in poverty and social inclusion with limited employment and education prospects.", "ESF", 610000.0, 1525000.0, "esf_scotland_136"], ["8EE", "north Ayrshire Employability pipeline - flat rate direct costs", "North Ayrshire Council", "Strategic Intervention management, administration and compliance.", "ESF", 204077.92, 510194.81, "esf_scotland_189"], ["8EE", "North Ayrshire Employability Pipeline", "North Ayrshire Council", "Operation will support vulnerable participants with multiple barriers through an employability pipeline focussed on those in SIMD areas.", "ESF", 1841910.0, 4604775.19, "esf_scotland_190"], ["8EE", "North Ayrshire Youth Employment Initiative", "North Ayrshire Council", "Supporting young unemployed people aged 16-29 into education, training and employment", "ESF", 2130000.0, 3190000.0, "esf_scotland_245"]]}}, "outwardCode": "KA12"}
