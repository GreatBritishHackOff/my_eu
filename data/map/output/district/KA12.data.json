The growing youth unemployment has reached the unprecedented scale, leaving a great number of young people graduating from school with no income and no perspectives. There are many governmental and civil society initiatives addressing this challenge but there is still a great need for exploring new possibilities of increasing young Europeans' chances on the highly competitive labor markets. The other challenge that our societies are facing is stemming from the low level of social involvement. Local communities are depopulating, there are less and less young people who would like to get more involved and do something for the benefit of their neighborhood, village or city.  Many people feel excluded and admit their lost important social bonds connecting them to the place they live in.  At the same time there is still a big number of active and devoted individuals with great ideas, who would like to have a job that has an impact on the community level, but just don't know how to start it. We believe social entrepreneurship can be the answer for both of those challenges and promoting the knowledge about the concept can both increase young people's chances on the job market and give them an opportunity to get involved in their communities. Even though the idea of SE is already quite spread among the youth workers, there is still a visible need for exchanging the experiences and knowledge on the topic, providing a proper flow of knowledge, especially between the countries from EU and Eastern Partnership. The propose project is  part of a series Keys to Employability (previous editions were devoted to soft skills and intercultural competence) that is to explore new possibilities of addressing the topic of youth unemployment. This seminar is to gather 28 youth workers and young leaders and provide them with a space for sharing the expertise, exploring and reflecting on the notion of SE in a more in-depth manner and building an international network of the organizations devoted to promote youth entrepreneurship as a way for empowering young people and contributing to the development of the communities they live in.The objectives of the project are defined as follows:- to promote the knowledge about social enrepreneurship and its  potential benefits for young people at risk of exclusion from labor market- to provide participants with practical tools and methods for prmoting entrepreneurial skills among their beneficiaries- to explore and discuss the challenges and solutions connected to work with young people who struggle to find a job - to get to know best practices of successful social entrepreneurships that reduced the unemplyment level and to provide participants with inspiration in the field- to build a sustainable network of individuals and organizations who are eager to establish international cooperation aiming at enhancing employability skills among youthThe project is expected to contribute to the increased capacities of participating organizations and individuals who will gain a new perspective on how to address the problem of youth unemployment through support of social entrepreneurship. As the dissemination is a crucial part of this training course, its effects will be visible among a broader network of stakeholders (authorities, other NGOs, public bodies and educational institutions) who will gain new on the topic and increase their knowledge on successful strategies for promoting employability.", "http://www.ceisayrshire.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-2-PL01-KA105-027323_4"], ["8AS", "Social Entrepreneurship as Local Force (SELF)", "CEiS Ayrshire", 17354.0, "The project \u201cSocial Entrepreneurship as Local Force (SELF)\u201d is developed in the framework of Erasmus+ Programme, KA1: Youth Mobility \u2013 partner countries.

It has a population of roughly 136,000 people. The council headquarters are located in Irvine, which is the largest town. The area also contains the towns of Ardrossan, Beith, Dalry, Kilbirnie, Kilwinning, Largs, Saltcoats, Skelmorlie, Stevenston, West Kilbride, as well as the Isle of Arran and the Cumbrae Isles. Our schools are in some of the most deprived areas of Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn order to enhance our provision of French and Spanish for our young learners and keep in line with national developments in the field of 1+2 Languages, we would like 53 members of our staff to participate in European mobility projects, namely one week immersion courses held in Lyon or Salignac in France or Malaga in Spain run by Languages for Education Europe and 'shadowing experiences' with partner schools abroad. These staff have been chosen on their individual merits, positivity and enthusiasm. Indeed, through Professional Review and Development discussions, these staff members have been identified as the key individuals who will benefit from the immersion courses/shadowing and make an impact on others in their school upon return. As reflective and forward thinking practitioners, such teachers will take the initiative to push their learning forward and share new ideas. This project will fuel their desire to improve both their own practice and that of others. The 'shadowing' experience would be part of the GTC's standards for Leadership and Management, contributing to our 'strategic vision' for the ethos and aims of our establishment to 'inspire and motivate learners, staff and all members of our learning community and it's partners'. This would be an educational opportunity to consolidate relationships we have already established with schools in France and Spain.\r\n\r\nThe chosen group represent a varied cross-section of our teaching staff to include Nursery, ASN, the Primary and Secondary sector, Language Assistants, Management and Leaders in the 1+2 Language Team.  We have also ensured that applicants are from a cross-section of cluster groups in our education authority i.e. Greenwood, Kilwinning, Irvine Royal, Largs Academy, St Matthew's, Arran High, Garnock, Ardrossan and Auchenharvie. Our Project Team are chosen carefully, so we can target and impact on as wide an audience as possible, in our teaching and learning community.\r\n\r\nOnce our staff members are up-skilled in the language(s) and current teaching methodologies, an action plan will be drawn up to ensure that the professional learning undertaken is recorded, so it can be reviewed and disseminated to other colleagues. North Ayrshire's strong self-evaluation and quality assurance policies will ensure that the learning activities undertaken on this Erasmus+ Project are reflected upon regularly and their impact  reviewed, measured and evidenced through professional review activities and triangulation feedback i.e. we will use multiple data sources when investigating the outcomes of this Project and how it has impacted on our young learners, their families and the surrounding community.\r\n\r\nAs well as benefiting our immediate communities, this European mobility project would provide opportunities to link up and partner with other European communities/schools through eTwinning. A key element of the immersion courses/shadowing experiences chosen is the effective use of ICT. Our schools have recently purchased ipads/tablets to motivate pupils. We will use these to enhance language learning and teaching and create new opportunities for connecting with other schools/communities in Europe, so improving the digital literacy of our learners.\r\n\r\nFinally, the ultimate aim of this European mobility programme, is that by immersing our teachers in languages abroad we will raise aspirations and expectations for pupils who live in areas of high deprivation where expectations can often be low. By raising these goals through our project of Modern Languages, we will help towards closing the attainment gap in our North Ayrshire schools.", "http://www.north-ayrshire.gov.uk", "North Ayrshire Council", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036081_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["8EE", "Ayrshire BG Business Competitiveness Programme", "North Ayrshire Council", "growth support programme which delivers an enhanced suite of business growth products to local SME\u2019s.", "ERDF", 941000.0, 2352500.0, "erdf_scotland_76"], ["8EE", "Poverty and social inclusion North Ayrshire", "North Ayrshire Council", "Support to members of the community in poverty and social inclusion with limited employment and education prospects.", "ESF", 610000.0, 1525000.0, "esf_scotland_136"], ["8EE", "north Ayrshire Employability pipeline - flat rate direct costs", "North Ayrshire Council", "Strategic Intervention management, administration and compliance.", "ESF", 204077.92, 510194.81, "esf_scotland_189"], ["8EE", "North Ayrshire Employability Pipeline", "North Ayrshire Council", "Operation will support vulnerable participants with multiple barriers through an employability pipeline focussed on those in SIMD areas.", "ESF", 1841910.0, 4604775.19, "esf_scotland_190"], ["8EE", "North Ayrshire Youth Employment Initiative", "North Ayrshire Council", "Supporting young unemployed people aged 16-29 into education, training and employment", "ESF", 2130000.0, 3190000.0, "esf_scotland_245"]]}}, "outwardCode": "KA12"}
