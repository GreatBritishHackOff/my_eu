The aim will be addressed by an integrated workplan comprising 1 management activity 5 interlinked RTD workpackages, and a dissemination and exploitation activity. In the RTD programme, Cybercolloids (CC) will produce and characterize 8 novel, LMWPs from alginate and agar raw materials provided by 2 SMEs - ROKO (RO) and Hebridean Seaweed (HS). The LMWPs will be screened using batch culture fermentations with human faecal bacteria, for prebiotic activity (i.e. ability to modulate beneficially the gut microflora) by University of Reading (UREAD). The 2 most effective agar and alginate LMWPs will be selected and bulk produced by CC for validation of prebiotic activity in a feeding trial in human volunteers (University of Ulster)). The end points to be assessed will be stimulation of beneficial bacteria (bifidogenic effects), increased short chain fatty acid production, beneficial effects on stool formation, and improvements in gut barrier function (assessed by an in vitro method). Additionally, benefits of the LMWPs towards plasma lipid profiles and blood glucose levels will be assessed. Alongside the human study, a detailed investigation of the effects of the selected LMWPs in an in vitro model of the human colon will be conducted by UREAD to provide supporting evidence for beneficial effects on bacterial types and activities in the colon. RO and HS in conjunction with CC will implement LMWP technology transfer and scale-up to facilitate production at an industrial scale. Subsequently, another SME Marigot Ltd, will provide a route to market and in conjunction with RO, HS and CC will exploit, with respect to the health and wellness sector, the relevant knowledge provided on the efficacy of novel LMWPs from alginate and agar.", 207204.0, 1057462.0, "HYFFI", null, null, null, "http://www.seaweedforhealth.org/", "http://www.hebrideanseaweed.co.uk", null, "fp7_94159_998321867"], ["9JY", "Crop Protection by Natural Raw Material Derived Biomolecules", "Hebridean Seaweed Company Limited", "The NatuCrop proposal seeks to develop a natural plant protection and biostimulant product for the SME\u2019s customers in the horticultural/agricultural industry.

It is also a suitable and safe replacement for agrochemicals that have been deregistered and removed from the market for safety reasons.

The consortium comprises 4 SME partners Hebridean Seaweed, Marigot, Coressence and Mesosystem, and 3 RTD providers \u2013 CyberColloids and Universities of Reading and Ulster. In the first stage of the project seaweed polyphenol extracts (SPEs) will be prepared. One of the SPEs will be produced at food grade quality from Ascophyllum. In addition, a series of novel polyphenol extracts from a range of seaweed types of relevance to the partner SMEs, will be prepared. All the extracts will be characterised for their polyphenol content. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the food grade SPE will be assessed in a dietary intervention trial in human subjects. The end points will include prevention of oxidative DNA damage in lymphocytes, and modulation of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines in plasma. In addition a short-term dietary intervention in human volunteers will be conducted to assess bioavailability and metabolism of the component polyphenols in the extract. Finally the novel SPEs will be investigated for anti-inflammatory and anti oxidant activity in vitro. The food grade SPE will be included as a comparator. In this way it should be possible to extrapolate from the in vitro activities to provide an estimate of the likely in vivo effects in terms of anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and to provide the SME\u2019s with candidate extracts with potential beneficial properties that can be further developed at a later stage.

Epidemiologic studies have shown that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, red wine and cocoa protects against such damage. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of these foods have been attributed to their high content of polyphenols.\n\nAlthough polyphenols from land plants are widely used as functional food ingredients and food supplements, seaweed sources have not been exploited. The main objective of the EU-funded 'Seaweed derived anti-inflammatory agents and antioxidants' (SWAFAX) project was to explore methods for extracting polyphenols from the seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum. The goal was to derive bioactive compounds from seaweeds for application in food and health and wellness products.\n\nOptimisation of the extraction methods led to a food-grade SPE containing a mixture of different molecular weight polyphenols. When tested on lymphocytes in vitro, this SPE exhibited substantial bioactivity and protected cells against DNA damage. It also demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity by reducing pro-inflammatory while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines.\n\nA human intervention study was conducted which entailed the consumption of one SPE by healthy volunteers. After an 8-week period, participants showed reduced levels of oxidants in their blood plasma and lower levels of DNA damage. Despite the inter-individual variation in absorption and metabolism of the polyphenols, there was an overall beneficial effect which could be translated into preventive measures against many degenerative diseases. \n\nExploitation of the SWAFAX SPE project could find a number of commercial applications with significant financial benefit for the implicated SMEs.
