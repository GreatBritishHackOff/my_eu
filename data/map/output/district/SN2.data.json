To achieve this, EPAD will also provide the analytical infrastructure to make correct observations regarding an intervention\u2019s value as an agent for secondary prevention. All this must exist in the right ethical, legal and social context. It must also be sustainable by being of value to numerous partners and stakeholders in the long term. The EPAD Consortium has been carefully designed to achieve the aim of secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nCurrent and recent drug development programmes in AD have been limited through the collection of heterogeneous samples of patients with advanced brain disease and an inability to measure effectively an index of disease course modification.\nRecruiting participants from clinics and the community for AD prevention trials with limited clinical background is both a risky and cost-inefficient strategy. Creating a disease register of people consented to enter secondary prevention trials delivers a degree of readiness that ensures better knowledge of a participants suitability and a more rapid throughput of screening for the trials. The EPAD Consortium has the necessary reach and influence from its partners to develop such a \u2018readiness\u2019 cohort.\nBy delivering an earlier, risk stratified population with run-in data in the EPAD Cohort across both clinical and biological domains; we can ensure a more homogenous population for study. We can also track changes in disease status as the basis for deciding on an intervention or combination of interventions likelihood of success in larger Phase 3 confirmatory trials.\nMost of the scientific community still consider A\uf062 dysregulation as central to AD so targeting this pathological process is a rational first step in what will be a standing trial. Other disease processes can be targeted when candidate interventions and intermediate phenotypes to reflect success are available.\nEPAD High Level Structure:\nThe IMI-EPAD Consortium will form the third part to a proposed IMI\u2013AD Platform (with IMI-EMIF-AD and IMI-Aetionomy) to produce a globally important superstructure for the secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nIMI-EPAD brings together all the major cohorts in Europe purposed for the exploration of disease processes and risks for dementia. In drawing from over 40 cohorts with almost 250,000 participants in 11 countries we have the basis for the EPAD Register from which we can draw the EPAD Cohort. Expertise in basic neurodegenerative sciences, epidemiology, statistics and trial design ensures that the standing proof of concept adaptive trial will have the optimal chance of delivering meaningful and definitive answers on an interventions likely success in confirmatory trials.\nIn establishing the International Scientific Synergy Group (ISSG) we have ensured that our work is visible to similar international initiatives and vice versa hence, through pooling know how and sharing data we can collectively overcome this devastating global disease.\nEPAD Work Packages and National Leadership:\nWe have created 8 work packages with 4 of these bound together in the EPAD Delivery Cluster which includes the scientific bedrock (WP1), the statistical engine room (WP2), the aggregation of suitable subjects (WP3) and trial delivery (WP4). These trial delivery activities are supported by project management (WP5), dissemination (WP6), business model and sustainability (WP7) and ethics, legal and social implications (WP8).

The use of alternative splicing (AS) is emerging as a core regulatory mechanism, in a similar way to whether a specific gene is transcribed or repressed, or a protein is degraded or stabilised. Also like both transcriptional and post-translational control, it seems that almost every gene in the human genome undergoes AS. Despite this, the role of AS in a fundamental cellular process, such as cell division is still poorly understood. This proposal aims to tackle this problem by assessing the role of AS in cell division.\n\nThe recent identification that the machinery involved in splicing, the spliceosome, is regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) during cell division strongly suggests AS, alongside PTMs, may have a core regulatory role in mitosis.

I will use a multidisciplinary approach of combining next-generation mRNA sequencing in human cells to take snapshots of multiple stages of cell division with validation using proteomic datasets. Further validation of individual candidates will be done by high-throughput fluorescence microscopy to discover potential novel regulators of cell division.

A particularly well-understood model system for studying the mechanisms of morphogen-mediated patterning is the vertebrate neural tube. Here, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) induces discrete neuronal progenitor domains through regulation of a combinatorial code of transcription factors. The observed precision and reproducibility of gene expression appears greater than can be accounted for by the precision of Shh signalling alone. Thus, mechanisms must exist that filter signaling noise. We hypothesize that this involves either the properties of the downstream transcriptional network regulated by Shh signaling or active cell sorting.\nThe proposed research project aims at quantifying the amount of noise in the pattern of gene expression in the vertebrate neural tube, and investigating how, at which level, and to which extent this noise is buffered. To achieve this goal, I will generate fluorescent reporters for the expression of three key Shh target genes, Nkx2.2, Olig2 and Pax6, and spatiotemporally correlate the activity of these reporters with Shh pathway activity. In parallel, a quantitative analysis of the behaviour of cells will be performed to elucidate the contribution of differential cell adhesion and active cell sorting. The combined results will be integrated into a theoretical framework to account qualitatively and quantitatively for Shh-mediated patterning of the neural tube.\nDue to the iterative deployment of Hedgehog (Hh) signalling during animal development and the evolutionary conservation of the Hh pathway, the types of mechanisms deduced from our quantitative analysis will probably not only apply to Shh-mediated patterning in the neural tube, but to a broad range Hh-mediated patterning processes.

HA consists of the receptor-binding HA1 and the fusion-mediating HA2, which has two membrane-interacting elements: the N-terminal fusion peptide and a C-terminal transmembrane anchor. At low pH, HA2 undergoes a series of conformational changes that project the fusion peptide out of a protein pocket towards the target membrane, and subsequently bring fusion peptide and transmembrane anchor, and likely the two membranes, into close proximity. The conformational changes are defined by crystal structures at neutral and low pH, but the membrane-associated parts of the protein were absent from the crystallization constructs.

The controlling principal source and loss mechanisms in the radiation belts are not yet completely understood. During a geomagnetic storm the length of time during which space assets are in danger is determined by the loss mechanisms, particularly by relativistic electron precipitation. The primary mechanism for this precipitation is the interaction of several wave modes with resonant electrons which leads to scattering into the atmospheric loss cone.\nThe nature of the wave activity and the interactions between the waves and radiation belt particles are strongly governed by the properties of the plasmasphere. At this point there are few existing and regular measurements of plasmaspheric properties, with existing plasmaspheric models lacking the structures known to exist in the real plasmasphere. There is evidence that enhanced wave activity and enhanced radiation belt losses occur due to such structures. In addition, there are large uncertainties concerning the fundamental nature of relativistic electron precipitation (REP), due to the difficulties of undertaking quality in-situ measurements.\nTo address these uncertainties in this proposed project we will provide regular longitudinally-resolved measurements plasmaspheric electron and mass densities and hence monitor the changing composition of the plasmasphere, one of the properties which determines wave growth. This will allow us to develop a data assimilative model of the plasmasphere. At the same time, we will monitor the occurrence and properties of REP, tying the time-resolved loss of relativistic electrons to the dynamic plasmasphere observations.\nOur approach will primarily use ground-based networks of observing stations, operating in the ULF and VLF ranges, deployed on a worldwide level.

It is readily affected by solar storms that impact the Earth's magnetosphere. At such times, the density of high-energy electrons and protons can vary by several orders of magnitude. During these so-called geomagnetic storms, space assets such as satellites are in danger.\n\nThe radiation belts overlap with the plasmasphere, a doughnut-shaped region of low-energy particles that co-rotates with the Earth. EU-funded scientists initiated the project PLASMON (A new, ground based data-assimilative modeling of Earth's plasmasphere - A critical contribution to radiation belt modeling for space weather purposes) to elucidate the role of the plasmasphere in the dynamics of the radiation belts.\n\nThe plasmasphere determines the growth and propagation of plasma waves that are responsible for the energisation of the radiation belts and particle loss through wave-particle interaction. PLASMON scientists attempted to identify and monitor how the two populations of particles interact through measurements by ground-based magnetometers.\n\nThe Automatic Whistler Detector and Analyzer Network (AWDANet) was extended and enhanced by whistler inversion capabilities and now it is able to provide plasmaspheric electron densities quasi real-time. In addition, the  existing MM100 and SEGMA magnetometer networks were extended  with new stations in Croatia, Lithuania, Namibia, Poland and Slovakia forming European Magnetometer Network (EMMA) obtaining plasma mass densities by Field Line Resonances (FLRs).  Very precise and complementary data collected at the same time and in different places helped to reveal changes in the densities in the plasmasphere .\n\nHowever, measurements only partly cover the plasmasphere. PLASMON scientists needed a global map of the plasma density in both time and space to determine the effect of wave-particle interactions on the radiation belts' dynamics. Data was, therefore, incorporated into a numerical model of the plasmasphere with advanced data assimilation schemes.\n\nThis physics-based model of the plasmasphere, continuously fed with new measurements, was used to identify structures inside or outside the plasmapause that are likely to result in enhanced electron losses. The PLASMON scientists monitored relativistic electron precipitation during periods of high geomagnetic activity by means of  the perturbation of military VLF transmitters'.\n\nThe presence of the radiation belts is a key factor in the design and operation of all spacecraft in low Earth orbit, as well as a natural hazard for astronauts.

However, these technologies address only two aspects of the process, namely the stability of the receptors during purification and the ability to form well-diffracting crystals. The strategies also apply only to GPCRs and not transporters or ion channels. The recent successes have been of GPCRs that are expressed in either yeasts or in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system, but many membrane proteins are expressed poorly in these systems or may be expressed in a misfolded non-functional form. A second issue with the future structure determination of GPCRs is the lack of generic technologies to allow the crystallisation of arrestin-GPCR and G protein-GPCR complexes. Although one G protein GPCR complex has been crystallised this was exceedingly diffciult and resulted in poor resolution of the GPCR component of the complex. We believe that it is possible to thermostabilise both arrestin and heterotrimeric G proteins, which will allow a simplified strategy for the crystallisation and structure determination of GPCR complexes.

Complex deep-sea environments are especially problematic. Ecosystem hotspots such as canyons or coral reefs contain true 3D morphology that cannot be surveyed with conventional techniques.

To face this challenge and avoid further fragmentation, nine leading organisations propose to establish a Network of Excellence in radioecology, called STAR. The goal is to efficiently integrate important organisations, infrastructures, and research efforts into a sustainable network that contributes to a European Research Area in radioecology. To achieve this, a Joint Programme of Activities will be implemented covering integration and sharing of infrastructures; training, education and mobility; knowledge management and dissemination; as well as three key research themes (integrating human and non-human radiological risk assessments; radiation protection in a multi-contaminant context; ecologically relevant low-dose effects). The coordinator, IRSN, is one of the largest radioecological research institutes in Europe with an excellent record in large project management. Three STAR partners are members of the High Level Expert Group on Low Dose Risk Research, ensuring that STAR will provide effective links to the wider community of low dose risk research.

Three different mixing processes (breaking of internal waves generated by tidal, mean or atmospheric-depression induced flow interacting with topography) are suspected to generate diabatic mixing, but their relative contributions both in terms of their magnitude and distribution in the vertical remain unclear. Furthermore, these processes are not taken into account in climate and ocean circulation models. The aim of the present project is thus to quantify the main different diabatic mixing processes in the Southern Ocean interior and to parameterise their effects within ocean models. Simple consideration of linear wave propagation and dissipation of internal waves in a stratified fluid will be used to create specific parameterisations of the missing physics in an eddy resolving model focussed around the Kerguelen Plateau.The parameterisations will be tested and refined by the comparison of model data with ARGO float data. The respective contributions of the three different mixing processes will be quantified and introduced in a global ocean circulation model in order to assess their impact on the MOC and CO2 uptake.

As a result, GO-SKA has updated the Description of Work. Some of the deliverables and milestones of the work packages have been altered to better accommodate the needs of the SKA Organisation, but the overall GO-SKA objectives remain unchanged.\n\nGO-SKA will work towards one integrated final deliverable, which will, among others, form a contribution to the coordinated Business Case for SKA1 construction.

Although most infections are mild, they cause one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases, infections in the eye can lead to blindness, active genital herpes necessitates caesarean delivery, and herpes encephalitis is usually fatal. Current anti-HSV drugs based on acyclovir are effective, but there will be a future need for alternative antiviral treatments. After a primary infection, HSV establishes a lifelong latent state from which it reactivates periodically, leading to recurring disease. Latent viral genomes are in a heterochromatin-like state in which transcription of almost all viral genes is repressed. Reactivation involves de-repression of viral gene transcription. Understanding the mechanisms by which HSV can establish, maintain and reactivate from latent infections may reveal avenues for the development of novel therapies. Cells express certain proteins that confer intrinsic resistance to DNA virus infections by repressing viral transcription. In turn, viruses encode proteins that combat this repression and thus increase viral gene expression. The interplay between these pathways determines whether HSV initiates a lytic or quiescent infection and is likely to be important in the regulation of latency.

Sensors and samplers have been employed to improve ability to measure properties in the ocean associated with the climate. This has included the deployment in both coastal and open sea of equipment for studying the biological carbon pump, mainly algae, which will provide ground-breaking insights into the ocean's role in the carbon cycle.\n\nZooplankton abundance and diversity is a key factor to understanding the carbon cycle within the ocean and marine scientists are now testing a long-term sampling device.\n\nAcidification of the world's oceans as a result of climate change is of growing concern.

Calcification is a fundamental physiological process of marine organisms that is largely determined by the characteristics of seawater. Calcifying marine organisms differ in their adaptability to variations in environmental conditions, in particular temperature and seawater pH. If global CO2 emissions continue to rise at current trends seawater pH may decrease to levels that are probably lower than have been experienced for tens of millions of years and, critically, at a rate of change 100 times greater than at any time over this period, with dramatic effects on productivity and marine ecosystems. CalMarO comprises investigation of calcification processes and the sensitivities to changes in environmental conditions at all scales ranging from cellular, organism, population to ecosystem, and regional to global levels. Covering this important topic in a training Network will offer young researchers an integrated perspective on an emerging problem and position their own work within the framework of a concerted effort to better understand the risks and consequences associated with ocean change.

Biogenic means they are produced by living organisms or biological processes.\n\nBio-calcification involves the production of crystals of calcium carbonate, which are used by marine plants and animals to build shells and skeletons to protect themselves. Changes in environmental conditions, such as global warming, which may affect ocean mixing and nutrient cycling, and ocean acidification can influence bio-calcification.\n\nThe impact of surface-ocean warming and acidification on marine organisms is uncertain, prompting the CALMARO training network to study this in detail. The project provided a supportive research environment that enabled fellows to investigate calcification processes and sensitivities to changes in environmental conditions. Studies extended from the cellular level through to the organism and population levels, and on to the ecosystem, regional and global levels.\n\nCALMARO's training programme was supported by three pillars: personalised programmes, network activities and dissemination.

However, formation waters are released through a 3 km long fracture 25 km north to the Sleipner platform while both natural gas and formation water are seeping through abandoned wells located in the area. The observed geological features pose a number of important questions that are currently addressed by ECO2: Are there any high permeability pathways for gas and fluid flow through the overburden? Are seepage rates amplified by the ongoing storage operation? May CO2 stored sub-seabed ultimately leak through the overburden via seismic pipe and chimney structures, fractures and abandoned wells?\n\nTo find answers, CO2 release  at three natural seep sites was studied and deliberate CO2 release experiments were conducted in the vicinity of the Sleipner storage complex.

This changing technological landscape is also affecting employment. Technological advances are also making some skills less marketable, while creating demands for other skills that have not traditionally been associated with drug development. Scientists that can communicate across disciplines are increasingly in demand and those with multidisciplinary skills are at a premium.

Euro-BioImaging will therefore develop a plan to construct and operate a set of complementary and strongly interlinked infrastructure facilities appropriately distributed across the European member states. To achieve this, Euro-BioImaging will define the legal and governance framework with its currently 22 member states and develop a finance plan in close cooperation with national funding bodies as well as with the European Commission. The key objective of the Euro-BioImaging preparatory phase project is to integrate these plans into an overarching business plan that provides a realistic basis for construction and operation of the Euro-BioImaging infrastructure. Through the combination of these technological and strategic objectives, Euro-BioImaging will be able to address the key elements of successful infrastructures: supporting research, training and innovation in biomedical imaging across Europe.", 26140.0, 5887700.0, "EURO-BIOIMAGING", "Expanding bioimaging infrastructure and access", "Biological imaging has advanced tremendously and with it understanding of how the body works in disease and health.

For example, the proneural Mash1 gene relocates away from the nuclear periphery when it is activated during neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Recently, the host laboratory demonstrated that the nuclear periphery plays a direct role in gene repression by experimentally relocating genomic loci to the nuclear envelope.

One soil-dwelling organism, the earthworm Eisenia andrei, served as the test case. Scientists studied uptake rate and routes and assessed internal distribution and speciation via evaluation of sectioned tissue, as well as growth and reproduction.\n\nThe bioavailability and toxicity of ZnO was very much affected by soil pH as a result of related effects on particle properties and fate. Interestingly, despite lower Zn accumulation in tissues of earthworms exposed to ionic Zn compared to nano ZnO, the earthworms exposed to ionic Zn exhibited greater toxicity. In similar results, earthworms exposed to coated and uncoated Ag NPs accumulated Ag tissue concentrations above the critical Ag body burden established for Ag ions, but without suffering the same toxicity.\n\nRegarding exposure routes, NPs are most likely ingested rather than absorbed through the skin as are ionic forms of trace elements.

This move minimised trade-offs in selecting projects based on limited funds. \n\nThe NANOSCI-EPLUS consortium created the framework for evaluation but the actual reviews and recommendations were made by an independent international panel of experts. The submission, evaluation and funding procedure was thus designed to ensure that the most deserving projects were funded with no consideration of international interests or barriers or of potential applications. \n\nNANOSCI-EPLUS funded 24 transnational collaborations on the interfacing of functional nano objects in the context of biology, electronics, photonics, plasmonics and more. Projects began in 2009, were reviewed for progress toward objectives in 2011 and final reports were to be delivered in April 2013.\n\nIn the relatively immature yet exponentially growing field of nanoscience and nanotechnology, funding of basic research has often taken a back seat to funding of projects with exciting potential applications. However, understanding the basic physics and materials interactions is prerequisite to knowledge-based and effective product development. \n\nThe NANOSCI-EPLUS consortium, through coordinated cooperation in research and funding at the national, regional and European levels, has established lasting partnerships for basic nanoscience research. Transnational collaborations will lead to exciting insights into the fundamental properties and behaviours of nano-scale objects. They will also form a solid foundation for many new and better focused applied research projects in the nanosciences.", null, "http://www.epsrc.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140725251.jpg", "fp7_89942_999637963"], ["1FL", "European Friedreich's Ataxia Consortium for Translational Studies", "Medical Research Council", "EFACTS (the European Friedreich\u2019s Ataxia Consortium for Translational Studies) assembles a body of expertise to adopt a translational research strategy for the rare autosomal recessive neurological disease, Friedreich\u2019s ataxia (FRDA). FRDA is a severely debilitating disease that leads to loss of the ability to walk and dependency for all activities. Some patients have cardiomyopathy that can cause premature death, visual and auditory loss, kyphoscoliosis, pes cavus, diabetes. Onset is usually in childhood, but it may vary from infancy to adulthood. FRDA involves child health and ageing aspects. FRDA affected individuals and clinical specialists are dispersed. This is a hindrance for patients to receive the care they need, and for clinicians and researchers to make progress. EFACTS has been created to move past this limitation. EFACTS strongly believes that, 12 years after European researchers discovered the FRDA gene, frataxin, when new treatments for FRDA are being developed, the time is ripe to invest in FRDA research in a concerted Europe-wide fashion. EFACTS gathers the critical mass of researchers and clinicians to exploit the patient base, research reagents and knowledge for progress. This comes when IT can act as a crucial support for collaborative work in collecting patient data and material, making it available to leading researchers for advanced analysis, research and drug development.

Failure to activate this process leads to multiple enzyme deficiencies, dysfunction of the respiratory chain with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and altered iron metabolism with mitochondrial iron accumulation.\n\nSince the frataxin gene fails to express in FRDA patients, restoring frataxin levels has been identified as major therapeutic target. Seminal work by an EFACTS partner using a cardiac conditional KO mouse model has provided proof-of-principle that gene replacement therapy with an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-derived vector can restore frataxin expression in the heart and prevent or reverse the progression of cardiomyopathy.\n\nWork to unravel the mechanism of frataxin gene silencing in FRDA has shown epigenetic modifications based on GAA nucleotide repeats, which could however be reversed to turn on gene expression. This observation has been recapitulated in two clinical studies, using either nicotinamide (known as vitamin B3), a class 3 HDAC inhibitor, or RG2833, a class 1 HDAC inhibitor, which were both able to restore frataxin levels in blood cells.

To investigate the reasons for the exclusion of the elderly in clinical trials and to provide solutions for this problem. INTRODUCTION. Although the elderly account for high drug consumption, they are underrepresented in clinical trials. With an increasingly ageing European population it is essential to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of drugs. Clinical trials need to take into account the relevant issues of this population, i.e. changed metabolism, multiple chronic conditions and poly-pharmacy. To examine this issue and effect a paradigm shift it is necessary to target gatekeepers and stakeholders of clinical trials. METHODS. The project will be coordinated by the Medical Economics and Research Centre, Sheffield, with guidance from the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research on Ageing at Keele University, UK. The 5 work packages (WP) will be carried out by a multi-disciplinary team of highly qualified experts in Geriatrics, Gerontology and social sciences. WP1 will involve a systematic review of the literature and review of ongoing clinical trials to assess the extent of exclusion of the elderly. Based on these findings WP2 and WP 3 will investigate why the elderly are underrepresented in clinical trials and what can be done to improve their participation. This will be carried out in 9 countries: UK, Spain, Holland, Italy, Poland, Lithuania, Romania, Israel and the Czech Republic. WP2 will research the views of health professionals and ethicists using structured questionnaires. WP3 will explore the perceptions of older patients and carers using a focus group methodology. For WP4, the recommendations from WP2 and WP3 will be used to develop a charter for the elderly in clinical trials. WP5 will disseminate and implement the findings. CONCLUSION.

Striatal neurons are also the main target of dopaminergic signals arising in the midbrain, the loss of which underlies Parkinson\u2019s disease, a common neurodegenerative disease.

The DevCoCast project will 1. disseminate existing environmental added-value datasets (both in-situ and satellite based) from various sources in Africa, South- and Central America and Europe in (near) real time and at no cost via GEONETCast to a broad range of user communities in Developing Countries and  2. promote and support the use of these products.  By utilizing the existing EUMETCast dissemination system, we can directly take benefit from the operational infrastructures and from a well developed user base in Africa and South-America. This enables us to focus our effort on the support of the use of the data and building up and maintaining the capacity in Developing Countries which includes training, workshops, networking and outreach.  The project sets up a number of pilot cases in Africa, South- and Central America and Asia and is conceived to have a big impact with a limited budget, by building upon existing production (SPOT-VEGETATION a.o.) and dissemination infrastructures (EUMETCast, FengYunCast), existing research projects (GEOLAND, VGT4AFRICA, MERSEA, GOOS, YEOS a.o.) and servicing all relevant environmental end-user communities.

For example, the vital statistics of contrast and luminance vary by several orders of magnitude within an image and during global changes in overall viewing conditions. The range of visual signals far exceeds the dynamic range of neurons in the retina.\nTraditional views dictate that during the visual contrast processing the retinal circuitry undergoes adaptation and thereby extends its dynamic range. This is intuitively appealing. However, recent studies have demonstrated an opposite form of plasticity \u2013 facilitation. Both adaptation and facilitation originate at the synaptic terminals of the bipolar cells. A combination of adaptation and facilitation might help to detect both an increase and decrease in contrast.

When performing risk assessment for eco-toxicological, human health or ground water vulnerability studies the major issue is not the total concentration of the heavy metal but its labile fraction i.e. the proportion of the metal transferable to an aqueous phase in ionic form. This may vary widely as a function of the solid forms in which the metal is hosted, the pH and redox conditions in pore waters that control the lability, or the occurrence of other species within the aqueous phase which may provide competitive sorption or preferential transport modes. Given the toxicity of a number of heavy metals even at low contents, accurate methods are required to properly monitor them in the environment and gain further insight in their behaviour. Simple extraction schemes are the most common procedure to assess natural availability of heavy metals in different scenarios. However, it has been demonstrated that these are unable to measure the true proportion of metal that may be exchangeable and contribute to lability, which may lead to unreliable risk assessments. This proposal seeks to accurately study the lability of heavy metals in several polluted scenarios by applying one of the most advanced methodologies for this purpose, namely \u2018isotope dilution\u2019 (ID). This technique reflects the pool of reactive metal in the soil and can be used to model solid-solution equilibria and the fixation of metal ions into less available forms. ID method has been successfully implemented for Cd, Zn and As, while a method for environmentally significant elements such as Fe, Sb and Se -particularly susceptible to redox conditions- remains to be developed.

The labile fraction is a truer indicator of risk, not rather than the total soil concentration, and it can vary widely depending on a number of factors. Given the toxicity associated with even small amounts of some heavy metals, accurate assessment is critical to safety.\n\nWith the support of EU funding, the project MEDEA was launched to investigate the use of one of the most sophisticated methodologies available, isotope dilution (ID). Scientists applied ID to contaminated soil types in two regional case studies. They also assessed the ability of ID to assess labile heavy metal content in fly ash (also known as flue ash, produced from the combustion of coal). Metals of interest were lead, zinc and cadmium.\n\nThe Rookhope catchment has been a lead mining area since Roman times. The team identified the best model of lead uptake by grass and heather, and also showed that managed heather burning recycles lead within the soil\u2013plant system. MEDEA outcomes will be particularly useful to owners of grazing cattle and to the grouse management.\n\nIn comparison, other sources of contamination such as sewage stations, power plants and leaded gasoline have polluted the River Trent catchment. The team confirmed the benefits of measuring the labile pool of metals to predict metal concentrations in solution. Interestingly, deposited petrol-derived lead is still high in some soils despite the ban on leaded gasoline in 2000.\n\nMEDEA included the first application of ID assays to assess reactivity of elements in industrial by-products such as fly ash. The metals were minimally reactive and weathering had little effect on lability. EDTA extraction was found to be a simple, fast and cost effective analogue for ID assays to estimate metal lability.\n\nMEDEA provided important insights into the factors affecting heavy metal lability and reactivity both in soil and in fly ash.

Structural analysis of RBM38 unveiled the microRNA binding sites and provided vital insight into the mechanism by which RBM38 destabilises the microRNA-mRNA complex.\n\nUpstream of the p21 and c-myc genes, scientists identified a regulatory region implicated in gene transcription.

However, the performance of the repository as a whole (waste, buffer, engineering disturbed zone, host rock), and in particular its gas transport properties, are still poorly understood.

Understanding gas generation and migration is thus vital in the quantitative assessment of repositories and is the focus of the research in this proposal for an integrated, multi-disciplinary project.  The FORGE proposal is for a pan-European project with links to international radioactive waste management organisations, regulators and academia, specifically designed to tackle the key research issues associated with the generation and movement of repository gasses.

Modellers and experimentalists exchanged their data to get the best possible results.\n\nThe FORGE team examined how irradiation affects bentonite backfill materials in contact with metal under simulated repository conditions, to determine the rate of hydrogen production.

To this end, this project will take a key step in prototyping a multiscale anatomy standard, and demonstrate its effectiveness in connecting patient specific radiological images to mathematical models of physiology, as well as to related genomic and molecular data. VPH data and model resources vary in type, complexity and accessibility. Therefore, the technical infrastructure that complements such an annotation strategy, and supports the interoperability of distributed VPH resources, will also be prototyped in this project.The outcome of this work will contribute a resource interoperability plan to the VPH's Toolkit Development Plan.", 92428.0, 1570414.0, "RICORDO", null, null, null, null, "http://www.mrc.ac.uk", null, "fp7_108024_999990170"], ["1SZ", "SPIRAL2 PREPARATORY PHASE", "Science and Technology Facilities Council", "The SPIRAL 2 Preparatory Phase project aims to achieve the development and signing of the consortium agreement allowing for the construction of the facility.

Prior to the development of wide-angle imaging of the inner heliosphere, signatures of such solar wind transients could only be observed within a few solar radii of the Sun, and in the vicinity of a few near-Earth and interplanetary probes making in-situ measurements of the solar wind. Heliospheric Imaging has, for the first time, filled that vast and crucial observational gap. \nHELCATS provides an unprecedented focus for world-leading European expertise in the novel and revolutionary, European-led field of Heliospheric Imaging, in terms of instrumentation, data analysis, modelling and science. HELCATS is a strategic programme that aims to empower the wider scientific community, in Europe and beyond, by providing access to advanced catalogues - validated and augmented through the use of techniques and models - for the analysis of solar wind transients, based on observations from European-led space instrumentation. All participant groups are at the forefront of heliospheric research and bring distinct, yet highly complementary, skills to the project.

Shh has the characteristics of a \u201cmorphogen\u201d- it functions at long range in a concentration dependent fashion to induce several different cell types. How Shh is perceived and interpreted by the receiving cells and consequently gives rise to diversity of cell fates has long been a central problem in neural development. In a recent study, the host laboratory have found that transcription factors of the Gli family are the intracellular mediators that transduce the concentration dependent aspect of Shh signaling; the data suggest that the transcriptional activity of Gli proteins are proportional to the concentration of Shh. However, the duration of Shh signaling also appears to contribute to the inducing activity of Shh.

Our first objective is to define the functional domains in hnRNP A1 that are required for miR-18a processing. Thus, we will determine whether RNA binding and/or the unwinding activities of hnRNP A1 are required for miR-18a processing.

The effect of chemicals such as plasticiser dibutyl phthalate (DBP), dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides on foetal testes development, androgen action, steroid production was investigated. Links to the occurrence of male reproductive disorders, insulin resistance, obesity were also explored.\n\nBreast milk levels in Danish and Finnish populations were checked for 121 endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including PCB, DBP and dioxin, in search of a correlation between chemical exposure and cryptorchidism. Cryptorchidism is a birth defect characterised by the absence of one or both testes from the scrotum. Results showed that the gonadotropin-releasing hormone pathway (GnRH) and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways were involved in reproductive disorders.\n\nPostnatal and foetal testes in regular and DBP-exposed rats were tested, with the latter showing lower testosterone production. Genetic studies of TDS cases identified biomarkers located in the region of TGFBR3 (transforming growth factor receptor III) and BMP7 (bone morphogenetic protein 7). TDS gene biomarkers \u2013 KITLG, TGFBR3 and BMP7 \u2013 were validated through a study on 671 Nordic men.\n\nLiquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry were used to reproducibly generate relevant chemical phenotypes from human serum samples of differing semen qualities. An association was found between sperm concentration and metabolic profiles.\n\nTDS affects a large portion of the male population in western countries today. Thus, DEER outcomes could contribute to proactive intervention and resolution of incidence of TDS through timely measures.

For example, it is unknown if the embryonic lethality of ADAR1 knockout mice is related to antagonism of RNAi. Thus, I propose to study how ADAR1 antagonizes the RNAi pathway and if it interacts directly with RNAi components.   Mutants of ADAR1 have been generated in the host laboratory. I propose to examine the activity of each mutant against RNAi in HEK 293 cells. These mutants will allow us to determine if RNA binding, localization or editing by ADAR1 is required for ADAR1 antagonism of RNAi. The effects on each branch of the RNAi pathway, siRNA and miRNA, will be elucidated using advanced techniques including miRNA detecting microArrays, cloning, dual-luciferase, and miRNA/siRNA reporters. Further, classical approaches of protein-protein interaction, and a recently optimized Tap-tagging approach, will be used to reveal if ADAR1 interacts directly with components of the RNAi machinery.

Such synergy potential between the metabolism and RNA research fields has until today not been exploited, because they are separated from each other in Europe and worldwide. Through consequently missing research training programs we thus lack experts with combined knowledge in metabolism and RNA. The aim of the MetaRNA proposal is therefore to establish a European Training Network (ETN) that educates specialists for academia and industry - fully trained at the interface of these two fields - in the development and application of RNA-based sensors to investigate metabolism at the single-cell level, to apply these tools for novel biotechnological applications and to provide a framework for their future use in diagnostics and therapeutics. In MetaRNA, eight research groups from the metabolic and RNA fields and six partners from the private sector join forces to create a platform of mobility and training to 15 early-stage researchers (ESRs), by means of customized research projects, exchange of knowhow among researchers and partners, attendance to specialized courses, workshops and conferences, as well as training in complementary skills.", 18715.0, 3283420.0, "MetaRNA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.mrc.ac.uk", null, "h2020_193944_999990170"], ["1FL", "Sexually dimorphic neuronal circuits underlying social behaviours in Drosophila", "United Kingdom Research and Innovation", "Sex differences are basic for reproduction, parenting and other social interactions.

In this project we aim to understand the neural circuits that process sensory information to compute the presence of a threat and the most appropriate defensive action. We will focus on the mouse superior colliculus (SC), an evolutionarily conserved brain region thought to be crucial for defensive behaviours. \nIn the first stage of the research we will study the behavioural response triggered by both visual and auditory stimuli.

First, we will measure the neuronal activity to different defence responses using single-unit recordings in freely moving animals. Second, we will employ a novel method of activity-dependent recombination, to label active neurons during a defined behavioural period and characterize their functionality using optogenetics. Next, we will determine the synaptic input onto SC neuron populations using in-vivo whole-cell recordings in head-fixed mice navigating a virtual environment.

In the proposed research, we will use a novel brain stimulation technique, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to selectively alter neural oscillations. By manipulating neural phase entrainment to speech with tACS we can, for the first time, provide decisive evidence concerning whether phase entrainment and speech comprehension are causally linked: If a modulation of phase entrainment leads to changes in speech perception and comprehension we can conclude that the former causally influences the latter. In a preliminary experiment, combining tACS with functional magnetic imaging (fMRI), we will determine the optimal tACS electrode montage to modulate neural activity in speech-specific brain regions (in the superior temporal gyrus). Using this setup in a behavioural task, tACS can be applied at different phase-lags in relation to rhythmic speech sequences. Critically, we expect perception of these stimuli to depend on the phase relation between tACS and speech rhythm, as a consequence of the manipulation of phase entrainment by tACS.

At the heart of the challenge lies the difficulty in the reliable and reproducible characterisation of NMs given their extreme diversity and dynamic nature, particularly in complex environments, such as within different biological, environmental and technological compartments. Two key steps can resolve this: 1) the development of a holistic framework for reproducible NM characterisation, spanning from initial needs assessment through method selection to data interpretation and storage; and 2) the embedding of this framework in an operational, linked-up ontological regime to allow identification of causal relationships between NMs properties, be they intrinsic, extrinsic or calculated, and biological, (eco)toxicological and health impacts fully embedded in a mechanistic risk assessment framework.

This is a crucial process in eukaryotic gene expression and we aims to greatly increase our understanding of its molecular mechanism through cryoEM studies of the spliceosome. The spliceosome comprises five canonical subunits, namely U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) and numerous non-snRNP factors. During the initial stages, U1 and U2 snRNPs bind the 5\u2019-splice site and branch point of pre-mRNA, respectively, and the spliceosome is fully assembled when the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP is recruited. The spliceosome then becomes activated through extensive structural and compositional remodeling which leads to the formation of the catalytic RNA core. Recently we determined the crystal structure of U1 snRNP and two key spliceosomal proteins: Prp8, which harbours the catalytic RNA core and Brr2, which catalyses the rearrangement of the RNA interaction network and plays a crucial role in spliceosomal activation.  We also solved the structure of U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP by cryoEM and revealed the nearly complete organisation of U5 snRNA and U4/U6 snRNA and over 30 proteins within this complex, providing crucial insights into the activation mechanism and the active site of the spliceosome.

Combining a 7T fMRI study (enabling distinction between hippocampal subfields) with a study of patients with focal hippocampal lesions will enable us to elucidate the nature and necessity of hippocampal involvement in segmentation. The significance of this study lays first in its potential to illuminate how real-life events are registered to memory, a process which is likely to differ significantly from the encoding of brief, simple stimuli that have been employed previously. The importance of studying encoding of complex events has recently received increasing recognition, yet this is still only at its infancy, with very few studies employing this approach. Combining the complementary expertise of the researcher and the host, the proposed research aims to identify what constitutes an event boundary in mnemonic processing. Through future collaborations, this has the potential to lead to applicable interventions for improving normal memory and ameliorating mnemonic disorders.", 69733.0, 160129.0, "HippBoundariesPE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.mrc.ac.uk", null, "h2020_201294_999990170"], ["1EU", "New geomodels to explore deeper for High-Technology critical raw materials in Alkaline rocks and Carbonatites", "Natural Environment Research Council", "Five of the 20 raw materials identified by the European Commission as critical are commonly found in association with alkaline rocks and carbonatites (heavy and light rare earth elements, niobium, fluorspar, and phosphate).

During my phD, I identified RNA ligands for the magnesium ions that catalyze these splicing reactions and showed that the spliceosomal U6 and U2 small nuclear RNAs form a structure resembling group II self-splicing intron RNAs. Although the spliceosome's catalytic core is RNA-based, numerous spliceosomal proteins promote the proper catalytic fold of this RNA core, juxtapose the reactive pre-mRNA elements with the U6 metal sites, and regulate spliceosome dynamics during the splicing cycle. Indeed, the Prp8 protein cross-links with the critical nucleotides of the catalytic RNA core and its crystal structure, reported recently by the host laboratory, revealed a cavity that accommodates the catalytic RNA core. Moreover, several helicases, such as Brr2 and Prp16, promote an active configuration of the U2/U6 RNA core and associated proteins and regulate their dynamics.

Three locations, namely Prague in the Czech republic (ELI-Beamlines), Szeged in Hungary (ELI-Alps) and Bucarest in Romania (ELI-NP) have been designated to welcome these unique and complementary centers to be constructed and operated as facilities for the scientific and private community with an investment volume exceeding 850 M\u20ac. A fourth infrastructure (Apollon) of the same type as the ELI centers is also being developed in Paris at Ecole Polytechnique. \r\nThe design, construction and operation of these large-scale laser infrastructures require highly educated personnel in various domains. We evaluate that each site has to recruit technical human resources among technicians, engineers and researchers. Altogether, the need for high level skills represent a pool of 500 to 600 people. Additionally, the laser sources and beam lines will be delivered through public procurement either partly or entirely by private companies mainly originating from the EU. The supplemental industrial workload generated by the ELI programs will require companies to hiring several hundreds of specifically trained employees. On top of that, European laser facilities already operational experience turnover which target the same pool of trained professionals. Each country in the EU proposes standard curricula covering optics, lasers and photonics aimed at educating a rather stable flow of students. However, the sudden need engendered by the ELI programs exceeds the training potential of our nations in these specific topics. Even if we setup an emergency program at several universities, it will still take at least 8 years to train a high school student at a doctoral level. We are therefore facing an extended skill deficit that might endanger the actual implementation of these large-scale infrastructures. \r\nIt is the aim of this project to bring together strategic partners able to propose short-term solutions covering the immediate needs identified by the consortium. The consortium has been naturally created with partners experiencing the skills deficit (5 major laser facilities) and 5 partners experts in education, training and innovative pedagogical techniques (Universities, training center, \u2018serious games\u2019 company). \r\n\r\nThe main objective of the project is to mitigate the above mentioned massive skills shortage in a time scale compatible with the infrastructures roadmap. As a first priority, we intend to develop a global laser safety program with certification at the European level. An additional laser-based nuclear radiation safety program will also be elaborated. Beyond the personnel safety, the partners have identified a large deficit in skills and knowledge about optics, lasers, photonics and associated technologies. We therefore propose a pedagogical approach that has been never used so far in laser and optics education (we are not aware of a similar approach in other domain either) aiming at training students and professionals at the highest level in very short terms. \r\n\r\nThe safety programs development will consist in building curricula at different levels and, in a second phase, produce the teaching material based on the agreed curricula. The challenge here is to come up with a program that is compliant with national workers law and labor codes and succeed to obtain certification at the European level. The revolutionary approach we propose here will be implemented in the context of topical education in optics, lasers and photonics. Our pedagogical concept will use information technologies. Two types of actions are considered. We will develop a library of small programs aiming at simulating complex physical effects occurring in laser or optical devices significantly easing the understanding of the underlying physics. The other action considered as a key action will use the advanced technologies of video games for educational purposes and develop a complete training tool. The trainee will be immersed in a virtual 3D laboratory (Oculus mask) where he will have to build and test optical or laser devices. Augmented reality will help him assemble the proper components by explaining, on demand, the properties and uses of these components.

The aim of this project is to help students develop these key skills through a trans-european cooperation between 13 academic, research and industrial institutions in the UK, Greece, Italy and France. It will focus on the use and integration of terrestrial remotely piloted airborne systems (drone) imagery and submarine remotely operated vehicle data for the combined study of geohazards in terrestrial and marine environments, through a programme of data sharing, scientific and technical collaboration and ultimately curriculum development at postgraduate level to help students develop advanced skills in these areas. The aim of the project is to develop a series of very high resolution 3D virtual reality models of geohazards observed in the onshore and offshore environment using data acquired from airborne drone and submersible platforms that can be used in classrooms to teach about onshore and offshore environments as a continuum. To facilitate this, the project aims to develop a series of toolkits to allow students to navigate these environments using virtual reality headsets, map and measure features on the ground surface and seabed to simulate real field  mapping activities; and then export features they have identified for further analysis in other software such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS). \r\nOur project will create a digital platform where terrestrial and seafloor data and virtual reality visualisation tools will be openly distributed to allow for the processing and visualisation of terrestrial and seafloor environment focused on natural hazards. The project will deliver teaching toolkits to partner the data, to develop firstly, observational and mapping skills (in the terrestrial and submarine environments) and secondly, a critical understanding of differences between geohazards in terrestrial and seafloor environments. From this, we will present a curriculum design that can form a framework for environmental and geoscience postgraduate course provision and training across Europe to tackle the skills shortage in environment and geoscience sectors.", "http://www.nerc.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF PORTSMOUTH HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA203-036719_12"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode",
