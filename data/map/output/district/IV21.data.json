Apart from that the participants should improve their foreign language competences, understand cultural differences and learn how to show tolerance regarding foreign nations. Moreover they ought to gain practical experience by working in a company or hotel in a foreign country. Besides this the students get to know distinct European traditions, values and beliefs. \r\nWhile working abroad they are in contact with two teachers of their school who support them whenever they require any help. The benefits for the participants are the improvement of their language skills, their intercultural skills and all the positive experience they get while working and living in a foreign country. 28 students of the HLW are participating in this project. All of them have the needed level of English as a first foreign language (B1).\r\nSome of them have had Italian as a second foreign language (A2) and some others have had French (A2). During their stay the interns are in permanent contact with the teachers who are responsible for the project via email or telephone. Some of the hotels will be inspected by the caring teachers who function as supervisors.", "http://www.theoldinn.net", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA102-034744_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "IV21"}
