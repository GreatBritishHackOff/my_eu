However, assessing the expected future value of the medicines when used in \u201creal world\u201d clinical practice requires additional information next to traditional (pre-authorisation) clinical trials.  Regulatory, HTA agencies and other healthcare decision makers have to make decisions on authorisation and access under conditions of uncertainty.  Currently, data packages which aim to minimise uncertainty on safety and efficacy may leave significant uncertainty in assessments of real world effectiveness of new medicines.  This results in further research commitments required post-authorisation (PASS, PAES, Reimbursement with Evidence Generation), and wide variability in access to medicines between countries. \nThe subsequent uncertainty relating to the reimbursement, and thus market implementation of new medication once approved by regulatory authorities, is negatively affecting the value of the drug development pipeline. The costly clinical developments to get to market approval, no longer seem to be a guarantee for market entry. This new risk presents a serious additional hurdle for drug developers that already face pipeline attrition. It also affects the speed and level of patient access, and therefore the extent to which patients and society might benefit from new medicines. \nIn recent years there has been considerable attention paid to the post-authorisation evaluation of treatments in real world clinical practice: study design and analytical methodology for assessing relative effectiveness; and use of registries and electronic healthcare data.  It may be possible to improve the value of information available at initial market authorisation by incorporating these techniques into pre-authorisation drug development.

A major accomplishment to date is the development of the NCL diagnostic algorithm, the focus of two peer-reviewed journal publications.\n\nNCLs have been associated with gene mutations such as CLN1, CLN2 and CLN3. An automated enzyme activity testing method based on mass spectrometry has been successfully developed to detect CLN1 and CLN2 gene mutations from dry blood spots. Researchers have also developed a cost-effective, rapid genetic diagnostic tool to detect all NCL forms through comprehensive analysis. Work is ongoing to adapt this for high-throughput applications.\n\nAdditionally, scientists identified a novel signalling pathway associated with CLN3 disease that could be a potential target for therapy. Animal models have been used to study proteomic changes due to CLN mutations and certain biochemical changes specific to CLN1 have been identified. Researchers also identified a to-date unknown NCL disease gene called ATP13A2/CLN12.\n\nPre-clinical testing of therapeutic options is ongoing. Adeno-associated virus constructs carrying the CLN3 or CLN6 gene for mice deficient in CLN3 or CLN6 transmembrane proteins were developed and testing is being carried out. Neural stem cell lines that over-express proteins responsible for the growth, survival and maintenance of neurons have also been established. These cell lines will be used in intra-vitreal transplants to test vision recovery in mice.\n\nProject outcomes have been disseminated through DEM-CHILD teaching seminars, the http://www.dem-child.eu (project website) , workshops, conferences, a diagnostic hand-out and a teaching video.

The ADDUCE project aims to investigate the long-term adverse effects of MPH on growth, neurological system, psychiatric states and cardiovascular system in children and adults. The ADDUCE team will use multiple pharmacoepidemiological research methods to achieve its aim: (1) Retrospective analysis of existing databases. (2) 2-year prospective cohort study recruiting 800 MPH-treated children and adolescents and 800 controls. (3) Cross-sectional study (600 MPH-treated patients and 600 controls) in late adolescents and young adults. Furthermore the ADDUCE team will develop research tools for the evaluation of adverse effects of MPH on cognition and motivation. The ADDUCE consortium comprises 12 academic partners, 1 SME and 1 EU professional network. The ADDUCE team will directly interact with the European Medicines Agency to assist them in making regulatory decisions on the safety of MPH in children and adults.

The EU-funded project 'Multi-disciplinary biodosimetric tools to manage high scale radiological casualties' (http://www.multibiodose.eu/ (MULTIBIODOSE)) tested and adapted these tools for the worst-case, large-scale scenario.\n\nThe toolkit has five complementary assays. Training was provided to laboratory personnel and the assays were tested on irradiated blood samples and mobile phones. Three triage categories were assigned according to identified dosage level. A statistical tool available on the project website was developed to collate results and provide standard errors and other measures for dose determination.\n\nTeam members found that using dose estimates alone without considering the standard errors and upper confidence limits was without exception the most successful categorisation method. This is particularly important as it demonstrates the accuracy of the dose estimates obtained with the assays in providing a realistic picture of actual exposure dose.\n\nA guidance document for radiation emergency responders is freely available for download from the website. The document also highlights the limitations of the triage tools and the capacity of the participating laboratories to carry out biodosimetric triage in a mass casualty emergency.\n\nMULTIBIODOSE partner laboratories are now prepared to coordinate and administer a response campaign in an emergency situation. They are now the largest network in the world with this competence.

Background of the project The project seeks to solve one of the major challenges that the poultry sector is facing concerning airborne pathogens. An example is Campylobacter which is a major problem in broiler houses (and in the consumer product). At certain times of the year (the warmer months) the breeders experience a rise of infection to more than 60-80% of the flocks. A previous study by DTU Veterinary Institute in Denmark has demonstrated that a major source of the infections is flies entering the houses through the ventilation system. DTU has demonstrated that by effectively keeping the flies out of the broiler houses, the number of infected populations will be drastically reduced.

By employing Renewable Energy Sources (RES) to liquefy and store cryogens, CryoHub will balance the power grid, while meeting the cooling demand of a refrigerated food warehouse and recovering the waste heat from its equipment and components.\nThe intermittent supply is a major obstacle to the RES power market. In reality, RES are fickle forces, prone to over-producing when demand is low and failing to meet requirements when demand peaks. Europe is about to generate 20% of its required energy from RES by 2020, so that the proper RES integration poses continent-wide challenges.\nThe Cryogenic Energy Storage (CES), and particularly the Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), is a promising technology enabling on-site storage of RES energy during periods of high generation and its use at peak grid demand. Thus, CES acts as Grid Energy Storage (GES), where cryogen is boiled to drive a turbine and to restore electricity to the grid. To date, CES applications have been rather limited by the poor round trip efficiency (ratio between energies spent for and retrieved from energy storage) due to unrecovered energy losses.\nThe CryoHub project is therefore designed to maximise the CES efficiency by recovering energy from cooling and heating in a perfect RES-driven cycle of cryogen liquefaction, storage, distribution and efficient use. Refrigerated warehouses for chilled and frozen food commodities are large electricity consumers, possess powerful installed capacities for cooling and heating and waste substantial amounts of heat.

The goal is to secure commitment of each stakeholders (public authorities, companies, CCIs\u2026) through concrete pledges to achieving the goals of the Alliance and call for others to follow the examples of the early pledgers but also to stimulate public and private financing to promote apprenticeship schemes.\r\nIn December 2013, Erasmus+ is approved by the European Council for 7 years (2013-2020) to achieve EU objectives for employment and growth matters particularly in the context of Europe 2020.

This professional experience is a considerable advantage in a competitive job market.\r\nThe law on vocational training, employment and social democracy of March 5, 2014 seeks to facilitate the signature of apprenticeship contracts and to encourage European mobility for apprentices.\r\n\r\n\u201cMOVIL\u2019APP -European mobility and Apprenticeships\u201d: a commitment of CCIs and their partners\r\n\r\nSince 2007, the network of CCIs has worked to expand apprenticeships and European mobility by the running of its national project MOVIL\u2019APP (actually more than 50 apprentice training centres -covering 8 regions). CCIs, their apprentice training centres and partners are fully persuaded that mobility, even if only for short periods, makes the apprenticeship pathway more attractive and ensures that it is just as highly considered as traditional school-based learning.\r\nThe effectiveness of the project lies in the fact that the parties involved (CCI France, local/regional CCIs, apprentice training centres) have known one another for a long while, exchange know-how, pool best practices and produce valuable tools and resources (communication/management/methods\u2026). This enables the new CCIs/training centres joining the project to become operational very quickly and to capitalise on the skills and know-how already acquired by the network.\r\n\r\nThe target audiences for the MOVIL\u2019APP initiative are:\r\n\r\n* Apprentices, undergoing training (levels IV and V). These mobility assignments are of short duration as they take place during training and must therefore be compatible with the rhythm of the apprenticeships organisation and also require the employer\u2019s approval.\r\nFrom a professional viewpoint, the goals of mobility are discovering new working environments and of course gaining self-confidence. From a personal viewpoint, the main impacts are achieving a better understanding of the European area and modifying one's behaviour (improving tolerance, curiosity and adaptability\u2026).\r\n\r\n* Post-apprentices. These are young people graduated (level V to I qualifications in all business sectors) from the apprentice training centers of the CCI and their partners who have completed their apprenticeship contract during the last 12 months. They are registered at the French unemployment service, registration that qualify them as \u201ctrainee undertaking vocational training\u201d. \r\nA long-duration mobility placement enables those people to improve their employability by upgrading their skills, particularly linguistic skills, and their adaptability in the international labour market.\r\n\r\n*Trainers. Usually, when we talk about mobility in vocational training we're first and obviously thinking about apprentices and post-apprentices. But, trainers need to confront their point of view with other European practices. For this reason, the MOVIL\u2019APP project proposes a mobility placement to all professionals involved in apprenticeships. Moreover, being fully convinced of the value of mobility projects, they will be then better able to encourage and promote its development.

It has propitiated the present project that will.meet the demands of educational VET Schools, enhancing better relationships among them  and national and European companies.\r\n\r\nThe project is addressed to 72 VET students and former students: second-year students of middle level vocational training of Tourism and Gastronomy, Computer Science and Administration or recent graduated (who graduated the last year), like mid-level technician of the mentioned professional sectors. \r\nThe project foresees 8 mobility flows: 4 to Italy, 1 to France, 1 to Poland and 2 to United Kingdom. \r\n\r\nEach VET school will select 3 former students and 9 students. The project foresees that 4 mobility flows will be carried out to Italy as the profile of the Italian partners as well as the different geographical areas they are located, will provide the students with the chance to be trained in very diverse companies of the same sectors.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of the ODEE project is to promote student\u2019s development of skills and competences through internships in companies in order to integrate the vocational competences they have already acquired and to efficiently enter the single European labour market. Therefore, students need, from one hand, to develop specific and technical skills in their professional sector, and from another hand, they also need to acquire and improve other key competencies, like cultural, linguistic, entrepreneurship, personal initiative, team, as well as to acquire knowledge about new different work environments. All these competences will enhance student\u2019s access to the EU labour market, both as self-employee and/or hired worker.\r\n\r\nThe main ACTIVITIES that partners of the project will carry out are:\r\n- PREPARATION of the motilities: selection of the participants, initial evaluation of their competences, pre-departure training of participants, logistics and agreements\u2019 tasks definition, coordination, etc.\r\n- IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOBILITY. Implementing the internship programs in the companies. The mobility also includes cultural activities.\r\n- EVALUATION OF THE PARTICIPANTS. The competences that will be acquired during the stay abroad will be evaluated according to the ECVET system and will be previously set, during the initial evaluation. All the internship activities will be planned to achieve these competences and will be customized.\r\n- MONITORING. The development of the internships will be monitored by all the tools and processes, previously agreed by the project.\r\n- EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT. \r\n- DISSEMINATION. The dissemination activities will be carried out in all project\u2019s phases. A final conference for the dissemination of the project\u2019s results will be organized. Besides the impact on the participants, the project will benefit all partners, fostering the European cooperation and relationships between companies and educational centres.\r\n\r\nThe DISSEMINATION activities and the mobility itself will generate an IMPACT at local, regional and national level. \r\nThe impact on the partnership\u2019s VET schools will be:\r\n- Improving qualifications and competitiveness of youngsters, enabling them to adapt to the digital era\u2019s demands and to a global knowledge-based economy, enhancing , at the same time, the increase of the youth employment and a sustainable growth.\r\n- Consolidating and increasing contacts with European entities to modernise education, to share good practices and to develop new projects in the field of European cooperation\r\n- Improving the quality of the training, delivered in the school, and adapted to linguistic, social and cultural diversity. This will allow schools to meet disadvantaged people\u2019s needs in a more efficient way and to understand better what active European citizenship is.\r\n- Improving knowledge and the use of evaluation and certification tools (ECVET and EUROPASS). \r\n- Increasing the attractiveness of vocational training education, to make it the first selected option for students and enhancing the prestige of the participating VET schools.\r\n\r\nThe project is strictly related to the 2020 Strategy and the New Skills Agenda for Europe 2016; it is consistent with the strategic priorities for contributing the increase in employment, productivity and social cohesion in the EU and its member states.", "http://www.roast-restaurant.com/contact/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037020_34"], ["8RQ", "Movilidad en Europa: promover el aprendizaje cultural y profesional  2017-2018", "H10 London Waterloo", 36369.0, "The project Mobility in Europe: promoting cultural and professional learning 2017-2018 (MEPACP 2017-2018) \u2013 mobility for Vocational students - has the strong support of the School Management team and the approval of the School Board. 10 students of Intermediate Vocational studies will take part in -  5 in France , 3 in United Kingdom and 2 in Malt and 3 teachers \u2013 in France, United Kingdom and Malt.  \r\nIn order to carry out the activity, the school counts on the permanent collaboration of the partner schools in France, which provide support as to the management of the project \u2013 locating companies if necessary, language or cultural teaching, and students\u2019 direct tutorship.

In light of economic changes, globalisation and requirements on labour market (the moving from employment to employability) entrepreneurship itself is becoming popular issue among young people as a lot of them are struggling to find job or having their own income.

The analysis realized starting from these activities of discussion and sensitization highlighted the need of implementing transnational mobility activities for the strengthening and updating of professional competences, both of recent graduates and staff, in the sectors identified in the project. In fact, they are sectors extremely relevant for the national economy (tourism, fashion, commerce), constantly increasing (ICT, electronics/electrotechnics, mechanical engineering/mechatronics, marketing), and in which the request of specific competences has grown (social field, mechanical engineering/mechatronics,  environment and territory). \r\nBesides the technical-professional competences related to the identified sectors, the project contributes to enhance the European identity and to improve intercultural, linguistic and digital skills, allowing the development of a set of personal and transversal abilities, essential in the current occupational scenario. \r\nThe realization of the project \"E.A.S.Y.

Europe has largely become one area of work and young people finishing their studies are eager for the opportunity to live and work around the world, to gain diverse experience and learn about new cultures that will in turn enrich their native societies.\r\nThe objectives of this mobility project are to give students at TCR the opportunity to finish part of their vocational training at companies abroad, or to study at schools in foreign countries and gain valuable experience which can\u2019t be acquired by other means. The cornerstone of vocational education is the vocational training that students receive as apprentices with various firms and companies. The situation in many vocational fields is difficult and students have had problems finding apprenticeships in Iceland. This is especially true of art and design related fields such as dressmaking, tailoring and cabinet making. Vocational training taken abroad is fully credited at TCR and great care is taken to make sure that the companies TCR students train with are fully qualified. It is important for our small nation to stay abreast of things regarding development of education and industry, and students receiving vocational training abroad return home with invaluable knowledge and experience that benefits our schools and job market. \r\nIn this mobility, six students have applied for grants to do their vocational training abroad or attend trade related courses for four to six months, with companies in Denmark, the United Kingdom and Italy (see Appendix 1).\r\nVocational studies in Iceland are not at university level but in certain trades students can complete the first year of university studies in Iceland and finish them with top-up degrees abroad.

The visit to KEA is integrated into a course in the final study year and is an important part of the studies. In Graphic Media Design and other planned group trips students are expected to do projects that are a part of their final grades. Lately, video presentations have gained popularity among students returning from trips and this has led to increased interest among other students.\r\nIt is important for the students of TCR to learn how study programmes for specialisations in certified trades are set up and carried out in foreign schools. In this application 74 students are applying for 14 day group study trips. It also includes application for six teachers to escort student groups. Previous trips have shown that student groups are received in a different manner when accompanied by teachers, and students have therefore requested to be accompanied by teachers, at least during the first few days while they are getting to know a new environment. In one of the groups applying, one student is in a wheelchair and the application is also for two accompanying persons for 14 days each. \r\n\r\nIt is also important for the teachers and staff of TCR to learn how study programmes for specialisations in certified trades are set up and carried out in schools abroad.

TCR is constantly looking to increase the range of study programmes to meet the needs and expectations of new students as well as the job market. Among new study programmes that have been developed at the school to this purpose are a programme in web development and design, a new study programme in technology and science for exceptional students that was set up in cooperation with Reykjavik University, and a completely restructured design programme now named the Design and Innovation programme where design and arts are intertwined with studies in traditional vocational fields. The school also offers a year-long study programme in preparation for university studies in the arts for students who have already completed a matriculation exam.
