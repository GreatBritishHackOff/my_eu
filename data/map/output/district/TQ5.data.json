The partnership, formed by a multidisciplinary team, will produce a joint research and innovation project that will exploit the complementary expertise of the participants and will create synergies among them. The main objectives are:\n1-\tto assess the current situation on potentially harmful algae and bacteria and the relevant emerging toxins in 8 countries belonging to different but geographically connected areas (Mediterranean Sea and North Atlantic);\n2-\tto develop innovative approaches to sample, and analyze the producing organisms and their toxins by chemical and biological methods including immunoassays and sensors;\n3-\tto estimate different future scenarios based on molecular data (routes of dispersion) and modelling.", 7842.0, 611650.0, "EMERTOX", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_213002_913819541"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["5AY", "APPLIED GENOMICS LTD", 7851.0, "Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie actions \u2014 generating, developing and transferring new skills, knowledge and innovation (15.03.01.01)", "fts_2017_27360", 2017]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["9HW", "RA9", "BRIXHAM HOSPITAL"], ["9HW", "RK9", "BRIXHAM HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TQ5"}
