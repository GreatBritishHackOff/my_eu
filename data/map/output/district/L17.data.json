Despite having different focuses and networks, our work intersects around social inequality and environmental sustainability, with the aim of offering training and events which strengthen community cohesion and increase skills, social inclusion and engagement. \r\n\r\nTo date the groups across each of our networks have mostly been working independently of each other because of limited time, income and capacity. We need to develop a framework of cohesion between our groups, along with a well-resourced core of people who can support a wider network together, build momentum, collaborate on strategy, cross-pollinate ideas and learnings, and sustain activities, trainings and events which increase community and individual empowerment. We need to be better able to engage the long term unemployed with skills and confidence and support social inclusion, to support dispirited young learners to feel more empowered and motivated in these tough economic times. \r\n\r\nWe chose our partner Col.lectui Eco Actui (CEA) because their three strands of learning \u2013 1) Tools for Sustainable Land Practice, 2) Resourcing Resilience and 3) Skills for Effective Collaboration - meet our key needs.\r\n\r\nObjectives of project: \r\n\u2018Empowering Networks of Resilience\u2019 aims to support CMs to significantly increase their work and impact from the local through to EU level by increasing:\r\n\u2022  Resources to support social and ecological renewal and increase levels of social inclusion and empowerment across Liverpool\r\n\u2022  Inclusive educational spaces to engage learners, particularly the most disadvantaged\r\n\u2022  Community engagement and active citizenship at the local through to EU level\r\n\u2022  Resources to share and collaborate with, and learn from others in Europe\r\n\u2022  Career development opportunities and resources to create increased paid opportunities and employment for staff and volunteers\r\n\u2022  Participants' personal sensibilities of connection with themselves and each other, passion for life and work, self-esteem and confidence \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nThis 13 month project will involve 21 trainers who are all community educators passionate about their professional development but a high majority of them face economic obstacles which prevent them from attending training. \r\n\r\nDescription of activities\r\nBetween October 2017 and November 2018, 21 participants from all three Consortium groups will travel to Col\u00b7lectiu Eco-Actiu in Spain to participate in one of their following trainings, including members of each organisation\u2019s trainer pool and a host of committed staff and members:\r\n\r\n\u2022   Regenerative Activism : To support increased levels of self-awareness which support resilient behaviors and cultures \r\n\u2022  Transformative Collaboration : To create inclusive educational environments which enhance positive group dynamics and individual empowerment\r\n\u2022  Mindfulness for Social Change : To harness capacity for attention and awareness to better work with challenging and stressful circumstances, and avoid burnout\r\n\u2022  Permaculture Design Course : To learn new and innovative land-based skills which can be directly applied to urban regeneration and community agriculture projects in Liverpool\r\n\r\nMethodology \r\nAn Action-Learning methodology will be used throughout to ensure all activities are embedded within the context of a reflective learning process. A participatory methodology will ensure partner organisations, participants & learners/target groups all play an active role within this Action-Learning & Learner-led process. \r\n\r\nDescription of envisaged results and impact::\r\n\r\nWe envisage this project to help CMs create the necessary capacity and conditions for a significant step in our community work from the local through to EU level. Our individual and shared networks will be more connected, resourced and resilient. \r\n\r\nThere will be an increased capacity and confidence to collaborate with others working towards similar objectives; increased social empowerment; increased sharing of good practice within and outside the network; enhanced quality, attractiveness and effectiveness of training courses, especially in terms of disadvantaged learners and communities; and increased employability of trainers and learners. Participants will also begin to learn Catalan, Spanish and other EU  languages. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we envisage increased levels of inclusivity, availability and quality of educational work to support significant numbers of unemployed people in Liverpool and beyond, using an innovative range of adult educational methodologies. These will also support community regeneration projects which empower people to learn new skills and alleviate fuel/food poverty, whilst supporting the thriving of our organisations, our networks, and our world to flourish.", "http://www.lcr.coop/", "Liverpool Community Renewables Ltd", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA104-036114_coordinator"], ["3AL", "The Plastic Bag Dilemma - Young People Investigating An Environmental Problem in Europe", "St Hilda's CE High School", 17472.0, "In the course of the 100th anniversary celebrations of our grammar school St Ursula Gymnasium, we would like to carry out a one week environmental project with the title \"The Plastic Bag Dilemma - Young People Investigating An Environmental Problem in Europe\" together with representatives from four partner schools abroad (UK, Lithuania, Norway and Ireland). Our aim is to raise people's awareness towards the topic and to make clear to the participants as well as the local community, also in the respective home countries, which role plastic plays in our everyday life and the impact it has on the environment. We would also like to draw their attention to environmentally friendly alternatives. We expect up to eight pupils and their accompanying teachers from every school who show great interest in this topic. Our plans include theme-related films, panel discussions with representatives from the economy, politics and ecology groups like the local Greenpeace group, guided tours concerning water management and ecological aspects and workshops prepared and conducted by the participants providing basic information as well as deeper insights into the topic. Moreover, we plan visits to the plastics industry and the Nixdorf museum in Paderborn. Another focus lies on the creative approach to the topic by the participants which should be exposed. These activities will be conveyed by cooperative learning, methods of scientific work, interdisciplinary learning etc. as well as informal and intercultural learning and key competences. Apart from the activities at school, we would also like to promote the sense of community among the participants with free time activities like an excursion to Paderborn, a barbecue or a disco night. We expect a change in people's minds concerning their use of plastics and hope to raise a deeper understanding of how we treat our environment.", "http://www.st-hildas.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-DE04-KA105-015479_3"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1AG", "Working Futures", "Greenbank Project", "The Working Futures Programme brings together a unique partnership of Greenbank College and VOLA (the Liverpool City Region (LCR) Third Sector Learning Consortium) to provide tailored, flexible interventions to integrate NEET young people into the labour market.
