In this way all of the participating youth will have the possibility to raise their awareness and understanding of other cultures and countries but more importantly discuss European citizenship in terms of security, peace, conflict resolution. This will be done using cross-comparision examples from the past (e.g. WWII) and present scenarios (e.g. Mediterranean boat people)\r\n\r\nThe Objectives of the Project are:\r\n1) To give youth the opportunity to learn via informal and non-formal learning approaches\r\n2) Give a real sense to today's youths about international cooperation and relations that lead into prosperous growth\r\n3) Emphasise the importance of human rights and rule of law in terms of a country's prosperity and EU founding principes\r\n4) To promote creativity and innovation amongst the young participants \r\n5) To promote the importance of outdoor activites and camping healthy lifestyles\r\n6) To promote the importance of equity and inclusion in the light of the growing multiculturalism in our societies.\r\n7) To appreciate the importance of values such as: respect, tolerance and friendship\r\n8) To acquire important skills such as: teamwork, leadership, organisational and socuting skills. \r\n9) To increase awareness on the importance of volunteering \r\n\r\nExchanged based on International cooperation, international relations, development cooperation\r\nThe youth exchange will aim to give a new realistic understanding of what international cooperation and relations mean both in the past and present scenarios. The project will give the youths a platform where they could discuss and experience workshops that will deal with issues such as confilct, resolution and peace. All of this will be done in contrast with the Malta-UK past relationship and how the EU is strengthen a new sense to cooperation on a European platform. On a more personal level the participating youth in this project are all coming from different backgrounds and for this reason several sessions during the exchange will seek to promote equality and inclusion. The participating youth are now living in more multicultural societies and for this reason it is very important to instill in the youth important values such as respect, tolerance, human rights and rule of law, which are necessary building blocks for international cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe results of the project would be first of all to have a unique experience for all the youth involved an experience that everyone will treasure. Via this project both both organisations will seek to establish a strong relationship with will pave the way for cooperation on future projects and/or initiatives. During this project the youth will have the opportunity to appreciate a sense of European citizenship via the intercultural dialogues and this will result in respect towards other cultures and traditions. As a result of this project the skills of the scout will increase and they will become better ambassadors towards promoting important priorities such as security, peace, conflict resolution. \r\n\r\nThe long-term benefits of the project will be in the sense that the qualities promoted during this exchange and the views of all the participants will remain with them and this will thus lead to rendering these youth more active citizens on the national and the EU level.  This is in particular important with respect to current scenarios of illegal migration and Russia's invasion on Ukraine. As a result of this project it will be possible for the participating youth to implement more and bigger projects for the benefit of other young people from the EU an neighbouring partner countries.", "http://www.scouts.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-3-MT01-KA105-003574_1"], ["3DZ", "Covilh\u00e3.Forma III", "Rotork Midland Limited", 149327.0, "The consortium \"Covil\u00e3.Forma\" was created and assumed by Covilh\u00e3 City Hall in 2014 with the intention of responding to the will demonstrated by 5 schools in the municipality that offer vocational training courses type 2, 4 and 5:\r\n_AFTEBI\r\n_EP Agr\u00edcola Quinta da Lageosa\r\n_ES Campos Melo\r\n_ES Frei Heitor Pinto\r\n_ES Quinta das Palmeiras\r\n\r\nCovilh\u00e3 has 50 thousand inhabitants and 27% of the companies of Castelo Branco region, which makes it an important stage in the development and growth of the region.

International activities aim to enhance knowledge, skills and competences of the students and staff. Mobility includes both student mobility with supporting staff and Luovi\u2019s staff mobility.  New partnerships and possibilities usually are opened throughout the staff exchange, which is a vital part of regenerating the international activities.  \r\n\r\nErasmus + VET Mobility Charter makes long-term planning possible. We aim at promoting equal opportunities to participate in mobility. We want to offer possibilities in all the VQs and to link internationality in all the learning by implementing international paths. \r\n\r\nStaff exchanges are a part of staff development and included in annual development and competence discussions between employees and superiors. The objectives are based on the Luovi priorities and exchanges enable sharing of good practices and methods of teaching and promoting employability. Work experiences of staff enhance the professional competence and knowledge of European world of work. We aim to pilot the international path model for staff as well as learning badges to recognize and validate international competences. We are committed to enhance the quality of international activities and we develop processes together with European partners in KA2 strategic partnerships project Premier. In addition, we participate in a pilot project funded by European Commission and coordinated by Kainuun Ammattiopisto in order to enhance long-term mobility. \r\n\r\nWe aim to develop students ' skills in working life and to promote students' professional growth, social skills, as well as everyday living skills. The participants are second or third year students with special needs in initial vocational training. They are studying for vocational qualifications in the following fields of education:  tourism, catering and domestic services,   natural resources and environment, technology, communication and Transport sector and Social sciences, business and administration and culture.  The placements will be carried out in small groups and there will be at least one accompanying person from Luovi to support the students.  The on-the-job-learning is carried out either in the units of partner organizations or in local enterprises.  \r\n\r\nThe role of accompanying persons is crucial in implementation of student mobilities. Accompanying persons support the students at work places and during the free time e.g. encouraging students to speak in a foreign language and motivating them by coaching the students.\r\n\r\nWhat is new?\r\n\r\nWe have included new partners and countries in this application in order to attract more students and staff to participate. We have created new partnerships in international projects funded by Finnish National Agency for Education. The new partners are from United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. We plan to have reciprocal mobility with Wolverhampton and Dutch partner. We will go on cooperation with reliable partners in Germany, France, Slovenia and Estonia. \r\n\r\nWe have created a common platform for blog writings for students and staff, Luovi.fi/international and it serves for reporting. The feedback has been very positive and we go on developing the blog further. We also aim to update the student mobility process and build the application process in electronic format.\r\n\r\nWe evaluate each mobility and international activities are evaluated according to Luovi\u2019s annual plan.", "http://www.wvtc.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FI01-KA116-046890_8"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WV11"}
