It provides a means of accounting for and expressing usage of natural resources for products, services and technologies, to inform all economic actors including SMEs (Small and Medium size Enterprise) and consumers, on environmentally relevant information. It is a novel, bottom up approach to measure resource efficiency, the results of which are applicable in corporate, industry and society wide contexts. It is an asynchronous, recursive, non-centralised data gathering and dissemination technique for a large scale stakeholder network.\nmyEcoCost aims to support various environmental accounting and assessment practices applicable to various national and international environment policy objectives. It links business added value to a measurement of aggregated resource usage as accepted environmental pressure indicator which goes beyond single issue indicators such as carbon footprint. Using an Internet-based service-oriented architecture (SOA) relevant and timely data is passed from supplier to customer recursively through the whole value chain to produce \u201cecoCosts\u201d for each product or service. The project will demonstrate how it is technically possible to provide timely and accurate resource efficiency statements.\nFor this to happen a series of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) infrastructure components will be arranged: A resource accounting framework to determine \u201cecoCosts\u201d, an ICT delivery mechanism to transfer the measurement from supplier to customer, benchmark figures for companies and consumers linking to macro level policy objectives, and interfaces for industry and consumers to interpret the measurement to assist decision making.\nThe project aims at researching and developing all key ICT and software elements to trial and to demonstrate the resource accounting framework and infrastructure in a proof-of-concept prototype, involving various value chain actors, users, environmental data processors and policy makers.", 30987.0, 3027666.0, "MYECOCOST", "Towards environmentally sustainable consumption", "Consumers and businesses alike stand to gain from environmentally sustainable products. An EU initiative aims to revolutionise product descriptions by listing the amount of natural resources required throughout the complete supply chain of products.", "Being able to assess the natural resources that a product needs and then gather environmental data from its entire life cycle could transform society's business processes, supply chains and consumer behaviour.\n\nThanks to EU funding, the project 'A consumer oriented prototype \u2013 Forming the nucleus of a novel ecological accounting system' (http://www.myecocost.eu/ (MYECOCOST)) is developing an ecological decision-support tool that collects environmentally relevant data along the supply chain of a product, from raw material extraction, manufacturing, assembly and transport to packaging and retailing.\n\nTo design its environmental information system, the project will rely on a global network that connects existing accounting systems. Data will then be transferred from suppliers to customers along financial data throughout the value chains to create an 'ecoCost' for a product at each stage. ecoCost gives a single value or score to consumers and a complete product breakdown to businesses. It is also readable via mobile and electronic devices.\n\nDuring the first reporting period, MYECOCOST application scenarios and system requirements were specified and the software architecture was defined. Based on this, all software components required to operate the system have been developed. The infrastructure that integrates the entire software and enables effective communication among all parties involved in MYECOCOST networks was also developed. Project members are preparing for proof-of-concept and prototyping of the system.\n\nMYECOCOST outcomes should contribute to more sustainable consumption and production patterns. Consumers and businesses will be in a better position to understand how they impact the environment.

Three new circular economy business models will be developed including (i) co-creation of products and services, (ii) sustainable consumption, and (iii) collaborative recycling and reuse. \n\nThe Co-creation of Products/Services model will bring end-users closer to the design and manufacturing phases by identifying consumer preferences via Big-data online mining product reviews and evaluating product specifications and prototypes via Living Lab to customise the end-user requirements. Benefited from the co-creation features, sets of sustainable production methods will be implemented and new products/services will be created.\n\nThe Sustainable Consumption model will develop a method to calculate the eco-points of products based on the outcome of FP7 myEcoCost project, assess product environment footprints (PEF), provide a traceability solution to monitor product\u2019s sustainability along the value chain, and support end-users and stakeholders to actively implement the circular economy via awareness raising and knowledge sharing activities. \n\nThe Collaborative Recycling/Reuse model will develop a system for stakeholders to interact with each other to facilitate the use/reuse of end-of-life products and reduce waste, and implement the eco-credits awarding scheme to encourage people to recycle/reuse.\n\nThis project will be demonstrated at a large scale in electrical and electronic products and farming/agri-foods sectors, provide an effective means to communicate with wide communities to disseminate the project outcome, and involve a large number of stakeholders along value and supply chains throughout the project lifetime, including end-users, producers, researchers and civil society.\n\nAn ICT platform will be developed to support the development, implementation, demonstration, communication and dissemination.", 157387.0, 6296794.0, "CIRC4Life", null, null, null, null, "http://www.cffcarboncalculator.org.uk", null, "h2020_214414_966018345"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TR25"}
