The limitations of sensors in terms of survival temperature, accuracy, stability, and degradation limit where measurements are made during development and the operating ceiling of the gas turbine. Engines are run with safety margin in order to safeguard components against mechanical failure. Consequently, they are not run at their most optimal, which impacts overall efficiency. For example, a 10C uncertainty on turbine entry temperature changes the specific fuel consumption by 0.2%. Also a 0.2mm change in turbine tip clearance changes the specific fuel consumption by 0.4%. It is believed that with better sensing techniques, in excess of 500,000 tonnes of kerosene could be saved per annum, which equates to a CO2 saving of over 1.5 millions tonnes. Despite some successes in recent research, it has become clear that the capability gaps are not closing quickly enough. Further research in to sensors and instrumentation is, therefore, absolutely essential if the capability gaps are to be filled at an adequate rate.\n\nThe STARGATE project intends to target these critical gaps and create the biggest impact possible within the constraints of the Call budget. The project will develop a range of advanced new sensors for high temperature gas path, surface, and structural measurements. The project also contains some detailed studies on wireless sensing.

Considering the increasing xenophobia in Europe, we think it is of significance to give our target group an opportunity to go abroad, expand their horizons, gain a cultural competence, become confident and aware of own identity and thus become open to new impulses.

Our target group will thus not homogenously be interns in companies. Students can also receive craft certificates by attending 4 years of Technical and Academic Education (TAF), a dual educational system or a final year in Upper Secondary School. ISK will offer all target groups the same opportunities to gain international experience and competence. Some groups will need different and shorter projects compared to regular interns in companies. We have successfully tested 5-week mobility and wish to continue developing this. Also, we will offer opportunities for students in the above- mentioned groups and continue developing projects for trainees with special needs. Subsequently, we will have to offer shorter stays, stays with accompanying persons, stays at technical schools, flexible departures and stays without language barriers. Our objective is an increase of the amount of mobilities to 6%, to reach the European Parliament\u2019s goals of mobility within VET.  \r\nNEW COOPERATING PARTNERS\r\nIn order to reach our goals of offering high quality projects, we are in a constant process regarding cooperation with new partners. \r\nDOCUMENTATION\r\nLearning Agreements are used and will be developed to ensure quality and we intend to follow advice of the Norwegian National ECVET Expert Group. All interns receive a Europass Mobility document as a certificate of their learning abroad and host companies will have access to Learning agreements with assessment after the project.                                                                                           \r\nSTAFF  MOBILITY\r\nTo integrate the project in the education, we offer mentors to visits to their interns. Mentors will thus be able to rise the interns\u2019 competence by using international experiences in academic discussions in own companies. Mentors are important correspondents in order to ensure quality, to spread information and recruit new interns. Additionally, ISK wishes to use Staff Mobility as a means to achieve the regional goals within education about 1) a closer relationship between public and private sector, and 2) contribute to the regional goal of enhancing the Green Shift.
