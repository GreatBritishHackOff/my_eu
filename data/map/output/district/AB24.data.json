This new perspective makes a special experience possible in which transcendence can be grasped through the indispensable sensual; and this new form of experience can and does reconfigure and shape both the \u201cnature\u201d of transcendence, and the self of the beholder.

As a result, it is necessary to understand drug uptake, efflux and metabolism to design more effective approaches.\n\nBased on this, the EU-funded 'Microbicide optimization through innovative formulation for vaginal and rectal delivery' (http://www.motifproject.eu (MOTIF)) initiative hopes to develop novel microbicide combinations that could reduce contraction of HIV-1. For a drug to be effective, it must cross the cervical, vaginal or colorectal epithelium and reach the HIV-1 primary targets, the T\u00a0lymphocytes.\n\nMOTIF researchers are investigating the potential role of drug transporters in the distribution of ARVs. The idea is to develop formulations that could improve the drug sub-mucosal distribution and exhibit an enhanced anti-HIV killing effect. A number of drug uptake and efflux transporters have been localised in the target epithelium and are currently under investigation.\n\nConsortium members aim to develop novel microbicide combinations alongside a drug encapsulation and formulation system that will allow insertion of any drug combinations. Ultimately, the efficacy of these drugs will be tested using in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo non-human primate models.\n\nThe key objective in the MOTIF project is to use the mechanistic information on mucosal drug distribution to generate effective microbicides.

There is a critical need to further the development of new antifungals, which requires a comprehensive molecular knowledge on fungal pathogenesis and signal transduction. ARIADNE uses a comparative biological approach at the systems biology level to identify and validate signalling target genes that play an essential causative role in fungal virulence on both plant and human hosts. To establish a comprehensive view of fungal pathogenesis seven pathogenic species will be studied, including the two major fungal pathogens of humans Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans, the devastating plant pathogens Fusarium oxysporum, Magnaporthe grisea and Mycospherella graminicola, as well as two established model pathogens of filamentous and dimorphic fungi, Ashbya gossypii and Ustilago maydis. This array of fungal species cuts across diverse taxonomic groups, covering several hundred million years of evolution. The central scientific and technological challenges for ARIADNE are to 1) integrate parallel transcriptomics, proteomics, and chemical genetics for a comprehensive set of major fungal pathogens, 2) identify evolutionarily conserved and species specific signalling effectors which act as key players in fungal virulence, 3) validate these proteins as candidate targets for small molecule inhibitors.

A large-scale genetic association study involving 1000 dairy cows will relate feed intake, digestion efficiency, milk production/composition and methane emissions to the ruminal microbiome and host genome, leading to new indicator traits and tools for use in both traditional and genomic selection. Cow-reindeer metagenomic studies will establish how host species influence ruminal microbiology and function.  Bovine twins studies will define how the rumen microbiome varies in an identical host genetic background. Nutrition work will assess how dietary oils, nitrogen and carbohydrates affect the ruminal microbiome and product quality. A meta-barcoding 16S rRNA analysis protocol will be developed to investigate ruminal microbiomes more accurately, rapidly and cheaply. Saliva and faeces will be analysed as possible tools for non-invasive assessment of ruminal microbiome and function. A novel method for on-farm methane analysis will be refined for easy application.

BONE-NET\u2019s scientific project will aim at investigating the early molecular mechanisms of metastases associated with breast and prostate cancers and primary bone cancers (e.g., osteosarcomas), including the identification of new genes and their regulators (microRNAs) that draw cancer cells to colonize bone and let these cells adapt and thrive in the bone marrow. This network will then seek to identify and develop molecularly-targeted therapies. BONE-NET\u2019s primary objective will be to train 11 early-stage (ESR) and 3 experienced (ER) researchers in technical skills such as genomics, proteomics, advanced microscopical methods, animal experimentation, noninvasive in vivo imaging methodologies and drug development. None of the participating laboratories use all of these approaches, but through workshops, courses and secondments ESR/ER will become expert in many of these disciplines. The network additional objective will be to foster collaborations between participating laboratories, in which ESR/ER will take part through individual training-through-research projects. The training programme will also expose the ESR/ER to the industry which will offer courses and a set of complementary skills (ethics, intellectual property rights, entrepreneurship), thereby enabling them to gain industrial work experience.

Joint training events included courses on proteomics and functional genomics, and a workshop on gene identification and gene therapy.\n\nProject members collected samples from osteosarcoma patients and bone marrow aspirates from prostate or breast cancer patients along with animal model samples. RNA extraction protocols were selected for messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) profiling of these samples. Pre-clinical models of bone metastases and osteosarcoma yielded a list of miRNAs that warranted further investigation.\n\nmRNA and miRNA expression profiles of osteotropic human breast and prostate cancer cell lines were successfully generated. Chimerical RNA samples of experimentally induced bone metastasis were sequenced. BONE-NET researchers also performed proteomic profiling of three proteins of interest on osteotropic prostate and breast cancer clones.\n\nIn vitro assays were used to elucidate the role of miRNAs in modulating stemness, clonogenicity and epithelial plasticity. Setup of various in vivo cancer models of animals is ongoing. The role of miRNAs on development of skeletal lesions caused by osteosarcoma and carcinomas will be assessed using bone histomorphometry.\n\nBONE-NET members have started preliminary work for researching liposomal drug encapsulation, bone sarcoma therapy and blocking targeted gene expression in cancer suppression.\n\nSuccessful project outcomes will identify genes and their miRNA regulators involved in cancer metastasis or spread. Studies could also point out cancer patients at higher risk of relapse and assess effectiveness of molecularly oriented therapies that target micrometastases. This would improve health care outcomes by saving or prolonging life and reducing health care costs.

European scientists developed new leads for anti-fungal vaccines, drugs and diagnostic markers.", "Fungal infections are increasing in incidence and pose a serious health threat to European citizens. To reduce the socioeconomic burden, novel diagnostic tools and vaccines are urgently required.\n\nThe fungus Candida albicans constitutes the major cause of life-threatening fungal infections. Although it naturally inhabits the human gastrointestinal tract without causing any harmful effects, in immunocompromised patients it can prove fatal. The main problems in managing fungal infections are the lack of appropriate diagnostic tools and the scarcity of effective drugs.\n\nTo address this clinical requirement, scientists on the EU-funded 'Pathogenomics and systems biology of fungal infections an integrative approach' (http://www.finsysb.eu/ (FINSYSB)) project followed an integrative, multidisciplinary approach. They investigated key aspects of host-fungus interactions during fungal infection and set out to identify potential therapeutic targets.\n\nAs a first step, they studied the impact of the host microenvironment on fungal virulence and fitness. They discovered that Candida albicans cells could adapt to diverse host microenvironments. Following attack by immune defences, they activated stress responses and adjusted their metabolism to local nutrients. As envisaged, changes in local nutrient availability affected drug resistance and virulence.\n\nUsing high-throughput analyses and a plethora of yeast mutants, scientists unravelled new determinants for cell wall biosynthesis and novel functions for yeast biofilm formation. These data led to the identification of putative biomarkers that could be used for diagnosis or as therapeutic targets.\n\nA significant part of the FINSYSB project was devoted to host immune defences and their interplay with Candida albicans. The team showed that yeast morphogenesis is a key determinant in triggering and shaping immune responses. Furthermore, they identified signalling pathways that are activated when immune cells are confronted by yeast cells.\n\nIn the 'Defeating the Enemy' part of the project, the network identified potential targets for novel vaccines, diagnostics and antifungal drugs. This work culminated in the identification of a novel antifungal agent with potential anti-fungal efficacy.\n\nCollectively, FINSYSB activities advanced our understanding of yeast-immune interactions. This should prove useful in the development of novel interventions in the battle against fungal infections.", null, "http://www.abdn.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/147539.jpg", "fp7_88892_999929448"], ["3FX", "Reducing Internet Transport Latency", "The University Court of the University of Aberdeen", "The present Internet limits the performance of applications that need real-time interaction.

However, changes in use have resulted in an important class of applications that now depends on timely delivery. Applications that need low latency currently require a dedicated network and/or operator traffic engineering. In response to this, RITE brings together a consortium with the research and industrial experience required to locate and explore the root causes of Internet latency. Research will specify and implement new methods to significantly reduce - or even eliminate - the effects of latency when coupled with small, but significant, changes in end-system behaviour. The benefits are expected to have no, or limited, impact on the throughput. The methods will be assessed using applications with four different use cases: one commercial financial application, one coordinated with the roll-out of a new multiplayer online game, one supporting interactive video in an access network and one evaluating web traffic over a broadband access network. Benefits are also expected for a range of current applications, including web-based collaborative tools and interactive remote control and to pave the way for a large amount of future applications. By taking the new methods to standardisation bodies, e.g. the IETF, and by implementing end-system solutions in open-source operating systems, RITE will ensure availability of the results and encourage deployment in the future Internet.

Most intriguingly, it turned out that the structure of a finite group is closely connected to the structure of the p-local subgroups, i.e. the normalizers of non-trivial p-subgroups, for a suitably chosen prime p. Of particular importance is the prime 2. Even though the proof of the classification of finite simple groups is insightful in its major conceptual approach, it is extremely long and difficult in its details. Thus, it would be of great interest to obtain a simplified proof. Moreover, to gain the maximum benefit from the methods of the proof of the classification, it is highly desirable to work in a more general context which in particular allows also for applications in the modular representation theory of finite groups. Saturated fusion systems provide a conceptual framework for this and connect to important questions in homotopy theory. A program to find a new and better proof of the classification of finite simple groups through a classification of simple fusion systems at the prime 2 has been recently outlined by Aschbacher. Two parts of our proposal concern classification problems for fusion systems. Their significance lies not only in completing important cases in Aschbacher's program, but also in giving new insight into the relative abundance of exotic examples, i.e. fusion systems not induced by any finite group.  In the third part we attack a major problem in the algebraic theory of fusion systems by defining an analogue in fusion systems of centralizers of subgroups of finite groups.

A key role for applied ecology over the coming years will be to provide clear recommendations on how conservation activities can optimise the landscape structure such that as much biodiversity as possible is likely to be retained.

Molecular imaging can play a pivotal role in changing the landscape of drug design/development and improving the health care system.

By answering the questions above, PET imaging has the capacity to render much more effectively the transition from pre-clinical to clinical phase, and to strongly facilitate the development of better drugs at an earlier stage and in a much more sustainable manner. The main obstacle to this change of paradigm in drug design and development is the lack of suitably trained translational scientists directly involved in PET imaging and imaging scientists with high-profile training in chemistry and PET-radiochemistry, which is particularly dramatic in Europe.
