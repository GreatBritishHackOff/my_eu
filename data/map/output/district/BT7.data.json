Chronic bacterial pulmonary infection leading to an irreversible decline in lung structure and function is the main cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with CF, with more than 95% of deaths due to respiratory failure. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is the most frequently isolated pathogen, chronically infecting up to 80% of adult patients. When this occurs patients require lifelong inhaled antibiotic therapy, which although onerous to take, has been fundamental in increasing life expectancy by suppressing infection, reducing exacerbations and preserving lung function in CF patients chronically infected with Pa. Studies employing enhanced culture techniques and culture-independent molecular approaches have recently shown that the lungs of CF patients harbour diverse polymicrobial communities, the \u201cmicrobiome\u201d. Other Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria (GNnF), including Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and bacteria from the genera Burkholderia, Achromobacter, Acinetobacter, Ralstonia and Pandoraea may be present and contribute to disease. Moreover, Burkholderia cenocepacia is associated with rapid deterioration of lung function and poor clinical outcome.  \n\nEstimates for the prevalence of non-CF bronchiectasis (BE) range from 4 per 100 000 in young adults to nearly 300 per 100,000 in persons 75 years and older in developed countries. The number of adults is increasing significantly and the forecast is that the number of adults with CF will increase by 100% between 2010 and 2025. These individuals will mostly have chronic infection with Pa. \n\nIndividuals with BE have chronic cough and sputum production and frequent respiratory infections which lead to impaired lung function and health-related quality of life. Chronic infection with Pa affects 12\u201327% of adults with BE and is associated with an increased exacerbation frequency, an accelerated decline in lung function, hospital admissions and increased mortality. There is a direct relationship between bacterial load, airway inflammation and risk of exacerbation supporting the use of long-term administration of inhaled antibiotics in BE. \n\nCurrently, a limited number of inhaled antimicrobials are available for use in CF with no antibiotics approved to treat lung infection in patients with BE. As median predicted survival of CF birth cohorts is now greater than 40 years, adherence to consensus treatment guidelines requires that chronically infected patients are treated for decades with inhaled antimicrobials. Furthermore, bacteria causing respiratory infection are becoming progressively more resistant to conventional antibiotics with up to 45% of CF patients colonised with multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens. New antibiotics with activity against such respiratory pathogens are urgently needed.  \n\nThe iABC-consortium (inhaled Antibiotics in Bronchiectasis and Cystic fibrosis) brings together world leading collaborative researchers to develop new antibiotic treatment options for people with CF and BE by sharing expertise and resources. It involves about 20 public partners and 2 pharmaceutical companies in 6 countries and 4 pan-European networks: ECFS-CTN, CLIN-Net, LAB-Net and EMBARC. These networks inclide almost all European countries and will be used to recruit centres for the clinical trials. These groups combine experience and proven expertise and success in microbiology, antibiotic development, clinical trials, endpoints and patient registries. Their existing infrastructure provides an excellent basis for the successful achievement of the objectives of ND4BB Topic 7. \n\nThe iABC consortium will build on and add to existing research networks and infrastructures within the IMI ND4BB-program, thereby strengthening these networks for future research programs.

Also, the presence of chemical and antibiotic residues in food has heightened consumers concerns about how food is produced and what they are eating.

However, despite the huge successes we have made in vaccine development against viruses and bacteria over the past 200 years there are presently no vaccines for any animal or human helminth pathogen.

Liver fluke disease, or fascioliosis, is a worldwide infection of livestock (especially sheep and cattle) and also an important pathogen of humans. This parasite is considered one of the most successful parasites because it has the greatest geographical and global distribution, and the widest host range of all helminths.

If the asteroid is far away, a tiny tug could be sufficient to cause the asteroid to miss the Earth.\n\nThe most powerful but least appealing technique explored during the NEOSHIELD project relies on explosive power to divert or break up the Earth-bound asteroid. However, breaking up a large asteroid could be disastrous if it were to result in the Earth being showered by many large fragments, instead of impacted by one solid piece. NEOSHIELD scientists use data from asteroid observations, lab experiments, and computer simulations, to find ways to best protect Earth from future devastating impacts.\n\nAt the end of the project, the NEOSHIELD researchers will provide detailed space-mission plans, which could form the basis of a proposal to national and international space agencies for a mission to demonstrate the necessary technology.", "http://www.space.com/14370-asteroid-shield-earth-threat-protection-meeting.html", "http://www.qub.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/143591.jpg", "fp7_101239_999992013"], ["1NN", "Advanced Technologies for Biogas Efficiency Sustainability and\nTransport", "The Queen's University of Belfast", "The ATBEST ITN will develop innovative research and training for the biogas industry in Europe.

Second, it studied how students from deprived social backgrounds perceive educational demands and try to cope with school life and what formal and informal support they mobilise. Third, the meaning and relevance of education was studied from different perspectives, such as those of students, teachers, parents, policymakers and employers: what skills and competencies bring about 'satisfying and successful lives'?

It also found that educational decisions are ultimately neither made by students and parents nor automatically determined by the education system.\n\nHowever, analysis revealed that in comprehensive education systems with flexible and accessible support young people have more possibilities to come to educational decisions which are both viable and meaningful than in selective education systems and those with unreliable support.\n\nThese results and findings are important to help guide students in investing in their future.

In general, it is difficult for consumers to find the provider's privacy policy, and some do not have one. \n\nIn most cases, consumers are unaware of which data are collected and how they are used. Furthermore, the current European legal framework is inadequate in several ways, and laws are implemented inconsistently and authorities have insufficient powers.

However, the switching speeds are limited by precessional motion of the magnetic spins to hundreds of picoseconds. However, magnetic spins can be manipulated on the femtosecond timescale.  However, the physics of the processes occurring on this timescale is poorly understood. The proposal aims to develop a multiscale approach to the theoretical understanding of femtosecond magnetisation processes and to make a critical comparison with experimental data. The overall goal of the project is to use this understanding to optimise materials for ultrafast (femtosecond) reversal and to develop computational tools for future materials and device design.", 286316.0, 4193028.0, "FEMTOSPIN", "Ultrafast spin dynamics \u2014 experiments and models", "Increasing the density of stored information to enable ever-smaller devices with greater memory capacities has become the Holy Grail for magnetic memories.

A world-class consortium of partners already conducting pioneering research in the field launched the project 'Multiscale modelling of femtosecond spin dynamics' (http://femtospin.eu/ (FEMTOSPIN)) to enhance understanding of fast processes.\n\nRecently, optical spin manipulation and magnetisation processes have been shown to be much faster than conventional ones based on current-generated magnetic fields. Models covering a variety of timescales are necessary to support development of related devices. To access the timescale of photons, electrons and spin interactions, one requires time-dependent density function theory (DFT). On the other hand, to compare model outputs to experimental results, one requires mesoscopic continuum models.\n\nFEMTOSPIN is passing information from DFT to the mesoscopic model using atomistic spin models. Experimental work is used to fine-tune models and provide greater insight.\n\nDFT electronic structure calculations are now providing insight into the mechanisms and properties underlying ultrafast magnetisation dynamics. In particular, models are illuminating the role of spin transport in magnetisation changes following application of a laser pulse. Electronic structure calculations are then linked mathematically to classical atomistic spin models. Together, these feed into the large-scale macrospin models that form an important link to experiments.\n\nModels have shed light on numerous related phenomena. Partners' discovery of thermally induced magnetisation switching (switching by a heat pulse alone without an applied magnetic field) prior to initiation of the project sparked worldwide attention. Now, the team has found the apparent origin of the effect. Further, the models predict such heat-driven reversal to take place in synthetic ferrimagnets consisting of two ferromagnetic layers coupled antiferromagnetically. Experimental testing of this prediction is under way.\n\nFEMTOSPIN is developing critically important multi-scale models of magnetisation phenomena validated by advanced experimental research.

Extensions to Hamilton\u2019s original ideas have given a profound insight into the balance that exists between selfless cooperation and egoism within eusocial insect societies, spawning such concepts as worker policing and conflict resolution. These form one element of social evolution. The other element concerns the major evolutionary transition from solitary to truly social (eusocial), yet it has remained largely ignored. This is because the most widely studied social insects (ants, some bees, some vespid wasps) are obligately eusocial, unsuitable models to investigate the evolution of sociality. The sphecid or sand wasps provide an ideal group, although they have been largely neglected. Though most are solitary, a few are facultatively social and exhibit reproductive division of labour. Here I propose to investigate a facultatively social species which exhibits a division of labour in large (10-30 nestmates) groups. The study will integrate behavioural observations in the field to document patterns of nestmate activities with microsatellite genetic analysis of individuals to determine reproductive success. These analyses will tease apart the relative importance of relatedness versus ecological factors, size and age in determining the extent to which an individual cooperates for the good of the society and foregoes reproduction. Experimental manipulations in the field will be used to test explicit hypotheses over the role of relatedness in modulating cooperation.

To study cardiovascular changes in vivo, optical coherence tomography (OCT) was implemented for vessel imaging and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT) for the heart.\n\nGiven the paramount importance of angiogenesis to cardiac repair, the consortium developed in vitro assays to evaluate the effect of radiation on heart neovascularisation.

In contrast, the impact of high-radiation doses on large arteries was triggered by increased inflammation.\n\nAlthough the findings of the CARDIORISK project suggest that low-dose radiation does not per se induce atherosclerotic changes, it may indirectly affect the stress response of the heart.

The roots of the project are in the capitalization of previous EVS experiences, which made us reflect about the importance of creativity, music and art for the volunteers as a way to communicate with people. We linked this with our local context in Sandrigo, where there are limited opportunities for youth to express creatively, feeling at the same time protagonists of useful and active social activities. Moreover, the potential of music as a viable tool to communicate with others, promote positive values and beliefs, and enter in contact with disadvantaged and disabled people is not fully exploited.\r\nFor this reason, we decided to realize in Sandrigo, where Margherita operates, a project that has the objective to equip 3 young volunteers from France, Germany and United Kingdom with the set of competences, skills and methodologies that will allow them to promote common values of tolerance, social inclusion, respect of human rights, diversity, intercultural dialogue and solidarity using their creativity and sense of initiative. The target group will be composed by end-users of the Cooperative\u2019s services (disabled people, elderly, disadvantage children and youth), the local stakeholders and the community members. At the same time, the project will be an important non-formal learning opportunity for them to improve key skills and competences linked with social and cultural work fields.\r\nThe group of three volunteers aged 17-30 will start their activities in September 2018 for 12 months. From one side they will be involved in the activities realized in the various centres in favour of disadvantaged children and youth (including second generation migrants), disabled and elderly people. They will participate in the management of laboratories, workshops, intercultural and learning activities; sharing also simple moments (lunch, free time, etc.) and creating valuable relations. From the other side they will participate in the cultural activities open to the public realized during the festival \u201cMargherita in Festa\u201d, at the Cooperative\u2019s social caf\u00e9 and within the services for disabled people. All the activities will promote the involvement of local stakeholders as schools, associations and informal groups with which the Cooperative collaborates. As it can be noted, from one side, activities will be aimed to develop volunteers\u2019 competences and skills. In fact, to relate with disadvantaged people is a great way to understand better the true meaning of values as tolerance, diversity and solidarity, while acquiring communication skills and new relational methodologies. From the other side, the activities will focus on allowing volunteers to promote these values with the local community and peers through events, laboratories, etc. In all this process, music will be used as a viable tool to express oneself, communicate and promote/transfer values and beliefs.\r\nDuring activities, the tutors will guide/support volunteers transferring them competences, methodologies and values. Margherita\u2019s principle of \u201cDomiciliarity\u201d (home-care), which means to recognize and try to empower the whole context where people live in, will be used as a reference.

The volunteers will have a big chance to acquire new skills and competencies, to increase their sense of tolerance and solidarity, as well as their intercultural competences and the ability to transfer these values to others.

This centre was set up in 2007 by TFS to make available high quality sewing machines and training to artisans in the Lake Zone.   It is the only such project of its kind in the world.\r\n\r\nTFS is also working on developing its model of promoting sustainable development through the provision of tools and training by establishing new projects.

This year we are planning 2 pilot projects in Tanzania with SIDO to provide high quality refurbished sewing machines, starter kits of tools for students finishing vocational training college and skills training.  We hope this will lead eventually to the establishment of a tools and sewing machine refurbishment centre.  This requires a huge amount of work to make this a reality - tools need to be sorted and checked for quality, boxed and cataloged and a shipment prepared.  We aim to send a container later this year to these pilots.\r\n\r\nIn November 2016 we entered a partnership with a Scottish NGO - the Global Concern Trust to provide kits of tools to artisans with disabilities in Malawi.

Possible areas of performance and LO have been identified by the partners mentioned in the relevant sections C. This action will respond to the strategy of improving the quality of training and prepare students adequately for entering into the job market or university; enhance the certification of skills in the informal sector (see training); improve the personal growth of the individual paths.\r\ninternational mobility for a period of nine days for 7 teachers and expert in guidance and mentoring in international training centers in the UK and Malta. This action will respond to the strategy of enabling a new way of \"doing school\" through the continuous training of teachers and technical staff of the school; raise the quality of mobility experiences of the students and their certification of skills.\r\nBoth macro-actions will contribute to achieving the objective of consolidating the local network, regional and international level between the worlds of education and employment.\r\nSince the implementation of the internationalization plan in 2015 the Sarrocchi Institute established the relationships with training centers and international companies, (eg Foyle, Cap Ulysse) and created new contacts with companies able to identify the quality of training paths in accordance with the professional figures in output by the Institute. The Institute has consolidated relationships with local companies, available to participate in the candidate selection process and moments of the final evaluation of the project and its impact.\r\nFinally Sarrocchi identified the alternating training of teachers in tutoring and counseling for 2018-2019, supplementary to the mobility actions.\r\nThe project management actions correspond to established practices as:\r\n- Signing of the MOU for single professionals;\r\n- Information and selection of candidates and staff through the procedures included in the request for Vet Charter. For staff the selection criteria are as follows: experiences related to international mobility 50%, 20% language skills, 30% motivation and ability to impact at the return.\r\nDefinition of LA in collaboration with international partners\r\n- Mobilities for students and staff as following flows:\r\n25-06/ 2018: 25 students in UK, 10 students in France\r\n01-10/ 2018:  4 staff in UK and 3 staff in Malta\r\n24-06/ 2019:  15 students in UK and 15 students in Malta\r\n02-09/2019:   15 students in Spain\r\nEvaluation of the results, recognition and certification of skills and ECVET points. Development of Europass certificates and review of CV for students and staff.\r\n- Dissemination, project evaluation and impact by developing a survey to gather feedback from students and the participating staff mobility to be used to reprogram and center more accurately other mobility initiatives\r\nThere is no change of purpose than envisaged in the strategy of internationalization. Primary goal is to improve the professional skills, language and key to all the participants. Secondary objective is to improve the practices and the educational offer of the school.\r\nIt confirms both the learning objectives for individuals and for the Institute strategies and its international partners. The numbers of participants in mobility have been expanded: 80 students and 7 staff.\r\nIt was predicted 5 leaders (1 for flow) for 10 days to facilitate the insertion of the students in the company
