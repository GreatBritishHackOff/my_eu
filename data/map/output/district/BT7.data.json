Chronic bacterial pulmonary infection leading to an irreversible decline in lung structure and function is the main cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with CF, with more than 95% of deaths due to respiratory failure. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is the most frequently isolated pathogen, chronically infecting up to 80% of adult patients. When this occurs patients require lifelong inhaled antibiotic therapy, which although onerous to take, has been fundamental in increasing life expectancy by suppressing infection, reducing exacerbations and preserving lung function in CF patients chronically infected with Pa. Studies employing enhanced culture techniques and culture-independent molecular approaches have recently shown that the lungs of CF patients harbour diverse polymicrobial communities, the \u201cmicrobiome\u201d. Other Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria (GNnF), including Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and bacteria from the genera Burkholderia, Achromobacter, Acinetobacter, Ralstonia and Pandoraea may be present and contribute to disease. Moreover, Burkholderia cenocepacia is associated with rapid deterioration of lung function and poor clinical outcome.  \n\nEstimates for the prevalence of non-CF bronchiectasis (BE) range from 4 per 100 000 in young adults to nearly 300 per 100,000 in persons 75 years and older in developed countries. The number of adults is increasing significantly and the forecast is that the number of adults with CF will increase by 100% between 2010 and 2025. These individuals will mostly have chronic infection with Pa. \n\nIndividuals with BE have chronic cough and sputum production and frequent respiratory infections which lead to impaired lung function and health-related quality of life. Chronic infection with Pa affects 12\u201327% of adults with BE and is associated with an increased exacerbation frequency, an accelerated decline in lung function, hospital admissions and increased mortality. There is a direct relationship between bacterial load, airway inflammation and risk of exacerbation supporting the use of long-term administration of inhaled antibiotics in BE. \n\nCurrently, a limited number of inhaled antimicrobials are available for use in CF with no antibiotics approved to treat lung infection in patients with BE. As median predicted survival of CF birth cohorts is now greater than 40 years, adherence to consensus treatment guidelines requires that chronically infected patients are treated for decades with inhaled antimicrobials. Furthermore, bacteria causing respiratory infection are becoming progressively more resistant to conventional antibiotics with up to 45% of CF patients colonised with multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens. New antibiotics with activity against such respiratory pathogens are urgently needed.  \n\nThe iABC-consortium (inhaled Antibiotics in Bronchiectasis and Cystic fibrosis) brings together world leading collaborative researchers to develop new antibiotic treatment options for people with CF and BE by sharing expertise and resources. It involves about 20 public partners and 2 pharmaceutical companies in 6 countries and 4 pan-European networks: ECFS-CTN, CLIN-Net, LAB-Net and EMBARC. These networks inclide almost all European countries and will be used to recruit centres for the clinical trials. These groups combine experience and proven expertise and success in microbiology, antibiotic development, clinical trials, endpoints and patient registries. Their existing infrastructure provides an excellent basis for the successful achievement of the objectives of ND4BB Topic 7. \n\nThe iABC consortium will build on and add to existing research networks and infrastructures within the IMI ND4BB-program, thereby strengthening these networks for future research programs.

Also, the presence of chemical and antibiotic residues in food has heightened consumers concerns about how food is produced and what they are eating.

However, despite the huge successes we have made in vaccine development against viruses and bacteria over the past 200 years there are presently no vaccines for any animal or human helminth pathogen.

Liver fluke disease, or fascioliosis, is a worldwide infection of livestock (especially sheep and cattle) and also an important pathogen of humans. This parasite is considered one of the most successful parasites because it has the greatest geographical and global distribution, and the widest host range of all helminths.

If the asteroid is far away, a tiny tug could be sufficient to cause the asteroid to miss the Earth.\n\nThe most powerful but least appealing technique explored during the NEOSHIELD project relies on explosive power to divert or break up the Earth-bound asteroid. However, breaking up a large asteroid could be disastrous if it were to result in the Earth being showered by many large fragments, instead of impacted by one solid piece. NEOSHIELD scientists use data from asteroid observations, lab experiments, and computer simulations, to find ways to best protect Earth from future devastating impacts.\n\nAt the end of the project, the NEOSHIELD researchers will provide detailed space-mission plans, which could form the basis of a proposal to national and international space agencies for a mission to demonstrate the necessary technology.", "http://www.space.com/14370-asteroid-shield-earth-threat-protection-meeting.html", "http://www.qub.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/143591.jpg", "fp7_101239_999992013"], ["1NN", "Advanced Technologies for Biogas Efficiency Sustainability and\nTransport", "The Queen's University of Belfast", "The ATBEST ITN will develop innovative research and training for the biogas industry in Europe.

Second, it studied how students from deprived social backgrounds perceive educational demands and try to cope with school life and what formal and informal support they mobilise. Third, the meaning and relevance of education was studied from different perspectives, such as those of students, teachers, parents, policymakers and employers: what skills and competencies bring about 'satisfying and successful lives'?

It also found that educational decisions are ultimately neither made by students and parents nor automatically determined by the education system.\n\nHowever, analysis revealed that in comprehensive education systems with flexible and accessible support young people have more possibilities to come to educational decisions which are both viable and meaningful than in selective education systems and those with unreliable support.\n\nThese results and findings are important to help guide students in investing in their future.

In general, it is difficult for consumers to find the provider's privacy policy, and some do not have one. \n\nIn most cases, consumers are unaware of which data are collected and how they are used. Furthermore, the current European legal framework is inadequate in several ways, and laws are implemented inconsistently and authorities have insufficient powers.

However, the switching speeds are limited by precessional motion of the magnetic spins to hundreds of picoseconds. However, magnetic spins can be manipulated on the femtosecond timescale.  However, the physics of the processes occurring on this timescale is poorly understood. The proposal aims to develop a multiscale approach to the theoretical understanding of femtosecond magnetisation processes and to make a critical comparison with experimental data. The overall goal of the project is to use this understanding to optimise materials for ultrafast (femtosecond) reversal and to develop computational tools for future materials and device design.", 286316.0, 4193028.0, "FEMTOSPIN", "Ultrafast spin dynamics \u2014 experiments and models", "Increasing the density of stored information to enable ever-smaller devices with greater memory capacities has become the Holy Grail for magnetic memories.

A world-class consortium of partners already conducting pioneering research in the field launched the project 'Multiscale modelling of femtosecond spin dynamics' (http://femtospin.eu/ (FEMTOSPIN)) to enhance understanding of fast processes.\n\nRecently, optical spin manipulation and magnetisation processes have been shown to be much faster than conventional ones based on current-generated magnetic fields. Models covering a variety of timescales are necessary to support development of related devices. To access the timescale of photons, electrons and spin interactions, one requires time-dependent density function theory (DFT). On the other hand, to compare model outputs to experimental results, one requires mesoscopic continuum models.\n\nFEMTOSPIN is passing information from DFT to the mesoscopic model using atomistic spin models. Experimental work is used to fine-tune models and provide greater insight.\n\nDFT electronic structure calculations are now providing insight into the mechanisms and properties underlying ultrafast magnetisation dynamics. In particular, models are illuminating the role of spin transport in magnetisation changes following application of a laser pulse. Electronic structure calculations are then linked mathematically to classical atomistic spin models. Together, these feed into the large-scale macrospin models that form an important link to experiments.\n\nModels have shed light on numerous related phenomena. Partners' discovery of thermally induced magnetisation switching (switching by a heat pulse alone without an applied magnetic field) prior to initiation of the project sparked worldwide attention. Now, the team has found the apparent origin of the effect. Further, the models predict such heat-driven reversal to take place in synthetic ferrimagnets consisting of two ferromagnetic layers coupled antiferromagnetically. Experimental testing of this prediction is under way.\n\nFEMTOSPIN is developing critically important multi-scale models of magnetisation phenomena validated by advanced experimental research.

Extensions to Hamilton\u2019s original ideas have given a profound insight into the balance that exists between selfless cooperation and egoism within eusocial insect societies, spawning such concepts as worker policing and conflict resolution. These form one element of social evolution. The other element concerns the major evolutionary transition from solitary to truly social (eusocial), yet it has remained largely ignored. This is because the most widely studied social insects (ants, some bees, some vespid wasps) are obligately eusocial, unsuitable models to investigate the evolution of sociality. The sphecid or sand wasps provide an ideal group, although they have been largely neglected. Though most are solitary, a few are facultatively social and exhibit reproductive division of labour. Here I propose to investigate a facultatively social species which exhibits a division of labour in large (10-30 nestmates) groups. The study will integrate behavioural observations in the field to document patterns of nestmate activities with microsatellite genetic analysis of individuals to determine reproductive success. These analyses will tease apart the relative importance of relatedness versus ecological factors, size and age in determining the extent to which an individual cooperates for the good of the society and foregoes reproduction. Experimental manipulations in the field will be used to test explicit hypotheses over the role of relatedness in modulating cooperation.

To study cardiovascular changes in vivo, optical coherence tomography (OCT) was implemented for vessel imaging and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT) for the heart.\n\nGiven the paramount importance of angiogenesis to cardiac repair, the consortium developed in vitro assays to evaluate the effect of radiation on heart neovascularisation.

In contrast, the impact of high-radiation doses on large arteries was triggered by increased inflammation.\n\nAlthough the findings of the CARDIORISK project suggest that low-dose radiation does not per se induce atherosclerotic changes, it may indirectly affect the stress response of the heart.

The economic sectors most represented within the province are agriculture, construction and services. The industry is centered mostly in the forest wealth of the province (wood and resin). In addition, Cuenca has 1 Business Park and 3 Industrial Estates.\r\n\r\nThe reason that the City Council decided to promote this initiative is due to the worrying situation which the city finds itself in, due to unemployment which is currently made more urgent due the economic crisis which we are experiencing. Cuenca is facing a stage in which the migration rate has reached 28.8% since the crisis began. This has meant that the town council of Cuenca is ready to do everything in its power to help alleviate the discontented situation which the city is experiencing. One of these initiatives is through the CUENCA PLUS project, which supports the economic and social development of the municipality through quality education and training.\r\n\r\nAccording to studies conducted by their own City Council, the causes of unemployment and the subsequent migration of young people from the town are due to many factors including: the failure of the education system with a high dropout rate, inadequate employment policies, the existing widespread discontent in the town and the lack of expertise of young people. That is why the City Council has decided to give a boost to the educational system of the municipality, by reinforcing and supplementing it with periods of practical training in companies in other EU countries, which mean further improvement upon the current intermediate level training and training employment.\r\n\r\nThe town council of Cuenca has suggested to 3 local institutions the creation of a Consortium formed by the City Council of Cuenca, IES Pedro Mercedes, IES San Jos\u00e9 and CEOE CEPYME Cuenca to assist in the development of the CUENCA PLUS project.\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed at 25 young people at intermediate level who are pursuing their final year or who are undertaking a course of preparation for employment leading to a Certificate of Competence. The training periods of 3 months and will take place between middle of April and July 2015.

We are a cross border organisation established in the Republic of Ireland in 2002 and Northern Ireland in 2005.   Depaul Ireland is part of Depaul International, a group of charities working to support people who are homeless and marginalised around the world. Our services span Community and Outreach, Vulnerable Families, Harm Reduction Accommodation services and Criminal Justice and Mental Health Services .  Our services are low threshold and some have been the first of their kind.  \r\n\r\nWithin the values of the work of Depaul Ireland lies a holistic approach to each individual with whom we work. This involves providing emotional support in addition to physical and practical services. It is within this structure of support that the work of our volunteer programme is vital. In particular, some of the Erasmus + priorities cover themes and issues that our volunteers and service users have been involved in.  For example, promoting awareness of homelessness issues to the public, developing healthier lifestyle activities within our projects, encouraging service users to develop skills and knowledge for future employment and study and exploring and celebrating culture through art, food and dialogue. \r\n\r\nObjectives of your project:\r\nThe volunteer programme was established to enable both local individuals and young people from other countries via Erasmus + to become involved with the work of the organisation.

The EVS volunteers will develop and facilitate over the 11 months varied programme of diversionary and worthwhile activities to encourage our service users to develop new skills and interests, support harm reduction to tackle unhealthy behaviours, explore cultural identity and support participation in the project and the local community they will return to.  \r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nThe Host and Co-ordinating organisation will develop a learning plan and project activities with the individual volunteers.  The following would be used to plan, monitor and evaluate the activities:\r\n\r\n-Training and Induction\r\n-Link/include in each service's key performance indicators (KPI\u2019s) and measure quarterly \r\n-Impact on SU\u2019s measured in Keyworking sessions\r\n-Feedback sessions (eg.

This centre was set up in 2007 to make available high quality sewing machines and training to artisans in the Lake Zone.   \r\n\r\nTFS is also working on developing its model of promoting sustainable development through the provision of tools and training by establishing new projects. In 0212 we ran a pilot project with an organisation called the Women's Rights Initiative (WORI) based in Jinja in Uganda.  They provide training and programmes for women and young people and operate a vocational training centre.  This year we will start a 3 year programme with WORI that will entail the establishment of a tools and sewing machine  refurbishment centre.  A huge amount of preparation work is needed to make this a reality - tools need to be sorted and checked for quality, boxed and catalogued and a shipment prepared.  \r\n\r\n2. To promote volunteering for all and in particular to provide opportunities for local people and those with special needs to contribute to the work of TFS. This is done through training and support in tool cleaning and repair, passing on skills and assisting them while they are at TFS.  \r\n\r\n3. To assist with raising awareness of the issue of sustainable development by showing how over-consumption, wasting of resources and environmental degradation, including the affects of increasing carbon emissions, correlate with poverty levels and social inequality.

The roots of the project are in the capitalization of previous EVS experiences, which made us reflect about the importance of creativity, music and art for the volunteers as a way to communicate with people. We linked this with our local context in Sandrigo, where there are limited opportunities for youth to express creatively, feeling at the same time protagonists of useful and active social activities. Moreover, the potential of music as a viable tool to communicate with others, promote positive values and beliefs, and enter in contact with disadvantaged and disabled people is not fully exploited.\r\nFor this reason, we decided to realize in Sandrigo, where Margherita operates, a project that has the objective to equip 3 young volunteers from France, Germany and United Kingdom with the set of competences, skills and methodologies that will allow them to promote common values of tolerance, social inclusion, respect of human rights, diversity, intercultural dialogue and solidarity using their creativity and sense of initiative. The target group will be composed by end-users of the Cooperative\u2019s services (disabled people, elderly, disadvantage children and youth), the local stakeholders and the community members. At the same time, the project will be an important non-formal learning opportunity for them to improve key skills and competences linked with social and cultural work fields.\r\nThe group of three volunteers aged 17-30 will start their activities in September 2018 for 12 months. From one side they will be involved in the activities realized in the various centres in favour of disadvantaged children and youth (including second generation migrants), disabled and elderly people. They will participate in the management of laboratories, workshops, intercultural and learning activities; sharing also simple moments (lunch, free time, etc.) and creating valuable relations. From the other side they will participate in the cultural activities open to the public realized during the festival \u201cMargherita in Festa\u201d, at the Cooperative\u2019s social caf\u00e9 and within the services for disabled people. All the activities will promote the involvement of local stakeholders as schools, associations and informal groups with which the Cooperative collaborates. As it can be noted, from one side, activities will be aimed to develop volunteers\u2019 competences and skills. In fact, to relate with disadvantaged people is a great way to understand better the true meaning of values as tolerance, diversity and solidarity, while acquiring communication skills and new relational methodologies. From the other side, the activities will focus on allowing volunteers to promote these values with the local community and peers through events, laboratories, etc. In all this process, music will be used as a viable tool to express oneself, communicate and promote/transfer values and beliefs.\r\nDuring activities, the tutors will guide/support volunteers transferring them competences, methodologies and values. Margherita\u2019s principle of \u201cDomiciliarity\u201d (home-care), which means to recognize and try to empower the whole context where people live in, will be used as a reference. Ideas and proposals of volunteers will be encouraged to stimulate their own sense of initiative and entrepreneurial attitude, and they will have the opportunity to create events, laboratories and workshops, involving local citizens and youth further than centres users.\r\nPositive impacts foreseen are many. The volunteers will have a big chance to acquire new skills and competencies, to increase their sense of tolerance and solidarity, as well as their intercultural competences and the ability to transfer these values to others. The users of Margherita\u2019s centres will have the possibility to create new relationships, exchanging new intercultural elements and reinforcing their communication attitudes, feeling part of an inclusive society. On the other hand, Margherita, and other partners, will enhance the international and European dimension of their work sharing this with the members of their communities. Volunteers will be considered as innovators. Their participation and creativity will help to improve the way we work every day. Different languages, cultures and background will be mixed together and allow a mutual positive contamination between all the parties involved, promoting common European Values of diversity, tolerance, solidarity and active participation, stimulating a dialogue between the involved local communities and Europe.\r\nFinally, our biggest hope is that, with the collaboration and the precious help of the volunteers, their creativity will contaminate all the people involved in the project and will allow to discover new paths of innovation contributing to build a real inclusive, tolerant and solidarity-based society.", "http://www.toolsforsolidarity.com", null, "erasmus_2017-3-IT03-KA105-012755_3"], ["1NT", "To tell the truth.

Trans and intersex communities are facing greater intrusion into our personal lives through media coverage and curiosity from wider society.

This centre was set up in 2007 by TFS to make available high quality sewing machines and training to artisans in the Lake Zone.   It is the only such project of its kind in the world.\r\n\r\nTFS is also working on developing its model of promoting sustainable development through the provision of tools and training by establishing new projects. In 2012 we ran a pilot project with an organisation called the Women's Rights Initiative (WORI) based in Jinja in Uganda.  This year we are planning 2 pilot projects in Tanzania with SIDO to provide high quality refurbished sewing machines, starter kits of tools for students finishing vocational training college and skills training.  We hope this will lead eventually to the establishment of a tools and sewing machine refurbishment centre.  This requires a huge amount of work to make this a reality - tools need to be sorted and checked for quality, boxed and cataloged and a shipment prepared.  We aim to send a container later this year to these pilots.\r\n\r\nIn November 2016 we entered a partnership with a Scottish NGO - the Global Concern Trust to provide kits of tools to artisans with disabilities in Malawi.  This year we will send out 9 kits of tools but we are planning to greatly expansion this project next year.\r\n\r\n2. To promote volunteering for all and in particular to provide opportunities for local people and those with special needs and fewer opportunities to contribute to the work of TFS. This is done through training and support in tool cleaning and repair, passing on skills and assisting them while they are at TFS.  We work with a range of support and community organisations to provide volunteering placements for people with disabilities, mental health issues, learning difficulties and for people who are long term unemployed or who are refugees and asylum seekers.\r\n\r\n3.

The innovative Time for Change programme for young people developed in the UK , will be transferred to other member states during the lifetime of this project. This project addresses the needs of young people who are most at risk of being economically inactive, and are more at risk of social exclusion, by involving young people who are severely disadvantaged. The Time for Change uses a unique blend of intensive one to one work with group activities and challenging outdoor environments and activities to provide young participants with space way from their normal environment where they can start to consider the changes that they want to make to their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChallenge for Youth developed this programme to work with young people from very disadvantaged areas of Belfast. Many of the young people had experienced conflict and some had been at risk of paramilitary violence. Other problems confronting young people who took part included family breakdoewn, severe poverty and problems with addictive or self-harming behaviours. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rationale behind the transfer of this project is that young people who face particular social disadvantage are at even higher risk of not having access to/becoming removed from: education, training, employment, and active society \u2013 and objective is a concern for all EU member states. Currently, 5.5 million young people are unemployed in the EU, meaning that 1 in 5 people under 25 who are willing to work cannot find a job. The unemployment rate among young people is over 20% \u2013 double the rate for all age groups combined and nearly 3 times the rate for the over-25s, and 7.5 million people aged 15 to 24 are currently neither in a job nor in education or training. In addition, due to Europe\u2019s current economic climate, the mobility of learners and youth is of paramount importance and it could be argues that access to mobility is even more important for those facing the most disadvantaged and risk of social exclusion. In order to have access to mobility, however, young people must have the skills to enable them to undertake training, education, or work experience. Through the transfer of the Time for Change Programme this project seeks to create opportunities and address the needs of young people most at risk of becoming excluded from socio-economic activities while establishing the basic core competencies need to move into education, work, or training. This project seeks to directly address these issues by working with young people aged 16 \u2013 25 who are most at risk or already defined in these categories. As such this project strongly links to the Europe 2020 Strategy (including the headline education target), the Youth on the Move Agenda, and the European Youth strategy while also ensuring that the most vulnerable young people don\u2019t get left behind or become further socially excluded by new programmes and initiatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Time for Change Europe Project aims to tranfer this innovative programme to Germany, Spain and Lithuania, By doing so, the project will ensure the needs of those who are furthest away from opportunity will be addressed, ensuring a greater social equity and inclusion for young people across Europe while building an evidence base for this and similar youth programmes through research, piloting, and evaluation of the project.  Furthermore, this project will enhance the cooperation between youth organisations and organisation that work with young people in Europe by developing the international experience of young people, youth workers, and youth organisations in each of the partner countries.  By involving youth organisations that are new to European partnerships and organisations that have strong experience working across European projects. The TFCE Project brings together 5 partner oorganisations each with an important area of specialism which they will contribute to the project delivery.  we are providing three youth organisations within Europe with the opportunity to collaborate and work cooperatively within the field of youth, this will develop the professionalism of all organisations involved in the project and deepen the European cooperation amongst organisations in the field of youth.

Developed in NI in response to the needs of lone parents, the innovative 'Restart' accredited employability programme combines: group work, individual life coaching, a work placement, practical help with CVs and job applications, with advice on personal finances, childcare and transport issues. Restart has been already been successfully adapted for use with lone parents in 7 EU countries (including Poland and Italy) through the successful implementation and delivery of two separate EU projects funded through the LLP Leonardo da Vinci programme: Restart (2010 -2012) and Restart 2 (2012- 2014).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Restart 3 project will adapt the Restart programme for use with other disadvantaged groups: people with disabilities in NI, people from migrant backgrounds in Poland, young people in Italy and lone parents in Spain, all of whom are at high risk of becoming excluded from education, training, employment and full participation in society. This project seeks to implement the adaptation and evaluation findings from the previous Restart 1 & 2 projects and will follow a similar methodology thus bringing added value to the new project in terms of its evidence base and lead partner Possibilities NI's experience of delivery in Europe using a tested and successful methodology. The project will research the needs of each of the target groups in their respective country contexts, the Restart programme will then be adapted, translated where appropriate, pilot tested with a small group in each country (up to 10) and validated with methodology guidelines and reports created to document each stage of the project.

These objectives are more specifically defined in the so called Modernisation Agenda (EC 2011). More specifically it sets a goal to improve the quality and relevance of higher education. In this process external evaluation and self-assessment are seen in a key role!  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough there are plenty of methods for both self- and cross-evaluation, there is a lack of models for a comprehensive approach, taking account the needs to increase international collaboration and improve international comparability in HEIs.  There have been many European projects on QA, but they do not cover still existing problems with accreditation such as required resources, complexity, delays between the evaluation rounds, poor feedback, poor quality loop and distance from continuous education development. There is a need for more flexible evaluation models and processes with peers to reduce the inertia of heavy accreditations/evaluations in HEIs. Contemporary processes are too laborious and increasingly demanding, binary evaluation lacks feedback on how to improve, and moreover, more and more reporting is demanded. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQAEMarketPlace4HEI -project proposes a flexible and collaborative method, processes and tools for degree program / higher education evaluation, as a complement for weighty/ponderous accreditations. The innovativeness of the project lies in the collaborative model of quality assurance that can complement accreditations and existing QA systems. The project promotes and strengthens the European cooperation in quality assurance while designing and piloting new kind of continuous, accessible, cooperation based model, tools and a virtual platform (the Market Place) supporting so called cross-sparring between institutions. Cross-sparring is to be understood as a process to make feedback more collaborative, concrete and objective, thanks to critical, but discreet brainstorming sessions, where strategies can be discussed, repeatedly contributing to the quality assurance with a critical external view. As in sport, a sparring partner helps to keep eyes on the objectives, learn from experience and stimulate reflectivity. This approach is beneficial both for the institution evaluated, which will get a more objective view on its strengths and potential improvements, and for the sparring partner which may identify best practices that can be useful for his own institution. The Market Place serves as a tool for finding the best possible sparring partners as well as a forum for networking, sharing experiences, information and best practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project consortium consists of eight European higher education institutions: Reykjavik University, Iceland; Turku University of Applied Sciences, Finland ; Aarhus University, Denmark; Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, Finland; Ume\u00e5 University, Sweden; Telecom Bretagne, France; Aston University, United Kingdom and Queens University Belfast, United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project implementation is based on the circular model of quality assurance. The first phase of the project focuses on the self-evaluation and how to ensure the results from different self-evaluation methods provide the right kind of information to enable the best possible pairs for the cross-sparring. Pilot HEIs are supported in this by kick-off workshops. During the second phase, this information is entered to a virtual platform built in this project, the Market Place, where the actual pairing is conducted. Later also the results from the cross-sparrings are entered to the Market Place. Thus the most common development themes can be identified to arrange special theme workshops open for all interested. The Market Place also serves as a database for QA methods, best practices etc. The third phase is about the defining, piloting and refining the cross-sparring method. The continuity of the quality enhancement process after the cross-sparring is supported by collaborative workshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project derives from the experiences and actual needs distinguished in the participating institutions to develop the quality assurance process. As a result the degree programs, which are selected for piloting the self-evaluation and cross-sparring processes, are able to exploit the project results directly during the project in their quality assurance and development processes.

In other words, an analysis of specificities of various cultural venues when wanting to implement an active cultural accessibility policy in the field of live and dynamic scenic arts, and also an analysis of the various user profiles accessing and taking part in these venues. Profiling will be done in all four countries and with many users This transnational analysis, in which various languages, genres, technologies and venues will be considered, will strengthen cooperation between organisations in different but complementary sectors that will exchange best practices. Simultaneously, an intensive dialogue with the authorities will be opened to discuss the best way to implement accessibility policies in the scenic arts, focusing on Catalonia and Flanders but extrapolating its results to other scenarios. Cooperation between regional authorities will be fostered and strengthened.\r\n\r\nThis initial event and profiling, plus the expertise gathered by the HEIs in accessibility training, will allow to define a new professional profile that responds to an emerging market need: that of the so-called \"expert/manager in accessibility for the scenic arts\".\r\n\r\nThe main competences and skills of this new professional profile, along with its denomination, will be discussed and agreed upon by the various stakeholders. \r\n\r\nAn open learning proposal, more specifically a MOOC, will be developed.  ACT will foster recognition and validation of knowledge, skills and competences acquired through this open learning. Before its launching, the MOOC will be designed, tested in a pilot course and disseminated in dedicated workshops. A showcase will be used as a testing scenario for the implementation of the skills acquired through the course. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, an accredited learning curriculum will be discussed and proposed for future implementation in the HEIs partners. Special emphasis will be put on the permeability of others types of learning with formal education pathways.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on promoting equal opportunities and accessibility to cultural events (scenic arts) across countries and languages searching to establish and qualify the profile of accessibility expert to empower all citizens and especially people with disabilities. The project should be carried out transnationally since EU countries have a wealth of languages, language situations (bilingual, trilingual, monolingual) and translation traditions (subtitling, dubbing, voice-over) where cultural representations will take place. There is a need to develop pan-European quality training and certification to guarantee a common professional profile across Europe and open new jobs. Designing and implementing the accessibility plans of a cultural venue should be the task of a well-trained professional able to work in a multilingual Europe aware of the cultural especificities along venues/users and the requirements of the different policies.", "http://www.qub.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA203-015734_6"], ["1NN", "Innovative Education & Training in High Power Laser Plasmas", "THE QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY OF BELFAST", 235153.0, "This is a resubmission of the proposal submitted at the previous KA2 call (2016).

PowerLaPs is also intended to PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and principal scientists to enhance their knowledge and improve their educational skills. This field of science and technology is considered to play a leading role for at least the next twenty years as proven by the thematic areas of the EU road-map of technology and research infrastructures (among others HiPER/NIF, ELI, XFEL) concerning laser matter interaction and laser fusion.\r\nAll 8 participating Universities have great expertise, theoretical or/and experimental in the field of laser plasmas and have\r\nbeen worldwide recognized for their contribution to education and science in their fields of expertise. For instance, CPPL of TEI of Crete  (the project coordinator) will provide the of state-of-the-art experimental infrastructure (such as the 45TW laser system and the 7fs phase locked laser) for the implementation of new state of the art training of the students of this proposal. Similarly, all partners including the associated company will provide their state of the art facilities for the same reason. \r\nThe great expertise of the scientific personnel involved in this project ensures the successful outcome of the project. More than 35  students (including the additional local students of the IP's) will benefit from the teaching and learning activities and will be given the chance to participate in ERASMUS+ activities in a multicultural environment.\r\nThe training scheme as has been analytically described in the proposal aims to make trainers and trainees members of a multinational and multicultural audience that will gain additional skills through innovative training in a field that is now and will be for the coming twenty years will be at the top of interest for the academic and industrial sector. \r\nIn addition, the training that the students will gain outside of their home countries will encourage cross-border co-operation, will contribute significantly to the increase of higher education quality provided by the partner Universities as well as by other higher education institutions in EU and worldwide via the dissemination programme of this project and will remarkably enhance the  profession skills of the participants. Furthermore, this project will give the opportunity to the teachers and the University authorities to collaborate in a multinational and multicultural environment obtaining all the benefits of such collaboration (as described in details in the proposal).\r\nThe PowerLaPs output will become an open platform of advanced training to EU universities, providing them access to the digital\r\neducational material that will be delivered among with the offering of the worldwide unique CPPL facilities for hands on training.\r\nAttendants that will successfully complete the proposed education and skill development program will gain high quality and\r\nprofessional training from top scientists & engineers (including training in high technology industrial sector) in the innovative field of high power laser produced plasmas. \r\nSuch training will have a significant impact in developing new skills for successful employment in a high tech industrial (as well as academic) private sector environment for plasmas and lasers as well as related technologies such as optoelectronics, microelectronics and optomechanics.

One of the project\u2019s main outputs  will be a toolkit \u2018From crafter to entrepreneur\u2019, designed  for members of vulnerable social groups. In this first phase for young migrants, asylum seekers and refugees, the toolkit will be divided into a series of chapters, each covering a series of important steps in the development of a craft-entrepreneurship initiative and the creation of an ethical marketing brand, from idea to the final product. This will aid the development of  the requisite  knowledge and competencies needed for the effective marketing of these ethical, sustainable crafts. The toolkit will result from expert reccommendations and the combined experiences of our partner organisations, as well as  experiences garnered from working with the case study group  in Slovenia. Individual chapters will be regularly tested on a group of 20 participants (refugees) and will therefore provide a non-formal learning programme. This will help participant\u2019s strengthen their entrepreneurship skills and get  first-hand experience of  the cultural heritage of the local environment, as well as facilitating the  development of an ethical marketing brand and cooperation with local artisans/ designers in order to create prototypes of handicraft products, bringing thus added value to the overall goals of the project. The testing programme will be carried out throughout the 10-months project in the form of a two dayworkshop taking place each month. We will also develop mentoring and peer support practices, emphasizing (most importantly) the role of psychological and social help to participating refugees. We will develop  team building and group work capacities as well as skill building in the space of craft and entrepreneurship with  the ability to  link traditional technologies to contemporary design approaches.\u00a0With the project we aim to introduce new, innovative ways of networking on all levels- both formally and in-formally, at local as well as international level.

We believe that the formation of networks and access to these spaces is as  important   as business training and technical assistance. Our aim is to contribute to the better integration of  refugees into the European Union, providing expert knowledge of the necessary  frameworks for social inclusion and promoting  the benefits of their cultural contributions and creativity.\u00a0In the project, we will set up an E-platform in both Slovene and English , which will be maintained after  project completion as a free open source site.

Its four research clusters focus on tensions between narrow economic perspectives on integration and the lives of Europe\u2019s people in their diversity, between the EU\u2019s external (trade) policy and its constitutional values, between different degrees of intensity of integration and different levels of governance, and between the two competing European human rights regimes. TREUP suggests that it is not desirable or even possible to fully dissolve these tensions \u2013 this would only result in neglect. Instead, European integration need not be mired by tensions if its main actors maintain a sense of its purpose. If the momentum for EU internal integration and global assertion of its values has been lost, it can be regained through regaining that purpose. And again, it is at the fringes of the European Union \u2013 whether defined geographically as the West, East, North and South or metaphorically as in the perspective of the minorities of free moving EU citizens, the economically excluded or non-EU citizens \u2013 that the purpose is most acutely perceived.
