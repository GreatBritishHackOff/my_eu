CrowdHEALTH will introduce a new paradigm of Holistic Health Records (HHRs) that include all health determinants. HHRs will be transformed into Social HHRs communities capturing the clinical, social and human context of the population segmentation and as a result the collective knowledge for different factors depending on the communities formulation criteria (e.g. demographics, diseases, lifestyle choices, nutrition, etc). CrowdHEALTH will deliver a secure integrated ICT platform that seamlessly integrates big data technologies across the complete data path, providing of Data as a Service (DaaS) to the health ecosystem stakeholders. CrowdHEALTH will develop policy modeling techniques to facilitate the inclusion of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in policies and the correlation of these KPIs both with all health determinants captured in HHRs and with information from other domains towards a \u201chealth in all policies\u201d approach. Creation and co-creation (cross-domain) of policies will be feasible through a rich toolkit, which will be provided on top of the DaaS, incorporating mechanisms for causal and risk analysis, as well as for compilation of predictions. Through the toolkit, multi-modal targeted policies addressing various time scales (long- / short- term), locations (area, regional, national, international), populations, and evolving risks will be realized. CrowdHEALTH will facilitate policies evaluation (on complete policy and per-KPI levels) and optimization through adaptive and incremental visualizations of simulations and outcomes of evidence based analysis of prevention strategies.

These technologies will be combined for the first time and validated by 6 law enforcement agencies (LEAs) to collect, process, visualize and store online data related to terrorist groups, allowing them to take coordinated action in real-time while preserving the privacy of citizens. \nThe RED-Alert solution will outperform state-of-the-art solutions in terms of number of languages supported, privacy-preserving capabilities, usability, detection performance, real-time capabilities and integration capabilities. The RED-Alert approach combines for the first time the CEP methodology with NLP/SMA and SNA applications in the context of social media data analytics, transforming (unstructured) social media data into (structured) events enhanced by semantic attributes. For example, a tweet will be an event consisting of content (expressed as NLP features e.g. concepts, sentiment, entities, etc.) and context (time and the author including SNA features e.g. number of followers, number of links, etc.). Turning unstructured social media data into structured events is key, as it allows the system to use (event) rules (event temporal logic, event logic patterns, even counting, absence of events) to infer insights or create alerts in real-time.\nThe project impact is supported by the participation of Europol and specific dissemination activities around the World Counter-Terrorism Summit, organized by one of the partners.

Most relevant to achieve the expected increase of production performance for highly customized products is to master the complexity of the supply chain and logistics in the global production networks. Ad-hoc collaboration and setup of production coalitions with a wide spectrum of suppliers and service providers is necessary to answer the customization wishes of customers for their individual products in short time,  high quality, and at affordable costs. Innovations from small high-tech companies requested by customers have to be integrated into the traditional industrial processes using novel organisational concepts and setups.\nDIGICOR will address the development of a collaboration platform, tools, and services for the setup and coordination of production networks and in particular the integration of non-traditional, small, yet innovative companies (SMEs) and logistics providers into the supply chain of large manufacturers (OEMs).

In parallel, the manufacturing processes of the future are changing and need to be highly flexible and dynamic in order to satisfy customer demands for, e.g. large series production, mass customization, or changing orders.\nTo keep pace with the needs of the manufacturing industry of the future, in Manufacturing 4.0 companies need to flexibly react to these demands and be able to offer production capacities in a rapid way. Thus companies looking for manufacturing capacity need to be supported by the means to find these capacities, configure them, and integrate them into their own manufacturing processes.\nTo achieve this, one obvious approach is to port successful concepts from the field of Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS) and Cloud computing to manufacturing to mirror agile collaboration through flexible and scalable manufacturing processes: \n\u2022 Leasing and releasing manufacturing assets in an on-demand, utility-like fashion.\n\u2022 Rapid elasticity through scaling leased assets up and down if necessary.\n\u2022 Pay-per-use through metered service.\nApplying these principles, Cloud manufacturing can move manufacturing processes from production-oriented to service-oriented networks by modelling single manufacturing assets as services in a similar way as SaaS or PaaS solutions. By modelling all process steps and manufacturing assets as services it is possible to realize cross-organization manufacturing orchestrations and integrate distributed resources and ultimately manufacture products more efficiently.\nWhile the theoretical foundations for Cloud manufacturing are manifest there are no proven tools and technologies exist in the market - CREMA aims to change this fact by providing Cloud-based Rapid Elastic Manufacturing based on SaaS and Cloud model.", 600295.0, 4284564.0, "CREMA", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_193459_936397940"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["4EE", "INFORMATION CATALYST FOR ENTERPRISE LTD*", 600110.0, "Fostering secure European societies (18.05.03.01)", "fts_2017_7222", 2017], ["4EE", "INFORMATION CATALYST FOR ENTERPRISE LTD*", 216973.0, "Improving lifelong health and well-being (09.04.03.01)", "fts_2017_7857", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "CW8"}
