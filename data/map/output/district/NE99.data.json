Leading idea is to introduce the concept of the European Green Car Initiative in the last mile operations, introduce innovative technology developments in the field of urban freight planning, vehicle technology and urban inter urban transhipment and to develop comprehensive and transferable impact assessment models for smart urban freight solutions. The main objectives can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022\tto enhance the innovation process at urban-interurban interfaces,\n\u2022\tto demonstrate and evaluate the technical and logistical feasibility of introducing electric vehicles and the second generation of hybrid truck technology into existing business supply chains and to apply these vehicle technologies in conjunction with information technology, operational, managerial and regulatory innovations including urban consolidation centres and telematics systems.\n\u2022\tto determine the critical success factors in stimulating the market uptake of new sustainable vehicle technology and other innovations in the urban logistics environment.\n\u2022\tto develop a Smart Urban Designer tool that allows the other city-regions and company supply chains to analyse the likely success and benefits of applying these innovations in their domain.\nThe project has a clear view as to the main goals for all the public and private partners, but we also recognise that the exact nature of the innovations and the demonstrations, between the demonstrations and the assessments needs to be localised in each demonstrator. Therefore we begin with 80% of the proposal clearly envisaged, but it is essential to address the crucial 20% through concertation and consensus.", 15520.0, 3215343.0, "SmartFuSION", "Greener, smarter urban freight", "Freight transport in urban areas is today a major cause of pollution in Europe.

Smart Mobility or 3. Smart Urban Spaces. The SECOND step is to develop desired scenarios for the cities for the selected focus areas. During the THIRD step the roadmap will be created, existing and future technologies and other developments will be identified, which enable the realization of the desired future scenarios. Opportunities and developments will be plotted on a timeline to provide insight in the required steps and milestones towards the favoured scenarios. The roadmaps will contain generic parts that are common for the partner cities, as well as specific parts that cater for the specific context of the cities.
