A total of 157 organisations from across the EU contributed information on funding provided for CVD research.\n\nProject members built on partnerships mobilised by the ESC in recent years to develop a comprehensive network including actors from academia, industry and all areas of the innovation cycle, as well as EU and national policymakers. Cross-disciplinary alliances and a collaborative approach are pegged as vital to innovation in health care and disease prevention.\n\nResearch returned a range of interesting findings related to CVD research in Europe. For example, of the EUR\u00a0876 million awarded for CVD research through open funding schemes from 2010 to 2012, one third was from the EU and two thirds from national sources (public and private). Also, research funding was found to be larger for cancer even though CVD is the most common cause of death in the EU.\n\nThe project website hosts the first-ever database on CVD research in Europe and provides information on country-specific funding schemes. This non-exhaustive inventory can be referenced for comparison with sources of national funding. Different types of users, including policymakers, funding bodies and researchers, can access the data for examination from very different viewpoints.\n\nOngoing inclusion of new data in this valuable tool will help improve knowledge on CVD research being carried out in the EU. Further, processes developed for data collection, classification and interrogation can be applied to relevant areas of medical research.\n\nCARDIOSCAPE has delivered tangible results that will help boost CVD research.

Antibiotics can cause disruption of the normal\n\nintestinal flora, an important part of the immune system, leading to an overgrowth of CDD. Currently, some 2350 patients\n\nsuffering from chronic CDD in a number of countries have been treated by faecal bacteriotherapy (FB), using samples\n\ncollected from donors. Although this procedure is reported, in a number of small studies, to be around 90% effective, it is\n\nhazardous, in that infection from the donor could be transmitted to the patient and it involves delivery of faecal samples into\n\nthe duodenum via a nasal probe.\n\nWe propose to treat CDD using a modified FB to restore the patient\u2019s original intestinal flora (employing samples collected\n\nfrom the patients themselves prior to their treatment) We will produce novel enteric-coated capsules, containing processed\n\nfreeze dried colonic flora that can be swallowed by a patient to restore their intestinal flora and immunise them against\n\nfurther infection by CDD.
