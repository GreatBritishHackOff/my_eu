The proposed PROTECTRAIL approach is therefore to split the problem of making the railway more secure into smaller asset-specific security problems (missions) for which it is easier to reach satisfactory solutions applicable and usable in different threat scenarios. Each sub-mission could be therefore better oriented to particularly significant areas of interest, resulting from risk analysis or from rail operator priorities. In a clear view of scope and performance goals, for each sub mission it will be easier to define, research and develop solutions in terms of architectures, technology deployment, as well as the necessary procedures, organizations to manage the specific issue. The PROTECTRAIL challenge is therefore to make interoperable the single asset-specific solutions and to conceive and design a modular architectural framework where each asset-specific solution can be \u201cplugged\u201d, that is the basis to assure a streamlined process of federation, integration and interoperability of respective solutions. The PROTECTRAIL project will address the following security sub-missions: protection of signal and power distribution systems against any terrorism act, track clearance, clearance of trains before and after daily use, staff clearance, luggage clearance control, passenger clearance control, freight clearance control, tracking and monitoring of rolling stock carrying dangerous goods, protection of communication and information systems, stations, buildings and infrastructure protection.", 70528.0, 18229601.0, "PROTECTRAIL", "Redefining rail security in Europe", "Tackling the different aspects of railway security under one integrated system will help rail operators and security authorities ensure safety for travellers.", "Ensuring railway security involves many different tasks and components, such as staff clearance, luggage clearance, freight clearance and protecting systems against terrorism. With this in mind, the EU-funded project 'Railway-industry partnership for integrated security of rail transport' (http://www.protectrail.eu/ (PROTECTRAIL)) tackled railway security from the perspective of a layered integrated system. It sought to divide the overall mission of security into smaller sub-tasks.\n \nWork within the project involved designing a system that interfaces seamlessly between security sub-missions. It also involved designing and demonstrating specific sub-system architectures to overcome key security sub-missions based on rail operators' needs, integrating the best technologies available today. \n\nTo achieve its aims, PROTECTRAIL provided tools and strategies for evaluating the security potential of a given security sub-mission in terms of performance, reliability, speed and costs. It outlined user requirements, defined the main mechanisms of the required system architecture, and ran simulations in France, Italy and Poland. This led to the implementation of the preliminary version of the system with valid prototypes for the sub-missions. \n\nAll these achievements have led to the design of an integrated system that stands to radically improve the security of rail transportation through better protection of railways and trains. From shielding signal and power distribution systems against electromagnetic terrorism to detecting abnormal objects under the ballast, This new system will close the security gap between different European railway systems. \n\nIn addition to supporting performance, reliability, speed and cost efficiency, the new system will help product and service developers improve and validate related technologies.

Researchers supported experimental work with computational fluid dynamics modelling and simulations. Through incremental increases in production, scientists achieved their production goal of 5\u00a0kg/hr and set a world record for flame spray pyrolysis capacity.\n\nThorough analyses of safety and nanoparticle risk management according to accepted procedures resulted in an industrial production line that completely removes the need for human contact with the nanopowders. It integrates automated feeding of nanoparticles and automated conveying and packaging of products.\n\nEconomic analyses demonstrated the potential of flame spray pyrolysis to cut commercial prices in half in some cases.

Working with the Philosopher of the human condition of the twentieth century; Hannah Arendt (1958; 1978), an inter-disciplinary think-tank research team brings Arendtian ethical philosophy into dialogue with SSH experts from a number of disciplinary fields, including thinkers of technologies and their effects on societies, philosophers of mathematics, gender and humanities experts, educational philosophy specialists, digital media thinkers, to produce a report that reflects the expression of the human algorithmic condition.

Having received this past year students from our specialties in Poland and also pending receipt from France.\r\nThroughout our experience as a shipping institution we have managed to consolidate our relationship with our partners in both Poland and the United Kingdom, where we have counterpart partners, small specialized companies in the personal image sector and also, in the case of Poland, with the help of intermediary partners.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this new edition, we have requested 4 mobilities for VET students; 2 for Poland and 2 for the United Kingdom. The number of scholarships will be distributed proportionally among the specialties and existing groups. If in some group or specialty there were not enough interested (a circumstance that is very unlikely given the success of the current project), that / s place / s would pass to the other group / specificity. In principle, they will be aimed at students of the intermediate degrees of the Hairdressing and Aesthetic specialties, but we consider the possibility of opening the experience to students of certificates of professionalism.\r\nThe beneficiaries of this project that will be part of their curriculum and will mark the beginning of their transition to the world of work are our second year students. Their ages range from 17 to 27 years (although the average age is in the 18-19 years) and the majority are women. An important part of our students comes from small urban centers relatively far from Valencia capital and its metropolis. From our internal quality surveys, it is clear that a significant number show a great root for their local nuclei that leads them not to think about labor mobility in the future. However, this trend is decreasing each year, while at the same time there is a feeling of openness to Europe.\r\nAs for the selection process, we would organize an information day, set a deadline for formal application, and then the international department would choose the beneficiaries based on the academic results (35%), English level (30%), And the valuation of teachers (35%). In addition to this information days, there is a need to add more activities before mobility (signing agreements, international meetings, talks with host partners, language training, cultural and Erasmus + training with beneficiaries, etc.) during mobility (meetings / evaluations Weekly study leaders with the tutors of the host partner etc.) and after mobility (evaluation, dissemination of results etc.)\r\nIn terms of impact, students will develop a greater cultural background that will include better language skills and greater openness to other cultures. This baggage will also be academic and professional. When performing their practices in salons linked to VET centers they will know another educational system (we will also do the same with the incorporation of new methodologies) and work and different work techniques specific to the field of hairdressing or beauty therapy. In addition, they will also gain professional contacts and new friendships, autonomy and maturity.\r\nShort-term / medium-term effects include employability (the main objective of this project, which will be reinforced by the cultural, linguistic and attitudinal impacts just mentioned) and the desire to continue to studying. As a long-term impact we find from a future employment in the host country or in any other until we continue to bet on the Erasmus + program and its values as future teachers, entrepreneurs or parents. Finally, it should be noted that the impact and objectives of our project, together with the rest of the participants, could lead to educational reforms.", "http://www.metropolishairdressing.com/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA102-046757_4"], ["1LQ", "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "KINGSTON UNIVERSITY HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", 166080.0, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.
