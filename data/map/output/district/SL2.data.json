The insulating material will have enhanced performance compared with the state of the art products and will contribute to the protection of the environment through the reduction of greenhouse gases generated in heating and cooling the building.\n\nThe concept described in HIPIN develops technology which is affordable and easily applicable. Insulating properties will be achieved through a combination of a novel approach to fabrication of aerogels to address the current cost issue, combined with the addition of low emissivity, a critical feature in improving the performance of thin insulating layers. In addition to the insulating effect, other functionalities will be sought such as self-cleaning, sound insulation and fire retardant properties.\n\nThe innovative multi-functional material will be suitable for application in a liquid form on exterior of buildings at a reducing cost and time required for installation. This will be achieved by the development of novel technology for handling fragile additives within liquid systems.\n\nThe developed process will constitute a viable approach to produce a material which can be affordably manufactured on an industrial scale and significantly in advance of solutions currently available.", 59283.0, 2349379.0, "HIPIN", null, null, null, "http://www.hipin.eu/", null, null, "fp7_101138_963184490"], ["5DS", "Sustainable Technologies for Calcined Industrial Minerals in Europe", "Imperial Chemical Industries Limited", "Europe is a major global producer of industrial minerals.  Around 180 million tonnes per year of products are extracted in the EU, with an estimated contribution of \u20ac10 billion to European GDP and offering direct employment to some 42,500 people.  A secure supply of sustainable mineral products is essential to maintaining the European mining, mineral and manufacturing industries.\n\nThe main objective of STOCISM is to enhance the competitiveness of the European industrial minerals industry by developing cleaner, more energy efficient extraction and processing technologies.  STOICISM is an industry-led project with a specific focus on calcined industrial minerals which are presently energy intensive to produce.  Most calcining uses the direct combustion of fossil fuels, contributing to up to 85% of their carbon emissions.\n\nTo meet the overall aim, three key calcined industrial minerals have been identified: diatomaceous earth; perlite and kaolin.  The processes implemented can also then be directly transferable to many other industrial minerals. In global terms, the EU produces one third of the world\u2019s production of perlite, 20% of calcined kaolin and 20% of diatomite.  Key markets for these minerals are beverage filtration, coatings, plastic, rubber, cosmetics, insulation and construction materials. STOICISM will research, develop and demonstrate a range of new innovative technologies along the industrial minerals value chain. This will include developments in extraction, beneficiation, drying, calcining and waste recycling.\n\nSTOICISM is expected to impact significantly on the sustainability of the EU\u2019s industrial minerals industry by decreasing the use of natural resources (both mineral deposits and energy resources) leading to the sustainable production of better and purer products with less waste and lower environmental impact.", 25453.0, 6859720.0, "STOICISM", null, null, null, "http://www.stoicism.eu/", null, null, "fp7_106426_963184490"], ["5DS", "ENergy harVesting by Invisible Solar IntegratiON in building skins", "Imperial Chemical Industries Limited", "Envision a full envelope concept that harvests solar energy from the 120 billion square meters of building surface available within the EU28.

To maximise efficient usage of the harvested energy, the solutions are coupled to novel heat systems and district heat networks.\n\nENVISION\u2019 focusses on energy harvesting of the fa\u00e7ade, and works by absorbing the invisible part  of the solar radiation (the near-infrared (NIR) part, roughly 50% of the solar energy spectrum) allowing visible aspects to be retained.

Bonding to wet, rough and fouled surfaces, however, remains challenging and adhesive technology is rarely applied for bonding in wet conditions, such as in (orthopaedic) medicine. Therefore, a need exists to educate young researchers in this interdisciplinary research field of controlling adhesion under wet conditions and to bridge the gap between the fundamentals of underwater adhesives and their practice. BioSmartTrainee is set up to provide such training by a combination of three complementary scientific fields: polymer science, adhesion and (fluid)-biomechanics. We aim to (i) extract principles from biological systems and mimic them to design synthetic materials; to (ii) experimentally test their adhesion properties in wet conditions and to (iii) clarify the adhesion mechanisms based on natural examples and theoretical modelling. These innovative adhesives will be useful for reversible attachment to a variety of surfaces in wet environments and, therefore, be highly relevant for products from European industry such as technological adhesives, coatings, tissue adhesives, wound dressings or transdermal delivery devices.
