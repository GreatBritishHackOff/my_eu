Moulded Paper Products (MPP) from China are up 20% cheaper than the equivalent EU products. Due to continued increase in prices there is a need for the EU industry to reduce cost affiliated with low energy efficiencies. A major portion of recovered fibre is sourced from local SMEs such as waste paper merchants, waste management companies and corrugated case manufacturers. The recovered paper market will be directly impacted through potentially higher demand. Demand from China for recovered fibre has pushed prices high. Exports globally estimated at over 13 million tonnes per annum (expected to increase by around 18 million by 2009) are used mainly for MPP manufacturing, which are subsequently exported back to Europe. Estimated growth volumes for existing and new markets, show that increasing usage of recovered fibre will be restrained, unless the industry can move forward on the following key issues: \u2022 Improvement in the ability to produce cost competitive products \u2022 Step change in the aesthetic characteristics of products, at competitive prices \u2022 Migration towards utilisation of post- consumer recovered fibre The Solution. The proposed project aims to develop a novel process for producing moulded paper products more energy efficiently with better complexity in design.

The 21st Century has offered special educators new and incredibly helpful insights from neuroscience and biochemistry for example, which now need to feed in to provision and school improvement planning.  This century has also brought us new technologies, particularly in relation to assistive and augmentative communication, allowing practitioners to address particular barriers to learning, and unlock potential. In addition, attitudes and values around special education (as well as to education itself) are changing.  Newer paradigms in our Post-Fordist global economy emphasise more personalised approaches, rather than a culture of uniformity which emphasises that all individuals must be offered the exact same thing.  At Swiss Cottage, when we talk about innovation and change for special education, we are also talking about a shift in understanding around notions of \"entitlement\", moving towards a belief that all children and young people have the right to have their individual needs met, rather than the \"right\" to do the same as everybody else, regardless of whether or not this is meaningful. Innovation, to reflect this rethinking represents a big and ambitious piece of work, leading to the development of new frameworks, systems, and processes, which can be supported through training and transnational networking.  As a National Teaching School therefore, we consider it our responsibility to nurture 'Change Agents' within the Special Education sector, internally, locally, and globally.  This requires us not only to \"change\", but also to \"engage\" , with models of best practice from other nations, international research, and comparative education approaches.
