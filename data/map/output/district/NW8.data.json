The aims of the proposed DEMYBE project are: to substitute the currently used carcinogenic Kieselghur filter system (currently used in 95 % of brewery worldwide) in regards to health and environmental issues that cause during the application/disposal of the filter aid in the brewery/vinification process and the removal of 80 % of OTA, from the end products.

Moulded Paper Products (MPP) from China are up 20% cheaper than the equivalent EU products. Due to continued increase in prices there is a need for the EU industry to reduce cost affiliated with low energy efficiencies. A major portion of recovered fibre is sourced from local SMEs such as waste paper merchants, waste management companies and corrugated case manufacturers. The recovered paper market will be directly impacted through potentially higher demand. Demand from China for recovered fibre has pushed prices high. Exports globally estimated at over 13 million tonnes per annum (expected to increase by around 18 million by 2009) are used mainly for MPP manufacturing, which are subsequently exported back to Europe. Estimated growth volumes for existing and new markets, show that increasing usage of recovered fibre will be restrained, unless the industry can move forward on the following key issues: \u2022 Improvement in the ability to produce cost competitive products \u2022 Step change in the aesthetic characteristics of products, at competitive prices \u2022 Migration towards utilisation of post- consumer recovered fibre The Solution. The proposed project aims to develop a novel process for producing moulded paper products more energy efficiently with better complexity in design. This developed technology will open the way for more applications of MPP across further industries, such as to replace plastic packaging used for consumables, \u2018non critical\u2019 parts in automotive and plastic bottles.", 97490.0, 1105737.0, "SINFILTRATE", null, null, null, "http://www.sinfiltrate.co.uk", "http://www.carbisfiltration.co.uk", null, "fp7_94173_998956053"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NW8"}
