Moulded Paper Products (MPP) from China are up 20% cheaper than the equivalent EU products. Due to continued increase in prices there is a need for the EU industry to reduce cost affiliated with low energy efficiencies. A major portion of recovered fibre is sourced from local SMEs such as waste paper merchants, waste management companies and corrugated case manufacturers. The recovered paper market will be directly impacted through potentially higher demand. Demand from China for recovered fibre has pushed prices high. Exports globally estimated at over 13 million tonnes per annum (expected to increase by around 18 million by 2009) are used mainly for MPP manufacturing, which are subsequently exported back to Europe. Estimated growth volumes for existing and new markets, show that increasing usage of recovered fibre will be restrained, unless the industry can move forward on the following key issues: \u2022 Improvement in the ability to produce cost competitive products \u2022 Step change in the aesthetic characteristics of products, at competitive prices \u2022 Migration towards utilisation of post- consumer recovered fibre The Solution. The proposed project aims to develop a novel process for producing moulded paper products more energy efficiently with better complexity in design.

Project partners include early education institutions in Bulgaria, France, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Croatia, Poland and Sweden. The project partnerships will be extended to institutions in Finland, Ireland and Denmark, where particularly youth welfare facilities, special-needs schools and institutions in elderly care will be considered. \r\n\r\nThe mobility project is divided into three schemes. \r\n\r\nThe first scheme - the Europaklasse class scheme - includes participants who have decided to focus on the development of intercultural competence during their initial professional education as an officially recognised nursery school teacher. As part of this education, the participants complete their placement abroad for three months at day care centres, nursery schools and at institutions for people with special educational needs. Possible requirements for participating in the project are e.g. intermediate-level educational qualification including one year at a vocational school or general qualification for university entrance including a 6-week social work placement.  The  profile of this scheme is geared particularly towards promoting intercultural competence and culturally sensitive work in plural and global societies and political conditions/contexts. The stay abroad allows the participants to learn about the conception of diversity  in their European partner country  and the resulting institutional challenges.\r\nDuring a period of preparation the participants of the first scheme approach their partner country from a variety of angles, take a specific language course and address the specific project topic on a theoretically well-founded level.\r\nDuring the stay abroad the participants are actively involved in the educational work of the partner institution. This includes e.g. working in teams, participating in public relations activities and implementing the project topic. In addition, the participants give 2 demonstration lessons, which are evaluated by the institute\u2019s teachers.  \r\nThe participants evaluate their experiences and insights after the placement abroad during an externally supervised 3-day workshop. The learning outcomes are incorporated in various documentations and publications.  \r\n    \r\nDuring the second scheme of the mobility project \u201cLearning Mobility of Individuals\u201d, the nursery school teachers in training are offered the opportunity to engage in a two-week work placement in a European country at the end of their vocational training. In this way they should be enabled to expand their already sound expertise in a culturally foreign environment and reflect on it.  These intercultural stimuli are aimed at enriching their future professional practice.\r\n\r\nThe third scheme \u201cLearning Mobility of Education Staff\u201d focuses on the professional discourse between the teachers of the institute and educational specialists in the partner countries . This scheme is implemented through job-shadowing, specific work placements as well as talks and presentations and develops the cultural diversity competence of the project\u2019s participants .\r\nThe project sponsor is responsible for continuous quality assurance and fostering cooperation between the institute and its European partners.\r\n\r\nThe project has a substantial multiplier effect at the Institut f\u00fcr Soziale Berufe due to its integration in continued education curricula, at a local level (involvement in cultural events) and at a regional level due to networking. \r\nThe sustainable, long-term benefit of the project is that the participants develop a professional identity as ambassadors for Europe and adopt a culturally sensitive and inclusive attitude in their professional self-conception, which essentially motivates and shapes their work as educational specialists.", "http://www.cityofwestminster.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003878_2"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["9LE", "RAL", "WELLINGTON HOSPITAL"], ["9NH", "RAL", "HOSPITAL OF ST JOHN & ST ELIZABETH"], ["9LE", "RHW", "THE WELLINGTON HOSPITAL"], ["9LE", "RRV", "UCLH OUTREACH: THE WELLINGTON HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NW8"}
