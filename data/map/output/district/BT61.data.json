It meets the specific requirements of the call (Section 1.1.2.4).\nEU-UNAWE exploits inspirational aspects of astronomy and space to interest very young disadvantaged children in science and technology, broaden their minds and stimulate European and global citizenship. The proposal builds on Universe Awareness (UNAWE), a unique, innovative and proven programme for children aged 4 to 10 years. It will exploit the achievements of European (EU) and South African (SA) space sciences to inspire, excite and stimulate young children, when their curiosity is high and their value systems are being formed. Specifically, EU-UNAWE will: - Train and empower primary school teachers in 6 countries to include astronomy and space topics in the classroom. - Develop and translate hands-on material, where appropriate emphasising EU and SA science and technology. - Provide a network for exchange of expertise and material between educators - Lay the groundwork for expansion of the programme throughout the EU, Associated Countries and ICP Countries. - Act as a showcase for EU and SA astronomy/space and related technologies, by disseminating the products among very young children, their teachers and their families. - Use astronomy/space products to stimulate awareness and strengthen public support for EU and SA space science research and technology. - Stimulate the next generation of EU and SA engineers and scientists, particularly girls. - Contribute to the integration of disadvantaged communities in participating countries. - Strengthen collaboration between EU and SA over mutually beneficial scientific, technological, educational and social topics. - Provide significant added value for Europe\u2019s expenditure on astronomy and space sciences for a modest incremental cost. Pooling complementary expertise and resources of 6 partners gives a project whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts.", 168732.0, 2140559.0, "EU-UNAWE", "Getting youngsters excited about the Universe", "An international network of more than 40 countries is promoting science education and inspiration for young children with astronomy as the touchstone.", "The EU-funded Universe Awareness (UNAWE) programme was begun at Leiden University in 2004 to inspire young children aged 4 to 10, particularly those from underprivileged backgrounds, in astronomy. It has become a unique, innovative and proven programme for fostering education and providing skills in science and technology throughout the world and particularly in developing countries.\n\nBuilding on UNAWE, the EU-funded 'Building on the international year of astronomy: Making young children aware of the Universe' (EU-UNAWE) project is exploiting EU and South African (SA) achievements in the space sciences. The EU-UNAWE website (http://www.eu-unawe.org) was launched in 2011 as the central information hub. Visits to the site have increased approximately 30\u00a0% per month since then.\n\nEarly achievements have attracted more and more countries to the network which now boasts UNAWE programmes in 40 countries. EU-UNAWE national project managers (NPMs) in each of the six participating countries are developing educational materials and running workshops. Together, they provide primary school educators with ideas, resources and confidence to bring astronomy and space science into their classrooms.\n\nMany events for children have been held and the EU-UNAWE International Office has organised an astronomy news service for kids called Space Scoop. It has already published about 50 stories based on press releases from major astronomical observatories and astronomy organisations that have been translated into 14 languages. Particular emphasis has been given to targeting girls and encouraging them to take up careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).\n\nEU-UNAWE is using the wonders of the Universe to inspire young children all over the world, encourage a lifelong interest in science and technology, and foster a feeling of international community. Its potential impact may have no boundaries, much as some have proposed for the Universe itself.", "http://eunawe.eu/", "http://star.arm.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2012-12/53687.jpg", "fp7_97906_998279187"], ["9DG", "European Planetology Network Research Infrastructure", "Armagh Observatory and Planetarium", "The Europlanet RI project will provide the European planetary science community with a unique research infrastructure, combining access to a suite of state of the art facilities while fostering their joint development and integration in terms of capacity and performance. This research infrastructure will include access to laboratory and field site facilities, advanced modelling, simulation and data analysis resources and to data produced by space missions and ground-based telescopes hence maximising the scientific impact of major European space missions and ground-based installations.   Access will be provided in two forms. Three coordinated Trans National Access activities will open to many users the unique range of laboratory and field site facilities selected for this project. In parallel, the IDIS e-service will provide a user-friendly web-based access to the available planetary science data, information and software tools.   Four Joint Research Activities will broaden the scope of the infrastructure, opening access to new field sites, offering new models and data analysis tools for users and widening the opportunity of remote data access by progressively upgrading IDIS into a Planetary Virtual Observatory.  Four complementary networking activities will publicize the objectives and opportunities of Europlanet RI and disseminate project results amongst the scientific community, industries, SME\u2019s, space agencies and the public. They will consolidate the establishment of a European Research Area for planetary science and exploration.  Building on the synergies between its services, joint research activities and networking activities, Europlanet RI will provide the ideal scientific and technical environment to fully analyse data from past and present planetary missions and prepare the next generation of missions. In this way it will play a vital role in establishing the European Community as a leading player in planetary and space exploration.", 22763.0, 6360765.0, "EUROPLANET RI", "Europe reaching for the planets", "Europe hosts one of the largest communities of planetary scientists, spread across all Member States. An EU-funded initiative has now forged a significant degree of cohesion and unity of purpose among them.", "The research infrastructure needed to address major planetary science questions extends beyond space missions. It requires a diversity of tools that should be shared among scientists to properly interpret observations and propose new theoretical models.\n\nTo address this need, a series of transnational activities have opened up to a broad community of users laboratory facilities and field sites, advanced modelling and data analysis resources tailored for planetary research. The 'European planetology network' (http://www.europlanet-eu.org/ (EUROPLANET)) was the initiative of European scientists working on the Cassini\u2013Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan, its largest moon.\n\nIn its initial phase, EUROPLANET helped researchers define common science goals and exchange ideas as well as personnel. From January 2009 it entered a new, more ambitious phase where access was provided to the world's largest databank in planetary science.\n\nIn a subsequent phase, under the project 'European planetology network research infrastructure' (http://www.europlanet-ri.eu/ (EUROPLANET\u00a0RI)), 27 research institutes and universities joined forces. They brought together data sets from a wide variety of space missions and the output of theoretical models to build a virtual observatory with an unprecedented view of the entire solar system.\n\nExtensive efforts were also devoted to raising the profile of European planetary science through national and international media. Underpinned by a network of key contact points in each European country, EUROPLANET\u00a0RI provided a plethora of information on Europe's involvement in planetary science to policymakers, the industry and the public.\n\nDuring the European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC), organised once a year, European scientists had the opportunity to get together with their international peers for a productive exchange of scientific results. The EUROPLANET\u00a0RI outreach activities also brought researchers' excitement to European citizens.\n\nThese activities also assisted experienced researchers to engage in dialogue with the public and, more importantly, a younger generation that needs encouragement to pursue a career in science. Successfully advancing research in planetary science will depend to a large extent on attracting Europe's budding scientists to this field.", null, "http://star.arm.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/156533.jpg", "fp7_92505_998279187"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["7AE", "Employment Preparation Service", "THE APPLEBY TRUST", null, "ESF", 606821.16, 933571.04, "esf_ni_25"], ["7AE", "The Print Room", "APPLEBY CAREERS PROJECT LTD", null, "ESF", 106783.0, 266957.0, "esf_ni_74"], ["7HF", "Road to Improving Skills and Employment Project (RISE)", "SOUTHERN REGIONAL COLLEGE", null, "ESF", 1224386.0, 3060966.0, "esf_ni_112"], ["7AE", "Employment Preparation Service", "THE APPLEBY TRUST", null, "ESF", 121717.0, 304292.0, "esf_ni_117"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT61"}
