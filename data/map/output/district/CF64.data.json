The \"Ready for a Job\" project is an integral part of this platform, as such, for a year; the actors involved in this platform are considering the implementation of a common project. \"Ready for a job\" is part of this effort, bringing together 5 members of the platform, working in favor of youth mobility within a consortium: Local Missions of Douaisis and Lille, Francas, CEMEA and L\u00e9o Lagrange Nord-Ile de France.\r\n\r\n\"Ready for a job\" is a way of pooling members of the network in terms of coordinating, preparing and supporting young people (school leavers, NEETs) from the territory to mobility as a key to professional and personal success.\r\n\r\nThe goals are:\r\n- Gain of professional skills,\r\n- Empowerment of an audience with less opportunity and professional difficulties,\r\n- Discovery of a specific profession in an intercultural environment.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to promote training and employment opportunities in order to facilitate the integration of young people into adult life by means of adapted and comprehensive support that prepare them both for mobility and re-employment . The 244 youngsters that will benefit of the grants are mainly aged between 18 and 30 and among them there are school leavers, others followed by training centers, local missions and the job center. Particular attention will be given to young people lacking opportunities, school dropouts and people with fewer opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe activities set up during the deployment of this project will concern the promotion of the Erasmus + program, through the platform\u2019s outreach antennas, informing and supporting participants towards mobility, valuing learning outcomes and dissemination of the results of this project. \r\n\r\nThrough exchanges on our practices, by pooling our tools and resources, at the level of the platform, we will allow future participants to benefit from a preparation that is intercultural and linguistic, practical and professional. Each member, as the sending organization, will be in charge of the follow-up of its participants, in liaison with the host organization. For each audience, we thought of an internship period in line with its needs and limits to meet their expectations.

In the short term, we aim at developing autonomy and adaptability of the youngsters, openness to other cultures, increasing in professional skills and develop a sense of responsibility. Over the long term, the project may lead to young people returning to work, particularly within the 6 months following their return from mobility.

In addition, next year the number of staff applications will be more than double the places available thanks to the promoting activities carried out by each individual institution.\r\n\r\nAn important element in the Consortium plan of international development is the increase of other kinds of mobility: the schools are applying for MOVE 4.0 Call (DGR Veneto n.1866/2016) in order to organize study holidays with compulsory B1 certification. If financed, 90 3rd year students will be involved and they are prospective candidates for Erasmus + mobility in 2018.

An increase of 1-2 groups for each school is foreseen. This number is only apparently low as these activities are often an alternative to exchanges, that are the most important mobilities in the schools of the Consortium.
