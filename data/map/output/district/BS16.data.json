The Combatting Bacterial Resistance in Europe - Molecules against Gram Negative Infections (COMBACTE-MAGNET) consortium will provide groundbreaking multinational phase 2 and phase 3 studies in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients and a phase 1 paediatric safety and PK study with the bispecific immunoglobulin (IgG)1 mAb (MEDI3902) targeting the pathogenic components PsI and PcrV as a new approach for preventing P. aeruginosa infections, especially pulmonary infections, in ICU patients. In addition, the consortium will perform phase 1 and phase 2 studies, including extensive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies, with a new beta\u2010lactam \u2010 AIC499 \u2010 with enhanced beta\u2010lactamase stability and in vitro/ in vivo activities against MDR-GNB, including P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. Alone, or in combination with a beta\u2010lactamase inhibitor (BLI), AIC499 is active against MDR isolates producing a wide range of beta\u2010lactamases, and therefore, offers the real prospect of a new treatment option for patients with life-threatening infections due to MDR GNBs. The COMBACTE-MAGNET consortium brings together 5 pharmaceutical industry partners and 36 academic partners, and is a true nexus of world class researchers from 10 European countries with expertise in (i) designing and executing observational and interventional studies related to antibiotic\u2010resistant bacteria; (ii) conducting high\u2010quality research in the epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of infections caused by MDR\u2010GNB, (iii) identifying novel biomarkers in critically ill patients; (iv) performing Phase I PK/PD studies; (v) performing Phase 2 studies enriched for PK/PD endpoints; and (vi) performance of large definitive Phase 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) for regulatory purposes. The two European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) project sponsors, MedImmune and AiCuris, will provide all required study\u2010related expertise in clinical development of monoclonal antibodies and antibiotics with MEDI3902 and AIC499 plus BLI as Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs), respectively.

The challenge is to discover how to program collective behaviour of the trillions of NP interacting in a complex tumour environment. Finding effective NP designs that give rise to desired outcome will require a new class of evolutionary algorithms that can simultaneously 1) generate novel NP-based anti-cancer strategies, 2) search over a large space of solutions, and 3) adapt to a wide variety of scenarios. Our novel evolutionary approach will be integrated with the NanoDoc (http://nanodoc.org) simulator that reproduces realistic NP motion and interactions within the tumour environment and with other NP. The most promising NP designs will then be synthesized and tested in vivo and  in vitro on breast and colon cancer stem cells using mouse cancer xenografts and microfluidic testbeds featuring cancer microenvironments. To promote translation of the platform from early stage research into a commercialized product for patients, we will work with industrial partner ProChimia Surfaces, organize \u2018Industry Open Days\u2019 for potential investors and develop a translation strategy.\nEVO-NANO is a multidisciplinary project that will create an entirely novel NP design platform for new cancer treatments, capable of autonomously evolving both innovative and adaptive solutions.

The equine industry in Norway is relatively new in comparison to other countries. In order to help professionalize this industry it is vital to obtain impulses and expertise from abroad. One of the countries that has a long standing tradition in the equine is England.\r\nMelsom School has established a partnership with Hartpury College in Gloucester, England. This college is a well renowned in the European equine world, and a stay there is a unique opportunity for our students.\r\n\r\nNorways climate and its equine population are quite different to those of England. In particular, the use of the horse and the horse culture in Norway are very different. Horses in Norway have traditionally been used in agriculture, and are in fact still used today in the more remote parts of the country to work the land and forests. They have been used to a lesser degree for competitions an leisure. However, over the last few decades there has been a rapid development in the industry, and the need to draw and learn from such tradition-rich countries like Britain is therefore important and essential for the development of an up-to-date and professional equine industry in Norway. A stay at Hartpury College will provide our students an insight into the various fields within the equine industry which is currently under development in Norway.\r\n\r\nThe project is intended to be implemented in 2015 and 2016 with a set number of students each autumn. During their stay the students will, through practice and theory, gain knowledge and understanding of certain areas of the equine industry in England. In addition, the students will carry out yard duties at the Hartpury College stables, follow on foot a traditional fox hunt, visit an equine rehabilitation and welfare center where they take care of old, sick and injured horses, and spend some time at a busy equine Vetrinary clinic. During their stay at Hartpury the students will be given demonstrations of some of the exellent facilities, such as treadmill, and get the opportunity to observe work-ups of clinical cases, thus enabling them to gain a working knowledge of the cardiovascular system of the sports horse. They will also se part of a rehabilitation program when horses are worked in the aqua-treadmill.\r\n\r\nANIMAL CARE\r\nIn Norway we have an educational institution at college level that educates Animal Carers.  Within this education the students get very little training in dealing with exotic animals. Melsom` s offer within Animal care does not lead to a veternary nurse qualification , but gives students the skills to take assistant jobs in Veterinary Clinics and in pet stores. To provide our students with as broad as possible expertise in animal care and exotic animals, we must travel outside Norway. Melsom, has today, an ongoing collaboration with Hartpury College in equine studies and will further develop this cooperation to include Animal care. Hartpury is the place to go with our students where they will recieve both practical training in dealing with exotic animals and  also theoretical knowledge. During their stay, students will be involved in the daily care of exotic animals, treatment of sick and injured animals. Hartpury also a hydrotherapy center for dogs where our students will be involved in the treatment of dogs that have injuries and problems.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to language skills, pupils will train on a daily basis as all lessons will be given in English and communication with other students and teachers will also be in English.  This helps to build confidence in speaking Englinsh.  Throughout the project the students will experioence a variety of cultural differences, focusing on british politenes. \r\n\r\n\r\nThose students who will participate in this project are students from Level 2 Agriculture and horticulture industry with specialization in Animal care. The project is intended to be conducted in the spring of 2016 and 2017.  An equal group of students each spring During their stay, the pupils will gain knowledge, via practical and theoretical classes, about  Animal care with focus on handling and care of exotic animals. \r\n\r\nThroughout their stay, students will also gain insight and knowledge of the cultural differences between Norway and England with special focus on courtesy, and terminology in the English language. During their stay, students will also be enlightend about further educationall possibilities , and hopefully bring potential business ideas home to Norway. Through the activities, work experience and education, students will be challenged to practice speaking English, and therefore become more confident in using the English language after their time at Hartpury", "http://www.uwe.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-NO01-KA102-013113_1"], ["1QY", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST OF ENGLAND, BRISTOL", 179719.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.uwe.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST OF ENGLAND, BRISTOL", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-012774_coordinator"], ["1QX", "Ondernemend handelen en sociaal ondernemerschap  : meer carri\u00e8reperspectief voor  MBO jongeren in Europa.", "Holiday Inn Bristol Filton", 155070.0, "General objectives:In the past 5 years Friesland College managed to increase the number of teachers and students going abroad.  We actively support these international mobilities, not only in Europe but also in developing countries.

We want to make them realize that a united Europe and a good cooperation between the member states are crucial for a stable economic Europe.  A very actual en critical situation with the number of refugees entering Europe.We aim at offering challenging education in general, not only by creating an international programme of Excellence abroad for our VET+ students of level 4EQF but we also look for possibilities for developing the talents of our students with a socially challenged background by offering them a life changing experience abroad. More specifically : 1. Entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial  attitude and  behaviour:Our students of level 4+EQF are more and more aware of the fact that they need to make their own choices in life in order to be economically and financially independent in an early stage of their life. The situation in Europe requires a more personified and individualized career path to reach personal goals. Our objective is to empower students in realizing a fulfilling, satisfying, fruitful life and career, either in Europe or in our region . Communication skills, using English in a natural setting, meeting young people in other countries, being part of their peer-to-peer training in social entrepreneurship is a good source for empowerment.  Developing personal leadership in a programme of excellence enables them to follow a path of growth, on a multisectoral level.Teachers and students wil be trained abroad within the companies involved. This enables students to develop the 4  Binckley 2020 competences of 21st century skills : creativity, critical thinking, communication and collaboration.  This training enables students to start up companies as start-ups or pop-ups while studying.  As part of that process we will also focus on Job-carving, former jobs defined in a new way and transferred into  new settings. That requires new curricula and new training methods which will be , developed  in collaboration with our international partners.Our partners will be triggered to implement the newly developed methods in their own region in order to inspire young  people starting their own businesses.2.

They are the key for a succesful study period abroad. 5. Focus on professionals in training in view of our Programme of Excellence which had been developed this year. Excellent students require excellent professionals. Extra material will be offered in the programme and therefore professionals will go abroad in order to find new teaching methods The exchanging of teaching methods,  training,  job- shadowing and intercultural sensitivity with foreign colleagues will contribute to a broader view on cultural values.
