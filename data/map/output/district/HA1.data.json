However the reality is a little different \u2013 the percentage of Lithuanian information and communication technology professionals  among total employed in the country is only 2.1 percent  by 2016 statistic. The main reason of the limiting growth of Lithuanian IT sector is notable shortage of IT specialists. It is obvious that any new qualified IT professional will get the job offer, and only from his competence and the choice will depend on what company and the position he chooses. There is no doubt that digitalization will have an increasing impact on business IT solutions that help simplify and speed up the work, and also will more and more replaced with common tasks.

The activities of our institution in cooperation with real firms, the experience form the subject training company, and the experience acquired from international fairs of training firms indicate the need for new, progressive and innovative methods of education based on the needs of Slovak and European job market. These methods emphasise the practical understanding, next to textbooks, they implement real situations from real life.       \r\n\r\nOur vision is to recreate and improve the students' profile with professional and linguistic knowledge within four years, which follows the needs of the modern European job market. The basic tool for this change is the new and updated school educational program, which takes into consideration these requirements and also this year there is a possibility to complete vocational education by studying at FEC - Further Education College. \r\n We would like to concentrate on the multicultural differences within Europe by learning about them, and trying to understand and accept them.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of the students' training the aims of our project are:\r\n-to introduce to the students the departments of the firms, and the agenda of each department\r\n-to enable students to consult with the professional workforce and with the management\r\n-to introduce to the students the work of the marketing department (marketing research, contact with clients, the preparation of catalogues and promotion materials, data processing, PR, the preparation and realization of meetings)\r\n- to introduce to the students the work of the HR department (training of the employees, types of contracts and  agreements, benefits, recruiting, job interviews, the preparation of a professional CV)\r\n-to introduce to the students the work of the economic department (budgeting, bookkeeping ,bookkeeping, reporting, statistics \r\n- to enable students and the employees to improve their communicative competence and professional vocabulary in English\r\n\r\nWe planned our mobilities as follows:\r\na/ students of the study field business academy - bilingual studies  - 10 students travel for three weeks to London, the mobility will take place either in May/June 2018.\r\nb/  students of the study field business academy  - 10 students travel for three weeks to London, their mobility will take place  in May/June 2018\r\nc/ managers (headmaster and 2 deputy headmasters - they travel for three days in different terms to Ostrava, their mobility will take place  from  October 2017 to March 2018.", "http://www.mapleestate.co.uk/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SK01-KA102-035258_10"], ["3EX", "Learning Through Language", "Red Ochre Enterprises Ltd", 170777.0, "Language Through Language (LTL) will provide mobilities for VET Learners in the vocational field of Teaching English, with a focus on teaching English for social inclusion and to disadvantaged and diverse communities.  Learners will be placed in 90 day placements, hosted in six language academies in Seville, Spain. Our project will last one year.\r\n\r\nLTL will support participants in developing their skills and experience so they can access  jobs and contribute to an equal and inclusive society after the placement. We will have 30 participants leaving for Seville in three groups of ten. Participants will likely be:\r\n-Any age over 18 \r\n-Based across the UK\r\n-Unemployed or in training and who want to use their training and build their abilities to teach English in a variety of settings to disadvanted and diverse communities\r\n-Motivated or curious about using English teaching to contribute to inclusion in the EU\r\n-Able to demonstrate or exhibit attitudes of kindness, curiosity and commitment.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of LTL are:\r\n-To provide high quality vocational training placements to English teacher trainees and recent (within 1 year of graduating) qualified individuals\r\n-For participants to leave LTL better able to secure or create employment in language work\r\n-Inclusion: contribute to addressing language needs of all learners+disadvantaged communities across the EU\r\n-Use language training and dissemination of results to increase skills, cultural interaction and multilinguism in the EU\r\n-Involve and empower participants throughout.\r\n\r\nLanguage is key to inclusion economically, socially and culturally. In the UK and EU, the need for teachers with high quality, internationally recognised English language teaching qualifications has never been greater. 7.7 percent of the population do not speak English as a first language with recent census figures showed that across England 1.7% of the population (900,000 people) have either no, or poor spoken English (Bringing People Together,DCLG, 2014). These people face significant barriers in participating fully in local, national and European life.  Most recently, The Casey Review (2017), stated that \"speaking English is the key to full participation in our society and economy, and is a prerequisite for meaningful engagement.\"\r\n\r\nThese 90 day placements are based on discussions amongst all our partners and our recent experience of what time frame allows learners to improve their skills, develop personally and achieve their objectives.\r\n\r\nThe need for innovative ways to reach and teach all learners but also isolated people and new arrivals means the placement will also provide training for participants to experience a variety of ways of practicing their vocation that they could not get in the UK.  English academies in Andalusia are world class and have particular approaches for LTL participants to bring back to the UK.\r\n\r\nWe will recruit \"for attitude\" as well as experience, qualifications and skills and aim for a positive group in each flow who can inspire peer to peer learning.\r\n\r\nAfter recruitment has occurred, Language Gateways takes place over three main stages:\r\n1) Preparation - professional, linguistic and cultural\r\n2) VET Placement - orientation, initial shadowing of staff, work placement \r\n3) Aftercare - development in placement and development of work related skills.\r\n\r\nPrior to their departure to Spain, participants will benefit from a range of training, information and and systems that aim to help them maximise the outcomes of the placement. Preparation training in London will equip them personally and professionally.\r\n\r\nPlacements will enable participants to gain vocational and professional skills, broaden their knowledge of the sector and develop enhanced intercultural awareness, which, along with improved teaching and personal skills, will support them in accessing  employment opportunities in the UK and EU. We will provide them with post placement support  to help access employment, career progression or further training opportunities, on their return. We then envisage that these teachers will be more effective in using language learning to address inclusion and equality in the EU in the future.\r\n\r\nSustainability is very important to LTL. One of the key ways in which we can have a national impact is firstly through dissemination of results. And secondly through sharing the learning of the teachers. We will work with them during the three flows to create a final toolkit which will share their learning so that it can be passed on to other trainee teachers at the UK consortium members schools but also to other schools and colleges throughout the UK. This toolkit will be an open educational resource.\r\n\r\nPlacements start in September when the first group of 10 participants travel to Spain.
