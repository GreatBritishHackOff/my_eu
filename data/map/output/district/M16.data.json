The PROMISS consortium contains worldwide expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, geriatrics, nutrition, physical activity, microbiomics, as well as in behaviour, consumer, sensory  and computer sciences. It builds on strong collaborations with food industry and SMEs to strengthen innovation of the European agri-food sector and their market position. Existing data from scientifically well-established prospective aging cohorts and national nutritional surveys from Europe and \u2018third countries\u2019 will be combined with new data from short- and long-term intervention studies in older persons at risk. Its holistic approach will provide insight in the causality of the links between diet, physical activity, appetite and malnutrition and underlying pathways, thereby providing the necessary evidence to develop optimal, sustainable and evidence-based dietary and physical activity strategies to prevent malnutrition and enhance active and healthy aging. PROMISS will also deliver food concepts and products as well as persuasive technology to support adherence to these strategies. The dietary and physical activity strategies and food products will be specifically developed with older user involvement to meet the needs and fit the preferences of older consumers. In close collaboration with stakeholders, PROMISS will translate these strategies into practical recommendations to guide policy and health professionals at EU- and Member States level. Dissemination and implementation takes place through strong dissemination partners operating on an European level and linked to national networks across Member States. PROMISS promises prevention of malnutrition, additional healthy life years and a strengthening of EU\u2019s food industry.", 327836.0, 5985871.0, "PROMISS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_200176_927584811"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9AE", "Fabulamundi.

Playwriting Europe: Beyond Borders?\u201d is a cooperation project among theatres, festivals and cultural organisations from 10 EU Countries (Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Romania, Austria, Belgium, UK, Poland and Czech Republic). The network aims to support and promote the contemporary playwriting across Europe, in order to reinforce and enhance the activities and strategies of the professionals and artists working in the sector and to provide them with opportunities of networking and professional development. Based on the experience of the past Fabulamundi projects, the new project will mark a difference with the previous editions, maximising the impact and the diffusion of the methodologies and activities tested in the previous years and adding new EU scale initiatives. During the 43 months of project, an ongoing promotion of EU playwriting will be run: 16 dramaturgies (200 plays and 120 playwrights) circulated; 90 plays translated and circulated in the participating Countries through 8 international Artistic Programs; 40 plays published in a foreign Country; the first edition of an EU Festival are some of the main results. An ongoing training program will be launched for 80 playwrights and for participating organizations, with a specific focus on technical skills. The Fabulamundi Audience Development strategy and the Fabulamundi training methodology for playwrights will be designed, assessed and disseminated at EU level, and  the Fabulamundi EU Network created to ensure the sustainability of the project after its end.

Besides becoming familiar with standard business procedures as well as company structures and enabling them to use their knowledge and improve their skills acquired during their course, a work placement abroad offers them an insight into everyday working atmosphere and living conditions in other European countries. For young people interested in the European integration process and training for a career in an international environment a stay abroad is a prerequisite for a successful start into professional life.\r\nThe following intentions and objectives have been worked out together with companies that offer our students the opportunity to pass a work placement abroad: \r\nto obtain an insight into in-company procedures by using the country's language; to experience the single European market and realize special strategies of discovering the German market from the foreign company's point of view; to experience the basic ties and differences between cultures, to learn to develop sympathy for culture, life and mentality of the host country, thus reacting reasonably in the foreign language and if necessary being able to reply critically to prejudices; to obtain knowledge about socio-economic and political relations and problems of the host country in order to deal with national characteristics in everyday situations. \r\nOur students are offered work placements in various European countries; they choose a host country according to their personal expectations based on their skills and command of the foreign language to be improved substantially with the help of this project. The countries providing work placements are Spain, England, Portugal, Ireland, Sweden and The Netherlands. \r\n\r\nOnly those companies are selected which can provide a qualified work placement in agreement with the coordinators at Berufskolleg Kaufmannsschule Krefeld. Moreover these criteria are ensured by the details of the training programme laid down in the contracts between the participant, our school as the project coordinator and the coordinator of the host institution. \r\n\r\nTo certify the work placements the students are issued the Europass Mobility on completion of the training programme. \r\n\r\nDue to the experiences from former projects the minimum period of the placement has been extended from previously six weeks to eight weeks at present. Companies as well as trainees will no doubt profit from this measure by achieving a more intensive practical experience and qualification. \r\n\r\nThe work placement is appropriately arranged to take place in the final year of the course, thus offering advanced students a much better understanding of company procedures.
