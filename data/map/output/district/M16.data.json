The PROMISS consortium contains worldwide expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, geriatrics, nutrition, physical activity, microbiomics, as well as in behaviour, consumer, sensory  and computer sciences. It builds on strong collaborations with food industry and SMEs to strengthen innovation of the European agri-food sector and their market position. Existing data from scientifically well-established prospective aging cohorts and national nutritional surveys from Europe and \u2018third countries\u2019 will be combined with new data from short- and long-term intervention studies in older persons at risk. Its holistic approach will provide insight in the causality of the links between diet, physical activity, appetite and malnutrition and underlying pathways, thereby providing the necessary evidence to develop optimal, sustainable and evidence-based dietary and physical activity strategies to prevent malnutrition and enhance active and healthy aging. PROMISS will also deliver food concepts and products as well as persuasive technology to support adherence to these strategies. The dietary and physical activity strategies and food products will be specifically developed with older user involvement to meet the needs and fit the preferences of older consumers. In close collaboration with stakeholders, PROMISS will translate these strategies into practical recommendations to guide policy and health professionals at EU- and Member States level. Dissemination and implementation takes place through strong dissemination partners operating on an European level and linked to national networks across Member States.

Playwriting Europe: Beyond Borders?\u201d is a cooperation project among theatres, festivals and cultural organisations from 10 EU Countries (Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Romania, Austria, Belgium, UK, Poland and Czech Republic). The network aims to support and promote the contemporary playwriting across Europe, in order to reinforce and enhance the activities and strategies of the professionals and artists working in the sector and to provide them with opportunities of networking and professional development. Based on the experience of the past Fabulamundi projects, the new project will mark a difference with the previous editions, maximising the impact and the diffusion of the methodologies and activities tested in the previous years and adding new EU scale initiatives. During the 43 months of project, an ongoing promotion of EU playwriting will be run: 16 dramaturgies (200 plays and 120 playwrights) circulated; 90 plays translated and circulated in the participating Countries through 8 international Artistic Programs; 40 plays published in a foreign Country; the first edition of an EU Festival are some of the main results. An ongoing training program will be launched for 80 playwrights and for participating organizations, with a specific focus on technical skills. The Fabulamundi Audience Development strategy and the Fabulamundi training methodology for playwrights will be designed, assessed and disseminated at EU level, and  the Fabulamundi EU Network created to ensure the sustainability of the project after its end.
