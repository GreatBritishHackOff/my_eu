The school ethos fosters the development of each individual, a proper sense of self-worth, a sense of responsibility and respect for others. Our school includes a sixth form and we also have very strong links with primary schools. Therefore to take a truly whole school approach to the embedding of internationalism, we need to involve staff from KS3 to KS5.\r\n\r\nWe aim to ensure that our pupils continue to be given a broad and rich education that will support their aspirations and not just be narrowly focused. We want to open up the curriculum to allow students to experience what is taught in schools across the world and examine how we can work collaboratively with schools in other countries. We want to bring learning to life by allowing students to discuss their learning with peers in other countries and learn from each other. We need to develop links and networks to do this.\r\nOur objectives for this project are very much based on our whole school objectives and our ethos of encouraging our pupils to consider themselves to be responsible members of a community both locally and globally.\r\n\r\nThrough this project, we aim to improve the standard of teaching across our school, offering our pupils more choice and a more rounded education. We want to learn from other schools across Europe and to encourage our pupils to develop a sense of global citizenship.\r\n\r\nWe will send 10 members of staff to Spain and 6 to France on structured training courses over a period of 2 years. Our courses include intensive language learning, cultural activities, teaching methodology sessions, the opportunity to spend time in a French/Spanish school and opportunities for professional discussion with colleagues about a range of MFL issues.\r\n\r\nTeaching staff from seven different departments and one member of the SLT will take part in this project, ensuring that the effects are felt by all students, and ensuring that the project is given the importance that it deserves.\r\n\r\nThe courses will enable existing MFL staff to develop their language skills and the confidence in methodology required to teach their second MFL. Staff from other departments will have the opportunity to fully immerse themselves in the language and culture of another country and see how their subject is taught.\r\n\r\nThe spread of staff will ensure that the project is truly embedded throughout the school and upon completion of the project all staff members will have been involved.\r\n\r\nOur courses  will include;\r\n- intensive language learning,\r\n- cultural activities,\r\n- methodology sessions,\r\n- opportunity for discussion with fellow professionals about issues related to MFL,\r\n- the chance to make links with French/ Spanish schools and \r\n- for staff to spend time in these schools sharing practice and developing links.\r\n\r\nWe anticipate the impact on our successful school will be widespread and long lasting, impacting on the staff who participate, non-participating staff, pupils, parents, SLT, Governors and the wider community.\r\n\r\nThere will be a dissemination school plan that lists the stakeholders to involve, the activities and the timeframe in which the activities and information sharing will take place. We would look to disseminate to as wide as possible an audience and as much as possible in the shortest timeframe.\r\n\r\nWe will  evaluate the success of the programme against our plan in the short and long term.", "http://www.maricourt.net", "Maricourt Catholic High School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035716_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["1HW", "RQ6", "ASHWORTH HOSPITAL HEALTHCARE REGISTRY"], ["1HW", "RW4", "ASHWORTH HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "L31"}
