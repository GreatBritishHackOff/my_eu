The Parenting by Connection approach was developed in the USA and is now gaining widespread recognition all over the world. We\u2019ve successfully mentored and moderated the birth of an independent organization that in the future will exclusively harbor this approach and its related activities. Freed from the PbC undertakings our foundation has opened a new chapter launching its next development project: LifeStock\r\n\r\nLifeStock is a 13month long intensive development periode during which we aim to gather a good crew of highly skilled and motivated trainers and instructors with the purpose of realizing brand new programmes. These new elements of our portfolio should 1) effectively answer the imminenet needs of our students, 2) being innovative and appealing quckly attrackt an important number of new students, 3) by their values, content and effect complete or reinforce the foundation\u2019s original message and mission.\r\n\r\n6 members of the organisation (idependent trainers, employees and volunteers) will participate at 8 events. They all are highly skilled trainers whose expertise and personal qualities represents a genuine added value in the project. Seven of the 8 mobilities are short-term learning experiences (3 to 10 days trainings), and 1 of them job-shadowing activity of one-week lenght. After thourough planning and a relativley short preparation phase trainers will gain knowledge and skills in 3 main fields which are: nature-based prgrammes, movement-based personal development, and creative self-expression.  As a result of the learning experiences, we will widen the scope of our programmes on offer and parallel to that widen our target goup as well. The monitoring and evaluation activities are already designed to initiate the adaptation of the new learning contents and support the launch of the new programmes. All this will also contribute to our aim to create financial sustainability for our activities, by extending our sevice-based income. The project also serves our capacity building in programme coordination, data management and communication good-practices included in the job-shadowing activity.\r\n\r\nIn our best hopes the new methodologies introduced by this project can widen the circle of those who are responsible, caring, community minded, grounded and strong, and therefore make the world a better place to be.", "http://www.embercombe.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-HU01-KA104-047331_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EX6"}
