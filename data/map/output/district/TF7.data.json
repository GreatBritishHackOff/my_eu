Cultural Heritage (CH) is a typical market for SMEs because they provide specific case-by-case solutions; however at present these SMEs cannot offer suitable protection measures against graffiti on CH buildings and monuments, as anti-graffiti coatings are hard to find on the market for the type of materials found in CH. Furthermore the products used in CH must follow the strict guidelines of conservation practice. The development of specific CH anti-graffiti products has been delayed due to the conflicting requirements, high financial risk and lack of R&D infrastructures of the SMEs. Therefore, EFFACEUR is a clear opportunity for them to increase their competitiveness and economic benefit. Previously, the GRAFFITAGE project attracted much attention worldwide because of the innovative approach proposed to solve this problem, which consisted in the development of a polymeric charge complex with proven anti-graffiti behaviour suitable CH materials. The SME partners of EFFACEUR propose to use this novel formulation as the basis for a new anti-graffiti product that will satisfy this market. Thus, EFFACEUR aims at further developing, uspcaling and transferring into the market this novel protective anti-graffiti formulation. More specifically, EFFACEUR will develop a new route for upscaling the anti-graffiti marketable prototype product and will optimize it so that it is industrially viable. Initially, new routes for the upscaling of the 2 main components of the anti-graffiti formulation will be developed. Based on these 2 components, the final anti-graffiti upscaled formulation will be produced. In the laboratory, the most adequate application and cleaning method for the product will be defined, and its properties will be studied (durability, reversibility, compatibility). Finally, the anti-graffiti product will be validated in real case studies.", 263881.0, 1265529.0, "EFFACEUR", null, null, null, null, "http://www.eura.co.uk/", null, "fp7_99195_989778010"], ["4QT", "PROTECTION OF CULTURAL HERITAGE OBJECTS WITH MULTIFUNCTIONAL ADVANCED MATERIALS", "Eura Conservation Ltd", "The multidisciplinary research project will be directed towards the development of innovative environmental friendly materials with value added functions aimed to the protection of immovable Cultural Heritage assets.

The coordinated team work will be focused on the two historical objects located in urban (Serbia) and rural (Slovenia) environment, both having continental climate. The HEROMAT project investigation involves the chain of activities from the synthesis, establishment of the methodology for characterization and testing of novel protective materials through their pilot production and, finally, to the in situ application and monitoring on selected historical buildings, giving also their life cycle assessment. The outputs of this project will be a set of novel materials applicable for the protection of different inorganic mineral substrates providing multiple added functions: consolidation, self-cleaning and anti-microbial effect. The first layer will provide appropriate consolidation of the historical material, while the second layer will serve for its efficient protection. Additionally, the novel materials as a whole will possess good water vapor permeability. The connection between built-in and new materials will be realized through novel photocatalytic nanocomposites, anionic clays (layered double hydroxides) associated to TiO2 and/or other semiconductors.

In the project, teachers asked themselves how to evolve learning methods concerning literacy from a democratic perspective. As a consequence, it was decided to make some extensive changes in the organization and environment of the preschool starting in august, 2018. As a result of the former project, teachers wished to create a space for children to explore and work with their 100 languages including digital competences, focusing on the work by the preschools of Reggio Emilia. The aim of this KA1 project would therefore be to enhance the professional skills of teachers by attending courses in Reggio Emilia organized by Reggio Children in Italy, \"International Study Group\" and participating in jobshadowing. The head of the preschool, the assistant head teacher, the heads of the departments in the school also including the special need teacher and art teacher, a total of 9 teachers, would attend the course in Italy divided into two groups during the fall, 2018 and spring, 2019. In Reggio Emilia, there is also a center called: \"Loris Malaguzzi International Center\", where the participants would have the opportunity to experience digital technology in a creative setting. Furthermore 11 persons of the school staff would participate in a jobshadowing taking place in two different preschools, one in the UK and the other in Sweden, during autumn 2018 and spring 2019. Those attending the jobshadowing have experienced or expressed an interest in working with digital tools with young children and are willing to participate in eTwinning projects following the visits. Both of these school work inspired by the preschools in Reggio Emilia and have evolved digital learning in their settings.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n- To extend teachers\u2019 professionalism in working inspired by the preschools in Reggio Emilia \r\n- Developing a specialized department within the preschool promoting democratic, diverse and creative ways of learning.  \r\n- Creating an environment to emphasize working with \u201c100 languages\u201d, focusing on evolving digital literacy considering the activities, interests and creativity of the children as a guiding principle.\r\n\r\nThe project is an action research focusing on the continuing process of supporting the professional learning community that was formed within the preschool during the former Erasmus+ KA2 project. Based on pedagogical documentations, we will continue to evaluate and develop the work of our preschool also using SWOT in this process.
