Cultural Heritage (CH) is a typical market for SMEs because they provide specific case-by-case solutions; however at present these SMEs cannot offer suitable protection measures against graffiti on CH buildings and monuments, as anti-graffiti coatings are hard to find on the market for the type of materials found in CH. Furthermore the products used in CH must follow the strict guidelines of conservation practice. The development of specific CH anti-graffiti products has been delayed due to the conflicting requirements, high financial risk and lack of R&D infrastructures of the SMEs. Therefore, EFFACEUR is a clear opportunity for them to increase their competitiveness and economic benefit. Previously, the GRAFFITAGE project attracted much attention worldwide because of the innovative approach proposed to solve this problem, which consisted in the development of a polymeric charge complex with proven anti-graffiti behaviour suitable CH materials. The SME partners of EFFACEUR propose to use this novel formulation as the basis for a new anti-graffiti product that will satisfy this market. Thus, EFFACEUR aims at further developing, uspcaling and transferring into the market this novel protective anti-graffiti formulation. More specifically, EFFACEUR will develop a new route for upscaling the anti-graffiti marketable prototype product and will optimize it so that it is industrially viable. Initially, new routes for the upscaling of the 2 main components of the anti-graffiti formulation will be developed. Based on these 2 components, the final anti-graffiti upscaled formulation will be produced. In the laboratory, the most adequate application and cleaning method for the product will be defined, and its properties will be studied (durability, reversibility, compatibility). Finally, the anti-graffiti product will be validated in real case studies.", 263881.0, 1265529.0, "EFFACEUR", null, null, null, null, "http://www.eura.co.uk/", null, "fp7_99195_989778010"], ["4QT", "PROTECTION OF CULTURAL HERITAGE OBJECTS WITH MULTIFUNCTIONAL ADVANCED MATERIALS", "Eura Conservation Ltd", "The multidisciplinary research project will be directed towards the development of innovative environmental friendly materials with value added functions aimed to the protection of immovable Cultural Heritage assets. This project will cross-link an expert Pan-European team from the UK, Italy, Slovenia, Serbia and Russia, including experienced researchers and active participation of industrial partners - SME. The coordinated team work will be focused on the two historical objects located in urban (Serbia) and rural (Slovenia) environment, both having continental climate. The HEROMAT project investigation involves the chain of activities from the synthesis, establishment of the methodology for characterization and testing of novel protective materials through their pilot production and, finally, to the in situ application and monitoring on selected historical buildings, giving also their life cycle assessment. The outputs of this project will be a set of novel materials applicable for the protection of different inorganic mineral substrates providing multiple added functions: consolidation, self-cleaning and anti-microbial effect. The first layer will provide appropriate consolidation of the historical material, while the second layer will serve for its efficient protection. Additionally, the novel materials as a whole will possess good water vapor permeability. The connection between built-in and new materials will be realized through novel photocatalytic nanocomposites, anionic clays (layered double hydroxides) associated to TiO2 and/or other semiconductors. Therefore, the overall goal of the proposed project is  the improvement of the physical state as well as the resistance to degradation of the monuments sustaining the functionality and the aesthetic appearance through a long period of time.
