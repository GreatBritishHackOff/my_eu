A comparative psychosocial study of the emotional dynamics of far 'right' extremisms in Germany and Great Britain", "Bournemouth University", "This project will focus on an international comparison of the interaction of extremist groups with the general public, an area where very little research has been done despite the ambitious European targets related to the intervention of and prevention of extremism. Due to the rise of Islamist and right-wing extremism in European countries, interventions are needed urgently.  The primary objective is to analyse the psychosocial underpinnings of extremism in relation to the societies of Great Britain and Germany as a precondition to develop better means to deal with threats to democracy in the EU.\n\nWe propose the psychosocial concept of 'interactive extremism' to grasp the relationship between the extremist groups and the population in Great Britain and in Germany, especially in the emotional public sphere. This notion of interactive extremism will firstly be applied to explore the interactions between the right-wing- extremist groups and the violent jihadist movement. Secondly, it will be applied to the interactions between the right-wing-extremist groups and the so-called centre of society. In a first phase, media analysis will be applied in the field of offline and online communications of right-wing-extremist and Islamist groups. In a second phase, we will conduct 16 focus groups in Germany and in GB. To analyse the data, we will follow a psychosocial and interdisciplinary approach in order to grasp the interaction of societal and psychological processes, including emotional and unconscious processes.\n\nThis will result in mapping the psychosocial conditions under which escalation and de-escalation of extremisms are most likely to occur in order to develop counterstrategies to address extremism. We will follow a psychosocial approach in order to grasp the interaction of societal and psychological processes, including emotional and unconscious processes. Our approach is interdisciplinary, as it combines theories and methods of the disciplines of psychology, especially psychoanalysis, sociology, media studies and political science.\nWith our new approach additional insights as follows will be gained:\n\n\u2022Understanding of the extremist interactions between extremist groups and between extremist groups and the general public\n\u2022Understanding of the internationalization of extremism", 81828.0, 81828.0, "EXTREMISM", null, null, null, null, "http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk", null, "fp7_188173_999862906"], ["5BB", "Social media and resurgent ethno-nationalism in Greece", "Bournemouth University", "The role of the media in the rise of political extremism is a critical issue for European societies in the current political and economic crisis, the persistence of which seems to foster euroscepticism, nationalism and right-wing populism. Greece is a highly emblematic case in this context, since the spread of anti-European sentiment, in addition to high poverty levels and the unprecedented rise of political extremism, pose a threat to the very survival of democracy. Since the beginning of the crisis, news stories in printed and electronic media in Greece have been dominated by negative emotional connotations: rage, fear, distrust, depression. The 2012 elections came to confirm these tendencies, the most disturbing of which is the electoral result achieved by the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn. In less than three years the right-wing extremists managed to increase their vote by more than twenty times, despite their anti-parliamentarian, racist and nationalist stances and violent means of action.\nThis wave of political extremism is an important phenomenon, yet there seems to be a significant knowledge gap in the field. Perhaps the least analyzed aspect is how the influence of the media determines its course. This project brings together a talented, young political researcher, experienced in political organizations and media communication, to work with an international team of experts in media studies and sociopsychology, in a two-fold study. At a macro level, we seek to examine the way that Greek media and public debates have formed negative emotions and perceptions on how democracy works, and to decode the mechanism through which such emotional stocks might have functioned to create a political opportunity for extremists in the context of the crisis.

In the same way that introduced species can disrupt native species genetics through hybridisation, they can also disrupt highly-evolved reproductive behaviours through a complex exchange of pheromones signals in chemical complexes of similar character. Species-specific modifications to separate similar pheromone systems, and prevent a generic response, have not previously been required due to geographical isolation, whereas today these species are increasing living in sympatry in European freshwaters. Correspondingly, a dominant individual of an invasive fish that uses chemical signals to modify behaviours among subordinates could, when introduced, also affect the individual behaviours of native species. This has been discovered in the most invasive fish in Europe, topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva, which has a sexual pheromone complex that causes the total inhibition of spawning in two small-bodied, nest-guarding cyprinids from continental Europe (sunbleak Leucaspius delinateus; IUCN Red List of Threatened Species) and North America (fathead minnow Pimephales promelas).

Traditional adaptive systems engineering assumes a system ability to monitor adaptation triggers autonomously. This assumption, however, is not always possible due to limitation of technology and also to the lack of infrastructure needed to do that in certain uses of the system.\n\nExample: imagine a disaster management system which needs data about a flash flood to decide upon what rescue strategy to adopt.

AD) thought they were ancestors of the early Israelites, others suggested that their appearance should be tied to the Hurrian expansion to the Levant.

This trend is at odds with EU commitments to halt forest loss and mitigate climate change over the next 20 years.\nIn the face of such immediate and globally significant issues, there is a lack of robust scientific knowledge on how tropical deforestation and degradation affects ecosystem stability and carbon pools. There is a need to develop systems that can rapidly assess tropical forest structure and relate this to carbon stocks stored in tree biomass and to habitat quality for keystone species, like primates. Remote sensing systems, such as those available from Earth observation satellites or aircraft, can deliver data on forest structure and composition. This project will utilise innovative new methods of acquiring detailed 3-dimensional data of tropical forests at a landscape-scale, using remote sensing systems on aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), in order to model primate habitat and measure forest carbon stocks.

Europe has largely become one area of work and young people finishing their studies are eager for the opportunity to live and work around the world, to gain diverse experience and learn about new cultures that will in turn enrich their native societies.\r\nThe objectives of this mobility project are to give students at TCR the opportunity to finish part of their vocational training at companies abroad, or to study at schools in foreign countries and gain valuable experience which can\u2019t be acquired by other means. The cornerstone of vocational education is the vocational training that students receive as apprentices with various firms and companies. The situation in many vocational fields is difficult and students have had problems finding apprenticeships in Iceland. This is especially true of art and design related fields such as dressmaking, tailoring and cabinet making. Vocational training taken abroad is fully credited at TCR and great care is taken to make sure that the companies TCR students train with are fully qualified. It is important for our small nation to stay abreast of things regarding development of education and industry, and students receiving vocational training abroad return home with invaluable knowledge and experience that benefits our schools and job market. \r\nIn this mobility, six students have applied for grants to do their vocational training abroad or attend trade related courses for four to six months, with companies in Denmark, the United Kingdom and Italy (see Appendix 1).\r\nVocational studies in Iceland are not at university level but in certain trades students can complete the first year of university studies in Iceland and finish them with top-up degrees abroad. TCR emphasizes collaboration with schools in other European countries, making sure that students are informed of the possibilities of studying abroad and encouraging them to make use of the possibilities. \r\nStudents of the School of Web Development have received grants to visit KEA before, this application is for the next years\u2019 class so that they can also get to know studies at the school. The visit to KEA is integrated into a course in the final study year and is an important part of the studies. In Graphic Media Design and other planned group trips students are expected to do projects that are a part of their final grades. Lately, video presentations have gained popularity among students returning from trips and this has led to increased interest among other students.\r\nIt is important for the students of TCR to learn how study programmes for specialisations in certified trades are set up and carried out in foreign schools. In this application 74 students are applying for 14 day group study trips. It also includes application for six teachers to escort student groups. Previous trips have shown that student groups are received in a different manner when accompanied by teachers, and students have therefore requested to be accompanied by teachers, at least during the first few days while they are getting to know a new environment. In one of the groups applying, one student is in a wheelchair and the application is also for two accompanying persons for 14 days each. \r\n\r\nIt is also important for the teachers and staff of TCR to learn how study programmes for specialisations in certified trades are set up and carried out in schools abroad. Many of the schools to which visits are planned are by far larger and offer a wider range of study programs than Icelandic schools ever can. TCR is constantly looking to increase the range of study programmes to meet the needs and expectations of new students as well as the job market. Among new study programmes that have been developed at the school to this purpose are a programme in web development and design, a new study programme in technology and science for exceptional students that was set up in cooperation with Reykjavik University, and a completely restructured design programme now named the Design and Innovation programme where design and arts are intertwined with studies in traditional vocational fields. The school also offers a year-long study programme in preparation for university studies in the arts for students who have already completed a matriculation exam. By visiting schools abroad teachers and the staff of TCR acquire invaluable new knowledge and experience that contribute to the development and enhancement of the education TCR provides. \r\nThe grant application includes an application for grants to 19 members of staff for study trips ranging from 5 to 14 days.", "http://www.aub.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IS01-KA116-026468_2"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["5HH", "I4SME", "Arts University Bournemouth (AUB)", "Prov of refurbished premises,new equipment & accompanying business support offering tailored 'business journeys' to promote innovative development.
