The goal is to increment the number and success rate of initiatives that use collective awareness approaches to respond to high-impact societal challenges. To do so, the project will:- engage a large base of organizations, networks, and programs that already operate successfully in the areas of social innovation, entrepreneurship, early stage business incubation, service design, and creativity. This CHEST Community has been started with 18 important organizations already involved as  supporting partners;- create a liquid information and social deliberation platform, based on a cooperative awareness approach and implemented on top of a broad spectrum of social media, which gives voice to communities bearing interests about hard-to-solve, high-impact social problems. The platform promotes the emergence of innovative solutions and allows a transparent and collective testing and selection of social innovation experiments;- launch and manage three rounds of open calls to distribute a consistent part of our project budget (around 2,5 Million euro); these funds will be allocated with a public competition for ideas with social innovation, and measure the effectiveness of proposed responses to social problems.  This evaluation and co-funding scheme includes public assessment of proposals with  crowdfunding and crowdsourcing (for optimal combination of expert/stakeholders input).The beneficiaries of the project are individuals, companies and organizations that want social innovation projects, and need to have their original ideas field-tested by an intelligent ad hoc crowd of experts and stakeholders.", 46743.0, 3011734.0, "CHEST", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110594_953485654"], ["1FS", "SIMplifying the interaction with Public Administration Through Information technology for Citizens and cOmpanies", "Sparta Technologies Ltd", "A seamless interaction with the public administration (PA) is crucial to make the daily activities of companies and citizens more effective and efficient, saving time and money in the management of administrative processes. In particular, online public services have an enormous potential for reducing the administrative burden of companies and citizens, as well as for creating saving opportunities for the PA. This potential is however far from being fully exploited. Online services made available by the PA typically rely on standardized processes, copied from their offline counterparts and designed only from the public sector organizations\u2019 own perspective. This results in online services that fail to adapt to the specific needs of citizens and companies. \nWith SIMPATICO, we address the issues above by proposing a novel approach for the delivery of personalized online services that, combining emerging technologies for language processing and machine learning with the wisdom of the crowd, makes interactions with the PA easier, more efficient and more effective. SIMPATICO combines top-down knowledge of the PA with bottom-up contributions coming from the community. These contributions can be of different types, ranging from the qualified expertise of civil servants and professionals to problems and doubts raised by citizens and companies that find online services difficult to use.

Among them, freight carriers and shippers are interested in minimizing freight logistics costs in order to maximize their profits, while maintaining a competitive level of service to their customers. City administrators and residents are oriented towards a decrease in traffic congestion, social costs and environmental nuisances, even though they are often direct beneficiaries of high quality delivery services. This leads to a multitude of differing and possibly conflicting objectives that are involved in urban freight transport planning and decision making, yielding a high level of complexity. This provides a main motivation for the development of tools for helping decision makers to reach higher grades of efficiency. \nDespite growing academic interest, the extent to which freight transport is acknowledged and formally considered in local authority transport planning varies considerably from country to country, and on a more local level, between towns and cities. As a result, policy development with respect to urban freight and city logistics is characterised by a rather fragmented approach, with many city authorities finding it difficult to address the complex set of differing views of a large variety of stakeholders. \nThe proposed project will be aimed at identifying local authority planning needs with regards to urban/city logistics activities and the necessary pre-requisites for inclusion of stakeholders in the process.

Accessing services and resources in the cloud on-demand and in a flexible and elastic way could result in significant cost savings due to more efficient and convenient resource utilization that also replaces large investment costs with long term operational costs. On the other hand, the take up of cloud computing by SMEs and the public sector is still relatively low due to limited application-level flexibility and also security concerns. The Cloud Orchestration at the Level of Application (COLA) project aims to increase the adoption of cloud computing services by the above mentioned two strategic target communities. Typical industry and public sector applications require resource scalability and efficient resource utilization in order to serve a variable number of customers with dynamic resource demands, and to suitably optimize resource consumption and costs. However, the dynamic and intelligent utilization of cloud infrastructure resources from the perspective of cloud applications is not trivial. Although there have been several efforts to support the intelligent and coordinated deployment, and to a smaller extent also the run-time orchestration of cloud applications, no comprehensive solution has emerged until now that could be applied in large scale near operational level industry trials. The overall objective of the COLA project is that by building on and extending current research results, it will define and provide a reference implementation of a generic and pluggable framework that supports the optimal and secure deployment and run-time orchestration of cloud applications.

However, the creatives e.g. musicians, photographers, filmmakers etc. primarily face two barriers to enter this market. Firstly, they do not have a traditional CV. Their history is all about their work i.e. their projects and art but not the places where they have worked. They struggle to present their CV in the traditional way, which makes it harder for them to find work. Secondly, many persons need to collaborate in a project and only a few are recognised. When a project is uploaded to online services like SoundCloud, Vimeo etc. only the uploader gets recognition. It is only linked to their account. The people behind the scenes e.g. vocalists, editors, producers etc. remain unrecognised. Social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, Youtube, Fiverr, Behance also could not address these issues.\nTo address these problems we have developed Twine, the professional network for the creative industry, as well as a marketplace that ensures tie-up between the prospective employers and the freelance creatives. When someone publishes a project they credit all the people who contributed to it. The project is then automatically added to everyone\u2019s profile - giving everyone the corresponding recognition they deserve. This creates a network that will help all creatives to connect, gain recognition and simply build a portfolio. The main objective of Twine is to lower the market entry barrier for the creative persons, make it easier for them to collaborate with each other and at the same time facilitate the hirers to find the right set of talents.
