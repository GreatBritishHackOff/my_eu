COMPOSE will achieve this through the provisioning of an open and scalable marketplace infrastructure, in which smart objects are associated to services that can be combined, managed, and integrated in a standardised way to easily and quickly build innovative applications.The COMPOSE project builds upon existing European research projects and ongoing standardisation activities to provide a comprehensive marketplace framework that will be able to cover the whole service lifecycle by integrating a number of innovative technological enablers in a coherent way. The project will develop novel approaches for virtualising smart objects into services and for managing their interactions. This includes solutions for managing knowledge derivation, for secure and privacy-preserving data aggregation and distribution, and for dynamic service composition advertising and discovering objects' capabilities and service provisioning and monitoring.The COMPOSE project is expected to give birth to a new business ecosystem, building on the convergence of the Internet of Services with the Internet of Things and the Internet of Content. The COMPOSE marketplace will allow SMEs and innovators to introduce new Internet of Things-enabled services and applications to the market in a short time and with limited upfront investment. At the same time, COMPOSE will allow major European players in the information and communication industry, particularly cloud service providers and telecommunications companies, to reposition themselves within new Internet of Things-enabled value chains.The COMPOSE consortium comprises twelve partners, including leading ICT companies, recognised academic and research excellence centres, a standardization body, as well as pioneering SMEs in Internet of Things-based innovative services", 276169.0, 5923558.0, "COMPOSE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_105818_953090088"], ["6QL", "TagItSmart! - Smart Tags driven service platform for enabling ecosystems of connected objects", "Evrythng Limited", "TagItSmart sets out to redefine the way we think of everyday mass-market objects not normally considered as part of an IoT ecosystem. These new smarter objects will dynamically change their status in response to a variety of factors and be seamlessly tracked during their lifecycle. This will change the way users-to-things interactions are viewed.\n\nCombining the power of functional inks with the pervasiveness of digital (e.g. QR-codes) and electronic (e.g. NFC tags) markers, zillions of objects will embed cheap sensing capabilities thus being able to capture new contextual information. Beside this, the ubiquitous presence of smartphones with their cameras and NFC readers will create the perfect bridge between everyday users and their objects. This will create a completely new flow of crowdsourced information, which extracted from the objects and enriched with user data, can be exploited by new services. \n\nTagItSmart will create an open, interoperable cloud-based platform with all the tools and enabling technologies, which will address the challenges related to the lifecycle management of new innovative services capitalizing on objects \u201csensorization\u201d. TagItSmart will empower all steps involved from creating smart markers, Functional Codes (FCs), to supporting secure and reliable acquisition and consumption of such contextual data, while preserving user privacy, to the provision of generic functionalities and a service composition platform which will allow even inexperienced users to create and deploy their FCs based services while maintaining system efficiency.\n\nTo boost the platform adoption, a set of industrial use cases will be used as a baseline for development, while additional stakeholders will be engaged through a co-creation Open Call approach.
