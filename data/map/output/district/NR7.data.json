However, through overuse and misuse of these agents, many micro-organisms have developed antimicrobial resistance. Oligonucleotide therapeutics have the potential to become the new class of antibacterials capable of treating a broad range of infections. By acting on novel targets, they circumvent current resistance mechanisms and with judicious use, can suppress the rise of future resistance.\n\nDNA-TRAP will build on a platform technology that uses proprietary nucleic acid-based Transcription Factor Decoys (TFDs) that act on novel genomic targets by capturing key regulatory proteins to block essential bacterial genes and defeat infection. Taking forward newly emerging insights and expertise that exists within each of the partners and through the mutual secondment of researchers, the project aims to develop a new class of nanoparticulate antibacterials capable of meeting the clinical challenge of drug-resistant infections such as Clostridium difficile and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\nDNA-TRAP will establish a lasting, international partnership for transfer of knowledge between Industry and Academia in the field of nanomedicine. Exchange of knowledge and expertise between the partners is key to establishing the fundamental properties of nanostructured drug delivery systems to treat bacterial infections and through this, provide the basis for building a manufacturing platform to advance the experimental therapeutic into clinical trials.\n\n17 researchers in the field of drug development and delivery from 2 commercial (SME) and 2 non-commercial partners across 2 member states, will have the opportunity to share and acquire new complementary and multidisciplinary knowledge, through inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary exchange, allowing for the development of new solutions and the establishment of further joint research projects.", 311395.0, 1901826.0, "DNA-TRAP", null, null, null, null, "http://www.procartabio.com", null, "fp7_110153_972894287"], ["0LB", "Nanotherapeutics for antibiotic resistant emerging bacterial pathogens", "Procarta Biosystems Limited", "Increase in antibiotic resistance is a global concern worldwide. The project NAREB's main objective is the optimization of several nanoformulations of antibacterial therapeutics in order to improve the therapy of multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) and MRSA infections in European MDR patients.\n\nNAREB will address the problem of drug bioavailability inside the infected macrophages, transport across the bacterial cell wall, and avoidance of escape mechanisms (expressed by the pathogen). The success of the utilization of nanoparticles in the improvement of drug targeting in other diseases opens the way for novel applications in nanotechnology-based treatments aimed at controlling MDR-TB and MRSA.\n\nSpecific objectives to achieve the main goal are:\n(i) Screening of different combinations of antibiotic drugs (small chemical molecules and/or biomacromolecules - glycopeptides) with nanocarriers (lipid, polymeric, biopolymeric);\n(ii) Loading of Transcription Factor Decoys (TFDs) designed to block the expression of essential bacterial genes in compatible nanoparticle systems and their testing as novel antibacterials;\n(iii) In vitro and in vivo testing of the best therapeutic combinations in relevant experimental models and using innovative bioimaging;\n(iv) Improved formulations of multifunctional particles containing selected antibiotics and TFDs for increasing the bioavailability of active molecules in the site of infection (targeting strategy, adapted route of administration)\n(v) Assessing safety, regulatory and production (GLP/GMP) aspects in relation with the most promising nanoformulations;\n(vi) Clinical Development Plan for the preparatory work for the subsequent clinical testing of the selected nanoformulations.\n\nThe project NAREB brings together 15 partners (including 4 SMEs and 1 industry) from 8 EU Member and Associated States with outstanding complementary expertise, ranging from material engineering to molecular biology, pharmacology and medicine.", 279971.0, 10641537.0, "NAREB", null, null, null, null, "http://www.procartabio.com", null, "fp7_110860_972894287"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NR7"}
