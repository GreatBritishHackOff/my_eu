To meet the qualification needs of the labor market, it is mandatory to continuously develop the educational and care taking aspects that also have to be seen in an increasingly European context. There is an obvious need for interculturally trained educators to develop an European training understanding/ standard in the area of child and youth services. In order to face this global challenge and to proactively transform it, we need improved educational and learning processes and the willingness to innovate. The beneficiaries need skills in the area of technical and subject matter competencies, as well as social and personal competencies (\u201cIt\u201d, \u201cUs\u201d, \u201cMe\u201d) to further their personal and professional development. This includes a professional analysis of different educational systems, communication skills, the openness to deal with \u201cforeign\u201d situations in an unbiased and process oriented manner (e.g. to engage instead of immediately evaluate), willingness to learn and courage and motivation to take on the responsibility for themselves and the intercultural process.Objective:The objective of our EU internship is the development and promotion of intercultural key competencies in the vocational training of educators. The professionally trained strategies need to be applied in a foreign environment and, if needed, modified accordingly.  The students will acquire new techniques and methods of education that have been practiced in the partnering institutions. Through this process, the participants can expand on their self- competence, like social competence, as well as their factual, methodological and intercultural competence. Another important effect is the positive experience with a geographical mobility and the resulting access to wider European educational and vocational training sections.The objectives and concepts are prepared, coached and evaluated in a continuous co-operation between Erzbisch\u00f6fliches Berufskolleg and the partner institutions.Target Group:Our target groups are students to be trained towards becoming state recognized educators and health practitioners.

In 2013, a new Strategy Plan was written whose main purpose was to modernize and internationalize Vocational Training. \r\nOur landmarks can be described as follows:  \r\n-2013: a committee was created by 3 directors in order to standardize Work-Placement Training in EU.\r\n-2014: a committee was formed with 9 people and worked on the proposal for KA102 (9 mobilities, 4 partners, 3 countries) and the Erasmus Charter for Higher Education Application. Both of these projects have been APPROVED.\r\n-2015: the same committee continues. We increased our partners;  wrote the KA102 project (12 mobilities, 6 partners and 5 countries) and KA103 (10 mobilities) with 2 new English-speaking countries.  These projects were APPROVED and 9 internships successfully managed.\r\n-2016: the same committee continues. Projects KA102 and KA103 were APPROVED and 12 internships successfully managed.\r\n-2017: the same committe continues working together. We are managing 22 granted mobilities. Projects KA102 and KA103 have been written.\r\nWork-Placement Training, carried out in companies, is part of these Cycles. Traineeships carried out in the EU must have the validity as in our country since Vocational Training is an instruction assessed by competences. Thus, no additional procedure shall be required.\r\nThe main purpose of our project is that 12 students in Intermediate Vocational Training have the opportunity to carry out their traineeships in different EU countries. In our fourth incursion, we have chosen well experienced partners in mobilities, located in 4 countries: Italy, Malta, the United Kingdom and Czech Republic.\r\nWe consider our students as priority in terms of participation in Erasmus+ in order to foster interculturality, cooperation, competences and to offer experience and integration into the labour market.\r\nThus, the school will draw up a shortlist of qualified candidates in order to ensure the quality of our students\u2019 training in work placements, in a transparent and fair way, taking into account equality, their academic merits and abilities.\r\nWith the participation of our students in Erasmus+, this proposal will aim to achieve the following results:\r\n\u2022 Improving the quality and attractiveness of Vocational Education and Training.\r\n\u2022 Increasing our students\u2019 job opportunities in the international labour market.\r\n\u2022 Promoting the sense of initiative and the entrepreneurial spirit.\r\n\u2022 Strengthening linguistic, technological and cultural skills.\r\n\u2022 Increasing EU knowledge and values.\r\n\u2022 Raising enterprise\u2019s awareness and the importance of lifelong learning.\r\nRegarding the practical and logistical preparation, we can conclude with the following comments:\r\n1. Before mobility: \r\n\u2022 Our school will come to a collaboration agreement with the companies where they are going to do their placements.\r\n\u2022 Both entities will plan an individualized training program in which will appear the different abilities students must obtain during their mobility.\r\n\u2022 Our school will provide students with insurance.\r\n\u2022 Our entity will be responsible for students\u2019 flight transportation. \r\n\u2022 Our receiving partners will be responsible for arranging of accommodation, airport pick-up service and organising students\u2019 welcome week during the first week.\r\n2.

Furthermore, worryingly enough, even when action is taken, the results are often not what were hoped for; institutions often complain that, in spite of all their efforts, few young people become involved and the returns on the investment are minimal. This project aims at bringing together 26 youth workers, municipality officers, migrant youth and young people with migrant background and youth leaders, from 11 European countries to: \r\n- Empower CSO and local authorities to better involve young people with migrant background in their programmes;\r\n- Improve local and regional integration policies and the competences of local stakeholders to work together (multi stakeholders and cross sectoral initiatives) and with migrants in developing new programmes;\r\n- Support the integration and the development of a sense of belonging of young migrants in their host communities; \r\n- Increase the involvement of all sectors, including the private one, in migrant youth integration.\r\n\r\nIn the framework of the 2015 Declaration on promoting citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education (\"the Paris Declaration\") and of the Declaration of the 2nd Youth Work Convention, this project aims at addressing the current gap of participation of migrant youth and young people with migrant background by supporting local authorities and institutions in working with and for them, by offering them the tools and competences needed to involve young migrants in the decision making process. \r\n\r\nIn agreement with the renewed framework for European cooperation in the youth field (2010-2018) and the Erasmus+ Programme priorities and putting into action the funding principles of the European Union (TEU, art 2 and 165) and these two declaration, using non-Formal Learning Methodologies, participants will address and seek answers for questions like:\r\n- how can institutions better respond to the need of young migrants?\r\n- How can they better shape their initiatives to offer real scope for them to become actors and to take decisions, thus concretely encouraging their participation? \r\n- are they prepared for the possibility of young people changing the old script?\r\n- Which support should come from civil society and youth workers to support both parties? \r\n- which actions are required by local authorities and CSO to reduce socio-political disadvantages of migrant youth and young people with migrant backgrounds?\r\n- which competences and methods do local authorities and youth organizations need to better reach out to marginalized young people and preventing their violent radicalization?\r\n\r\nGiving spaces of participations to young migrants in Europe, does not mean listening to their own voices but also to the entire world of institutions, civil society organizations, private associations, ... working with and for them.", "http://www.ubele.org", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE02-KA105-002132_7"], ["8AA", "Local Youth Policies on Social Entrepreneurship", "THE UBELE INITIATIVE", 32217.0, "Local Youth Policies on Social Entrepreneurship is a 17 months staff mobility project offering two\r\ninterconnected transnational activities to support the development of competencies of youth workers for supporting youngsters in starting their own business with a particular focus on youth work with young migrants.

However, youth often express that they need to improve their skills and capacities so that their projects can have long-lasting impacts.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIM & ACTIVITIES\r\nThe Youth Changemakers Training2: Learning and Sharing for Ecological Sustainability, Community Resiliency and Personal Agency (YCT2) responds directly to the youth demands expressed above. As such, the aim of this project is:\r\n\r\nTo increase the capacities of youth to effect long-lasting social and ecological change in their\r\ncommunities and internationally.\r\n\r\nThe YCT2 is specifically designed for 16 youth from 7 different EU and Mediterranean countries who are actively involved in and/or deeply committed to social and ecological change initiatives. Special attention will be paid to ensuring the participation of disadvantaged youth who meet this criteria.\r\n\r\nThe three learning activities and one ongoing learning activity of YCT2 are:\r\n1. Preparation Phase: Online learning modules\r\n2. Main Activity: One-month bilingual participatory training\r\n3. Follow-Up Phase: Local community presentation and engagement\r\n4. Ongoing activity: Learner-centred monitoring and evaluation\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOUR MODULES & OBJECTIVES\r\nThe four specific dimensions and the overall training will be certified by five separate organisations. The details of each certified dimension are:\r\n\r\n1. Facilitation & Community Engagement, 60 hrs\r\n\u00b7 To harness soft skills in community building and advocacy.\r\n\r\n2. Indigenous & Systems Worldview, 44 hrs\r\n\u00b7 To deepen the understanding and appreciation of holistic and sustainable worldviews.\r\n\r\n3. Alternative Economies, 44 hrs\r\n\u00b7 To explore the creation of alternative economies and alternative currencies.\r\n\r\n4. Permaculture Design, 76 hrs\r\n\u00b7 To develop hard skills and foundational knowledge about environmental sustainability.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon completion, participants will receive three recognized national and international certificates such as Intercultural Dialogue (Uniterra Catalunya), Design in Permaculture (Resilience.Earth SCCL) and Transition and Community Resilience (Transition Towns Network).\r\n\r\n\r\nINNOVATIVE METHODOLOGIES\r\n1. Transformative Teaching Methodology (TTM)\r\nTrainers will use TTM because it is a very effective teaching & empowerment methodology when working with youth. TTM includes techniques such as popular education, group problem solving, cooperative games & mind-mapping.\r\n\r\n2. Innovative Project Planning & Management\r\nExpert trainers & practioners will teach participants how to innovatively design & execute projects.\r\n\r\n3. Systemic Transnational Networking\r\nYouth participants & partner organisations will be engaged in multiple networking activities that are theme-based & goal-oriented.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPECTED IMPACTS\r\n- Youth leaders have a greater capacity to effect long-lasting social and ecological change in their communities.\r\n- Trainers draw ideas and inspiration from existing social & ecological change initiatives from across Europe and the Mediterranean.\r\n- Resilience.Earth ad partner organisations are more inspired and empowered to continue engaging and leading transnational initiatives for social and ecological change.\r\n- Resilience.Earth and partners new to ERASMUS+ have more knowledge and experience about mobility opportunities offered by the programme and can impulse new projects in the future.\r\n- Stakeholder certification entities have a greater understanding of collaborative certification trainings.\r\n- Local and regional communities experience a growth in social and ecological change work.\r\n- National and international communities increase their awareness of social and ecological issues and solutions", "http://www.ubele.org", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES02-KA105-011006_5"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["9LJ", "THE MIGRANTS' RESOURCE CENTRE", 84884.0, "Third programme for the Union\u2019s action in the field of health (2014-2020) (17.03.01)", "fts_2017_22596", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "N17"}
