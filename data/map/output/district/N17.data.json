We want participants to apply the skills and knowledge they learn through this project in order to provide children with the best approaches to learning.\r\n\r\nOur agreed objectives are to develop children\u2019s curiosity and provide a research based curriculum based on the Reggio Emilia approach indoors and  the Forest School Approach outdoors . We want children and staff to co-research and learn together to plan and develop their own learning which will lead to deeper, more effective learning and critical thinking experiences. Staff are beginning to use a variety of techniques with the children to support sustained shared thinking including \u2018Talking and Thinking\u2019 Books and we want to develop this further. We also want to use more natural materials, loose parts, transient art, and a range of provocations to achieve this.

This way, we hope there will be a personal, academic and professional enrichment.\r\n\u00b7 We have requested 4 mobilities for students to perform the full period of their FCT in companies in the UK and Czech Republic . As noted above, these candidates will have to demonstrate their high academic achievement, a good level of English (and willingness to learn Czech) and certain personal skills that enable them to successfully develop such mobilities.\r\n\u00b7 Pre-mobility activities will deal with linguistic preparation of candidates. During their stay abroad, activities will be designed according to their training program and the needs of the company. In these activities, online language support (OLS) provided by the Erasmus + program is also included.\r\n\u00b7 Regarding the methodology, things like the profile of both the student and the company in which they will develop their mobility will be considered without losing sight of the goal of interacting in countries of our European environment and improving their linguistic and professional skills.\r\n\u00b7 In the short term, the the main result is obtaining the Technician title for the Vocational Training Course  which they are studying, thereby improving their Curriculum Vitae. In addition, we expect an improvement of their skills in English,  this being the language mainly used in any European context when peorple from different countries speak. Also, in the long-term, these\r\nmobilities revert positively in improving our teaching practices in our schooll and bring new professional ideas applicable to our professional area. The bonds created with companies in the UK and Czech Republic will help us develop future projects within the Erasmus+ program.\r\nAs for the staff mobilities for training, 2 mobilities have been requested for two colleagues of the Professional Family of Mechanical Manufacturing. The objective of these two mobilities is to know the methodology of their subjects in a foreign country.

The school teaches in 3 different levels of education. In 2015, it was awarded by the Management System with the European Seal of Excellence 500+ points. In 2013, a new Strategy Plan was written whose main purpose was to modernize and internationalize Vocational Training. \r\nOur landmarks can be described as follows:  \r\n-2013: a committee was created by 3 directors in order to standardize Work-Placement Training in EU.\r\n-2014: a committee was formed with 9 people and worked on the proposal for KA102 (9 mobilities, 4 partners, 3 countries) and the Erasmus Charter for Higher Education Application. Both of these projects have been APPROVED.\r\n-2015: the same committee continues. We increased our partners;  wrote the KA102 project (12 mobilities, 6 partners and 5 countries) and KA103 (10 mobilities) with 2 new English-speaking countries.  These projects were APPROVED and 9 internships successfully managed.\r\n-2016: the same committee continues. Projects KA102 and KA103 were APPROVED and 12 internships successfully managed.\r\n-2017: the same committe continues working together. We are managing 22 granted mobilities. Projects KA102 and KA103 have been written.\r\nWork-Placement Training, carried out in companies, is part of these Cycles. Traineeships carried out in the EU must have the validity as in our country since Vocational Training is an instruction assessed by competences. Thus, no additional procedure shall be required.\r\nThe main purpose of our project is that 12 students in Intermediate Vocational Training have the opportunity to carry out their traineeships in different EU countries. In our fourth incursion, we have chosen well experienced partners in mobilities, located in 4 countries: Italy, Malta, the United Kingdom and Czech Republic.\r\nWe consider our students as priority in terms of participation in Erasmus+ in order to foster interculturality, cooperation, competences and to offer experience and integration into the labour market.\r\nThus, the school will draw up a shortlist of qualified candidates in order to ensure the quality of our students\u2019 training in work placements, in a transparent and fair way, taking into account equality, their academic merits and abilities.\r\nWith the participation of our students in Erasmus+, this proposal will aim to achieve the following results:\r\n\u2022 Improving the quality and attractiveness of Vocational Education and Training.\r\n\u2022 Increasing our students\u2019 job opportunities in the international labour market.\r\n\u2022 Promoting the sense of initiative and the entrepreneurial spirit.\r\n\u2022 Strengthening linguistic, technological and cultural skills.\r\n\u2022 Increasing EU knowledge and values.\r\n\u2022 Raising enterprise\u2019s awareness and the importance of lifelong learning.\r\nRegarding the practical and logistical preparation, we can conclude with the following comments:\r\n1. Before mobility: \r\n\u2022 Our school will come to a collaboration agreement with the companies where they are going to do their placements.\r\n\u2022 Both entities will plan an individualized training program in which will appear the different abilities students must obtain during their mobility.\r\n\u2022 Our school will provide students with insurance.\r\n\u2022 Our entity will be responsible for students\u2019 flight transportation. \r\n\u2022 Our receiving partners will be responsible for arranging of accommodation, airport pick-up service and organising students\u2019 welcome week during the first week.\r\n2. During mobility:\r\n\u2022 Our school and our partners will keep a smoothly flowing communication that will allow a constant exchange of opinions among the school tutor, the students and the school tutor of the hosting organisation by different means of communication.\r\n\u2022 The sending student must upload a file weekly in which will appear all the activities done by the student and signed by the student\u2019s tutor in the receiving company.\r\na)  Pre-preparation stage (Dec 16-Jan 17)\r\nb)  Communication stage at all the members of the school community (Feb 17-Oct17)\r\nc)   Selection process stage (Nov17)\r\nd)   Preparation of students stage (Dec17-Mar18)\r\ne)   Training stage in European countries (Apr-Jun 18)\r\nf)    Assessment stage (Apr-Jul 18)\r\ng)   Dissemination of results stage (Jan17-Dec 18)\r\n3. After mobility:\r\n\u2022 Once training in work placements is completed, the company will send a certificate in which our student\u2019s development in the company will be assessed.\r\n\u2022 Once the student\u2019s tutor receives the documentation provided by the hosting organisation, he/she will assess the activities carried out by the student in the work placement according to the assessment tool Europass\r\nThe dissemination of the results of the actions undertaken within the project will be published in different resources such as our school\u2019s website and blog, Plataforma Valor and social networks.

The training courses offered all develop skills, commitment to, and the know-how for life-long learning. Courses provide new frameworks and skills to create social inclusion and active citizenship in order to increase the employability and competitiveness of our most disadvantaged groups, including asylum-seekers and refugees. These courses open up access to learning opportunities that are not usually available to the Black and Minority Ethnic community organisations from which the majority of participants will be drawn.\r\n\r\nThe project will be delivered by a consortium of 4 organisations who came together in 2016-17 to design and deliver a KA1 Adult Education programme called 'Creating resilient communities through social leadership'. The European Summer School will provide 6 learning programmes, in Germany and the Netherlands, for 86 participants from a range of UK-based community organisations.  Participants will be drawn from our 4 consortium organisations as well as from the beneficiary community groups and organisations we work with. \r\n\r\nThe lead partner is The Ubele Initiative (TUI).  TUI is a not for profit, community led organisation with a mission to contribute to the sustainability of the African Diaspora community.  Through social leadership development, community enterprise, training and social action, TUI supports diverse grass-roots projects and organisations across the UK.

Staff and volunteers who participate in this project will acquire new knowledge and develop skills in  social leadership development, Change Lab methodology, Systems Thinking and Black empowerment.\r\n\r\nWe wish to build on our 2016-2017 Erasmus + KA1 Adult Education programme through introducing social leadership and change management frameworks to a different cohort of individuals and organisations.  The aim is to develop their personal and professional insight, knowledge and skills to be utilised for the benefit of the communities they work with. We are also offering development courses for our more experienced consortium and beneficiary staff. These courses will extend their knowledge, skills and capacity to synthesise multiple frameworks and to more effectively lead change and sustainability. \r\n\r\nOur consortium will expand capacity, in the UK, Europe and internationally, to develop new initiatives and partnerships. This will lead to positive community, economic and social growth. This project will ultimately enable us to create a large cohort of skilled social change facilitators working across marginalised communities in the UK.
