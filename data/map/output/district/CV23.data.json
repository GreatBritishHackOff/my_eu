INSARD partners regard agricultural research and development (ARD) as a process of innovation involving different participants making complementary inputs to produce research results that contribute to development. In this process, farmers do not merely receive new knowledge from research; they are involved in generating it. Smallholders and NGOs are already doing applied and adaptive research to answer questions to which formal research is not giving enough attention, e.g. how to improve local marketing systems. In bridging the gap and bringing smallholders and researchers into joint research on questions central to smallholders\u2019 concerns, civil-society organisations (CSOs) in the South and the North can play a vital role.\nThe main aim of INSARD is to ensure the informed participation of a broad range of European and African CSOs in formulating and implementing ARD. It will do so by:\n1) Designing a structure for coordination and communication between European and African CSOs involved in ARD and in influencing ARD policy and practice\n2) Identifying CSOs\u2019 research priorities and a strategy to communicate these to other actors in ARD\n3) Facilitating joint definition of specific research examples by CSOs and researchers, based on the smallholders\u2019 priorities\n4) Engaging in policy dialogue with key African and European research organisations and donors.\nThe project will build up a more transparent system for CSOs to provide well-founded inputs and positions in the ARD agenda and its implementation, so that smallholders are central to publicly funded ARD. It will help make research more relevant for small-scale family farmers, including livestock-keepers. It will seek to achieve its aim by building on existing initiatives and networks in Europe and Africa that involve CSOs promoting smallholder-centred ARD.", 11513.0, 509788.0, "INSARD", null, null, null, null, "http://www.practicalaction.org.uk", null, "fp7_97295_987308002"], ["9QZ", "Uptake of Climate related Research Results through Knowledge Platforms with African Collaboration Partners", "Practical Action", "The main aim of the AfriCAN Climate project is the development, operation and promotion of a web-based Knowledge Platform for efficient dissemination of climate change research results and good practices, to encourage users for uptake of success stories and research knowledge in new projects. Thereby, the project will contribute to mitigate climate change impacts on African regions and help communities to adapt to the changing climatic conditions.\nEmphasis will be placed on a variety of innovative and creative web functionalities (\u201ce-tools\u201d) when developing the interactive, multimedia, pan-continental, multi-lingual and interdisciplinary AfriCAN Climate Platform. The new platform visitors, the already registered users and the members of the online communities will be facilitated by the editorial team to actively participate in knowledge exchange and uptake of research results. The high profile consortium includes a large variety of experienced EU and African organizations, corresponding to the diversity of target audience addressed by the call. The experts in the consortium achieve full thematic, linguistic and geographical coverage to serve the African continent\u2019s climate change knowledge needs. They will jointly build and continuously update a knowledgebase to feed the platform. Country fact sheets on climate change impacts will be developed for all 54 African countries.\nStrategic networking meetings with information multipliers and FP7 National Contact Points will be held on a regular base to encourage them to become active on the Platform by building climate change interest communities, or joining existing communities. On a yearly base, large promotional events will be organized, hosting the AfriCAN Climate Music/Art and Good Practice Award. Technical tours to good practice sites and workshops on uptake of lessons learn in good practice projects and financing will complement the networking activities and improve South-South Cooperation amongst African regions.", 53261.0, 1054354.0, "AfriCAN Climate", "A web-based solution to climate change", "EU funding has helped to establish an online platform for all things climate related in Africa to improve translation of research into action.", "Extreme weather and unpredictable climate patterns have dire consequences for Africans who rely on land, lakes and seas for food and income. In facing these challenges, it is vital that communities have access to the latest scientific knowledge and technologies in the field of climate change mitigation.\n\nIn line with this need, the EU-funded http://www.africanclimate.net (AFRICAN CLIMATE) (Uptake of climate related research results through knowledge platforms with African collaboration partners) project was established. It has launched a dynamic web portal that brings together an active network of African and European researchers as well as communication experts.\n\nThe portal covers five main topics: research, policy, financing, good practice and country-specific information. It is also multilingual and interactive, and is regularly updated with news, events, links and practical tools.\n\nVideos and images featuring the faces behind good practice in climate change adaptation and mitigation in Africa have been uploaded as well. This multimedia approach also includes fact sheets detailing the current and projected impacts of climate change on each of the continent's 54 countries.\n\nAnother major component of the portal is a number of case studies demonstrating good practice in climate mitigation. Researchers stringently assessed these against pre-established criteria before adding them to the portal.\n\nThe AFRICAN CLIMATE portal is intended to serve as a knowledge hub and point of contact for researchers, project developers and policymakers. It should facilitate an increased uptake of research results, broader cooperation and awareness, and scaling up of already successful initiatives.", null, "http://www.practicalaction.org.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/160922.jpg", "fp7_101025_987308002"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["9QZ", "PRACTICAL ACTION LBG*", 2922790.0, "Cooperation with developing countries in Asia, including Central Asia and the Middle East  (21.02.51.03)", "fts_2016_10820", 2016], ["9QZ", "PRACTICAL ACTION LBG*", 324738.0, "Disaster prevention, disaster risk reduction and preparedness (23.02.02)", "fts_2016_32854", 2016], ["9QZ", "PRACTICAL ACTION LBG*", 246183.0, "Disaster prevention, disaster risk reduction and preparedness (23.02.02)", "fts_2016_35666", 2016], ["9QZ", "PRACTICAL ACTION LBG*", 919973.0, "Civil society in development (21.02.08.01)", "fts_2017_22967", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "CV23"}
