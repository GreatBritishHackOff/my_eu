We have to underline that such a program couldn\u2019t be achieved without the help of Europe\r\n\r\nThe objectives respect the recommendations of the EU commission, our decision to offer that chance to the students and staff meets the professional needs of the participants but also their EU recommendations. The content of the working program has been agreed on by all the partners and they are committed to respect the stages of the project. These stages will imply a vast panel of people\r\nThe role of each partner is perfectly clear. The GIPAL carries the project. The Rectorat manages the project. It has a long experience of the programme and it will support the vocational schools all along the project. The piloting committee is in charge of developing the project, insuring the follow-up, the management and the evaluation of the project. The latter also has to check the financial balance and controls that the various actors meet their commitments. The sending organizations will respect the terms of the mobility program of the consortium. They are in charge of the monitoring and evaluation of the participants\r\n\r\nThe young people will be more efficient on the job market, they will enrich their professional, cultural and linguistic skills, they will see Europe differently, they will improve their skills in ICT, they will be more autonomous, become aware of the similarities and differences of the working methods, prove their ability to adapt and integrate into a new environment, get the Europass, the Europro and the opportunity to get a bonus for their baccalaureate. The schools will develop a network of training organizations, a partnership \u201ccompany-school\u201d at the European level, exchange innovative practices and give a new image to vocational schools. They\u2019ll get the accreditation for quality award Label Lyc\u00e9e des M\u00e9tiers, increase the attractivity of their schools, decrease the rate of school-leaving pupils. Expected impact: renewal and sustainability of the project in 2019. The staff will improve their professional skills, enrich their educational practices, exchange skills and discover other education systems. Expected impact: improvement of the professional, practical and theoretical skills. For the learners, it will be an undeniable professional added value which will be transformed into assets on the job market and it will offer career developments to the staffs involved in the project\r\n\r\nThese impacts are tangible and easily measurable. All the partners will be asked to transmit and promote the Erasmus program in addition to proceed at the global evaluation of this program. This evaluation will aim to analyse positive and/or negative points and allow to adjust our practices for next projects.
