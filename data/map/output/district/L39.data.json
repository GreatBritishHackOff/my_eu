The platform will be structured for data acquisition from monitoring devices and forecasting tools, data interpretation, system control, and evaluation mechanisms enabling full decision support for end users at farm scale. These tools will be integrated with multiple state-of-the-art irrigation technologies and strategies as well as newly adapted devices leading to further increased water productivity. The flexibility, cost-effectiveness, ease of use, minimal maintenance of the system and often, increases in crop yield, will boost its acceptance and up-take by the end-users (the farmers, extension workers). In addition, as added value the system will enable reduction of fertilizer use, further supporting sustainable use of natural resources and adaptation of agricultural practice to climate change. To achieve this, the FIGARO project will develop a holistic and structured precision irrigation platform which will offer farmers flexible, crop-tailored irrigation scheduling protocols for their specific fields taking into account spatial variability management.", 60545.0, 6385288.0, "FIGARO", "Irrigation goes hi-tech", "Agriculture uses enormous amounts of water. EU-funded engineers have developed a state-of-the-art irrigation platform to accurately manage the quantity of water used and promote sustainable farming.", "The 'Flexible and precise irrigation platform to improve farm scale water productivity' (http://www.figaro-irrigation.net (FIGARO)) project addresses the use of fresh water on farmland. The aim of the project is the implementation of an irrigation management platform based on newly developed precision technologies. Field testing is now underway in Bulgaria, Denmark, Greece, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.\n\nA number of existing software and hardware tools are integrated into the FIGARO platform to provide a farm-level decision support system for growers, technicians and water managers. The prototype platform components include a sophisticated decision support programme, a crop growth model, plant and soil sensors, data from satellite analysis and forecasting algorithms.\n\nThe platform structure is designed to integrate any type of sensing technique and management model, allowing it to expand its functions. Therefore, the platform can utilise models' sensing systems and networks calibrated to local conditions. Upcoming technologies such as robotic and mechatronic sensors can also be easily integrated into the platform.\n\nEnvironmental and crop growth data are collected and fed into state-of-the-art agronomic models while cross checking data from a variety of sources. The result is accurate, precise and reliable recommendations for how and when farmers should irrigate their crops.\n\nFIGARO gives policymakers an effective tool for monitoring and managing agricultural practices like irrigation, fertiliser application, and the use of saline or brackish water. The platform therefore allows decision makers to administer natural resources such as water and energy more effectively.\n\nFood industry companies buying agricultural produce grown using the FIGARO system will reduce their environmental impacts. It will also be easier for them to comply with environmental regulations. They will also be able to use the label stating 'Environmentally friendly farming practices used in our products lowered water footprint'.\n\nThe platform's flexibility, ease of use and minimal maintenance will help to ensure its widespread uptake and use by end users. It will help to reduce water and fertiliser use while optimising energy consumption across farms. It will also help to adapt farming practices to climate change and enable farmers to comply with national, EU and international regulations and standards.", "http://www.figaro-irrigation.net/", "http://www.edenirrigation.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/147603.jpg", "fp7_105374_953873169"], ["4QP", "Polyglot and Hybrid Persistence Architectures for Big Data Analytics", "Edge Hill University", "The need for levels of availability and scalability beyond those supported by relational databases has led to the emergence of a new generation of purpose-specific databases grouped under the term NoSQL. In general, NoSQL databases are designed with horizontal scalability as a primary concern and deliver increased availability and fault-tolerance at a cost of temporary inconsistency and reduced durability of data. To balance the requirements for data consistency and availability, organisations increasingly migrate towards hybrid data persistence architectures comprising both relational and NoSQL databases. The consensus is that this trend will only become stronger in the future; critical data will continue to be stored in ACID (predominately relational) databases while non-critical data will be progressively migrated to high-availability NoSQL databases. Moreover, as the volume and the value of natural language content constantly grows, built-in support for sophisticated text processing in data persistence architectures is increasingly becoming essential.\n\nThe aim of TYPHON is to provide a methodology and an integrated technical offering for designing, developing, querying and evolving scalable architectures for persistence, analytics and monitoring of large volumes of hybrid (relational, graph-based, document-based, natural language etc.) data.

However, the use of OSS also comes at enormous cost: choosing among OSS projects and maintaining dependence on continuously changing software requires a large investment. Deciding if an OSS project meets the required standards for adoption is hard, and keeping up-to-date with an evolving project is even harder. It involves analysing code, documentation, online discussions, and issue trackers. There is too much information to process manually and it is common that uninformed decisions have to be made with detrimental effects.\n\nCROSSMINER remedies this by automatically extracting the required knowledge and injecting it into the IDE of the developers, at the time they need it to make their design decisions. This allows them to reduce their effort in knowledge acquisition and to increase the quality of their code. CROSSMINER uniquely combines advanced software project analyses with online monitoring in the IDE. The developer will be monitored to infer which information is timely, based on readily available knowledge stored earlier by a set of advanced offline deep analyses of related OSS projects. \n\nTo achieve this timely and ambitious goal, CROSSMINER combines six end-user partners (in the domains of IoT, multi-sector IT services, API co-evolution, software analytics, software quality assurance, and OSS forges), along with R&D partners that have a long track-record in conducting cutting-edge research on large-scale software analytics, natural language processing, reverse engineering of software components, model-driven engineering, and delivering results in the form of widely-used, sustainable and industrial-strength OSS.

It motivates, entertains and highly influences our mood. Various researches have also shown the benefits of Music in the teaching-learning process, as it was already posed by Plato or Aristotle, one of the forerunners of integral music education. Today, the influence of Music on people\u2019s mood and health is getting more and more reckoned as musical therapy is spreading. Due to the tight link between Music and Emotions, the suitable use of such resource might contribute to a positive emotional environment within the classroom, which would be ideal for learning purposes.\r\n\r\nOur school is a Secondary school which runs a project on bilingualism. Therefore, we feel the need to innovate our methodology as well as to improve the linguistic competences of part of our teachers. So, we suggest here analysing the use of Music as a methodological tool for the learning-teaching of English oral expression.\r\n\r\nOur main aims in this project are to integrate Music as a methodological resource in the school as well as to improve the oral skills of both pupils and teachers so that the communication in the classroom improves itself, and to strengthen our project on bilingualism. The use of new technologies as a means to reach our aims above and the study on body language as a tool in TFL through Music will be sought. All this will be done to eventually gain the growth of the school and the cultural dimension of an integrated Europe.\r\n\r\nNine teachers from four different departments will take part in the project. Two of them will follow courses on methodology, four teachers will participate in job shadowing in experienced schools and two teachers will take English courses to enable them reach competence enough to join the bilingual project. After the training process, the members in the project will eventually put the acquired knowledge into practice through the subjects they teach. Among other activities, didactic units will be developed, which will deal with the suprasegmental features in English through music. They will be put in practice on teachers first, then on pupils. A series of activities and a repertoire of songs \u2013the bases to work on both musical and linguistic grounds, will be collected. Also, two choreographies with a medley of songs as musical base will be developed. Finally, a comparative study on pronunciation will be rendered based on the audio sample and free software as a tool.\r\n\r\nAmong the long run benefits, the inclusion of music in daily life at school will help the teachers and pupils enjoy such a motivating and attractive element as part of several subjects. The departments will include such methodological principles in their plans and they will enjoy both the material and the methodological resources produced within the project. It will help the school bilingual project to consolidate and spread thanks to the participation of new coming teachers, which will result in the enhancing of the quality in education. It will also improve the teachers and pupils\u2019 communicative skills in English. The school itself as an institution will benefit from all the above as well as from the chance of getting more visible and prestigious to local, national and even European stands. Eventually, other schools, teachers and departments in administration will enjoy the results thanks to the project broadcasting.\r\n\r\nFor broadcasting\u2019s sake, we suggest the creation of a logo, posters, a summary video, brochures, as well as the use of online media such as web pages, social networks, Erasmus+ platform, the translation of materials and informative meetings to other schools about the project results.\r\n\r\nFinally, the transparency, diligence and efficacy of the project will be granted by means of a thorough assessment which will look into every project activity and result. Every mobility will be assessed by means of travel diaries, reports or Skype chats, whose results will be taken into account through language assessment or by checking the fulfilment of the setup strategies. The use of such tools and European certificates as the advisory documents rendered by ECVET, Europass or the Language European Passport will be of great help and support. \r\n\r\nWe hope this project helps both teachers and pupils find a new incentive in their daily lives at school, and both English and Music reveal as languages for communication and enjoyment", "http://  www.edgehill.ac.uk  ", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA101-015268_2"], ["4QP", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "EDGE HILL UNIVERSITY", 62144.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://  www.edgehill.ac.uk  ", "EDGE HILL UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-012701_coordinator"], ["4QP", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "EDGE HILL UNIVERSITY", 46279.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://  www.edgehill.ac.uk  ", "EDGE HILL UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA103-023619_coordinator"], ["4QP", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "EDGE HILL UNIVERSITY", 71119.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://  www.edgehill.ac.uk  ", "EDGE HILL UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035466_coordinator"], ["4QP", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "EDGE HILL UNIVERSITY", 94804.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://  www.edgehill.ac.uk  ", "EDGE HILL UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-046832_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["4QP", "Productivity and Innovation Centre", "Edge Hill University", "The Productivity and Innovation Centre is based on delivering an output driven programme of intensive workshops, with accompanying support from academic subject experts, which take SMEs through a rapid innovation process to achieve two outcomes:\n\n1.
