The platform will be structured for data acquisition from monitoring devices and forecasting tools, data interpretation, system control, and evaluation mechanisms enabling full decision support for end users at farm scale. These tools will be integrated with multiple state-of-the-art irrigation technologies and strategies as well as newly adapted devices leading to further increased water productivity. The flexibility, cost-effectiveness, ease of use, minimal maintenance of the system and often, increases in crop yield, will boost its acceptance and up-take by the end-users (the farmers, extension workers). In addition, as added value the system will enable reduction of fertilizer use, further supporting sustainable use of natural resources and adaptation of agricultural practice to climate change. To achieve this, the FIGARO project will develop a holistic and structured precision irrigation platform which will offer farmers flexible, crop-tailored irrigation scheduling protocols for their specific fields taking into account spatial variability management.", 60545.0, 6385288.0, "FIGARO", "Irrigation goes hi-tech", "Agriculture uses enormous amounts of water. EU-funded engineers have developed a state-of-the-art irrigation platform to accurately manage the quantity of water used and promote sustainable farming.", "The 'Flexible and precise irrigation platform to improve farm scale water productivity' (http://www.figaro-irrigation.net (FIGARO)) project addresses the use of fresh water on farmland. The aim of the project is the implementation of an irrigation management platform based on newly developed precision technologies. Field testing is now underway in Bulgaria, Denmark, Greece, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.\n\nA number of existing software and hardware tools are integrated into the FIGARO platform to provide a farm-level decision support system for growers, technicians and water managers. The prototype platform components include a sophisticated decision support programme, a crop growth model, plant and soil sensors, data from satellite analysis and forecasting algorithms.\n\nThe platform structure is designed to integrate any type of sensing technique and management model, allowing it to expand its functions. Therefore, the platform can utilise models' sensing systems and networks calibrated to local conditions. Upcoming technologies such as robotic and mechatronic sensors can also be easily integrated into the platform.\n\nEnvironmental and crop growth data are collected and fed into state-of-the-art agronomic models while cross checking data from a variety of sources. The result is accurate, precise and reliable recommendations for how and when farmers should irrigate their crops.\n\nFIGARO gives policymakers an effective tool for monitoring and managing agricultural practices like irrigation, fertiliser application, and the use of saline or brackish water. The platform therefore allows decision makers to administer natural resources such as water and energy more effectively.\n\nFood industry companies buying agricultural produce grown using the FIGARO system will reduce their environmental impacts. It will also be easier for them to comply with environmental regulations. They will also be able to use the label stating 'Environmentally friendly farming practices used in our products lowered water footprint'.\n\nThe platform's flexibility, ease of use and minimal maintenance will help to ensure its widespread uptake and use by end users. It will help to reduce water and fertiliser use while optimising energy consumption across farms. It will also help to adapt farming practices to climate change and enable farmers to comply with national, EU and international regulations and standards.", "http://www.figaro-irrigation.net/", "http://www.edenirrigation.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/147603.jpg", "fp7_105374_953873169"], ["4QP", "Polyglot and Hybrid Persistence Architectures for Big Data Analytics", "Edge Hill University", "The need for levels of availability and scalability beyond those supported by relational databases has led to the emergence of a new generation of purpose-specific databases grouped under the term NoSQL. In general, NoSQL databases are designed with horizontal scalability as a primary concern and deliver increased availability and fault-tolerance at a cost of temporary inconsistency and reduced durability of data. To balance the requirements for data consistency and availability, organisations increasingly migrate towards hybrid data persistence architectures comprising both relational and NoSQL databases. The consensus is that this trend will only become stronger in the future; critical data will continue to be stored in ACID (predominately relational) databases while non-critical data will be progressively migrated to high-availability NoSQL databases. Moreover, as the volume and the value of natural language content constantly grows, built-in support for sophisticated text processing in data persistence architectures is increasingly becoming essential.\n\nThe aim of TYPHON is to provide a methodology and an integrated technical offering for designing, developing, querying and evolving scalable architectures for persistence, analytics and monitoring of large volumes of hybrid (relational, graph-based, document-based, natural language etc.) data. TYPHON brings together research partners with a long track record of conducting internationally-leading research on software modelling, domain-specific languages, text mining and data migration, and of delivering research results in the form of robust and widely-used open-source software, industrial partners active in the automotive, earth observation, banking, and motorway operation domains, an industrial advisory board of world-class experts in the fields of databases, business intelligence and analytics, and large-scale data management, and a global consortium including more than 400 organisations from all sectors of IT.", 412606.0, 3925035.0, "TYPHON", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_214253_951860613"], ["4QP", "Developer-Centric Knowledge Mining from Large Open-Source Software Repositories", "Edge Hill University", "Recent reports state that the adoption of open-source software (OSS) helps, resulting in savings of about $60 billion per year to consumers. However, the use of OSS also comes at enormous cost: choosing among OSS projects and maintaining dependence on continuously changing software requires a large investment. Deciding if an OSS project meets the required standards for adoption is hard, and keeping up-to-date with an evolving project is even harder. It involves analysing code, documentation, online discussions, and issue trackers. There is too much information to process manually and it is common that uninformed decisions have to be made with detrimental effects.\n\nCROSSMINER remedies this by automatically extracting the required knowledge and injecting it into the IDE of the developers, at the time they need it to make their design decisions. This allows them to reduce their effort in knowledge acquisition and to increase the quality of their code. CROSSMINER uniquely combines advanced software project analyses with online monitoring in the IDE. The developer will be monitored to infer which information is timely, based on readily available knowledge stored earlier by a set of advanced offline deep analyses of related OSS projects. \n\nTo achieve this timely and ambitious goal, CROSSMINER combines six end-user partners (in the domains of IoT, multi-sector IT services, API co-evolution, software analytics, software quality assurance, and OSS forges), along with R&D partners that have a long track-record in conducting cutting-edge research on large-scale software analytics, natural language processing, reverse engineering of software components, model-driven engineering, and delivering results in the form of widely-used, sustainable and industrial-strength OSS.
