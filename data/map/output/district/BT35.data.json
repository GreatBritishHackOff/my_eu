Fabrications Limited", "No need for heat! NVP Energy presents the first to market, high-rate AD technology that successfully treats low strength wastewater (WW) at ambient temperatures (4 - 20\u00b0C). The low-temperature anaerobic digestion (Lt-AD) process provides a novel solution to Food and Drinks industrial sectors which produce large volumes of WW. The European milk treatment and processing sector alone generates over 367 billion litres annually which is typically treated using conventional aerobic processes. The latter treatment process is unsustainable. It results in high sludge yields, requires a large footprint on-site and is hugely reliant on fossil fuels for aeration. The Lt-AD technology produces negligible sludge volumes, presents a compact design, requires no heat input or biogas recirculation, and produces effluent of urban wastewater directive (UWWD) standard (< 125 mg/L COD) without post-aeration. Comparing Lt-AD to conventional aerobic treatment of WW from a typical dairy processing plant producing 2,000 m3 WW per day, Lt-AD can provide annual OPEX savings of \u20ac1,662,106 p.a over a payback period of 2.49 years that includes RHI revenue of \u20ac374,176. The low temperature operation of Lt-AD allows for 100% of the biogas produced being available for reuse or resale. Lt-AD also has a high impact on environmental savings through reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and lowered thermal energy and fossil fuels requirements.  This Phase 2 project will allow NVP Energy install and commission a demonstrator plant and gain 8-12 months operational data. The results obtained, in conjunction with ETV assessment, will build the business case for each targeted market channel ahead of commercialisation.

Viewpoints to Multiculturalism\u201d is a joint student and teacher mobility project coordinated by Salpaus Further Education and realized by Sanare, a network of Finnish vocational institutions and education providers. The network partners are Finland\u2019s Diaconia College, The Federation of Education in Jokilaaksot/Ylivieska Vocational College, South Ostrobothnia Folk High School, Rovaniemi Municipal Federation of Education/Lapland Vocational College, The Federation of Education in Central Ostrobothnia, and Kemi-Tornionlaakso Municipal Educational and Training Consortium Lappia/Vocational College Lappia. The project is carried out in co-operation with our foreign partners in Spain, Denmark, Czech Republic and the UK. In choosing the partners, versatility has been taken into account to the effect that there are on-the-job learning places both for practical nursing students and for youth and leisure instructor students. In addition, the foreign partners have experience of multiculturalism, the central theme in the current project. The on-the-job learning places are in day care centres, schools and in care units for the elderly and the disabled. In the \u201cVlog Up!\u201d project there will be altogether 54 student mobilities and 14 staff mobilities.  \r\n\r\nThe Sanare network has carried out international projects previously, too, the most recent one being the Erasmus+ KA1 project \u201cIlona \u2013 voluntary work as part of the welfare field\u201d (2015-17). The previous experiences in collaboration act as a starting point in the current project. Thus, the practices that have proved to be good previously, as well as the designation of assignments within the network, are adopted to efficient use in the current project.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to increase the knowledge possessed by the applying network and the collaborating working life networks about the opportunities and challenges of multiculturalism in the European partner countries and in this way promote a new kind of European sense of community and equality. This goal is reached through video blogs, or vlogs, produced by the students taking part in the mobility periods. \r\n\r\nThe Sanare network has international partners, of which the ones chosen to be in this project are the ones with the most experience of supervising students from different cultural backgrounds and in whose staff and/or clients the multicultural dimension has traditionally been present. \r\n\r\nAs the concrete result of the project there will be, in addition to the mobility weeks, video blogs made by the participating students. In these vlogs, the various manifestations and forms of multiculturalism, as encountered in the on-the-job learning places abroad, are recorded and presented. The vlogs are recorded using for example cameras, smartphones and tablets. The students will update the vlogs in real time during the on-the-job learning periods. The vlogs will be advertised on the websites of the participating colleges. The vlogs can also be used for example in the marketing campaigns of the colleges, in parents\u2019 nights, and in staff education. \r\n\r\nThe mobility periods are recognized using the Europass mobility certificate. In addition, the mobility periods are recognized as on-the-job learning periods belonging to the students\u2019 qualifications as an obligatory part. \r\n\r\nThe various activities of the project are planned in detail in the autumn of 2017. At the same time, orientation is arranged for the first students going abroad in the spring of 2018. The staff mobility periods will take place in an early stage of the project, mostly in the autumn of 2017.
