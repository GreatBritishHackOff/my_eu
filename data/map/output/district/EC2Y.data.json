Although treatments have been developed that are effective in a proportion of patients, they are aspecific, relatively toxic and do not mediate cure. Currently, it is unknown which molecular effects need to be induced and/or targeted to prevent induction or persistency of RA.

In the treatment of neurological disease, the blood brain barrier (BBB) still represents an obstacle for the delivery of drugs to the brain and thus a major challenge for the development of therapeutic regimens. Understanding the molecular basis and functioning of the BBB in health and disease, including transport mechanisms across the BBB, therefore holds significant potential for future strategies to prevent and ameliorate neurological disease. Recent research indicates that some neurological disorders have a developmental etiologic component. The major goal of the NEUROBID project is thus to understand the molecular mechanisms and function of the BBB in health and disease both in the developing brain and the adult central nervous system. With an interdisciplinary consortium from the fields of developmental neurobiology and BBB research, NEUROBID aims to (i) understand the involvement of normal and disturbed BBB function in normal and abnormal brain development and (ii) to develop novel strategies for drug delivery to the brain. Unique transport mechanisms across the BBB will be used to target potential therapeutic macromolecular and cellular agents specifically to the brain barriers and transport them into the brain. The main target disorders of NEUROBID are non-inherited neurodevelopmental disorders arising from perinatal adverse exposure, such as cerebral palsy, and classic adult neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and stroke. In the long term, NEUROBID hopes to pave the way for new treatment strategies and thus reduce the economic and social burden of neurological disease. 1. Olesen J, et al.

Their plan was to compare the function of a normal and an abnormal BBB, and identify key players involved in the mechanism. In the normal brain, researchers elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which large molecules (proteins) are transferred across the choroid plexus, and identified specific brain barrier cell surface recognition targets.\n\nThe function of the BBB is significantly challenged by adverse perinatal exposures such as inflammation, hypoxia and glucocorticoid treatment. Using animal models for these situations, scientists were able to assess the effect of disease on BBB function in the developing individual. They discovered that exposure to corticosteroids in the perinatal and neonatal periods significantly increases the risk for neurodegeneration.\n\nSimilar alterations in the morphology and function of the BBB are imposed by perinatal inflammation. In answer to this, the consortium investigated how neuroprotective drugs could restore or maintain BBB integrity. With respect to the transfer of molecules or drugs across the BBB, scientists explored various strategies, including the modification of lipid solubility, and the use of transporters or carriers.\n\nCollectively, the activities of the NEUROBID study promote a better understanding of the BBB and its function, particularly in the developing brain.

The building blocks of the perovskite materials are very low cost and the processing into the final perovskite thin-film can be achieved with low temperature fast processes.
