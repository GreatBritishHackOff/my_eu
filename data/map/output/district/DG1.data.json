From passive and unidirectional users to proactive and interactive. Users can comment or rate a TV show and search for related information regarding characters, facts or personalities. They do this with both friends and wider social communities. This phenomenon is known as 2nd Screen. Another coupled phenomenon is Content Syndication, a field of Digital Marketing, where digital content is created once and delivered to different marketing channels at the same time. In today's 2nd Screen environment there are no true standards, protocols or common ways in which users can discover and access information related to consumed contents. Users have to  initiate information searches by using eg Google to 'participate' in the show. European enterprises wishing to provide services are restricted by a lack of business intelligence that can be applied with a view to profit from and enrich this market. SAM will change this by developing an advanced social media delivery platform based on 2nd Screen and Content Syndication within a Social Media context. Providing open and standardised ways of characterising, discovering, syndicating media assets interactively. Users will prosume digital assets from different syndicated sources and synchronised devices (e.g. Connected TVs) thus creating richer experiences around media. SAM's innovation is that instead of users reaching for the data; it is the data, which reaches the user through the syndication approach and their 2nd screen. This is based on the creation of dynamic social communities related to the user and digital asset context (e.g. profiles, preferences or devices). SAM will be able to capture and analyse valuable business intelligence which can be used to efficientize and monetarise the process for providers of assets and broadcast material and enrich as well as amplify the process for the consumer.

We've gradually started feeling the need to implement those methods outside our borders. We would like to learn about other youth organizations using similar methods, thus enhancing both the youth sector itself as well as organizations and individuals within it. Therefore we decided to link up with organizations from across Europe and invite them to participate in a partnership building seminar.\r\n\r\nWe decided to address goals such as good practice exchange of street-based youth work, strengthening the youth sector and better knowledge of street-based youth work within the sector, professional development and capabilities of youth workers locally and internationally, an upgrade of organizations with newly developed partnerships and a prepared plan for additional international cooperation. Therefore we invited organizations from all over Europe to cooperate;  this seminar involves twelve organisations from abroad who will send two participants (together 24) to the partnership building seminar, held in January 2017.\r\n\r\nWe expect participants, youth workers, experienced in outreach work, primarily from target group aged 17-29.

Participants will exchange experiences, good practices, methods we use and obstacles that we can together overcome more easily. Within the activity we expect to form several new partnerships and for each partnership a plan for further cooperation will be formed together with the planned activities to find project application opportunities. Project applications will ensure partnerships.\r\nIntroduction of participants, organizations, projects and methods, used by participants, partnerships building activities with work plan after this seminar and step by step plan to project application are all parts of the seminar. An important part of the seminar will be evaluation which will ensure learning opportunities even to those participants and organizations that might not decide to cooperate further.\r\nThere will be different methods used, mainly working in bigger or smaller groups, with an addition of activities to encourage creativity and idea generation. Each sequence will be moderated by a chosen moderator (participants can freely enter this role), enabling equal cooperation, involvement and participation of all. The facilitator will also be responsible for following the schedule and goals of each sequel.

Longer therm benefits are clear: common project applications leading into development of cooperation within and outside the network, strengthening of youth sector, and therefore better participation of interests of youth in society.
