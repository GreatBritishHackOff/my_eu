From passive and unidirectional users to proactive and interactive. Users can comment or rate a TV show and search for related information regarding characters, facts or personalities. They do this with both friends and wider social communities. This phenomenon is known as 2nd Screen. Another coupled phenomenon is Content Syndication, a field of Digital Marketing, where digital content is created once and delivered to different marketing channels at the same time. In today's 2nd Screen environment there are no true standards, protocols or common ways in which users can discover and access information related to consumed contents. Users have to  initiate information searches by using eg Google to 'participate' in the show. European enterprises wishing to provide services are restricted by a lack of business intelligence that can be applied with a view to profit from and enrich this market. SAM will change this by developing an advanced social media delivery platform based on 2nd Screen and Content Syndication within a Social Media context. Providing open and standardised ways of characterising, discovering, syndicating media assets interactively. Users will prosume digital assets from different syndicated sources and synchronised devices (e.g. Connected TVs) thus creating richer experiences around media. SAM's innovation is that instead of users reaching for the data; it is the data, which reaches the user through the syndication approach and their 2nd screen. This is based on the creation of dynamic social communities related to the user and digital asset context (e.g. profiles, preferences or devices). SAM will be able to capture and analyse valuable business intelligence which can be used to efficientize and monetarise the process for providers of assets and broadcast material and enrich as well as amplify the process for the consumer.

It responds to one of DAREIC's missions : promotion of European and international mobility of the academy.\r\nThe GIP \"Lifelong Learning\" is the promoter of the project: it ensures the financial aspects and the DAREIC the administrative and pedagogical aspects that it shares with the members of the steering committee, namely pedagogical advisers of primary school , inspectors of secondary school and an inspector, delegate to continuing education for the Nancy-Metz Acad\u00e9mie.\r\nThe Nancy-Metz Academie has a unique geographical situation because it has three border countries, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg and the flow of frontier workers is very important and will remain so if \"lorrains\" people can justify sufficient language skills. The MIRABEEL 2 project responds in terms of language learning to the objectives and priorities set out in the 2014-2018 academic project, namely to enable each pupils to learn a foreign language at an early stage in school, to promote the setting up innovative and effective pedagogical devices, making the international component of the project of establishment a lever of collective ambition and developing the teaching of different subjects in a foreign language. The aim is to ensure that, thanks to European mobility, the linguistic and cultural competences of primary school teachers and teachers of non-linguistic subjects at secondary school are discovered, innovative teaching methods for foreign language teaching and other subjects  teaching in foreign language, new pedagogical tools, other time schedules, other evaluation systems, and other learning organizations in different European school systems.\r\nThe MIRABEEL 2 consortium combines 23 primary schools, 4 colleges and 15 secondary schools, most of which offer one or more European sections. It will organize 260 mobilities of teachers , trainers, pedagogical advisers, teachers of foreign languages, teachers of non-linguistic disciplines who have foreign language certification and teachers who wish to teach their discipline in a foreign language . These mobilities are distributed as follows: 99 mobilities for structured courses and 161 mobilities for job-shadowing. They will take place over a period of 5 to 12 days, in 16 European countries, over a period of 2 years.\r\nFor the structured courses, the participants will use the training organizations or training institutes they will choose according to the linguistic and intercultural program they propose. The job-shadowings will take place in partner schools  that the sending schools have already identified or that relay organizations in different European countries, partners of the DAREIC, will offer them within the framework of the chosen theme. The internship program will be established in liaison with the steering committee.\r\nWithin this committee, the DAREIC and the GIP, with their experience of cooperation on grouped mobility projects, will monitor and coordinate the project; They will facilitate the pooling of tools to enable a better implementation, from the point of view of financial and administrative management as well as the pedagogical, cultural and linguistic preparation, if necessary, or evaluation. The DAREIC will propose a continuous follow-up and accompaniment of the schools at all the stages of the project.\r\nThis consortium will allow sending schools to respond to their European development plan either by providing language instruction in primary schools with B2 level teachers or by developing innovative pedagogies in foreign language teaching and in other differents subjects teaching in foreign language both in primary school and in secondary school, and in the long term, by having, in the lyc\u00e9es which have one or more European sections, several teachers who will pass the certification in foreign language in order to be able to teach all or part of their discipline in foreign language.\r\nThe pedagogical advisers, trainers and inspectors will use the methods, tools, practices especially related to the digital to propose renewed trainings to all the teachers of the Nancy-Metz Acad\u00e9mie .\r\nParticipants in job-shadowing will establish new partnerships with European schools that will ultimately develop new virtual or physical mobility for pupils or strategic Erasmus + partnerships projects.", "http://www.dumgal.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA101-036403_3"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["2DD", "Business Gateway Local Growth Accelerator Programme Dumfries and Galloway", "Dumfries and Galloway Council", "Target businesses with aspirations to grow their potential, capacity, innovation or knowledge; and help local businesses into later stages of the Business growth pipeline provided through Scottish Enterprise.", "ERDF", 914541.04, 2286352.62, "erdf_scotland_57"], ["2DD", "Poverty & Social Inclusion Enhanced Pipeline - Dumfries and Galloway", "Dumfries and Galloway Council", "Support delivered to income deprived members of the community aimed at areas within Dumfries and Stranraer.", "ESF", 559359.72, 1398399.31, "esf_scotland_127"], ["2PN", "D&G Employability Pipeline", "Dumfries and Galloway Council", "The operation will deliver an employability pipeline focussed on those with multiple barriers and furthest from the labour market with a particular focus on unemployed young people.", "ESF", 1366707.69, 3416769.24, "esf_scotland_165"], ["2PN", "SI Management - D&G", "Dumfries and Galloway Council", "Strategic Intervention management, administration and compliance.", "ESF", 156363.35, 390908.38, "esf_scotland_166"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["4JX", "PISCES LEARNING INNOVATIONS LIMITED", 78853.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2016_30151", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "DG1"}
