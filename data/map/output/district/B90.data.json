Safety technologies have shown outstanding capabilities for supporting the driver in hazardous situations. Despite their effectiveness, currently available systems are typically implemented as independent functions. This results in multiple expensive sensors and unnecessary redundancy, limiting their scope to premium-class vehicles.The project is based on the concept that by integrating applications together, vehicle components may be shared among the various safety systems. This is accomplished in interactIVe by discrete architectural layers that are common to all applications. These provide large amounts of knowledge about the driver, state of the vehicle, and the environment to all interested applications. The overall result is an optimal use of resources, lower implementation costs, and ultimately a much broader acceptance of the technology.Although application and sensor fusion is an active area of study, substantial amount of research is still required before its commercial feasibility. By building upon current state-of-the-art technologies, interactIVe will develop next-generation safety systems based on three pillar concepts, namely continuous driver support, collision avoidance, and collision mitigation.The core activities of the project will address the design and development of the Intelligent Vehicle Systems, whose capabilities will be shown in demonstrator vehicles. The project will be conducted through a coordinated effort from leading automotive industries, suppliers, and research institutes.By demonstrating these results, interactIVe will significantly enhance the feasibility and attractiveness of next-generation safety systems, strengthening the position of European industries in the area of Intelligent Vehicles and e-Safety.", 260919.0, 24104833.0, "interactIVe", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_93555_999589366"], ["4LA", "Electrical Power Control \u2013 More Electric Aircraft", "Goodrich Control Systems Private Unlimited Company", "Systems for Green Operation (SGO) WP1 will deliver a V&V Plan on how European industry can support and de-risk Airbus in their work in SGO WP4 on a comprehensive ground demonstration ahead of a flight demo.

However, intersections can still be regarded as black spots. Depending on the region and country, from 30 to 60% of all injury accidents and up to one third of the fatalities are intersection related. This is due mainly to the fact that accident scenarios at intersections are among the most complex ones, since different categories of road user interact in these limited areas with crossing trajectories.<br/>The INTERSAFE-2 project aims to develop and demonstrate a Cooperative Intersection Safety System (CISS) that is able to significantly reduce injury and fatal accidents at intersections.<br/>The novel CISS combines warning and intervention functions demonstrated on three vehicles: two passenger cars and one heavy goods vehicle.

Motorcyclists and cyclists are particularly vulnerable to injury, especially when accidents involve roadside barriers.\n\nSignificant European funding is being directed towards improving these so-called road restraint systems (RRS). The Smart RRS project looked at how technology can be employed to increase road safety.\n\nThe first step involved analysing data from accidents involving RRS, examining what body parts are most often affected, the role that speed and angle of impact play, and so on. This was complemented by an investigation of the current standards governing RRS as well as the latest advances in motorist safety technologies.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, the Smart RRS participants have begun designing and constructing different prototypes. Computer-based models are helping identify which materials and profiles deliver the best performance. Primary and tertiary sensors are also being developed that will, in addition to other functions, alert emergency services to the exact location of accidents in order to reduce response time.\n\nCare is being taken to ensure that the Smart RRS can be easily integrated into existing road infrastructure, that production and maintenance costs are minimised and, above all, that the system is robust and reliable.
