Safety technologies have shown outstanding capabilities for supporting the driver in hazardous situations. Despite their effectiveness, currently available systems are typically implemented as independent functions. This results in multiple expensive sensors and unnecessary redundancy, limiting their scope to premium-class vehicles.The project is based on the concept that by integrating applications together, vehicle components may be shared among the various safety systems. This is accomplished in interactIVe by discrete architectural layers that are common to all applications. These provide large amounts of knowledge about the driver, state of the vehicle, and the environment to all interested applications. The overall result is an optimal use of resources, lower implementation costs, and ultimately a much broader acceptance of the technology.Although application and sensor fusion is an active area of study, substantial amount of research is still required before its commercial feasibility. By building upon current state-of-the-art technologies, interactIVe will develop next-generation safety systems based on three pillar concepts, namely continuous driver support, collision avoidance, and collision mitigation.The core activities of the project will address the design and development of the Intelligent Vehicle Systems, whose capabilities will be shown in demonstrator vehicles.
