Two to three workers have organized for a group of 15-20 members to play football in a Gymnasium for disabled people once a week. The origin of the project dates back to November of 2011 , when employees of Hlutverkasetur  reached out to employees of a residential cluster about how to get the people more active . The conclusion of these talks where to organize some kind of a sport activity for these people, since one of the employers had experience with football they decided to start playing football once a week. Since then the participants have met once a week all year round and now we want to promote and strengthen the group more .\r\nThe plan is to go with the 15 -man squad to Glasgow in the fall and meet the football group from Caledonia clubhouse , both to learn about their group and to tell them about us .\r\nThe aim of the project is to promote health and improve the effectiveness of a group of people who struggle with psychiatric illness / disorder. The fact that employers take part in the football can be very encouraging for users to participate. The fact that this group is open to participants of multiple sources who all have an interest in football increases the possibility to communicate with others.  This trip abroad will hopefully strengthen the group further , give them the opportunity to meet others and establish a partnership.\r\nWhen people with the same interest come together they are likely to communicate with each other and are more likely to encourage others to live a healthy lifestyle.\r\nIndividuals who struggle with psychiatric illnesses are highly isolated and employees are often the only individuals they meet . For them, this is perhaps the only time they go out and to meet and talk with others. \r\nThis football program has the main aim to reduce stigma / discrimination and to help the individuals participating in the program live a healthier live style.", "https://ec.europa.eu/education/participants/portal/desktop/en/organisations/register.html", null, "erasmus_2014-1-IS02-KA105-000038_1"], ["7JT", "Spanish Immersion Course in M\u00e1laga", "St Mungo's HS", 2672.0, "- One participant who is a qualified secondary teacher of French who worked hard during her free time to complete a 2 year course distance learning Spanish Diploma with the University of Dundee in June 2014.

Within the framework of CfE there is a recognition of the importance of language learning as a communicative skill which will enable young people to participate fully in a global society and economy.\r\n- The participant will interact with other European teachers to  share good practice and various resources (ICT, songs, media, word documents, presentations, games etc.). This will enable the school to play a more active role in raising the awareness of the importance of languages within its local authority by leading by example and interacting with other European partners  and using ICT to communicate more effectively with learners and educational partners.\r\n- This project will enable our school to contribute to major educational initiatives such as Curriculum for Excellence, the Scottish Government 1+2 language policy and raising awareness of the importance of languages and working together within Europe.", "http://www.stmungoshighschool.co.uk", "St Mungo's HS", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013189_coordinator"], ["8EJ", "Supporting the implementation of 1 + 2 Languages", "Carron Primary", 1457.0, "We currently deliver French and Gaelic modern language through a stand alone curriculum.

In line with the most recent guidelines from the government a 1 + 2 approach we now hope to make changes to this. \r\n\r\nAt present I am currently involved in a cluster group who are from all different backgrounds of modern languages who are put together to take this initiative forward. Our objective is that by 2020 all children will experience L2 from Nursery to p7 with the addition of L3 from P5 onwards , thus giving them the knowledge and skills necessary to learn a language to transfer to new situations enabling them to become global citizens. There are around 400 pupils in the school with 19 class teachers who will be impacted upon completion of this project.  All pupils will begin to have tasters of the language as of August 2015 and as staff training and resources within the school develop this will become core and normal to their every day learning.\r\n\r\nWe aim to provide these opportunities to all pupils regardless of needs or background in an engaging way. To do this we hope to embed it within the curriculum using it in daily classroom life, introducing it through interdisciplinary projects and whole school celebrations providing children with a wide and rich range or learning activities in modern languages to develop literacy and language skills to enable children to become, successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributor, responsible citizens.

We hope to meet the Scottish government's target of children learning a second modern language from Primary 5 onward before the government's proposed deadline of 2020. To better support the links between ourselves and our feeder high school, St Mungo's, we plan to deliver Spanish from nursery level, and introduce French to P5 pupils.

Adjuvant staff, many of whom are ex-Scottish FA education and mobility employees, are now involved in the delivery, assessment and management of circa 250 Modern Apprentices employed by the Scottish professional football clubs who are undertaking the SVQ Level 3 qualification, Achieving Excellence in Sports Performance.\r\n\r\nFor those intent on a career in professional football, the path starts at the age of 16, when clubs offer apprenticeships to their most promising young players. Although aspects of the two-year training programme have changed significantly, the goal remains the same: a professional contract.\r\n\r\nHowever, the statistics are damning. The Premier League and Football League advise that between 60% and 65% of the 700 or so apprentices taken on each year are rejected at 18. Even half of those who do win a full-time contract will not be playing at a professional level by 21 years of age (source: PFA). Effectively, this means that five out of every six players who start an apprenticeship will not be playing football for a living five years later.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation reports published by a number of organisations (Scottish FA, Celtic FC, Aberdeen FC) have unequivocally shown that participation by young apprentice players in a European mobility programme can boost their chances of being offered a professional contract. Celtic and Aberdeen FC have reported that almost 30% of mobility participants subsequently went on to play first team football \u2013 an unprecedented success rate. This recent (2015) club data confirms that European mobility undertaken by apprentice players can profoundly affect their chances of becoming professional footballers. Both of these clubs went on to report that mobility also had a marked effect in boosting employment rates in other industries for those mobility participants who were not offered a professional contract. Consequently, the anticipated  impact of this mobility project will be to significantly increase the skill sets of the mobility participants which will improve their prospects of being offered employment as a professional player on completion of their apprenticeship. Those participants who are not offered a professional contract will benefit from increased employability in alternative career pathways due to the transferable and interpersonal skills acquired as a direct result of their mobility experience.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this mobility project will be to provide a work experience abroad that not only enriches apprentices\u2018 professional and academic lives, but will also promote openness, adaptability and flexibility, and enhance language learning, intercultural skills, self-reliance and self-awareness.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal objectives of this project is to use the competencies and life skills acquired through mobility to enhance the future employability of participants, whether that be as a professional football player or an alternative career path. Evaluation will include the collection of employment data (post apprenticeship) for mobility participants and comparing this to their peers.

However the Scottish Government's ambition is to expand and improve language learning, by 2021, so that our young people are equipped with the skills and competencies they need in our increasingly globalised world. Through attending the one-week immersion course in Malaga, this would enable me to enhance my own Spanish speaking skills and liaise with my European partners.
