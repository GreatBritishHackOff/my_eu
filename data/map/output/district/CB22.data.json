Thus, genome spatial organization can be considered on a par with other epigenetic features that together contribute to overall genome control.

HERCULES will provide the normal benefits of LED lighting \u2013 high electrical energy to light conversion efficiency (reducing energy consumption), instant start-up and efficient dimmability, but will also allow tuneable colour rendering for applications such as food retailing.\n\nIt is essential that light sources produce high quality colour rendition, which has proved critical to the health and productivity of workers. High efficiency LEDs have very poor colour rendering and current approaches use multiple phosphors on each LED to generate a poor typically \u201cblue rich\u201d approximation to natural light. These phosphors can seriously reduce the efficiency of the LED, so more LEDs are required to achieve the light ouput. In a compact light source this has the effect of increasing the temperature of the LEDs, which has a very negative feedback as their efficiency decreases rapidly with temperature. The HERCULES solution will overcome this serious limitation.\n\nThe key developments in this project will be:\n\u2022\tCharacterisation and selection of suitable high efficiency LEDs\n\u2022\tNovel electronic driver design\n\u2022\tOptical design for several form factors, especially to de-image LEDs\n\u2022\tLow cost injection moulding tool making technique for optical finish\n\u2022\tPrecision injection moulding of optical elements\n\u2022\tNovel luminaire design for indoor/outdoor/specialist applications'", 70675.0, 1128143.0, "HERCULES", "Goodbye bluish lighting, Hello Sunshine", "With EU support, scientists have delivered a light-emitting diode (LED)-based system that produces full colour rendering and has 95 % efficiency.

LEDs offer higher energy efficiency and rapid start-up at a reasonable cost. However, poor colour rendering resulting in a bluish output can be unpleasant, stressful and tiring for the eyes.

Scientists focused on increasing the efficiency, brightness and colour of a medical luminaire (complete lighting unit) while ensuring that it can be disinfected. Efficiency depends on LED selection, colour mixing, the electronic driving circuitry and the thermal design.\n\nHERCULES delivered an advanced lighting system that combines light from different LED sources to produce near-perfect colour rendition across the full visible spectrum at extremely high efficiency.\n\nScientists showcased the technology in two demonstrators: a bed head light and an examination light. The bed light has controllable colour temperature to match the natural circadian rhythms of day and night. It comes with a dedicated programmer, but can also be programmed and controlled from a smartphone. The examination light is equipped with five colour settings ranging from cold to warm white light. The high R9 (saturated red) colour rendition enables greater resolution of tissue differences for surgical procedures, whereas the cold white  setting supports general examinations and is particularly good for visualising veins, required for safe and painless drawing of blood.\n\nHERCULES developed a highly efficient, full colour rendering and cost-effective LED lighting system with broad applications wherever good colour rendition is a necessity. The technology will significantly enhance the competitive position of related small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the EU.

To achieve this, they are using state-of-the-art technologies to study the epigenome and especially identify the 5-methyl-cytosine marks on the genome. Combined with functional gain of function and loss of function studies, this information will provide insight into the mechanism of epigenetic reprogramming early during development.\n\nIn addition, the consortium aims to investigate the role of histone modifications in genomic imprinting and the mechanisms underlying its regulation. For this purpose they have chosen specific imprinted loci and will examine how genomic imprinting is affected by mutations in histone methyltransferases and demethylases.\n\nTo extend their findings into imprinting disorders, researchers have recruited large cohorts of patients affected by Beckwith\u2013Wiedemann syndrome and Silver\u2013Russell syndrome. Both of these diseases are associated with chromosome\u00a011 imprinted genes, and to facilitate their investigation researchers have recapitulated the mutations in mouse models. Given the importance of imprinted genes in stem cell differentiation, the consortium also plans to correlate gene expression and epigenetic modifications during experimental somatic cell reprogramming.\n\nTaken together, INGENIUM activities will provide fundamental knowledge on the role of chromatin dynamics in gene expression.

The multiplex protein detection technology would be able to generate data for nearly 180 proteins at the same time using a tiny amount of blood.\n\nProject partners used PLA technology where two antibodies couple to DNA oligonucleotides against the same target protein. This allows the ligation and amplification of these DNA oligonucleotides by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), generating a strong signal.\n\nPROACTIVE consortium members successfully developed multiplex PLA assays based on the simultaneous detection of 96 protein molecules. An improved method termed proximity extension assay (PEA) was developed that offered increased signal recovery from blood plasma. Improvements in component generation such as the antibody\u2013oligonucleotide conjugation technology were also achieved.\n\nProject partners developed a laboratory information management system (LIMS) for PLAs geared towards biomarker discovery. The data, alongside clinical information of the samples, were stored in a central server and could be accessed by all researchers.\n\nImplementation of the PROACTIVE system on a cohort of patients with colorectal cancer led to the identification of proteins specific for the early stages of the disease.

However, this creates a new challenge for medical science, to facilitate healthy ageing. With age, the function of the immune system declines, rendering older people more susceptible to infections and less able to benefit from vaccination. Indeed, improving vaccine efficacy is key to reducing infection-related morbidity in older people.  To date, the complexity of the ageing process has hindered attempts to fulfil this ambition, and thus innovative approaches are required to better understand the underlying biology.\n\nVaccination creates protective immunity by inducing the germinal centre (GC) response, an intricate process that generates memory B cells and long-lived antibody-secreting plasma cells.  However, the GC response declines with age.  Strikingly, it is not B cells that are responsible for the age-dependent decline in the GC response, but the CD4\\ T cells and the microenvironment of older individuals. The cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible, however, remain unknown. In the GC there are two subsets of specialised CD4\\ T cells, T follicular helper (Tfh) and T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells, which act in opposition to promote and suppress the response, respectively. I hypothesise that aberrant formation and/or function of Tfh and Tfr cells contribute to impaired GC responses during ageing, and that these cells could be targeted to improve vaccine efficacy.  Furthermore, the most prominent age-dependent change in secondary lymphoid tissues is the accumulation of senescent cells, which can modify immune function and tissue structure.

I and others have shown that inter-individual variability in the longevity pathways \u2013and in particular, in stress response genes- has consequences for genetic/environmental phenotypic robustness as well as for lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. My main interest is to uncover the causes that explain inter-individual variability in lifespan. The variability across individuals must include an important non-genetic component because the laboratory strains of this nematode are genetically homogeneous. I propose that lifespan variation is a by-product of non-genetic sources of variability in the pathways that control longevity. Strikingly, inter-individual differences in stress responses are transgenerationally transmitted. Transgenerational memory is an adaptive strategy that informs the next generation about the likely environmental cues that will be encountered, and sets patterns of gene expression by the incomplete erasure of chromatin marks in the germline. I hypothesise that transgenerational epigenome inheritance introduces transcriptional variability for genes that influence lifespan. Also, I propose that the probabilistic nature of lifespan is caused by inter-individual differences in the inheritance of longevity genes that set the rate of ageing from early development. Understanding the basis of lifespan variability is crucial for personalised medicine, where not the average population but rather the individual is centre stage. It is equally crucial for the identification of new factors that may have been missed by the analysis of population averages that can have an impact for human ageing and health.

Firstly, using novel single-cell technologies, I will characterize the EEL cells in detail, validating them as an in vitro model of pre-implantation development.

Validated EEL regulators, including two additional newly confirmed factors, will be analysed mechanistically determining their interaction partners, interdependencies, and mode of action.
