The manufacturing test coupons have already been used in comparison of experimental and calculated results, and all the NDI defects data at the coupon level are available.\n\nPerhaps the largest component of the MAAXIMUS project deals with simulating composite material behaviours during damage initiation, propagation and final failure. Extensive and comprehensive work has focused on the development of models considering damage from the micro scale to the barrel scale, with proper coupling between scales and careful control of the error in the solution. Reducing uncertainty plays a critical role in reducing redundancy, which translates to reductions in weight, cost and time. A new test rig for large structural components will eliminate the need for a barrel test for certification.\n\nMAAXIMUS is nearing the finish line with final months to be devoted to full-scale validation of simulation methods and test procedures. Successful completion will put powerful tools in the hands of aircraft manufacturers, supporting them in efforts to significantly reduce the time and cost of development and assembly of composite aircraft fuselages.", null, "http://www.airbus.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-07/159295.jpg", "fp7_89907_999931582"], ["7AR", "More Integrated Systems Safety Assessment", "Airbus Operations Limited", "The increase of aerospace systems complexity has meant that by using existing methods for systems development, industry has reached a barrier to innovation and a risk to the competitiveness of products. This is characterised by an increasing time to market for new technologies, increasing costs to demonstrate proof of safety, a greater demand for skilled resources and a limitation on design iterations, which means there is less time to optimise designs that are compliant with safety targets. MISSA aims at filling this gap and providing methods and infrastructure that accelerate the convergence toward optimal system architecture that integrate safety constrains.

Fire, ice and system failures are typical safety hazards associated to FS. FS accidents, though only representing 2% of accidents/incidents, continue to be a recurrent concern, especially as: the complexity of FS escalades to cope with increasing needs, including more stringent safety requirements ; flight conditions evolve with new routes at high altitude, crossing the Arctic, and faster climbing and approach; climate changes with more aircraft (A/C) exposed to hazardous weather.\nThus, FS have to deal with more extreme temperatures, stronger temperature gradients, more humidity, and more exposure to lightning. In addition, new technologies are emerging: Composite, More Electric and Alternative Fuel, bringing new safety requirements. For example, within the composite A/C environment, systems will be more exposed to lightning and induced arcing.\nSAFUEL will address the urgent need for European-led research in FS safety to develop the next generation of safer FS also offering the opportunity to reduce the current over-dependence on patented US technology.\nSAFUEL will develop:\n-the new FS design, meeting the severe safety constraints of Composite and More-Electric A/C and evolving flight conditions\n-a range of highly innovative prototypes, adequate testing and simulation tools to allow regulators to assess the safety of future FS as well as providing the necessary data to support authorities in rules and regulations for safe flight in icing conditions.\nThe project will also significantly improve the compliancy of the FS with evolving flight conditions and emerging technologies, enabling perfect emergence of Composite A/C.\nBy achieving these objectives, SAFUEL will reduce the rate of accidents/incidents related to FS from the current 2% to 0.4% instead of witnessing an increase.\nSAFUEL brings together a consortium of best-of-breed experts from academia and industry-from components to airframer.

Furthermore, the growing usage of polar aircraft routes, combined with climate change, could mean an increased risk of FS failure due to icing.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'The safer fuel system' (http://www.safuel-FP7.eu (SAFUEL)) aims to develop, test and validate a new, safer fuel system that protects against icing and ignition risk/flammability hazards. The regulation-compliant system will minimise the FS risks associated with future aviation conditions of more extreme temperatures, increased humidity and more frequent lightning exposure.\n\nTechnical objectives include improving water detection in fuel tanks, enhancing flammability protection, removing ignition sources and validating compatibility with modern aviation electronics. Additionally, the 13-member project plans to verify compliance with alternative fuel standards. The undertaking runs from September 2012 to February 2016.\n\nIn order to develop new technologies, the project first defined an aircraft baseline and multi-level system and component specifications. It also defined criteria on technology maturity, safety and compliance.\n\nWork on the detector for water in fuel tanks began with an analysis of the accident report literature. Hence, an optical dissolved-water sensor is under development. The team tested the ageing properties of optical fibre in aviation fuel, and determined the relation between water detection and temperature. Results indicate good performance of the optical water sensor.\n\nThe first stages of studying icing phenomena involved designing innovative test benches to enable the correct modelling of environmental conditions during flights. Subsequently, the team studied various factors affecting ice accretion in inaccessible aircraft locations.\n\nResearchers developed and tested sensor/matrix materials in conditions corresponding to the fuel tank environment. The systems\u2019 requirements led to trade-off choices being made in favour of the most innovative gauging technologies, specifically hydrodynamic-based gauging. SAFUEL also developed and optimised a classical fuel tank inerting system architecture for use with an in-tank oxygen sensor, comparing the energy consumption against a reference architecture.\n\nSAFUEL will yield aircraft fuel systems less vulnerable to the hazards of flight environments.

These tools will assess the compatibility of fuels with respect to the fuel system and the combustion system and will help evaluate the chances of success in an approval process. The JETSCREEN objectives are to develop a screening and optimization platform, which integrates distributed design tools and generic experiments to assess the risks and benefits of alternative fuels, and to optimize alternative fuels for a maximum energy per kilogram of fuel and a reduction of pollutants emissions. As a step prior to the lengthy and costly approval process, screening uses low cost small scale experimental and model-based testing to predict the impact of fuel on selected engine and fuel system components. The methodology is based on deriving predictive tools which capture fuel composition\u2019s effects on properties and sub-processes which have a direct impact on the performance of the fuel system and on the performance and emissions of the combustion system. Moreover, once the sequence of models exists to derive a relationship between fuel composition and sub-system performance then the reverse direction namely optimization is possible; for targeted performance or emission reductions can then be connected to a modification in the fuel formulation.
