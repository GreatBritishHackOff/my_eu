The information includes two geohazard data products: a new ground stability layer and accompanying interpretation that are produced by 27 national geological surveys.\n\nThe surveys use their geohazard information in combination with measurements of terrain motion supplied by satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radars. Urban maps are supplied after integrating land-cover and land-use data from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Services. The PANGEO data can be viewed on the project website and in Google Earth.\n\nUpon user enquiry for a given town, the service automatically integrates the ground stability layer with corresponding data from the Copernicus Urban Atlas at a resolution of 2.5\u00a0metres. The PANGEO service is entirely free to use and the data products downloadable (as PDF files) to enable integration into the user's geographic information system.\n\nThis wealth of information is targeted at local authorities, civil protection agencies, insurers, businesses and interested members of the general public. For example, local authority planners and regulators can now make more informed decisions on spatial planning in areas of instability. Governments can take remedial action in geologically susceptible zones to avoid high costs from possible disaster.\n\nTo ensure the sustainability of the PANGEO service, additional European towns that the Urban Atlas will cover can join the online system, once all the datasets are available.

Sharing experiences is organized at the FRMFR with the objective of creating a regional cohesion on all matters related to European mobility and thus project in terms of the valuation of these mobilities at events: General Meetings but also days of departmental or national educational groups. The impact for these teachers is to benefit from an increase in skills to better support the mobility of young people and ensure that they are more likely to benefit from this experience and offer existing and new partners coming unfailing support.
