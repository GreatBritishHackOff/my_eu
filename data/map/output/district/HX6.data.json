These tools will then be used in any of our 5 different study courses to help both native and non-native students enhance their linguistic and scientific know how/skills.The latest ICT technologies will be largely used to boost our pupils\u2019 motivation and pleasure of learning Maths in L2 and applying it to the learning of other related school subjects. TwinSpace will be used by the project teachers for internal communication and to share ideas, materials and results with relevant stakeholders. The two teachers of English will support the team throughout the whole project life cycle; they will be particularly involved in preparatory activities (ESP course focused on classroom management and mathematical language), in itinere (backing of teachers in mobility, preparing teaching materials in L2 and implementing learning modules in class) and in the final project evaluation phase (skills assessment).Finally, having a highly motivated and fully working MAKTS team will represent a precious long-term resource to be used as a: - reliable operational tool for planning and supervising further CLIL activities within our school;- reference point for the implementation of similar experiences in other schools of our territory.", "http://www.rvhs.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT02-KA101-023311_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "HX6"}
