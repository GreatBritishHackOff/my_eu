Of strategic importance, they are major contributors to EU GDP. Despite their many positive impacts, these industries face threats of: (i) sustainability of growth in terms of raw materials, energy and environment and (ii) competitive threat from Asia. The mainstream Transparent Conducting Oxide (TCO) is Indium Tin Oxide (ITO). Without ITO the manufacture of displays and PV cells is not possible owing to the unique twin properties of ITO thin films: metal-like electrical conductivity and glass-like light transparency. This makes ITO absolutely essential in the manufacture of displays and PV cells. The massive industrial growth rates and hence, high demand for ITO comes with substantial problems: high cost of ITO electrode production due to high demand and high price of indium and control of indium resources by China. To counter the above mentioned threats, the EU industry requires the replacement of ITO with lower cost and readily available metals. This is urgently needed to sustain EU solar, displays and electronics industries growth and freedom from Chinese control of these essential raw materials (especially since China is starting to curb rare earth and indium metal exports which is leading to price increases in these materials). By lowering the raw material costs, the AltiTude project also distribute great improvements to the SME participants and to EU industry offering competitive advantage. AltiTude delivers ITO alternative multi transparent conducting oxides (m-TCO) with performance equal or even better than ITO. In AltiTude m-TCOs, the indium is replaced with lower cost and more readily available metals such as Galium, Zinc and Tin. The result would be an enormous reduction in industry costs and a great increase in sustainability for electronics, displays and solar industries.", 180713.0, 1152461.0, "ALTITUDE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.hensonceramics.com", null, "fp7_192110_951901159"], ["2DH", "Cities for Business Innovation \u2013 Network of Urban Procurers", "Staffordshire County Council", "The C4BI project is a Network of Procurers that will provide an integrated answer to the challenge of urban innovation by combining in the same network City Authorities and Innovation Organizations, thus allowing impacting both the demand and the supply.\nThe C4BI project approach relies on the networking of urban public procurers that will enhance internal processes and foster transnational procurement processes with innovation facilitators that will mobilize SMEs for the procurement processes and innovation organisations that will facilitate the demand-supply link and mainstream and disseminate the results.\n\n\u2022\tCity Authorities: acting at the demand side, through directing their public procurement towards more innovative or more sustainable technologies.

However, in reality, such principles are seldom followed, because of traditional practices affecting tender selection and the awarding of contracts.\n\nThus, European procurers are not meeting the expectation that public procurement should achieve the EU-28 objectives for innovation and growth. Furthermore, procurers do not address the societal challenges that place demands on public authorities.\n\nTo address this, the EU funded the 'Cities for business innovation \u2013 Network of urban procurers' (http://www.procurers-network.com (C4BI)) project. The goal was to develop a consistent policy of innovative public procurement, focusing on major European societal challenges. These include 'active and healthy ageing' and 'demographic ageing of the urban population'. The goal was addressed by linking public authorities with innovating organisations, and thus affecting demand and supply. The seven-member project concluded after two years at the end of 2014.\n\nThe project's initial-year work consisted of two stages. The first involved each public procurer assessing their procurement practices and concluding, via a peer-review process, on areas needing improvement. Each partner addressed the issues using a combination of training and dissemination activities, plus adoption of new practices.\n\nDuring the second stage partners began identifying services and products able to better address the topic of 'ageing cities'. First, the needs of local communities were identified, and suitable processes were enacted.

The project will seek to increase inter-cultural learning skills using non-formal education and active methodologies. This will bring together a diverse group of young people in a creative setting where they will engage in cultural activities such as, music, ceramics and art. This will take place in a variety of settings that afford the opportunity to also be aware of the local environment. \r\n\r\nEach exchange will comprise two visiting groups of young people aged 15 to 19. There will be ten young people from each visiting group who will meet with a group of ten young people from the host country. Each group will be accompanied two youth workers. Each exchange will involve thirty young people and at least 6 youth workers. The young people will be recruited from existing youth clubs and projects in each of the 3 countries and the youth workers will work with them to prepare for the exchange\r\n\r\nEach exchange will have a cultural theme that reflects either the centre being visited or the regional heritage. The three exchanges will reflect the national culture of the host organisation with young people in the visiting groups with a specific interest. For example, Solna will focus on music as a theme, visiting young people will already have an interest in this subject and have prepared in advance of the visit to engage in the theme of the exchange.\r\n\r\nOur aim is that this project will, over twelve months, facilitate a cultural exchange between the young people and youth workers of three European countries. Enabling them to share and develop their respective cultures, raising their identities as young citizens of Europe and appreciate the similarities and differences of the peoples in the three nations. By participating in the cultural exchange activities they will gain a greater appreciation of what takes place elsewhere in Europe and of the challenges and opportunities facing young people that, in turn, might lead to a more cohesive and responsible society. We feel that this aim is even more important due to the UK referendum result.\r\n\r\nThrough this project we intend to support the Erasmus+ objective of creating a skilled/flexible workforce. We will achieve this by developing youth workers experience in carrying out exchanges and developing long term relationships with colleagues in other countries. Young people and adult workers will be living and learning alongside others from their own, and two other countries. We will be challenging any preconceived ideas or prejudices in a supportive environment.
