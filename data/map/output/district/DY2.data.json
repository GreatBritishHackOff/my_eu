They commercialise small volumes of low-emission vehicles, including taxis, delivery vans, factory vehicles and domestic cars. However with current technologies their market is limited and their development has been split between low-cost mass market and expensive high-performance vehicles. These vehicles do not meet customer performance demands, at a price point which is competitive with IC engines. Large vehicle manufacturers overcome this gap and reduce their development costs by platform sharing component technologies. However due to the lack of collaboration within our industry, this platform technology is not available. This proposal addresses this technology gap though the development of an open platform power management system, with customisable performance and efficiency. The platform will be supported by a modular platform drive motor topology, based on a fully scalable axial flux design (100Nm to 1,200Nm cont. torque). The low cost technology will be sufficiently high torque to drive the wheels at a high speed, without requiring an intermediate gearbox. To further drive down cost we will use the housing of the liquid cooled drive motor, as a heat sink for a high current power convertor. This will be achieved by applying a circuit board directly onto the motor housing, using a thermal spraying technology. The project will benefit Europe through increased sales of low-emission vehicles and enable our members to reduce development time by 20% and component cost by 40%. The modular drive motor platform will enable our members to manufacturer desirable vehicles at a competitive price and reduce the total vehicle cost by up to 13%. In addition we will offset imports by EU manufacturing of new drive motors, increasing European revenues by \u20ac257 million and profits by \u20ac51 million.", 213754.0, 2604557.0, "SAFEDRIVE", "New motors to boost electric and hybrid cars", "An initiative to advance and unify drivetrain technology for electric and hybrid cars could help European businesses in the field significantly. It will also bring the continent closer to a greener land transport model.", "About 1\u00a0600 European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), mostly automotive industry manufacturers and suppliers, are working on developing cutting-edge hybrid, electric and fuel cell technology for vehicles. These businesses face many challenges, particularly since there is no common drivetrain platform for applications under development, giving an advantage to larger multinational vehicle manufacturers.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'A platform power management system and low voltage drive train for hybrid and electric vehicles' (http://www.safedrive-fp7.eu (SAFEDRIVE)) supported European SME electric vehicle manufacturers in penetrating the electric vehicle market. It worked on developing a scalable, modular electric drivetrain to suit different types of electric and hybrid vehicles such as small cars, trucks and utility vehicles.\n\nEnvisioning a new motor design that requires lowering the voltage of direct current (DC) systems, SAFEDRIVE worked on a new split-Pi DC-to-DC converter and a power management/distribution system. The modular DC motor would eliminate the need for a gearbox, enabling direct drive operation through a drive shaft or as a hub motor. The project team developed an efficient bi-directional DC-to-DC converter in the drivetrain between the modular motors and power sources (super capacitor, lithium-ion batteries, motor-generator set).\n\nTo achieve its aims, SAFEDRIVE brought together SME supply chain partners, associations and end-users from across Europe. The project partners investigated existing technologies and developed the software behind the control and power management of the drivetrain. This was followed by production of new circuit boards, design of the drivetrain component parts and integration into a prototype.\n\nTowards the end of the project the team was very close to completing a fully functional electric vehicle drivetrain with an innovative modular DC motor that produces the desired torque. All the project's results have been disseminated to stakeholders, laying the groundwork for a unified drivetrain that could boost SME results in the field. Thanks to this initiative, Europe has come one step closer to becoming a leader in producing cleaner vehicles.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112212.jpg", "fp7_95937_989199987"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DY2"}
