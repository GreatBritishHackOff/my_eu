The OPERAs research will establish whether, how and under what conditions the ES/NC concepts can move beyond the academic domain towards practical implementation in support of sustainable ecosystem management. OPERAs will use a meta-analysis (systematic review) of existing ES/NC practice to identify knowledge gaps and requirements for new policy options and instruments.

These improvements are expected to increase the efficiency of power converters by a factor of 4, yielding a 75% reduction in losses. In this context, the objective of GreenDiamond is to fabricate a 10kV transistor in a high power package, followed by a high voltage AC/DC converter based on such devices.\nTo meet GreenDiamond\u2019s challenging goals, the consortium gathers experts on power device design, diamond growth and characterization, packaging and testing as well as an innovative end-user. Most of the partners are also involved in SiC or GaN technology, allowing the project to benefit from their ample experience and achievements in wide bandgap semiconductors. As far as diamond transistor structure is concerned, unlike GaN and SiC, Europe still has a significant scientific and technological advantage over non-EU competitors. It is therefore extremely important to maintain the competitive edge that will lead the development of truly green electronics in the near to medium term future.", 171034.0, 3696337.0, "GreenDiamond", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_193765_952894536"], ["0DL", "Enhancing ecoSysteM sERvices mApping for poLicy and Decision mAking", "Wcmc Lbg", "Mapping and assessment of ecosystems and their services (ES) are core to the EU Biodiversity (BD) Strategy.

The project provides the opportunity of drawing on the experiences of the first event of this kind and further developing the approach in an international setting.\r\nThe basic idea is for different youth groups to choose a fantasy role-playing background and create a cultural backdrop as well as challenges that are combined in an exciting interactive story. In this project the hosting country will be Germany. Before the meeting the groups will research create scenes that pose challenges and encourage value discussions (such as individual freedom vs. the good  of the community). They will produce a handbook as a basis for the group leaders to create an adventure story for a game. The groups will experience the game elements during the actual game event and use their own experience as a basis for intercultural value discussions.  The project foresees reflection and discussion phases on a regular basis.\r\nThe participants will live together for 8 days. They will be divided into smaller mixed teams in which they play a hero that experiences an adventure set in a mythology setting. Since different heroes have different skills and knowledge, cooperation is the key to overcoming the obstacles and successfully completing the game. Some of the participants (primarily the group leaders) will prepare the adventure in advance and take on the role of game directors during the event. They will describe the adventure as a story in which the players, working in teams, can decide what their heroes do and say, so that they influence the direction of the storyline. The game will be played both inside and outside, making it possible for the teams to go on long walks and play while experiencing the landscape.\r\nAmong the learning goals are developing teamwork, cooperation, and friendship in an international setting, improving soft skills and social competences, acquiring cultural understanding, raising awareness of other values and beliefs, and improving language and communication skills.\r\nIn total there will be 50 participants. 7 or 8 of them will take on the role of game directors and moderators with the task of running the game and leading the discussion and reflection phases. The participants will be chosen from young people within the informal groups who are active in voluntary youth work. Other participants will be disadvantaged youth chosen with the help of youth centers. For them the project brings the potential to orient themselves better in society and to open their minds in ways that would never be available to them otherwise.\r\nThe project requires good preparation which consists of choosing the venues, organizing food, organizing travel arrangements, compiling the materials on the setting, creating an adventure story and game rules, preparing discussion rounds and reflection phases, as well as choosing the members who get to participate. The project will be documented using pictures, videos, and written reports. Results will be published on websites in various form. The groups involved will use the opportunity of the event to create a European network in which the members can support each other better in their future activities.\r\nGiving young people the opportunity of cooperating, developing an understanding for each other, and building a lasting friendship will have a huge impact on society.

This LLP provides our interns with financial support to help lower the overall cost for their families.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are that the students can acquire the skills and abilities expected by the economy. In dealing with him/herself: self-esteem, self-confidence, a sense of basic trust, appreciation, self-efficacy, introspection, self-responsibility, and self-discipline. In dealing with others: attention, appreciation, empathy, ability to comprise, insight into human nature, ability to take criticism, awareness, tolerance, respect, language competence (especially in the foreign language), and intercultural competence. In regards to teamwork: ability to work in a team, cooperation, motivation, ability to confront conflicts, communication skills, and also general skills and abilities such as responsibility, diligence, flexibility and commitment.\r\n\r\nThis year we will be dispatching 35 students to partner companies in England, Germany, Italy and Spain.  Students will not only get their first professional experiences in an international environment, but also be able to apply their specialized practical knowledge along with their specialized theoretical knowledge.  Third year students know that they will not only be learning how businesses operate in other countries.  As interns, they must also learn other aspects of the work environment including managing to communicate with coworkers and superiors in a foreign language as well as taking care of guests in a multilingual environment.  The practical, linguistic, and social skills acquired by our students are very important for school but more so for their future professional careers.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the preparedness and quality of the internship, there is a monitoring system during the entire preparatory phase and also during the time abroad through E-mail and/or telephone.  The supervisors are also very important during the internship.  Through personal contact with the tutors and guest organisations, we can improve the quality of the job positions provided to our students.  At our school, we support our interns through monthly meetings.  The team of teachers in charge also meet with students in their free time.
