Patients treated with broad spectrum antibiotics are at greatest risk of CDD diarrhoea and many of those\n\naffected are hospitalised elderly patients with serious underlying illnesses. Antibiotics can cause disruption of the normal\n\nintestinal flora, an important part of the immune system, leading to an overgrowth of CDD. Currently, some 2350 patients\n\nsuffering from chronic CDD in a number of countries have been treated by faecal bacteriotherapy (FB), using samples\n\ncollected from donors. Although this procedure is reported, in a number of small studies, to be around 90% effective, it is\n\nhazardous, in that infection from the donor could be transmitted to the patient and it involves delivery of faecal samples into\n\nthe duodenum via a nasal probe.\n\nWe propose to treat CDD using a modified FB to restore the patient\u2019s original intestinal flora (employing samples collected\n\nfrom the patients themselves prior to their treatment) We will produce novel enteric-coated capsules, containing processed\n\nfreeze dried colonic flora that can be swallowed by a patient to restore their intestinal flora and immunise them against\n\nfurther infection by CDD. RFID tags will be employed to associate capsules with the relevant patient and assist with sample\n\ninventory.\n\n3 SMEs in 3 EU states and 5 distinguished research providers along with 1 OTHER SME in the coordination role will collaborate to provide the necessary technology to the project. The coordinator has previously coordinated an EU proposal and acted as a participant in projects over several\n\nFrameworks. The outcome will be a non-antibiotic medicament to treat and prevent CDD The consortium plan to patent the\n\nIPR from the project, exploit and disseminate the technology worldwide and carry out animal and hospital clinical studies.\n\nThere are no gender issues related to the proposal but animal and human studies will require ethical approval.'", null, 610442.0, "DNTCD", "Bacteriotherapy for Clostridium infection", "European researchers are harnessing the action of healthy gut bacteria to combat a type of infectious diarrhoea.", "One in five elderly people undergoing antibiotic therapy in hospitals develop Clostridium difficile disease (CDD). Taking broad-spectrum antibiotics disrupts the gut flora, resulting in CDD and symptoms such as diarrhoea and colitis. When diagnosed promptly, CDD responds well to treatment but recurrence is an issue requiring development of new therapies.\n\nThe key objective of the EU-funded 'Development of a novel treatment for clostridium difficile' (http://www.dntcd-project.eu/ (DNTCD)) project is to address such C.difficile nosocomial infections. The idea is to develop a treatment based on faecal bacteriotherapy (FB), using samples collected from donors. A number of studies report the high efficacy of this procedure. This procedure is however associated with certain hazards including the transmission of infections from the donor to the patient. \n\nDNTCD partners propose a modified FB using samples collected from the patients themselves prior to their treatment. These will be freeze-dried and encapsulated in novel enteric capsules for oral intake. The capsules will also contain RFID tags for inventory as well as patient-specific linking.\n\nThe DNTCD study will carry out clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FB capsules in healthy volunteers and CDD-affected individuals. A database is also underway for the recording and tracking of samples.With recent reports showing a CDD increase among hospitalised children, DNTCD study outcomes could provide an alternative non-antibiotic treatment approach for CDD.", null, "http://www.x-check.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/146181.jpg", "fp7_101383_965904370"], ["4JZ", "Smart high-frequency environmental sensor networks for quantifying nonlinear hydrological process dynamics across spatial scales", "Rs Hydro Ltd", "Regulators and industries are challenged by the difficulty to analyse and predict the impact of nonlinear environmental processes on short-term and long-term responses of ecosystems to environmental change. Until very recently, the development of most conventional monitoring, forecasting and prediction tools has been based on the assumption of stationary environmental systems. In the context of global change these tools are increasingly pushed towards and even beyond their design limits (the latter resulting in the first line from the prevailing limitations in spatial and temporal resolution of environmental observations).\n\nFor this project, we propose a rationale stating that only novel, high-frequency/high-resolution environmental monitoring and predictive modelling will yield new process understanding of ecosystem functioning. Technological progress offers as many opportunities as it triggers challenges: what is needed now are new strategies to generate, manage and analyse BIG DATA at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.
