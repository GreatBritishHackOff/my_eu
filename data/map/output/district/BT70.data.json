More than 150 young people, aged from 13 to 25, with less opportunity, will take part to an international youth exchange with the thematic of \"Migrants in Europe\". The 5 groups leaders, in each exchange, are using methods coming from the non formal education, using video-reports ; debates, workshops, games, visits, participating in local public events  which will provide participants new skills, competencies and habilities. Video-reports they will have to do in the dedicated workshops will give them a tool to act and will sensibilize the population to the question of migrants in Europe. The activity \"I will change the world\" will help to develop their social, political and economical creativity.

It's also a new opportunity of local and transnational partnership. For volunteers it's an enriching personal, professional and linguistic experience. Volunteers will participate to the local and european social-educational activities developped by the host organisation using video-reports.
