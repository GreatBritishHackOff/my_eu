To achieve this, EPAD will also provide the analytical infrastructure to make correct observations regarding an intervention\u2019s value as an agent for secondary prevention. All this must exist in the right ethical, legal and social context. It must also be sustainable by being of value to numerous partners and stakeholders in the long term. The EPAD Consortium has been carefully designed to achieve the aim of secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nCurrent and recent drug development programmes in AD have been limited through the collection of heterogeneous samples of patients with advanced brain disease and an inability to measure effectively an index of disease course modification.\nRecruiting participants from clinics and the community for AD prevention trials with limited clinical background is both a risky and cost-inefficient strategy. Creating a disease register of people consented to enter secondary prevention trials delivers a degree of readiness that ensures better knowledge of a participants suitability and a more rapid throughput of screening for the trials. The EPAD Consortium has the necessary reach and influence from its partners to develop such a \u2018readiness\u2019 cohort.\nBy delivering an earlier, risk stratified population with run-in data in the EPAD Cohort across both clinical and biological domains; we can ensure a more homogenous population for study. We can also track changes in disease status as the basis for deciding on an intervention or combination of interventions likelihood of success in larger Phase 3 confirmatory trials.\nMost of the scientific community still consider A\uf062 dysregulation as central to AD so targeting this pathological process is a rational first step in what will be a standing trial. Other disease processes can be targeted when candidate interventions and intermediate phenotypes to reflect success are available.\nEPAD High Level Structure:\nThe IMI-EPAD Consortium will form the third part to a proposed IMI\u2013AD Platform (with IMI-EMIF-AD and IMI-Aetionomy) to produce a globally important superstructure for the secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nIMI-EPAD brings together all the major cohorts in Europe purposed for the exploration of disease processes and risks for dementia. In drawing from over 40 cohorts with almost 250,000 participants in 11 countries we have the basis for the EPAD Register from which we can draw the EPAD Cohort. Expertise in basic neurodegenerative sciences, epidemiology, statistics and trial design ensures that the standing proof of concept adaptive trial will have the optimal chance of delivering meaningful and definitive answers on an interventions likely success in confirmatory trials.\nIn establishing the International Scientific Synergy Group (ISSG) we have ensured that our work is visible to similar international initiatives and vice versa hence, through pooling know how and sharing data we can collectively overcome this devastating global disease.\nEPAD Work Packages and National Leadership:\nWe have created 8 work packages with 4 of these bound together in the EPAD Delivery Cluster which includes the scientific bedrock (WP1), the statistical engine room (WP2), the aggregation of suitable subjects (WP3) and trial delivery (WP4). These trial delivery activities are supported by project management (WP5), dissemination (WP6), business model and sustainability (WP7) and ethics, legal and social implications (WP8).

A major flaw in the design of the Internet is its imbalance of powers in the favour of the sender of information. The network accepts anything that the sender wants to send and will make a best effort to deliver it to the receiver. This has led into increasing problems with spam mail and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, forcing companies and users to conceal their E-mail addresses and place their systems behind firewalls. The most severe consequence of this is that the possibilities offered by the Internet are not being utilized.<br/>The publish/subscribe paradigm (pub/sub) has been proposed as a remedy to these problems. Senders publish what they want to send and the receivers subscribe to the publications that they want to receive. In the pub/sub world only publishers need to have names. Already a large share of the use of the Internet is essentially pub/sub. We need a new Internet architecture, derived from the pub/sub paradigm. This will lead into a redesign of all the layers. In the new Internet, multicast will be the norm and security and mobility are designed into the architecture, rather than added on as after-thoughts.<br/>PSIRP (Publish/Subscribe Internet Routing Paradigm) will redesign the Internet architecture from the pub/sub point of view, taking nothing (not even IP) for given. The new architecture is implemented and feedback from the implementation work is used to refine the architecture.

It will leverage flexible radio approaches expected in 5G (e.g. FBMC). \nSPEED-5G has a very strong consortium, with a mix of operators, industrial partners, SMEs and leading European research institutes. They bring considerable knowledge and technology background to the project in architecture, resource management, protocols, radios, standardization, trials and tests, along with the most advanced of trial facilities, like the 5GIC centre.\nThe SPEED-5G innovations will be considered in an architectural framework consistent with the 5GPPP. They will be researched, implemented and trialled in SPEED-5G in order to reach high level of maturity and confidence. This will guarantee impact on the 5GPPP program as a whole, on standards and on European technical leadership.", 301877.0, 4658741.0, "SPEED-5G", null, null, null, null, "http://www.bt.com", null, "h2020_197352_999908593"], ["7AJ", "Service Programing and Orchestration for Virtualized Software Networks", "British Telecommunications Public Limited Company", "Virtualisation and software networks are a major disruptive technology for communications networks, enabling services to be deployed as software functions running directly in the network on commodity hardware.

The advantages of renting ICT infrastructures, platforms, and services, with easy access to scalability and elasticity, are driving an ever accelerating transfer toward the cloud of data and applications. Unfortunately, such a convenience comes at the price of the data owners losing control over their own data and any consequent misuse or security threats on them, which often limit the owner's adoption of the cloud's potential capabilities. On one hand, cloud providers can be assumed to employ basic security mechanisms for protecting data in storage, processing, and communication, devoting resources to ensure security that many medium and small companies may not be able to afford. On the other hand, data owners, when relying on the cloud, lose control over data and their processing, hence leaving them potentially exposed. Today data owners have to choose between having security but limited functionality or fully enjoying functionality but compromising on security and privacy guarantees. This situation has a strong detrimental impact on the adoption and acceptability of cloud services. Data owners may refrain from relying on the cloud for certain data, which they consider more sensitive or critical, or they use the cloud but remain exposed to the consequences of improper protection and control. The goal of ESCUDO is to empower data owners as first class citizens of the cloud.

Every interaction between fans and idols are staged and paid for. The idol culture is all about accessibility.What is striking is the contrast between how criminal this feels from a European point of view and how normal it feels in the Japanese context - women trying to win male admiration and men preferring younger women. In this sense, the idol culture is merely a modern interpretation of a long tradition. What is new and makes this a successful industry however, is the social context of men and women who are increasingly disconnected from one another and have stopped seeking real relationships. The idol business capitalises on this vacuum. It provides a platform for virtual relationships where idealised femininity and failed masculinity meet.
