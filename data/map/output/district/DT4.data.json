These are coupled with ageing infrastructure systems, continuously growing and changing demands on the built and natural environments as well as limited financial and depleting natural resources. Until now, research has been focused on the development of proactive risk-based approaches for civil infrastructure reliability and management with benefits in improved performance, safety and cost. However, there are significant uncertainties associated with the various predictive models directly affecting the quality of the decision making mainly due to the limited amount of information available on the condition, demands and actual performance of various systems. Recently, a new generation of miniature wireless sensor platforms which utilize novel digital signal processing has emerged. These can be adopted to obtain large quantities of highly diverse sensor data that are continuously collected over a long period of time from multiple locations providing significant insight on the condition, demands and performance of the system. These developments open up a completely novel area of multidisciplinary research towards the \u2018smart\u2019 management of sustainable environment. Even though there are top research institutions working in the field of wireless sensors and others in the civil infrastructure reliability and management, most of the activity is fragmented and there is no significant activity in performing multidisciplinary structured research for developing integrated smart and dynamic systems for effective management of the built and natural environment. The aim of SmartEN is to fill this gap and push innovation through the development of an ITN network that will focus on the development and effective integration of emerging technologies targeting key application areas of current interest to the European Commission and internationally.", 183483.0, 3094833.0, "SMARTEN", null, null, null, null, "http://www.dflsystems.co.uk", null, "fp7_92822_995657859"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0RH", "Let's improve teachers' skills abroad", "St Augustine's Catholic Primary School", 51134.0, "In order to modernize,  reinforce  internal  abilities and internationalize School our \u201cPOF\u201d, for a long time-, includes participation in several Comenius projects;  organization of individual internships  for teachers abroad; adherence to International projects and continuous training project of teachers  in accordance with the lifelong learning programme to support methodological and cognitive empowerment of learners.\r\nIn this perspective the European Development Plan has been processed as part of POF  where goals and aims were set out; questionnaires were provided to detect on time staff interests and needs; structured courses, Job shadowing and  Teacher Training  were chosen because they are more responsive to the staff needs and functional at the School; modes were shared for a proper selection, preparation, follow up measures and for the evaluation and dissemination of experiences. The Document aims are: improving  Education staff\u2019s skills (teaching, staff training, community languages knowledge, ICT); enhance knowledge, the understanding of national and European policies and practices; reinforcing the quality of teaching and learning, development of our Comprehensive Institute with a European breath. \r\nOur school  has devoted great attention to the learning mobility, considered as participation in training activities abroad for the benefit of individual and the whole school, as it is repeatedly stressed in the European documents of reference. The headteacher and 28 teachers are the beneficiaries of the project,  both of non-language subjects and foreign language teachers, identified on the basis of:\r\n-curiosity and openness to the new CLIL methodology, which often upsets the traditional lecture and encourages to review the educational certainties to provide a more timely response to the demands of contemporary society;\r\n-manifest willingness to participate to mobility activities as they aim to exploit all the motivational and practical implications of a full immersion in the \u201cother\u201d reality. \r\nSTAGES OF THE PROJECT\r\nThe mobility project consists of the following stages:\r\n-preparation ( practical arrangements, selection of participants, linguistic/intercultural/task-related preparation of participants before departure);\r\n-implementation of the mobility activities;\r\n-follow-up (monitoring of the activities, formal recognition of the learning outcomes of participants, how to place them in the curriculum of the participants, evaluation, exploitation of the project results, dissemination of the results at different levels: of the Institute, local, national and European level for the sharing of know-how, but also to influence policy and practice).\r\nAll the project stages will be properly documented in accordance with the principles of clarity, coherence, transparency and equity.\r\nAt different stages of the EDP a prominent role has been and will be carried out by the eTwinning platform:\r\n-finding Organisations  which provide structured courses;\r\n-understanding and sharing the cultural aspects of the home and host countries and Institutions, before departure;\r\n-management of mobility through the Mobility tool, from the starting stage of the introduction of participants\u2019 names and the activities to be carried out until the generation of the final report;\r\n-participation in the Learning Events;  joining an e-twinning project together with the mobility one;\r\n-sharing experiences, socialization of results and exchange of good practices;\r\n-creation of conditions for the development of ideas for future cooperation.\r\nThe evaluation of the course will be both through self-reflection on the experience and the individual\u2019s perception of the benefits that will be derived, and through the Working Group set up within the school Institution. The Working Group, as well as the European Development Plan, will be characterized by flexibility in order to include third parties in various ways involved in the process of innovation and internationalization of the school, implementing an overcoming of self.\r\nThe impact assessment will have a very important role as it will allow the identification of point of strengths and weaknesses of the course and, ultimately, a revision of the Plan. \r\nDissemination of results will be ensured in order to make them usable by the entire educational community on the local, national and European level. For this purpose both traditional forms of dissemination (brochures, articles, leaflets, flyers, reports,\u2026) and innovative (newsletters, website, social networks, You Tube,  platforms such as eTwinning and the Dissemination Platform) will be encouraged. They will be addressed both to users of school Institution and to a wider public.
