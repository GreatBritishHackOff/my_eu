Distribution and transmission grids and power system architectures still follow planning rules and procedures defined for the traditional operational paradigm. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and prepare solutions for the operational problems that will be caused on the electric grid, to the generation sub-system and to its commercial operation as a result of progressively increasing deployment of EV. The conceptual approach in this project involves the development of a methodology consisting of two synergetic pathways: - Development of a management and control concept that will facilitate the actual transition \u2013 the MERGE concept; - Development of an evaluation suite that consists of methods and programs of modeling, analysis, and optimization of electric networks into which electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure is integrated. The MERGE concept is inspired from consideration of DER deployment but differs in that we consider now the resources to be mobile in terms of their connection to the grid. Analogies will be derived and adapted to the case of mobile resources, which can be either consumers (when in charging mode) or injectors of power (if batteries are delivering power back to the grid). By exploiting a specific computational evaluation suite that is capable of simulating real world power systems (generation, transmission and distribution) for either steady state or dynamic behavior it will be possible to test the adequacy of EV preliminary smart control interfaces that will be developed in the project. It will address comprehensively the impact of EV presence regarding steady state operation, intermittent RES integration, system stability and dynamic behavior, system restoration, regulatory aspects and market arrangements.", 35050.0, 3836136.0, "MERGE", "Electric vehicles charging ahead", "Electric vehicles charging ahead", "Widespread market uptake of hybrid and all-electric vehicles, further considered together as electric vehicles requires careful consideration of the future operation of current electric power systems. Understanding and comparing the impact of such integration given uncontrolled conditions through a careful framework was the purpose of the EU-funded project 'Mobile energy resources in grids of electricity' (http://www.ev-merge.eu/ (MERGE)) . \n\nScientists considered the relevant infrastructure including charging concepts, smart metering and communication technologies.  Advanced simulation tools were then developed to assess the technical, economic and environmental aspects of electric vehicle integration in a holistic way. The study included analysis of steady-state and dynamic behaviours, the use of intermittent renewable energy resources and system stability and restoration schemes. Further, researchers considered regulatory issues, business models and market impact.\n\nOutcomes enabled the team to formulate several concepts for management of large-scale electric vehicle integration including business models and communication schemes. Partners concluded that, while no significant technical problems are expected until 2020 regardless of the charging strategy adopted, this is not the case by 2030. Development of an optimised and standardised charging infrastructure and planned regulatory framework will be necessary to avoid costly investments in network reinforcements. However, scientists emphasised that vehicle owner conformity should always be voluntary, highlighting the need for appropriate incentives. Researchers concluded with policy and regulatory recommendations for the present, intermediate- and long-term integration of electric vehicles.\n\nMERGE has provided the tools necessary to evaluate the operational issues associated with widespread market uptake of electric vehicles. Optimising integration will reduce technical and economic problems in the near future for maximum positive impact.

As a result, young people are often socially excluded and have difficulty participating actively.One of the main reasons why we want to pursue this project is to promote the concept of social entrepreneurship for young people across Europe. The idea is that participants are able to use all the information acquired during the exchange and begin to think about their future career and all the possibilities that they have to create their own future.The objectives of the project are:- Provide young people with the opportunity to develop or improve their basic and transversl skills, such as entrepreneurship, digital skills, teamwork, creativity and multilingualism providing the theoretical and practical means to facilitate the resourcefulness of the youngsters with creative processes and business in order to facilitate their employment, also in relation to other areas of Europe.- Promote social inclusion; will participate in the exchange young people with fewer opportunities, youngsters who have financial problems or are in a state of inactivity or unemployment.

Europe has become the place to move and interact exercising their rights.Participants involved in the project are 36, aged between 18 and 30 years who are dealing with the world of work for a short time, and young people who are looking for a new job or unemployed; boys who have finished high school and are facing with a number of choices such as the university, the search for a job, experience abroad, creating their own work; youngsters who feel an uncomfortable situation for the job, with many unknowns about it and how to build their career.

To achieve positive outcomes for young people it is important that key local stakeholders work effectively in partnership rather than isolation. When we state key local stakeholders we are referring to schools, colleges, municipalities, NGOs, sport clubs and businesses. When all or a combination of these groups collaborate creatively together they can make a more meaningful impact in shaping the citizens of tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThe project proposal is to enable partners to share current good practice on effective co-operation to harness CSR or other opportunities to benefit young people, develop new ideas to pilot in their local area, share the pilot outcome and provide recommendations which can be developed further in future projects. The proposal will be achieved through a training course with two stages:\r\n\r\nProject Stages\r\nStage 1 \u2013 Venue Jaunpils, Latvia \u2013 Training Course duration 7 days (plus travel) \u2013 to include two representatives per partner (total 12 participants) who are youth workers active as staff / volunteers in municipalities / NGOs or Sport Clubs. The purpose of Stage 1:\r\n\u2022 Introductions and showcase of host location\r\n\u2022 Dacorum CVS to present the model of using business CSR activities to benefit local schools through practical time limited projects\r\n\u2022 Share current good practice (all other partners to present)\r\n\u2022 Techniques to effectively engage young people\r\n\u2022 Identify the attributes of successful co-operation and how to maximise these\r\n\u2022 Prepare and plan pilot activities for local activities\r\n\u2022 Develop networks for co-operation through the pilot stage\r\n\u2022 Overview of the Erasmus+ Programme\r\n\u2022 Outline ideas for future project co-operation\r\n\r\nStage 2 \u2013 Pilot at a local level an initiative to bring together local stakeholders with the outcome of young people developing healthier lifestyles, community activity and their own competence, capabilities and employability skills. The initiative will include a range of stakeholders from different sectors, including as a minimum the partner organisation, a local business and one other stakeholder - Average number of young people participating in local initiatives - 10 per partner x 6 partners = 60\r\n\r\nThe time provided for Stage 2 would be 6 months and will include actively sharing the development and delivery of initiatives with partners through social media\r\n\r\nStage 3 \u2013 Venue Hemel Hempstead, UK \u2013 Training Course duration 6 days (plus travel) \u2013 to include two representatives per partner (total 12 participants) who are youth workers active as staff / volunteers in municipalities / NGOs or Sport Clubs.

The process will encourage active participation and to ensure in group work that we embrace trans-national working benefits and enable participants with less experience to be mentored by those with more. The training course participants will agree the group rules and ensure that we have an inclusive approach which values all views and opinions. The local activity between the two training courses will be led at a local level in accordance with the organisation structure and policies, though there will be ongoing peer support made available through the Private Facebook group to address issues which may arise. This will be monitored by Dacorum CVS to ensure it becomes an effective tool for partner engagement.\r\n\r\nEach training course will be attended by 12 participants (6 partners x 2 participants) and the result will be greater empowerment and understanding of the different agendas of stakeholders from other sectors and how to harness these within innovative and improved partnerships that benefit young people.
