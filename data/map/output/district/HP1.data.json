Distribution and transmission grids and power system architectures still follow planning rules and procedures defined for the traditional operational paradigm. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and prepare solutions for the operational problems that will be caused on the electric grid, to the generation sub-system and to its commercial operation as a result of progressively increasing deployment of EV. The conceptual approach in this project involves the development of a methodology consisting of two synergetic pathways: - Development of a management and control concept that will facilitate the actual transition \u2013 the MERGE concept; - Development of an evaluation suite that consists of methods and programs of modeling, analysis, and optimization of electric networks into which electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure is integrated. The MERGE concept is inspired from consideration of DER deployment but differs in that we consider now the resources to be mobile in terms of their connection to the grid. Analogies will be derived and adapted to the case of mobile resources, which can be either consumers (when in charging mode) or injectors of power (if batteries are delivering power back to the grid). By exploiting a specific computational evaluation suite that is capable of simulating real world power systems (generation, transmission and distribution) for either steady state or dynamic behavior it will be possible to test the adequacy of EV preliminary smart control interfaces that will be developed in the project. It will address comprehensively the impact of EV presence regarding steady state operation, intermittent RES integration, system stability and dynamic behavior, system restoration, regulatory aspects and market arrangements.", 35050.0, 3836136.0, "MERGE", "Electric vehicles charging ahead", "Electric vehicles charging ahead", "Widespread market uptake of hybrid and all-electric vehicles, further considered together as electric vehicles requires careful consideration of the future operation of current electric power systems. Understanding and comparing the impact of such integration given uncontrolled conditions through a careful framework was the purpose of the EU-funded project 'Mobile energy resources in grids of electricity' (http://www.ev-merge.eu/ (MERGE)) . \n\nScientists considered the relevant infrastructure including charging concepts, smart metering and communication technologies.  Advanced simulation tools were then developed to assess the technical, economic and environmental aspects of electric vehicle integration in a holistic way. The study included analysis of steady-state and dynamic behaviours, the use of intermittent renewable energy resources and system stability and restoration schemes. Further, researchers considered regulatory issues, business models and market impact.\n\nOutcomes enabled the team to formulate several concepts for management of large-scale electric vehicle integration including business models and communication schemes. Partners concluded that, while no significant technical problems are expected until 2020 regardless of the charging strategy adopted, this is not the case by 2030. Development of an optimised and standardised charging infrastructure and planned regulatory framework will be necessary to avoid costly investments in network reinforcements. However, scientists emphasised that vehicle owner conformity should always be voluntary, highlighting the need for appropriate incentives. Researchers concluded with policy and regulatory recommendations for the present, intermediate- and long-term integration of electric vehicles.\n\nMERGE has provided the tools necessary to evaluate the operational issues associated with widespread market uptake of electric vehicles. Optimising integration will reduce technical and economic problems in the near future for maximum positive impact.

Biomolecular modelling techniques such as homology modelling, docking, and molecular simulation have advanced tremendously due to world-leading European research, resulting in extreme demands for better computational performance and throughput as these tools are used in applied research and industrial development. This research has direct influence on our daily life in areas such as health and medical applications, the development of new drugs, efficient drug delivery, biotechnology, environment, agriculture and food industry. Life Science is one of the largest and fastest growing communities in need of high-end computing, and it is a critically important industrial sector for Europe. However, compared to some other disciplines, the use of e-Infrastructure is still relatively new - many advanced techniques are not applied commercially due to limited experience.
