Therefore there have been a number of non-destructive techniques developed to inspect, monitor and detect impurities and defects within products in production lines. Existing inspection tools such as X-ray imaging have been used to inspect engineering materials and food products but are subject to health and safety issues as well as large equipment footprint and high cost resulting in unsuitability for many inspection situations. \nStructural health monitoring (SHM) and damage detection techniques are also of great importance in the offshore, civil, mechanical and aeronautical engineering communities, both for safety reasons and because of the economic benefits that can result. The need to be able to detect damage in complex structures has led to the development of a vast range of non-destructive techniques (NDT), of which many are based upon structural vibration analysis. However, the majority of NDT systems for SHM are slow, costly and require long periods of downtime to complete.

This time the partners from the UK, Latvia, Lithuanua, and Sweden will expand their successul experiences to address young people belonging to national or ethnic minority groups. Participating partner organizations agreed that community inclusion and empowerment of youth representing different national and ethnic minority groups is essential for advancement of solidarity, participation and democracy.  We decided to undertake this youth exchange in Latvia as its population has been homogeneous for centuries and this Mobility Project will be our joint step towards the inclusive society facing the necessity to adapt and change to new realities.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the youth exchange are concentrated around:\r\n\r\n- sharing innovative visions and practicing possible ways of social and community inclusion of youth representing national and ethnic minority groups by facilitating non-formal learning process in their local and regional peer led projects;\r\n- exploring how the non-formal education impacts on the lives of young people representing national and ethnic minority groups throughout the \u201cNew Europe\u201d and agreeing action centered strategies that assist young people to address the issues raised;\r\n- making progress in recognition of non-formal learning and peer leaders\u2019 inputs and achievements;\r\n- encouraging full participation and taking on of responsibility by young people in all aspects of the exchange;\r\n- becoming more aware of the conditions other young people live in and the issues that affect youth representing national and ethnic minority groups both locally and in the rest of Europe, and for them to develop confidence regarding their environment;\r\n- identifying the next steps we need to take to create peer-led education products in minority youth groups inclusion and empowerment. \r\n\r\nThe youth exchange will involve young people and youth leaders from the UK, Latvia, Lithuanua, and Sweden (16 pax from each partner country) and will take place in Riga, Latvia.

Therefore, a \u201crecipe\u201d of engaging such committed youth in social entrepreneurship is seen as boosting opportunities for youngsters to provide for themselves and benefit their rural communities.\r\n\r\nSocial entrepreneurship is the attempt to draw upon business techniques and private sector approaches to find solutions to social, cultural, or environmental problems. Social entrepreneurship typically takes into account a positive \"return to society\" and often closely interconnected with the voluntary sector.\r\n\r\nThis 10 days' youth exchange will bring together young people from the UK, Portugal, Sweden, and Latvia to Porto, Portugal from the 28th of September to the 7th of October, 2017 to work on \"recipes\" for social entrepreneurship in rural areas. The developed cookbook of \u201crecipes\u201d will allow to follow up, disseminate, and multiply the developed ideas/projects upon return home.\r\n\r\nWith this project we also want to promote non-formal ways of communication between the participating groups of young people from rural areas by letting them share their ideas, skills and achievements in peer-led workshops.

These youngsters are experiencing exclusion with economical, social and educational challenges to overcome. Empowering them to set socially valuable goals and giving them tools to reach these goals will make our societies healthier and more humanistic.\r\n\r\nWe have planned the programme in a way that it will allow the young people from each country to meet and plan their own national presentations and evenings and then during the exchange they will make a similar active contribution in international teams on their chosen workshop. Workshops will be led by youngsters themselves and will allow their skill or talent or achievement in certain field to be shared with other participants in the peer group. Then they will make an effort to make this work towards the benefit of the local community or a local target group through the developed social entrepreneurship projects in accordance with the OPEN SPACE technology.\r\n\r\nDuring the exchange we will use activities, workshops, presentations, facilitated exchange of experiences and best practices.

Innovative thinking speeds up and improves the very meaning of community volunteering, making it more Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-bound.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this Mobility project belongs to the young people who feel certain that such international Youth Exchange can create innovation-friendly environment that makes it easier for great ideas to be turned into community-oriented projects.\r\n\r\nThe project will bring together partner organizations from the UK, Estonia, Turkey and Lithuania. The exchange will take place in Lentvaris, Lithuania. Each country will be represented by 15 young people and 3 youth peer leaders. The idea can be further developed in local projects after the exchange and serve as an inspiration for developing follow-up projects by the participants who will establish new contacts for future co-operation. Furthermore, the participants will be introduced to a set of brand new methods and tools for generating ideas and developing strategies for successful project implementation, get familiarized with the basic tools in project making/project management. The exchange will shed light on the objectives, strategies, project phases and evaluation guidelines and enable the participants to share their best practices and start the process of developing ideas for future co-operations.\r\n\r\nThe target group for this exchange is young people with lesser socio-economic opportunities motivated to improve their knowledge, skills and understanding to play an effective role in society, to become visible as a members of their communities. In addition, these young people are motivated to become more self-confident and develop a sense of responsibility for themselves as well as their surroundings. Their careful selection is one of the main aspects of this youth exchange to be taken care of by all the partner organisations.\r\n\r\nThe approach used during the exchange itself will be workshop based, which will include discussions, sharing of ideas and practical activity e.g. role play, world caf\u00e9, open spaces etc. to aid learning. Young people from partner groups will also prepare artistic, creative workshops in a medium of their own choice. This will not only provide opportunities for exploring the theme of active citizenship but will also act as a means of inclusion and intercultural learning as they are prepared to run the workshops with mixed nationality groups and also to publicise it to the local young people and public in the vicinity of the exchange. This will also ensure that the young people have been involved in the design and implementation of the programme.\r\n\r\nThe exchange will have a strong non-formal empowerment / training dimension pursued in workshops of World Caf\u00e9, Open Spaces and other strong non-formal education tools. These tools will aim to introduce participants to concepts such as citizenship, human rights, diversity, democracy and civil society.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this project can greatly contribute to the personal development of  participants. In the series of workshops participants will learn:\r\n\r\n- using imagination to consider the situation of others;\r\n- about the barriers to volunteering and active citizenship and ways to overcome those barriers;\r\n- analysing the role of community;\r\n- the difference between positive and negative action;\r\n- that everyone can make a difference;\r\n- the variety of ways in which a person can be an active citizen.\r\n\r\nThis project will also have a strong European dimension and stimulate reflection on the emerging European society and its values. European dimension of the project will be developed by all the partners together, as they intend to extend such projects among young people of multinational communities, basing on interlinked educational activities.

These young people should be inspired and empowered to develop the sense of youth initiative and belonging to the community.\r\n\r\nThe participating partner organisations from the UK, Sweden, Latvia, and Turkey will come to Riga, Latvia for the Advance Planning Visit and then for 11-day youth exchange. The participants of the exchange will be 14 young people (including those with poor school performance and early school-leavers) and 2 group leaders from the participating organisations.\r\n\r\nThe project is aiming to promote the idea of community volunteering among young people with poor school performance and early school-leavers. We will use the inspiration elements in order to encourage participants of this exchange to think innovatively about the ways of active participation in their communities. This youth exchange will provide the young people with creative, adaptable tools and inspiration to increase their sense of youth initiative and belonging to the community. This aspect of thinking will open up new opportunities, give way to an array of creative solutions and help to rethink the existing obstacles that hinder the achievement of the desired educational outcomes.\r\n\r\nUsing non-formal education methods and activities (such as experiential workshops, simulations exercises and community interaction), the youth exchange aims at implementing an inspiring, active and creative space for the development of new ideas and exploring possibilities for the youth.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n\r\n- To bring confidence and inspiration to young people with poor school performance and early school-leavers to continue education and be creative;\r\n- To equip the participants with new skills of learning, show them different approaches to learning, and prove that education can and should be attractive and fun;\r\n- To understand and develop the sense of youth initiative and belonging to the community as well as to promote the idea of community volunteering among young people with poor school performance and early school-leavers;\r\n- To focus on knowledge, skills and attitudes young people need for becoming active citizens and how they can be acquired;\r\n- To encourage young people with poor school performance and early school-leavers to practice active participation in their local communities;\r\n- To show the participants how to disseminate the knowledge and skills they acquired to their peers;\r\n- To stimulate teamwork of the participating partners by enabling informal community networks and organisations to evolve the results of this project further.\r\n\r\nThis youth exchange will provoke both personal progress and social integration, helping young people to become integrated into society and making them more self-motivated. The projects will also stimulate young people to reflect on the essential characteristics of European society and, above all, encourage them to play an active role in their communities and make aware that they are European citizens. After taking part in such activity young people will certainly value the experience they have gained. They will make friends with young people from different countries and of various nationalities, learn a lot about various parts of Europe, its shared values and its heritage.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the exchange and its results will also be transferred and used in the participating partner organisations according to the agreements drawn between the participants and the partner organisations. As a result of the activity the participating partner organisations will support realisation of the projects developed by the participants with the aim to engage more young people with poor school performance and early school-leavers in community volunteering.", "http://www.youngpeoplefirst.org.uk", "YOUNG PEOPLE FIRST (MIDLANDS)", "erasmus_2017-2-UK01-KA105-036953_coordinator"], ["3JE", "Act Youth-ful: Facilitating social inclusion and employability skills of young people representing ethnic minority groups", "YOUNG PEOPLE FIRST (MIDLANDS)", 38486.0, "As our European society is becoming more diverse due to both internal and external migration flows, the period of ethnically homogeneous nation-states is receding into European history. However, our partnership believes that we need to maintain solidarity and social cohesion, which make the successful integration of national / ethnic minority groups vital in order for the European Social Model to prosper.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this youth exchange was developed in the course of youth encounters in 2015-2016 where the young people met to work on community oriented initiatives of social inclusion of disadvantaged youth. This time the partners from the UK, Latvia, Romania, and Turkey will expand their successul experiences to address young people belonging to national or ethnic minority groups. Participating partner organizations agreed that community inclusion and empowerment of young people representing different national and ethnic minority groups is essential for advancement of solidarity, participation and democracy. We decided to undertake this youth exchange in Latvia as its population has been homogeneous for centuries and this Mobility Project will be our joint step towards the inclusive society facing the necessity to adapt and change to new realities.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the youth exchange are concentrated around:\r\n\r\n- sharing innovative visions and practicing possible ways of social and community inclusion of young people representing national and ethnic minority groups by facilitating non-formal learning process in their local and regional peer led projects;\r\n- exploring how the non-formal education impacts on the lives of young people representing national and ethnic minority groups throughout the \u201cNew Europe\u201d and agreeing action centered strategies that assist young people to address the issues raised;\r\n- making progress in recognition of non-formal learning and peer leaders\u2019 inputs and achievements;\r\n- encouraging full participation and taking on of responsibility by young people in all aspects of the exchange;\r\n- becoming more aware of the conditions other young people live in and the issues that affect youth representing national and ethnic minority groups both locally and in the rest of Europe, and for them to develop confidence regarding their environment;\r\n- identifying the next steps we need to take to create peer-led education products in minority youth groups inclusion and empowerment.\r\n\r\nThe youth exchange will involve young people and youth leaders from the UK, Latvia, Romania, and Turkey (16 participants from each partner country) and will take place in Riga, Latvia. Two representatives from each partner organization will take part in the APV (Advance Planning Visit) where they will establish project delivery roles and share responsibilities for various aspects of the youth exchange. The APV will take place in Riga, Latvia a month before the exchange.\r\n\r\nThe target group for this youth exchange is young people mostly with a difficult social background, balanced about national / ethnic minority background and facing employment difficulties. The young people - participants of the exchange will have different experiences in intercultural contacts from nil to quite experienced peer leaders and ex EVS volunteers. By using knowledge and experience got during the previous projects and involving suitable methods and ensuring that the project is firmly rooted within the local community, we hope that this youth exchange will give the possibility of reaching out to young people representing different national and ethnic minority groups widely in Europe.\r\n\r\nThis exchange will create interlinked educational environment as the participants will share their personal impressions about peer eduaction, non-formal educational means, and we intend to evolve their knowledge and skills by integrating them into the society and thus raising their employability. The methods of non-formal education such as using facilitated discussion, developing positive relations and delivering projects will engage young people in the exchange. The actions and performances developed by youth, young leaders and peer educators during the exchange to publicise and promote minority youth inclusion and employability will help them and other youngsters recognize/multiply the value of such experience.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this exchange is that advantages gained and skills acquired will be used not only by participants of the project but also spread around local youth groups and the organizations that take part in such intercultural follow up projects will relate this to both a local and European context.\r\n\r\nThe Erasmus+ programme will be also explored and promoted which will lead to follow-up projects and usage of the skills gained during this exchange in them in terms of paying more attention to the topics of Dissemination and Transfer of Skills / Knowledge from the project.", "http://www.youngpeoplefirst.org.uk", "YOUNG PEOPLE FIRST (MIDLANDS)", "erasmus_2017-2-UK01-KA105-036970_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CV31"}
