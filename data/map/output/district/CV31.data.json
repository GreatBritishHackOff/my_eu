CITI-SENSE will develop, test, demonstrate and validate a community-based environmental monitoring and information system using innovative and novel Earth Observation applications.\nTo achieve this, the project will: (i) raise environmental awareness in citizens, (ii) raise user participation in societal environmental decisions and (iii) provide feedback on the impact that citizens had in decisions. It will address the call\u2019s request for effective participation by citizens in environmental stewardship, based on broad stakeholder and user involvement in support of both community and policy priorities. The project aims to learn from citizen experience and perception and enable citizenship co-participation in community decision making and co-operative planning.\nThe concept of CITI-SENSE rests on three pillars: technological platforms for distributed monitoring; information and communication technologies; and societal involvement. Three pilot case studies will focus on a range of services related to environmental issues of societal concern: combined environmental exposure and health associated with air quality; noise and development of public spaces, and indoor air at schools. Attention will be given to representativeness of citizen participation. The case studies will be designed in collaboration with citizens\u2019 groups and decision makers. They will be based on distributed data collection using innovative static, portable and personal devices (low-cost reliable microsensor packs) that communicate with a data repositories through mobile phones or other devices. Development of participatory methods, data management strategies, and applications to facilitate exploitation of the data and information for policy, and society, will be done.", 242348.0, 9805573.0, "CITI-SENSE", null, null, null, "http://www.citi-sense.eu/", "http://www.geotech.co.uk", null, "fp7_106482_954160289"], ["3PL", "Non-contact Near Infra-Red insPEction and monitoRing For Evaluation of ComposiTes", "Inspection Technologies Ltd", "Increasing automation and demands for quality in production (food, pharmaceuticals, non-metals such as polymers and composite components etc.) has resulted in visual and optical inspection by humans becoming impractical in certain situations. Therefore there have been a number of non-destructive techniques developed to inspect, monitor and detect impurities and defects within products in production lines. Existing inspection tools such as X-ray imaging have been used to inspect engineering materials and food products but are subject to health and safety issues as well as large equipment footprint and high cost resulting in unsuitability for many inspection situations. \nStructural health monitoring (SHM) and damage detection techniques are also of great importance in the offshore, civil, mechanical and aeronautical engineering communities, both for safety reasons and because of the economic benefits that can result. The need to be able to detect damage in complex structures has led to the development of a vast range of non-destructive techniques (NDT), of which many are based upon structural vibration analysis. However, the majority of NDT systems for SHM are slow, costly and require long periods of downtime to complete. They also struggle to give structural information on near surface (<10 mm) layers. \nWe have developed an innovative and new form of NDT, based on Near Infrared (NIR) inline inspection and detection of defects, which has been validated for non-metallic engineering materials and is capable of providing a rapid, more informative and cost effective NDT solution for composite manufacturers and end users. \nThe NIR-PERFECT project will therefore develop a more robust business plan for this new NIR NDT inspection and monitoring system. This will then enable us to define end user specifications and allows us to align our engineering approaches to further optimise the system to meet future end user requirements.", 38122.0, 54461.0, "NIR-PERFECT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.inspectiontechnologies.co.uk", null, "h2020_194720_952033952"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CV31"}
