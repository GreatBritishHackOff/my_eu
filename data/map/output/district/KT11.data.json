However, data sources are typically fragmented and contain information gaps which prevent their full exploitation. EMIF aims to address this by developing a common Information Framework that enables improved access to these data sources, enhancement through linkage of the different sources and collection of additional new information. EMIF will focus on two specific research objectives in order to guide the development of the Information Framework:  identification and evaluation of biomarkers i) of the risk for metabolic complications in obesity; ii) of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease onset in the preclinical and prodromal phase, which in both cases will identify high-risk individuals for future intervention trials. To achieve this, a variety of data sources ranging from small-scale information-rich disease cohorts for biomarker discovery to large EHR data for population characterisation and biomarker validation will be utilised. An extreme phenotype approach will utilise the subpopulations at the extremes of a particular trait distribution using large-scale metabolomics and proteomics for biomarker evaluation. The development of the Information Framework will involve addressing data standards, semantic interoperability as well as ethics, data privacy, legal issues and the development of an IT platform for multi data sources access. The Information Framework will be designed to support the current research objectives, but more generally studies using human health data.

The common off-label use of metformin for treating PCOS in children appears to have no greater risk than that in adults; drug tolerance is good with limited adverse effects. However, clinical trials are needed and requested by EMA to validate the safety and efficacy of this agent in PCOS.\nIn January 2012, the EMA released a revised priority list of PUMA generic medicines and Metformin was identified as a requested drug for treatment of PCOS in children. The call requests data on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety in this indication. A PIP was submitted to EMA in August 2012. In its final opinion of 17 May 2013 the PDCO recommend to agree to the PIP. The PDCO and the consortium have agreed that by restricting exposure to no more than 2000 mg metformin / day, no additional pharmacokinetic investigations are required or even requested by EMA.\nMETFIZZ will conduct the required product development and clinical studies to establish efficacy and safety of administering age-appropriate innovative effervescent soluble formulations of metformin.

Therapeutic cooling is effective in reducing ischaemic brain injury following cardiac arrest, and hypothermia is therefore considered by experts the most promising treatment for patients with acute ischaemic stroke, next to reperfusion strategies.\nThe EuroHYP-1 trial is a pan-European, open, randomised, phase III clinical trial which will assess the benefit or harm of therapeutic cooling in 800 awake adult patients with acute ischaemic stroke.

Besides this, the team recruited a central lab, packaging and labelling as well as a central electrocardiogram facility.

Radio communications networks used by public safety and the emergency services will normally be used to provide Public Protection.  Most public safety organisations have the capability to rapidly deploy mobile communications network elements to provide additional capacity and/or maintain communications if the main network fails.
