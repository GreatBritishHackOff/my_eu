Since then we have successfully trained 16 staff across the curriculum and this year will send 12 students to Norway on work placements. The College recognises the far-reaching impact such experiences have had and how this can be extended further to include students and staff in other curriculum areas. The College set up a wheel of internationalisation (WOI) to identify 4 stages of international involvement and map these against each curriculum area, prioritising those areas whose students would most benefit from a European experience. This has formed the basis for the internationalisation of our curriculum and we are now entering an exciting stage where we are closer to achieving the final stage which is ECVET.\r\n\r\nIn this current project, we have identified our core curriculum as the next developmental stage for staff training in another European country.  This includes the Apprenticeships and Work-Based Learning team, and Maths teachers, all of which are seeking ways to be more innovative in the delivery and management of their programmes in order to improve skills and get more young people into work. Finland is recognised for its excellent education system so 5 members of these teams will travel to Savonlinna College in Finland to achieve the following:\r\n1. To share best practice with peers both in College and in other European countries.\r\n2. To broaden their knowledge of vocational training in Europe.\r\n3. To internationalise the College curriculum.\r\n4. To improve the teaching and learning of Maths in vocational areas by implementing new methodologies.\r\n5. To create a local labour market better-equipped to enter careers where contact with other cultures is necessary.\r\n6. To help prevent isolation and radicalisation of students.\r\n7. To raise the profile of the EU among young people on the Isle of Wight and what it means to be a European citizen.\r\n8. To learn how to implement measures to improve employer engagement.\r\n9. To learn how to motivate young people and employers to engage in the Apprenticeship system in the UK by sharing best practice.\r\n10. To understand the ECVET system and how this might be applied to College programmes of study.\r\n\r\nThe second strand of our project stems from a staff training visit by lecturers from Hospitality, Business and Travel and Tourism to Guadeloupe. There they recognised the benefits that might be gained by sending their students on a brief work placement in another country. However, they also recognised that most benefit would be gained from working in a large city rather than another island. Therefore we plan to send 30 students from these curriculum areas to Barcelona to learn about catering, hospitality, tourism and business in a major international city. Before the students go they will organise between them an awareness event about Barcelona and Spain generally to raise the profile of their visit in college and to help them complete the Event Management unit on their course. They will learn vocationally relevant Spanish and will complete the work placement element of their qualification. In addition Travel and Tourism students will complete a Travel Agency Day with the International Department in order to teach them the logistics of preparing a visit.\r\n\r\nOn their return, staff and students will make presentations to their peers, parents, schools and local employers in order to raise awareness of the benefits and positive impacts that the mobilities create.\r\n\r\nWe envisage that, as a result of this project we will have a better informed staff and student cohort who are more aware and better informed about the opportunities for working, living and studying in other European countries. Students participating in the mobilities will improve their linguistic competence and learn new skills which will help improve their confidence and their career opportunities due to their improved CVs. They will be more open to embracing different cultures and therefore less at risk of radicalisation. Staff will have learnt from their peers, exchanged ideas and shared best practice forming a basis for future sustainable collaboration with European partners.  Through their dissemination of their findings, participating staff can inform the College senior leadership team of best practice, providing them with the opportunity to consider implementing new strategies, which in turn will enhance the student experience and their future.\r\n\r\nIn the long term the impact of the dissemination of this project will lead to further internationalisation of all curriculum areas with student and staff exchanges.

The educational community will participate in conducting and broadcasting the project.  \r\nOngoing activities are defined by their own training programs of each field, and adapted to the company where the student will develop its practice. \r\nTo carry out this project a cooperative methodology has been used, integrating the stated needs of the students, the chances of having quality partners, the personal interests of the students, and the ability and knowledge of teachers and tutors who design and manage the programs.
