Current methods for wall and floor insulation are disruptive, labour intensive and can be very costly. This severely limits the uptake and discourages most stakeholders from undertaking insulation works\n \nSolving this technical challenge would open up a clear and well defined business opportunity. Driven by legislative targets to reduce energy consumption, this translates into a vast market and an immense aggregate welfare benefits to society.\n \nTo meet this demand, Q-Bot has developed an innovative process using a remotely controlled robotic device that can survey, assess and apply insulation. For both under floor and solid wall insulation Q-Bot radically reduces the time, cost and disruption compared to traditional methods.\n \nThe project will work with key stakeholders to further understand their needs. By preparing an in-depth market study and an Innovation Strategy Development plan, Q-Bot aims to effectively target high potential markets.

Our innovative solution meets these needs by providing a value for money, light sensitive sensor that produces high definition images of non-illuminated areas at night and in low light conditions.\nCurrent technology suffers from poor light conversion and sensitivity therefore, to see at night and in low light conditions, the scene needs to be illuminated. Our proposal is to improve sensitivity by using sensors with organic compounds that are sensitive to background sky radiation (1.5 micron). We will also develop Application Specific Integrated Circuits to process the sensor output. The novelty in our innovation is the integration of new technologies and the processing of data produced by a 1.5 micron organic sensor. This will deliver high resolution images at night and in low light conditions.\nOur solution will reduce the energy required to illuminate urban soft targets and critical infrastructure. Added benefits include a reduction in light pollution and that surveillance can be carried out in areas which have lighting restrictions. The development of a proven, production ready system is the ultimate aim of the project. In Phase 1 we will carry out a feasibility study to verify the technological, practical and economic viability of our proposal. Our feasibility study will consider the results of relevant European and International research.\nWe plan to further develop our prototype and carry out a small-scale demonstration of our innovative solution. The results of Phase1 will inform the direction of our future development activity in Phase 2.

Underfloor insulation is one of the most effective ways of preventing energy loss and draughts but traditional methods are expensive, very disruptive to occupiers and can be hazardous for installers. \n\nQ-Bot is developing an innovative underfloor insulation system that has the potential to improve the energy foot print of millions of Europe's least energy efficient buildings by as much as 25% while reducing installation costs by 50 to 75%. The small robotic device is unique and superior to other underfloor insulation in that it can access uneven and tight spaces and underfloor voids in order to install insulation. The device enables homes, which would otherwise be difficult, expensive and potentially hazardous to treat, to be made much more energy-efficient, at much lower cost and with minimal disruption for the occupier.\n\nQ-Bot's technology has been proven to work in prototype trials (TRL6) and is currently being tested in the field at a small number of customer sites (TRL7). The technology is highly scalable and can be deployed easily within existing distribution systems. Q-Bot has already received orders worth ca. \u00a3150K (\u20ac200K) and Q-Bot's current customers have indicated that they are very interested in using the solution across wider parts of their property portfolios. \n\nDuring Phase 2, Q-Bot will develop a fully working demonstrator (WP2 and WP3), carry out full-scale trials with customers and installers (WP4 and WP5) and prepare further commercial exploitation (WP6).
