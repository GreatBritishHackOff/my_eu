For this purpose, the QualiMaster infrastructure will enable autonomous proactive, reflective and cross-pipeline adaptation, in addition to the more traditional reactive adaptation. Starting from configurable stream processing pipelines, adaptation will be based on quality-aware component description, pipelines optimization and the systematic exploitation of families of approximate algorithms with different quality/performance tradeoffs. However, adaptation will not be restricted to the software level alone: We will go a level further by investigating the systematic translation of stream processing algorithms into code for reconfigurable hardware and the synergistic exploitation of such hardware-based processing in adaptive high performance large-scale data processing.

Cost estimates by EU governments indicate that billions of euros will be spent over several decades to implement WFD. There is an increasing level of concern on the implementation cost (financial and carbon). Integrated water quality models designed to predict the quality of water across the linked urban and rural scales in a catchment is seen as a tool to optimise this cost. Integrated Catchment Modelling (ICM) is based on linking numerous empirically calibrated sub-models of water quality processes.  Catchment scale WQ predictions are then used to justify investment. Current water quality sub-models contain significant uncertainty.  Methods have been developed to quantify uncertainty at a level however little work has been carried out to investigate WQ uncertainty propagation between sub-models. QUICS will develop a generalised catchment wide approach to uncertainty assessment that can then be used in WFD implementation studies. It will address uncertainty propagation at the spatial and temporal scales found in catchments and develop tools to reduce uncertainty by optimising sampling and monitoring and the objective selection of model structure.

Although cardiovascular mortality rates, adjusted for age, are generally declining, the prevalence of IHD is increasing due to the emergence of new risk factors.\n\nIn order to further reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, better prevention and management of IHD is needed. A common technique for the diagnosis of IHD is invasive coronary angiography, but its current diagnostic yeld is suboptimal mainly due to underutilization of non-invasive tests prior to the invasive study.\n\nThe EU-funded EVINCI-STUDY project investigated the diagnostic accuracy of combining non-invasive anatomical information from computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) with functional information from stress imaging. The aim is to achieve earlier non-invasive detection and characterisation and thus better management of IHD. Project partners performed the investigations in a cohort of 697 patients with suspected IHD, and low-intemediate probability of disease, selected from 14 clinical centres across Europe.\n\nComparison of several imaging techniques for their diagnostic accuracy to detect obstructive coronary disease and predict revascularization revealed that CTCA had better diagnostic performance than stress imaging. Perfusion based imaging techniques (Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET)) had greater sensitivity, while wall motion based techniques (echocardiogram (ECHO) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)) had greater specificity. In addition, integration of CTCA with functional imaging increased diagnostic accuracy of functional imaging alone.\n\nProject members implemented a multimodal electronic tool to enable the organisation and visualization of all available information (clinical, biological and cardiac imaging) for a single patient. This ensured easy presentation of the integrated information at multiple levels of complexity to specialists and referring physicians, including medical practitioners.\n\nIn years to come, there will hopefully be a reduction in the use of invasive procedures, inappropriate revascularisation and health costs due to poor management.

The detection of anomalies will trigger fast re-scheduling and re-optimization.\nCoPro will demonstrate advanced plant-wide and site-wide coordination and control in five typical use cases that cover a wide range of sectors of the process industries, and the whole value chain:\n- Petrochemical production site\n- Base chemicals and polymer production site\n- Recycling system in cellulose production\n- Consumer product formulation and packaging plant\n- Food processing plant\nIn addition,CoPro will develop methods for the coordination of plants in industrial parks that belong to different companies, thus providing a basis for future industrial symbiosis.\nCoPro pays special attention to the role of operators and managers in plant-wide control solutions and to the deployment of advanced solutions in industrial sites with a heterogeneous IT environment. As the effort required for the development and maintenance of accurate plant models is the bottleneck for the development and long-term operation of advanced control and scheduling solutions, CoPro will develop methods for efficient modelling and for model quality monitoring and model adaption", 336432.0, 5705321.0, "CoPro", null, null, null, null, "http://www.psenterprise.com", null, "h2020_205426_998066272"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9SJ", "Wild Way Of The Vikings", "MARA MEDIA LTD", 133332.0, "The Vikings were the first human beings to cross the Atlantic Ocean.

A report of the European Commission from 2012 proposes \"Rethinking of Education: investing in skills for better socio-economic outcomes\".

It includes 2 volunteers hosted in Lous\u00e3 for 12 months: 1 volunteer by ARCIL and 1 hosted by Bloom. It also includes 4 volunteers hosted in Figueira da Foz for 12 months: 2 in the Hosting Organization APAFF, and 2 volunteers in a new Hosting Organisation: Cavalo Amigo. In this project we invite volunteers from: Finland, Italy, Spain, France, United Kingdom and Cyprus.\r\nThe target groups of the host organization ARCIL are mainly children, youth and young adults with and without disabilities. The organization has from the beginning a special sensibility for the youth problems and realities. The second organization APAFF works on awareness of animal rights for the local community.  The mission of the hosting organization Cavalo Amigo is to help improve the lives of people with disabilities and special needs that can benefit from horse riding and other equine related activities. And the 4th organization Bloom works in order to support, consult, develop and implement social, cultural and educational projects with a national and international dimension, to empower initiatives and organizations, in the local community, mainly addressed to youth.\r\n\r\nHosting a young European is a good opportunity to work on awareness and inform the target groups, our team and the local community, especially young people, to the importance of inter cultural activities as a way to exchange knowledge, practices and to experience different activities. Hosting European volunteers represents a helpful human resource and is motivating our teams. At the same time, we know that these volunteers will be also considered like \u201csomething special\u201d for the town, people and institutions. \r\n\r\nThe volunteers are going to help the host organizations with organizing different activities like leisure time activities with children, youth and adults with and without special needs, helping in adoption campaigns for animals, awareness activities for animal rights, etc. The volunteers will give a helping hand in organizing special events, like information session on schools and promotion campaigns in fairs. The methodology we use will be based on non formal learning, inter cultural learning and learning by doing.\r\nWe hope that the volunteers can also be always a new way for information for the young people of Lous\u00e3 and Figueira da Foz: in fact, the young people living in isolated area sometimes don\u2019t know the possibilities offered by Erasmus Plus and it\u2019s one of the reasons of their no- participation. In February 2008 we received the first European volunteer in ARCIL, and now it jas hosted 19 participants. In APAFF is the 4th participating. For Bloom and Cavalo Amigo it is going to be the first Hosting project. Each of the projects until so far gave us fantastic results and we are ready to continue the process of continuously hosting volunteers in Lous\u00e3 and Figueira da Foz. At the same time another organisation is hosting a volunteer. It\u2019s very useful if there are more projects occurred at the same time: for volunteers and for the promoting of the programme Erasmus Plus. It gives us a tool to collaborate together and build a structure in our region.\r\n\r\nWe foresee that this project has an important impact for the volunteers involved, the organizations and the local community. The volunteers will bring a new intercultural dimension in the organizations and the local community.
