Initially working with the EFPIA members the collaborators of CHEM21 will analyse a number of projects that are in development to decide which the priorities are for technology development. This analysis will also be used to update the literature of green technology based on updating previous papers.\nThe technology being developed is divided into three work packages based on chemical catalysis and synthetic methods, biocatalysis and synthetic biology. The first effort will investigate the use of a range of catalysts with a main focus on replacing and applying catalysts based on common metals rather than the precious metal based catalysts that have limitations of sustainable supply. Use of continuous reactors and process intensification will also be addressed as well as fluorination chemistry. In biocatalysis a range of projects based on the needs identified by the chemical round table have been chosen including amide synthesis, stereo- and regio-specific hydroxylation of complex molecules as well as other redox reactions. Again process engineering and supercritical solvents will be developed as intensification methods. In the third part the development of the emerging field of synthetic biology will be addressed with the development of enzymatic chemical cascade pathways in fermentation strains with freedom to operate to produce targets of interest.\nFinally the outcomes of the efforts described will be incorporated into education and training efforts to produce the next generation of process chemists with a good understanding of green and sustainable metrics.", 187172.0, 20865339.0, "CHEM21", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_203703_959972432"], ["7NW", "New manufacturing infrastructure for the production of high quality Natural Fibres", "Incontrol Ultrasonics Ltd", "Natural fibres offer a route to the production of sustainable composites, replacing inorganic and petrochemical based fibres with high-embodied energy.

Chemical treatments have been used to modify fibres to improve matrix to fibre adhesion in composite materials. However, these chemical treatments use hazardous materials, are time-consuming and create a significant level of waste. Therefore, a treatment process that does not pose a threat to the natural environment and that is reproducible, whilst creating little or no hazardous waste, would be extremely advantageous.

Despite stringent health & safety standards over 50% of UK road workers reported a near miss with a vehicle and the large majority of injuries or fatalities occur within designated safety areas. These safe zones are either protected by positive protection systems such as concrete barriers or soft barriers such as traffic cones. The latter are mainly used for temporary works. In such a scenario cones may be the only protection a road worker has from traffic. Due to the maturity of Europe\u2019s road network and the rapid deterioration as a result of heavy traffic and weather conditions, temporary road work is increasing. In addition to concerns about safety, preparation of these temporary barriers is a major drain on resources. As a lot of roadwork is carried out at night, barriers are equipped with lanterns. These are typically powered by disposable batteries which only last a short period of time and have to be changed frequently. The Safelane consortium have successfully developed  a wireless perimeter protection system that detects an impact to a temporary barrier. However,  there are several significant technical hurdles that currently prevent the development of a system that can be applied to every road maintenance scenario. In Safelane we propose to develop an all-encompassing system including; a Smart re-chargeable lantern battery with integrated wireless impact sensor; a Smart alarm base station capable of receiving alerts from individual impact sensors, to warn the workforce; and a device management system enabling road maintenance contractors to effectively manage temporary work sites via a web based graphical user interface. The new Safelane system will therefore help provide early warning of temporary road work barrier breaches and will eliminate the need for manual changing of lantern batteries, reducing battery disposal by over 90%.", 215724.0, 960605.0, "Safelane", "Roadwork cones go high-tech", "Roadwork cones go high-tech", "One of the most dangerous occupations in the world is road maintenance, which has injured many workers on the job, especially in temporary roadworks.

Such barriers are not ideal for safety and are also not cost effective, requiring as well adequate lighting as much roadwork is done at night.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'An all-encompassing, intelligent safety and asset management system for highway maintenance' (http://www.safelane.fp7.co (SAFELANE)) is helping to bolster safety and safeguard the lives of road maintenance workers. Based on existing Intellicone technology, which employs sensors, lighting and wireless communications to enhance the safety of temporary work zones, the project is working on an improved solution to roadwork.\n\nMore specifically, the project team is developing an innovative battery system that can be charged in\u00a0situ. It is bringing cost efficiency and reliability to roadwork sites, in addition to avoiding use of millions of batteries that end up in landfills or that are destined for recycling. SAFELANE is also integrating its safety system with current road maintenance and management computer networks and systems in order to achieve more cost savings and better reporting of incidents.\n\nAlready, the team has enhanced the Intellicone technology with improved data-logging mechanisms and sensors for vehicle impacts. It conducted trials and observed the results using high-speed video and impact sensor data. The team also built mechanisms to detect deliberate and malicious removal of the cones to minimise vandalism and enhance safety. \n\nTest results demonstrated the benefits of the Intellicone Safelane technology in reducing risk and strengthening safety. Work is continuing on specifications and design of the smart battery and mass-induction system based on wireless charging technology. \n\nWhen the project results are fully exploited, Europe's roads stand to become safer and more secure.
