The accessibility technologies we have are meeting the needs of only some, at high cost, and will not work with many new technologies. The path and pace of technological change predestines these approaches to fail in the very near future. At the same time the incidence of disabilities is increasing as our population ages.The same technical advances however hold the potential for a radical paradigm shift in our approach to accessibility that can harness the pace of innovation and have it work for us rather than against us. An international consortium is forming to tap the unprecedented ability to pool resources and match demand with supply enabled by the Cloud to build a Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII) that can deliver accessibility to every individual where they need it, when they need it and in a way that matches their unique requirements; automatically so that they do not need to negotiate, explain, qualify or justify.Cloud4All represents a European based effort to advance the GPII concept by pulling together a large multi-sector international community including stakeholders, industry leaders and experts in emerging technologies to thoughtfully research, design, develop and test the key software infrastructure and pilot implementations needed to explore this promising approach to digital inclusion. Cloud4All will do this by:-Creating/refining user profiling standards and tools capable of capturing the individual needs and preferences of the full range of users facing interface barriers-Creating/refining interface and materials profiling standards and tools capable of characterizing the full range of ICT/materials users need to access and the different techniques and strategies for accessing them-Improving mechanisms to match users and with interfaces and materials they can use or techniques or services that can make them usable-Creating a mechanism to allow users to locate solutions from many different sources in a single search-Demonstrating automatic, on-demand, matching or modification of mainstream and specialized technologies\u2028to match each individual as they encounter them, including proof-of-concept demonstrations of this approach across a spectrum of technologies including: Computer OSs and Browsers; Web pages/Apps; Mobiles; Kiosks/Info-Transaction Machines; Installed and Virtual Assistive Technologies; Digital Televisions and Smart Homes-Testing of the concept with users with a wide variety and combination of physical, sensory, cognitive, language, and learning disabilitiesIf successful, this approach may give us our first chance of reaching the large group of users that do not qualify for or otherwise have not been reached by special services, but nonetheless face barriers to access that prevent them from participating in our rapidly advancing digitally enabled society.", 63605.0, 10454611.0, "CLOUD4all", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_101353_963914318"], ["2RU", "Easy Reading: A Framework for Personalised Cognitive Accessibility when using Original Digital Content", "Texthelp Ltd", "The \u201cEasy Reading\u201d framework will improve the cognitive accessibility of original digital documents by providing real time personalisation through annotation (using e.g. symbol, pictures, videos), adaptation (using e.g. layout, structure) and translation (using e.g Easy-to-Read, Plain Language, symbol writing systems). The framework provides these (semi-)automated services using HCI techniques (e.g. pop-ups/ Text-To-Speech (TTS)/captions through mouse-over or eye-tracking) allowing the user to remain and work within the original digital document. This fosters independent access and keeps the user in the inclusive discourse about the original content. Services adapt to each user through a personal profile (sensor based tracking and reasoning of e.g. the level of performance, understanding, preferences, mood, attention, context and the individual learning curve). \nThe interdisciplinary project team includes users with cognitive disabilities in all phases through the Inclusive Participatory Action Research Method (IPAR) ensuring to address real users\u00b4 needs.\nThe \u201cEasy Reading\u201d framework is planned as a cloud based, open source and freely available support infrastructure. It will reach as many people with limited reading and language skills (e.g. people with cognitive disabilities - ~2,5% of the population - older adults, people with a different mother tongue) summing up to 25% in some regions or countries. Additionally, many more people will enjoy exploring new and unfamiliar content using personalised access. \nThis framework integrates and supports state-of-the-art and future R&D.

The RE4-Project targets the demonstration of suitable design concepts and building elements produced from CDW in an industrial environment, considering perspective issues for the market uptake of the developed solutions.
