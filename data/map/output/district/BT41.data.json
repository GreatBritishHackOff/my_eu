The accessibility technologies we have are meeting the needs of only some, at high cost, and will not work with many new technologies. The path and pace of technological change predestines these approaches to fail in the very near future. At the same time the incidence of disabilities is increasing as our population ages.The same technical advances however hold the potential for a radical paradigm shift in our approach to accessibility that can harness the pace of innovation and have it work for us rather than against us. An international consortium is forming to tap the unprecedented ability to pool resources and match demand with supply enabled by the Cloud to build a Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII) that can deliver accessibility to every individual where they need it, when they need it and in a way that matches their unique requirements; automatically so that they do not need to negotiate, explain, qualify or justify.Cloud4All represents a European based effort to advance the GPII concept by pulling together a large multi-sector international community including stakeholders, industry leaders and experts in emerging technologies to thoughtfully research, design, develop and test the key software infrastructure and pilot implementations needed to explore this promising approach to digital inclusion. Cloud4All will do this by:-Creating/refining user profiling standards and tools capable of capturing the individual needs and preferences of the full range of users facing interface barriers-Creating/refining interface and materials profiling standards and tools capable of characterizing the full range of ICT/materials users need to access and the different techniques and strategies for accessing them-Improving mechanisms to match users and with interfaces and materials they can use or techniques or services that can make them usable-Creating a mechanism to allow users to locate solutions from many different sources in a single search-Demonstrating automatic, on-demand, matching or modification of mainstream and specialized technologies\u2028to match each individual as they encounter them, including proof-of-concept demonstrations of this approach across a spectrum of technologies including: Computer OSs and Browsers; Web pages/Apps; Mobiles; Kiosks/Info-Transaction Machines; Installed and Virtual Assistive Technologies; Digital Televisions and Smart Homes-Testing of the concept with users with a wide variety and combination of physical, sensory, cognitive, language, and learning disabilitiesIf successful, this approach may give us our first chance of reaching the large group of users that do not qualify for or otherwise have not been reached by special services, but nonetheless face barriers to access that prevent them from participating in our rapidly advancing digitally enabled society.", 63605.0, 10454611.0, "CLOUD4all", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_101353_963914318"], ["2RU", "Easy Reading: A Framework for Personalised Cognitive Accessibility when using Original Digital Content", "Texthelp Ltd", "The \u201cEasy Reading\u201d framework will improve the cognitive accessibility of original digital documents by providing real time personalisation through annotation (using e.g. symbol, pictures, videos), adaptation (using e.g. layout, structure) and translation (using e.g Easy-to-Read, Plain Language, symbol writing systems).

After 2 years of experience as a Consortium, the strategy of internationalization of the VOCATIONAL TRAINING CENTRE (CFA) has improved and continues to adapt to everybody\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nOur Consortium also got bigger and the number of mobilities almost doubled. The international experiences are seen as a process integrated into the course of training, Masters of Apprenticeship consider them as an increase in value more than a constraint, our foreign partners are involved in a bigger reciprocity today and we work finally on the certification of these experiences.\r\n\r\nNumber of mobilities 2017-2019 :\r\n\u2022 Learners: 154\r\n\u2022 Accompanying persons: 37\r\n\u2022 Members of staff: 31.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Consortium are more numerous and more diversified.

The agricultural and horticultural regional VOCATIONAL TRAINING CENTRE consists of 20 UFA. Every UFA is also constituent center of an EPLEFPA most of the time. Among the 10 members of the Consortium we count as many UFA as High schools and EPLEFPA. This variety of profiles explains that we make demands of mobility for mixed audience (learning and initial training) who have a common route of training. Our project grows richer year after year and the European culture, the exchange of practices, propagate in all these organizations.\r\n\r\n7 institutions composed our Consortium 2015-2017; 3 new UFA have joined the project involving new partners (Spain, the United Kingdom). Therefore, a total of 10 institutions participate in this Consortium EFP for 2017-2019. These 10 institutions have decided to get together to mutualize the initiatives, coordinate the actions, to unite the work force, the technical skills and to benefit from a shared financial management. Mobility resource teams (an education-administration binome task force per institution) are associated to the development of the project to determine orientation, the general and specific objectives, strategy... They are the link between the Regional VOCATIONAL TRAINING CENTRE and the mobilities in every institution.\r\n\r\nThe objective is more than ever to develop and to strengthen individual mobility in these establishments, with a growing demand from the learners, their families and the professional partners. Indeed, the discovery of new skill techniques, the improvement of the foreign language level, the opening to the European citizenship, the improved autonomy in the work field and in everyday life are so many assets approved by all the actors of the mobility.\r\n\r\nThe Consortium II EFP project will be spread out over two years (2017-2019) to facilitate the pedagogy of alternating qualification courses: so according to the seasonality of the sectors and the rhythms of alternation of the UFA, each of them, with the cooperation of the French employers, can schedule the departures of learners, trainers, members of the teams and the associated professionals.\r\nFor the learners, establishments propose mobilities in a company for two or three weeks in agreement with the French employers. This duration provides enough time for the learner to become integrated into the host company and to discover new techniques without penalizing the French employer in his professional activity.\r\n\r\nThe staffs, as for them, will leave from 2 to 7 days for mobility in training centers and partner companies. \r\n154 apprentices and 37 accompanying persons will leave for mobility in Italy, Germany, Romania and Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Spain, The United Kingdom, Ireland \u2026: back to France, they will use the observations made in the partner country, to present their life in a company but also their everyday life.\r\n\r\nThis year we have developed the chapter \"scattering\" and \"valuation\" to take advantage of these experiences to speak about the project. Furthermore, we have launched a more elaborate quality approach to be sure of the relevance of the project and to maintain a reflexive approach.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, profits are multiple: an enrichment of the professional practices for the apprentices and the staffs, an interest generated within the teams and the learners around international exchanges, intercultural exchanges, valuation of the various actors involved in the project, which already impact on the participating establishments.", "http://www.cafre.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036978_2"], ["4PS", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", 2553.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.cafre.ac.uk", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035486_coordinator"], ["4PS", "\u0160irimo obzorja", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", 113611.0, "BIC Ljubljana is applying for a two-year mobility project for VET students and staff.

We will organize mobilities with 10 partners in the UK, Ireland, Cyprus, Finland, Spain, Portugal and France. The choice of partners is based on the needs of individual vocational programme and positive experiences. With the project, we want to achieve general and specific goals related to the professions of the participants.\r\nThe students will gain and/or enrich generic competences such as: health and safety, environmental protection, ICT literacy, social competences, sense of fairness, ethics, career orientation and planning, entrepreneurship, independency, responsibility, ability to organize one\u2019s life abroad, ability to establish contact with citizens of another country, discovering cultural landmarks, learning a foreign language, learning for life.\r\nVeterinarian technicians want to develop students' teamwork skills and improve the level of skills in care for animals. To achieve this they will work in clinics in the UK, Ireland and in an animal shelter in Cyprus.\r\nNature protection technicians will work in Finland in a forestation or in a tree nursery.  They will get familiar with the usage of biomass.\r\nConfectioners will work in workshops in Spain, France and Portugal and will learn how to make local deserts. They will experience the communication process with clients and suppliers. Food processing and nutrition technicians will work in olive plantation (picking olives) and in olive oil processing in Spain. \r\n We organize the activities in cooperation with several partners. Some of them have been our partners for a number of years. The Spanish partner will host a larger number of food processing and nutrition technicians, since the work placements in the olive oil processing offered very good quality. Portuguese partner will host a large group of nature protection technicians, butchers, confectioners and biotechnology students. For the first time we are sending an entrepreneur to Finland. The activities are usually planned bilaterally so BIC Ljubljana also hosts students and staff from partner organizations.\r\nWe expect the project to be a positive influence for the participants as well as for our organization. Participants improve their generic and vocational competences and the organization will gain new European experience, staff and student motivation for work, new knowledge and skills to be included in the learning process.
