YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, etc.). Thus they will experiment \"marketing\" a video or other informational content online, and they will test different possible strategies and corresponding outcomes. They will find out about online communities for informational content sharing. They will debate about youth involvement in participative culture through online media. They will learn how to guide their target public in choosing the most appropriate vehicle for online content.\r\n\r\nIn this module, participants will also debate on and learn about video sharing platforms specifically geared to the needs of educators, for example, Academic Earth, MIT open courseware, Ted-ed, TeacherTube, YouTube EDU. These are all websites which were founded with the goal of giving everyone on earth access to a world-class education. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipants requirements:\r\n\r\nFor this training we are targeting youth workers who are already active in digital mediation or who are willing to work on such topics in the future. No prior knowledge about the topics of the training is required. \r\nParticipants must be willing to innovate their professional practices and to disseminate the results of the project.\r\n\r\nThe international training course \u2018Digital Mediation; Redefining digital culture within youth organizations\u2019 will be hosted in Larnaca by \u2018CIP\u2019 from 2 to 8/May/2018 in cooperation with partner organizations from the following 15 countries: Germany,  Greece, France, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Croatia, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Bulgaria, United Kingdom and Spain.

While discussing important issues around effective dissemination of information, we discovered that animation offers new, powerful and much needed communication tools that can be easily embraced by any type of organizations and individuals. As such, animated content can easily be used: \r\n- as an educational tool (especially in training or teaching)\r\n- to ensure better dissemination, visibility and promotion of various causes\r\n- as a form of artistic expression (with therapeutic elements), when voicing out ones needs, etc. \r\n\r\nAIM and OBJECTIVES: \r\n\r\nInspired by the learning outcomes of the German course, participants\u2019 enthusiastic feedback, as well as our Greek partner\u2019s over 10 years of experience related to animations, we decided to take the theme further afield. Hence, we have designed a practical KA1 youth workers mobility (Training Course) \u201cAnimate to Participate\u201d. The project's main aim is to develop capacities of youth organisations in the use of animations as the innovative, non-formal education, dissemination and empowerment tool. In order to achieve that, the following objectives shall be implemented step by step:\r\n\r\n- analysing the importance of animation in information sharing and assessing its application in the youth field\r\n- bringing together youth work practitioners and training them in the basics of animation techniques \r\n- discovering the potential of the available ICT and media tools in launching, testing and implementation of animation in the youth field \r\n- increasing partner promoters capacity to provide creative and innovative solutions to ensure greater visibility and dissemination of our everyday work  \r\n- through the use of animations > fostering active participation and development of key competences for the benefit of members and service users of our organisations\r\n - exchanging best practices as well as providing space for networking and development of future project ideas based on the creative forms of expression (e.g. animations).\r\n \r\n\r\n- WORKING METHODS: \r\n\r\nTraining course will see the application of traditional non-formal educational methods, including: name games, energisers and teambuilding exercises; presentations (both online and offline); one-to-one and group work;  discussions e.g. round table, brainstorming, etc.; networking and exchange of best practices; reflection time; learning by doing, etc.\r\n\r\n- IMPACT:\r\n\r\n* Participant level\r\n- increased knowledge, skills and attitudes related to the use of animations and digital tools in the local/national and international youth work activities\r\n- concrete (hard) skills developed in the use of animations (stop motion technique)\r\n- greater awareness gained of how to use animations as part of DEOR activities or in educational context (e.g. when creating animated content) \r\n- improved motivation to be an active yet considerate user of ICT tools\r\n- improved confidence and belief in one\u2019s own creative and innovative potential.\r\nAll these will be complemented by:\r\n- new international friendships developed\r\n- increased motivation to use newly gained competences back at home when working with the sending organisations as well as youth and community groups\r\n- eagerness to engage in further ERAMSU+ partnerships aimed at giving upskilling and giving voice (e.g. through creative forms of expression) to those who need it. \r\n\r\n* Organisational level \r\n- staff members, volunteers, trainers, etc. trained in the field of animations   \r\n- creative and innovative ideas developed for the sake of promoting organisations, creating more engaging educational tools, providing bridge for the community work (all these can be granted through the application of animations)\r\n- new international contacts developed (not all partner promoters have yet worked together!)\r\n- new ideas for local and international projects developed.", "http://www.consiliumdt.co.uk", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-035636_coordinator"], ["3QR", "See, Draw, Learn:\u00a0training course on visual facilitation of the learning process", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", 16873.0, "-TYPE OF ACTIVITY: youth workers mobility - training course\r\n- DATES:  22-30 Sept 2017\r\n- VENUE: Nowy Sacz, Poland\r\n- NO. OF PARTICIPANTS and STAFF: 30\r\n- COUNTRIES ENGAGED: Poland, United Kingdom, Estonia, Romania, Greece, Latvia, Slovakia, Croatia, Austria, Norway, Czech Republic and Turkey.\r\n\r\nCONTEXT: \r\n\r\nThe proposed project idea is based on the concept of the similar course on visual facilitation carried out in Estonia in 2014. Previous project (Facilitarium) turned out to be highly successful - it not only showed how important  facilitations skills are in general, but also how innovative approaches (e.g. the use of visualisation techniques) can help strengthen the overall learning of the target groups as well as enhance the impact and value of educational activities. \r\n\r\nThe main theme of the training is addressing visual tools as an approach to enhanced facilitation of educational and informational activities organised by NGOs and individuals active in the youth field. Visual does not refer here to graphic means only (although graphic component is usually the biggest), but it also encompasses any other tools which allow to communicate ideas and information visually through diverse means e.g. paper-cutting and folding, collages, different 3d shapes, digital presentations etc.\r\n\r\nAIM and OBJECTIVES:\r\n\r\nThe following KA1 project is based on implementation of a highly practical, hands-on training course aimed at improving the quality of communication and educational activities of youth NGOs by means of providing their staff (e.g. trainers, facilitators, teachers, coaches, youth work practitioners, volunteers and all those engaged in conducting educational activities) with a set of tools and practices for enhanced visual facilitation. These can later be used when organising all sorts of educational and informational activities in the youth field e.g. training courses, seminars, partners meetings, study visits, exchanges, presentations, meetings etc.\r\n\r\nIn order to reach the project aim, the following objectives have been set:\r\n\r\n\u2014 to explore and better understand the need for visual facilitation of learning in the youth activities nowadays (note: it is important that each of the organisations and participants engaged in the course discover the context in which VF can be used in their own everyday work);  \r\n\u2014 to bring together 30 practicing facilitators with lack of or low visual presentation skills and newcomers in the training and facilitation field so as to explore the benefits of visual facilitation;\r\n\u2014 to explore and learn the variety of tools and methods applicable for visual facilitation and mapping of educational and informational activities in the youth field;\r\n\u2014 to develop participants\u2019 skills in using important components of visual facilitation: shapes, colours, composition, hand-writing, paper-fold and -cut techniques, visual metaphors, analysing and summing up of information;\r\n\u2014 to set up the basis for further development of these skills on individual and organisational level in order ensure the exploitation of newly gained knowledge for the benefits of NGOs and a variety of learners we work with;\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY:\r\n\r\nThe working methods of the training will include typical non-formal education methods, focused on individual and group exercises, workshops, live presentations, discussions, quests for experience and tests for skills, by which we are going to cover all the components of visual facilitation process. Most importantly, though, training course is a hands-on activity which means that project's agenda includes a lot of creative practical tasks allowing participants to reveal their talents and master facilitation skills. \r\n\r\nIMPACT:\r\n\r\nThe proposed project offers a great learning and capacity building potential for participants involved, partner promoters as well as target groups we all tend to work with back home. These are typically young people, as well as occasionally children and adult learners. Here, those attending will be provided with the unique opportunity to develop a set of highly creative and by far innovative competences in visual facilitation of learning. As such, the skills and knowledge gained can be used broadly across various fields, encouraging creativity within meeting rooms, board rooms, workshops, training courses, classrooms and any other places, where visual facilitation of learning is deemed useful. This means that the effects of our joint work are likely to not only target direct partner involved but may stretch out to our local communities as well as any other work carried out by the partners at the regional, national and international level. \r\n\r\nWe expect that also the proposed project will have significant impact on the participants and partner promoters, thus leading to new ideas and future projects being planned. Here, the process of taking next steps after the project shall be skilfully facilitated and will be incorporated in the training course daily timetable.", "http://www.consiliumdt.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PL01-KA105-037395_4"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["4BA", "INNOVASEC LTD*", 253449.0, "Fostering secure European societies (09.04.03.03)", "fts_2017_4519", 2017]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["1EX", "R1A", "MALVERN COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"], ["1JE", "R1A", "ROWAN HOUSE EMI FACILITY & DAY HOSPITAL"], ["1EX", "RWP", "MALVERN COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WR14"}
