The galenic formulation will consist of drug loaded biodegradable polymer particles (e.g., chitosan, polylactic-co-glycolic acid, PLGA) embedded into a biodegradable hydrogel matrix (e.g., hyaluronic acid (HA)-based) to be deposited as a patch onto the olfactory region. A pH-sensitive, mucoadhesive particle coating (e.g., chitosan, chitosan derivatives) will ensure an environment-specific adhesion to the olfactory epithelium. This novel technology will largely enhance the controlled and sustainable delivery of drugs and increase the drug bioavailabilty to the CNS. NogoA antagonist NG-101 will be used as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Proof of concept studies and initial clinical data have proven the enormous potential of blocking NogoA for spinal cord remyelation and axonal integrity. However, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) like NG-101, do not sufficiently cross the BBB. The sustainable and controlled release of NG-101 to the CNS will be achieved via the transport of embedded polymer particles to the olfactory epithelium, the subsequent release of API and permeation through the olfactory region, the only part of the nasal epithelium which is in direct contact with the brain. The direct transport route from the nasal cavity to the brain, bypassing the BBB, offers an exciting mode of central nervous system (CNS) drug delivery not only for demyelinating disorders but also for other CNS indications, e.g., stroke, neurodegenerative diseases or tumours. The proposed new innovative N2B drug delivery platform is a practical, safe, and minimally invasive technology. It will be exploited for NG-101 and has the potential to be implemented with other APIs with a low CNS bioavailability.", 533596.0, 5646500.0, "N2B-patch", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_206572_926453791"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2BQ", "Petroc Go III", "PETROC", 374542.0, "Petroc Go III is a Key Action 1 Project which continues to build upon the successes of the Petroc Go and Petroc Go II projects, expanding them to include additional vocational groups and partner organizations allowing 182 students and 46 staff from the College to be involved in a series of 2 week placements throughout Europe in 2018-19.\r\nThe project targets participants from an isolated rural area, who face barriers to accessing education, training and personal/professional development opportunities. The area suffers from poor public transport, a low-skill low-wage economy, and a high cost of living. \r\nThe participants in this project will be drawn from students taking courses with Petroc at all our campuses. The destinations chosen for the project will primarily be focused on specific vocational area/groups of students to ensure maximum benefit for their programme of study and future career. The main target groups for each destination are as follows:\r\n1) France (Avoriaz ) - Outdoor Education & Sports; Public Services\r\n2) Spain (Barcelona) - Automotive, Engineering, Business Management, Beauty and Hairdressing\r\n3) Malta (Humrun & Goza) - Animal Conservation \r\n4) Sweden (Mora) - Early Years Care & Education, Teaching Assistants ,Travel and Tourism and Animal Care;\r\n5) Spain (Seville) - Spanish language courses\r\n6) The Netherlands (Zwolle) - Fitness & Sport.\r\n7) France (Loudun/Chinon) - Learning Difficulties and Disabilities\r\n\r\nThe project will enhance participants\u2019 employability skills, as well as their cultural horizons, through the following range of activities:\r\nTailored work programmes in local garages, offices, and businesses in Barcelona;\r\nWorking alongside winter sports specialists in the Alpine Ski Resort of Avoriaz;\r\nWorking and training with staff and students running Deltion College\u2019s Fitness Centres in the Netherlands;\r\nWork experience in local nurseries and schools, animal care and conservation organizations and a travel resort in Sweden.\r\nWorking alongside a dedicated Research team studying the local shark population around the coasts of Malta\r\nWorking alongside other disabled young people in a vineyard run by a dedicated social enterprise\r\n Working as Teaching Assistants in Lessons in a classroom setting in Seville.\r\nThe project will be overseen by the College\u2019s highly experienced Projects Team, working alongside curriculum staff to ensure participants are able to maximize the opportunities available to them in the various partner countries in order to enable them to develop a greater cultural understanding of life in modern Europe; increase their self-confidence; raise their aspirations; and, most importantly, develop skills which will considerably increase their employability and boost the economic development of the Petoc catchment area.\r\nThis project forms part of the College's longer-term strategy to increase the involvement of young people in the Erasmus+ Programme throughout Devon in order to increase employability and contribute to the development of a higher-skill, higher wage economy.", "http://www.petroc.ac.uk", "PETROC", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036297_coordinator"], ["2BQ", "Secci\u00f3n Europea de Automoci\u00f3n 2017", "PETROC", 35579.0, "The proposal focuses on our Vocational Training students of Automotive Mechanical and Electrical Repairs (CFGM Electromecanica). The main goal is to offer them the chance to discover other educational systems and the working processes of different countries. They will have the opportunity to participate in training workshops through our partner schools in France and England, so they will live an experience in another environment in a European atmosphere. Teachers and coordinators from both schools will be involved in this project; firstly preparing the programme, secondly monitoring the stay and finally doing the evaluation.\r\nDuring their stay the students will be accompanied by a teacher who will be responsible for all contacts with the companies that will host the work experience and training placement and the teachers from the host school.\r\n\r\nA total of 24 students will participate in this programme (12 in Bains, France, and 12 in Barnstaple, England). The teachers from the spanish and host centres have jointly developed a practical programme in both the school and the work experience partner company, so that our students will be able to improve and expand their technical knowledge.\r\n\r\nWe aim to have ambitious goals, yet set attainable results:\r\n\r\n- to offer the students the maximum opportunities to be able to consolidate and improve their technical knowledge and training\r\n- to prepare them in order to  become more confident when facing the challenge of new situations such as looking for a new job\r\n- to enable the students to improve their linguistic abilities and allow them to enhance their CV by including this experience.\r\n- to expand on their personal development, by helping them to learn how to adapt to new situations, far from their usual environment\r\n- to promote cooperation between schools from different countries\r\n- to exchange methods and practices that will encourage us to be innovative and to enrich our school\u2019s Curricular Project\r\n\r\nThe benefits of this mobility project are various, some of them are long term objectives:\r\n\r\n\u2022 to assist our students to adapt easily to a new working environment\r\n\u2022 to contribute to the growth and expansion of their cultural background\r\n\u2022 to improve their language abilities\r\n\u2022 to awaken their interest to discover new opportunities outside their country\r\n\u2022 to complement their personal, social and vocational training\r\n\r\nWe feel that for all the participants the Project represents a fantastic opportunity to compare, contrast and exchange information, opinions, working practices and curricular models.
