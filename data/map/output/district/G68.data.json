Today the photonics global market alone is around \u20ac300 billion and Europe has established a strong position with a total share of 20%, directly employing about 290,000 people. However, the shortage of sufficient skilled labour and entrepreneurs capable of handling the highly multi-disciplinary nature of KETs remains a major problem in the EU. Tailoring of semiconductors at the nanoscale is an important enabling technology for a wide range of photonics and electronics applications in diverse areas. In the training network proposed here, a cohort of 15 early stage researchers will be trained in the full range of skills required for a career in photonics, including materials growth, device fabrication, characterisation, design, theory, and commercialisation. A carefully-chosen, well-balanced consortium of 8 academic partners, 2 full industry partners and 7 associated partners are well placed to provide the training in these skills, with European and worldwide reputations as leaders in each field. These skills will be developed within four burgeoning research areas; Semiconductor Metamaterials & Plasmonics, Dilute Nitride semiconductor nanostructures, Hydrogenated Semiconductors and Metamorphic structures. The outcomes of this enabling fundamental research are well focused to deliver advances in sources for secure communications, sensitive detectors for security applications, more efficient solar cells for energy generation, LEDs and sensors for environmental gas and bio-sensing. Each researcher will experience both academic and commercial environments thanks to the strong industrial involvement, resulting in multi-skilled, industry-focused graduates.

While the former provide energy efficient processing power for the majority of the workloads, the latter offer the possibility of customizing and adapting hardware solutions over time to specific needs. The targets of innovation in OPERA are next generation LP servers and highly parallel embedded computer systems based on ULP architectures. Adopting a mechanism for selecting the best processing element for a specific task is fundamental for achieving good levels in energy efficiency. OPERA aims at exploiting such kind of mechanisms to orchestrate both general-purpose and reconfigurable devices. The OPERA vision is to integrate ULP smart devices into a platform that uses next-generation LP servers to remotely process the data and offering cloud-based services. \nOPERA's added value to the project is the validation of the technological solutions on three different real-life workloads use-cases. By integrating and optimizing computing systems for energy efficiency at different levels of the computing continuum, OPERA envisages the creation of big opportunities for Europe", 827483.0, 5518675.0, "OPERA", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_199230_973126408"]]}}, "outwardCode": "G68"}
