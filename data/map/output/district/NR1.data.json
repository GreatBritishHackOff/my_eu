By combining three most advanced microscopic techniques into a single workstation, we aim at reaching a new quality level in the study of the molecular biology of living cells. The proposed single molecule workstation will be composed of three key elements: (i) inverted light microscope (ILM); (ii) atomic force microscope (AFM); and (iii) optical tweezers (OT). A true virtue of this initiative is that by combining several ultra-sensitive microscopy techniques into a single workstation completely new horizons for molecular biology related studies are opened. The aim of this combined ILM-AFM-OT setup is to look at the surface topography using high-resolution AFM, to study the distribution of cellular molecules using high sensitive fluorescence and contrast enhanced light microscopy (ILM), and to measure molecular interaction forces with ultra-sensitive optical tweezers. As a complementary method, photo-thermal nano-spectroscopy (PTNS) will be used to investigate spectroscopic properties of cellular material with a spatial resolution down to sub-100 nm which will enable chemical analysis of sub-cellular components. The combined setup will provide a qualitatively new level in microscopic studies, giving unprecedented versatility in the detection and monitoring of cellular events with highest spatial and temporal resolution. The proposed single workstation will be used for the study of the correlation between structure and function of living cells with applications in immunology and cancer research.", 167715.0, 2688805.0, "SMW", "An imaging instrument beyond the state of the art", "Over recent years a number of imaging techniques have been developed that enable the visualisation and study of cells. A combination of the three most advanced microscopic techniques into a single platform would facilitate the simultaneous study of the structure and function of living cells.", "Understanding how cells function requires not only the characterisation of the molecular constituents of the cell, but also their spatial and temporal interplay. To facilitate this light and atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques work in a complementary manner to study living cells.\n\nWhile light microscopy allows the visualisation of the interior of cells, AFM provides resolution at the nanometre scale facilitating the study of mechanical interactions of membrane components. Optical tweezers (OTs) further enable the observation of molecular interactions inside the cell.\n\nThe EU-funded ?Single molecule workstation? (SMW) project aimed to integrate all conceivable functions of these complementary technologies into a single and unified single molecule workstation (SMW) concept. The proposed instrumentation consisted of inverted light microscope (ILM), AFM and OT technologies.\n\nBy combining these ultra-sensitive microscopy techniques into a single platform, partners wished to open up completely new horizons for molecular biology-related studies. The setup allowed for simultaneous surface topography using high-resolution AFM, study of the distribution of cellular molecules with enhanced ILM, and measurement of molecular interaction forces with ultra-sensitive OT. As a complementary method, photo-thermal nano-spectroscopy (PTNS) was used to investigate spectroscopic properties of cellular material with a high spatial resolution, enabling chemical analysis of sub-cellular structures.\n\nThe workstation was designed to integrate AFM and ILM from a mechanical, optical and electronic perspective. Additionally, software for the combination of these technologies coupled with a user interface was developed. Project partners generated a prototype of a combined AFM-ILM instrument and tested its applicability for cancer detection and immunological T cell activation.\n\nThe optimised SMW platform offers the unique opportunity to simultaneously study the interior and exterior of cells with high resolution. Such a tool is expected to have a major impact on the biology community.", "http://www.till-id.com/smw.html", "http://www.anasysinstruments.com", "/docs/results/images/2012-12/53674.jpg", "fp7_103658_998539632"], ["1ES", "Ecofriendly synergists for insecticide formulations", "Agchemaccess Limited", "Insect pests cause significant damage to agricultural crops and transmit several important diseases of humans and animals. Chemical insecticides have been used to control insect pests for many decades and remain essential to ensure a supply of affordable food and as part of disease vector control for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, the world-wide use of synthetic insecticides over many years has led to increased resistance to insecticides and contributed to environmental contamination. One way to reduce insecticide use without compromising control is to use a synergist in combination with an insecticide. Synergists are themselves nontoxic but act by increasing the effectiveness of the insecticides they are used with. They do this by inhibiting the metabolic systems in insects that detoxify insecticides. The goal of this project is to develop ecofriendly synergists for use in formulations with insecticides, both in agriculture and in Public Health, enabling a reduction in the amount of insecticidal active applied, and thereby reducing the adverse effects of these insecticides on beneficial insects such as bees. On the basis of in-depth experimental analyses of the interactions of the known synergist piperonyl butoxide with metabolic enzymes in pest insects, new molecular structures will be designed, synthesized and evaluated on pest and beneficial species using laboratory bioassays and field trials. In addition, the synthesis process to manufacture these synergists will be evaluated with the aim of achieving an industrially and economically feasible process. Finally strategies will be developed that use the novel synergists to enhance the control of insect pests while preserving beneficial insects. As such this research has significant scientific, economic, and social impact as part of sustainable food production and disease control and will enhance the partners\u2019 competitiveness in this important industry by means of global patent and license agreements.", 37144.0, 1026097.0, "ECOSYN", null, null, null, "http://www.ecosyn.eu", "http://www.agchemaccess.com", null, "fp7_110500_952548537"], ["1UA", "PREVENTIVE METHODOLOGY AND TOOLS TO PROTECT UTILITIES", "Harnser (Uk) Limited", "In recent years, we have witnessed an increase in the number and impact of cyber attacks.
