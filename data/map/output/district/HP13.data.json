European aquaculture production has increased substantially over the last decades. However, overall production growth in Europe over the period 1994-2001 was 6.3% APR, 5.5% less than the global trend. The overall price trend was negative (-0.5% APR) vs positive global development. This sector has experienced increasing competition from non-EU countries, especially Asia and South America has made it imperative to increase research and development. Land based fish farming is the critical success factor in intensive aquaculture since they are the start of a very complicated value chain. Further developments of land based fish farms are therefore crucial for the aquacultural sector. Water is one of the most critical input factors, and control of water temperature is the most important factor for optimal growth. The proposed project aims to develop technology that will allow the water in an aquaculture tank to be maintained at the optimum temperature to enhance fish growth by creating a modular constructed, thermally insulated, temperature controlled, low running cost system. The OptiTEMPtank system will be constructed from rotationally moulded segments with internal foaming to provide thermal insulation, which will be joined together with an innovative system to provide a seal against the water. A temperature control system will adjust incoming water temperature to maintain the optimum required to promote maximum growth through the use of innovative water heater and cooler fuelled by biogas. The biogas will be generated from the Biomass (aquaculture faeces and unused food waste) filtered out from the outlet of the tank through the use of an innovative micro-scale anaerobic digestion biogas generator.", 11103.0, 1151506.0, "OPTITEMPTANK", null, null, null, "http://www.ist-world.org/ProjectDetails.aspx?ProjectId=f3c287ef370241a9befb06b2d8103617", null, null, "fp7_94827_998671067"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7XJ", "St\u00e4rkung junger Frauen in Europa", "Wycombe Youth Action CIO", 6428.0, "Youth work in the Kelkheim is delivered by the municipal administration of the town (Taunus), and the office for youth and social affairs sub.  Kelkheim has three youth centers dedicated to urban youth work provision, these centers are used by young people as a retreat space, and provide points of contact for advice and guidance.   Of late the work has also focused around the integration of newly arrived young refugees, and supporting the holiday, education and advisory, services locally.\r\nProvision has included activities during holidays such as games and matches, training and education fairs with local schools entitled JUBIZU. \r\nThe team at Kelkheim had already delivered youth work across borders in Europe, with young people having the opportunity to undertaking free educational breaks in France, Coatia, and Italy. In 2010 the first youth encounter took place with Former Yugoslavian, then in 2011 a youth partnership with the municipality of Rahovec in Kosovo with the organization \"SHL - Students-helping-life\". After a preparatory meeting of experts in Rahovec, we conducted I four youth meetings. The fifth youth meeting is scheduled for May of this year.\r\nPartnering Kelkheim WYA have been delivering independent Youth Work in High Wycombe for 35 years, as a local charity they have had the unique insight in to the needs and concerns of young people and have delivered projects run by young people for young people. They also deliver a number of weekly youth provisions and work with local authorities on the Gangs, Extremism, Violence and Child Sexual Exploitation agendas.  In addition to this, they provide advice and guidance and deliver a number of local youth forums allowing young people to have their voices heard by local decision makers and partner organizations.\r\n\r\nAt the October 2011 the UN adopted Resolution 66/170 of 11. The resolution highlighted the present challenges faced by girls and recognized  that girls in many parts of the world are exploited and discriminated against on various levels and remain at a disadvantage. In this project we would like to draw your attention to the fact that not only girls, as is often assumed from Third World countries are affected, but also girls in Europe today. In our daily work with young women we have identified a high demand for empowerment measures, especially for girls, as hierarchical and classical role assignments influence their life enormously. This form of discrimination seems often promoted and strengthened in todays media landscape. \r\n\r\nWith this in mind and through multiple forms of consultation with young girls on both youth projects young women identified a wish to better understand their bodies and their identity. This need informed our decision making process for this project, and we were able to design a project which will empower young women to host their own conferences, learn about new cultures and build confidence through visit a new country, whilst also obtaining the YouthPass.\r\nWork delivered will center around the facilitation of workshops to allow young women to plan and deliver their own conference, one in each country for their peer groups and professionals with the aim of:\r\nOpen dialogue around the role of young women in modern Europe.\r\nDiscuss the identity of young women in Europe\r\nExchange their experiences of being young women in an ever changing Europe\r\nExplore the representation of young women and body image in the media. \r\n\r\nThe cohorts of girls selected from both organizations will be largely made up of young women who attend youth groups aimed at young girls who are struggling with their identity and image, and have been identified as vulnerable, either because they have been diagnosed with Autism, behavioral difficulties, or have faced particularly difficult life journeys. It is hoped the project will strengthen their self confidence and encourage them to develop a positive self image. \r\nMeasurable outcomes which the success of the project will be measured against will be:\r\nThe delivery of two conferences delivered by each group, one in Kelkheim and one in High Wycombe. \r\nGirls will complete evaluation forms, expressing their satisfaction with the journey.\r\nParticipants will have achieved the YouthPass Certification through the duration of the project. \r\n\r\nThe long term impact of this project will be in the confidence and achievement of the young women who take part in the workshops, conferences and youth exchange, their aspirations and an increase in positive self worth. As a direct result of taking part it is hoped, young women will be able to form positive cultural identities for themselves and each other. Better understanding diversity and celebrating the differences in todays Europe. Through the workshop discussions young women will be able to reconcile cultural expectations with a positive European identity, and in line with the LAG M\u00e4dchenpolitik Hessen hope to identify customized solutions for the development of identity of young women.", "http://www.wycombeyouthaction.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-DE04-KA105-015415_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "HP13"}
