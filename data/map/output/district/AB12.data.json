Such an uptake will deliver improved design processes, better products and services, and improved competitiveness. For the European Union as a whole this means improved employment opportunities and economic growth.\n\nThe importance of advanced ICT to the competitiveness of both large and small companies in the engineering and manufacturing domain is well established. Despite early successes in this area, there are still many barriers to the uptake of such solutions, not least of which are the initial cost and complexity of adoption, particularly in the context of challenging trading conditions. This proposal targets the ICT Innovation for Manufacturing SMEs (I4MS) action line (Phase 2) and builds on Phase 1 of that initiative.\n\nPhase 2 addresses the adoption of next generation ICT advances in the manufacturing domain. At the core of Fortissimo 2 are three tranches of Application Experiments (~35 in total). An initial set is included in this proposal and two further sets will be obtained through Open Calls for proposals. These experiments will be driven by the requirements of first-time users (predominately SMEs) and will bring together actors from across the value chain, from cycle providers to domain experts via the Fortissimo Marketplace. This will enable innovative solutions to manufacturing challenges, leading to new and improved design processes, products and services. A key feature of Fortissimo 2 will be the adaption of the Marketplace to meet the needs of end-users. It will offer a responsive and reliable service to companies which want to access HPC and Big resources and expertise.\n\nFortissimo 2 initially involves 732 months of effort, a total cost of \u20ac11.1m and EC funding of \u20ac10m over a duration of three years, commensurate with achieving its ambitious goals.", 26838.0, 9632350.0, "Fortissimo 2", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_198765_933041255"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["3BN", "NORTH SEA ADVISORY COUNCIL*", 243568.0, "Governance and communication (11.06.62.04)", "fts_2016_36036", 2016], ["3BN", "NORTH SEA ADVISORY COUNCIL*", 458.0, "Support expenditure for maritime affairs and fisheries \u2014 Non-operational administrative and technical assistance (11.01.04.01)", "fts_2016_40345", 2016], ["3BN", "NORTH SEA ADVISORY COUNCIL*", 261676.0, "Governance and communication (11.06.62.04)", "fts_2017_36567", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "AB12"}
