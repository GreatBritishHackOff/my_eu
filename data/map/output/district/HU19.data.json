Lately, many staff members (both teachers and management of the school) have made progress in honing their language skills. We would like to take advantage of that to also develop other than language-related skills.\r\nNine of our teachers will participate in job-shadowing in nine different schools in Great Britain, Finland, Hungary, Greece, Lithuania, Spain and Cyprus, which will focus on innovative teaching methods. The school were carefully chosen according to their expertize and experience. These teachers will also become \u201cmentors\u201d and will actively participate in implementing the new methods into the teaching process according to the conditions of the school.\r\nThanks to the fact that job-shadowing will also be attended by the management of the school, represented by the headmaster of the elementary school Kl\u00ed\u010d, an environment encouraging a positive change of the work of not only individual teachers will be supported, but also in the organization of the school as a whole.\r\nWe believe that this project will not only contribute to the overall improvement of competences, but also to development of language skills, enrichment of knowledge about other cultures and education systems as well as providing new friendships and contacts for further cooperation.\r\nBy having the teachers attend these courses, our school aims to use technology more effectively, to get experienced mentors to help school staff with implementing technology to the teaching process and to gain the chance for potential international cooperation with other educational institutions.\r\nEven though it will be teachers attending the courses, we believe it will be the students who will benefit most from the project\u2019s achieved objectives.", "http://www.withernseaprimary.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-CZ01-KA101-047527_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "HU19"}
