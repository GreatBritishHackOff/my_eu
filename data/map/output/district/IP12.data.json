They commercialise small volumes of low-emission vehicles, including taxis, delivery vans, factory vehicles and domestic cars. However with current technologies their market is limited and their development has been split between low-cost mass market and expensive high-performance vehicles. These vehicles do not meet customer performance demands, at a price point which is competitive with IC engines. Large vehicle manufacturers overcome this gap and reduce their development costs by platform sharing component technologies. However due to the lack of collaboration within our industry, this platform technology is not available. This proposal addresses this technology gap though the development of an open platform power management system, with customisable performance and efficiency. The platform will be supported by a modular platform drive motor topology, based on a fully scalable axial flux design (100Nm to 1,200Nm cont. torque). The low cost technology will be sufficiently high torque to drive the wheels at a high speed, without requiring an intermediate gearbox. To further drive down cost we will use the housing of the liquid cooled drive motor, as a heat sink for a high current power convertor. This will be achieved by applying a circuit board directly onto the motor housing, using a thermal spraying technology. The project will benefit Europe through increased sales of low-emission vehicles and enable our members to reduce development time by 20% and component cost by 40%. The modular drive motor platform will enable our members to manufacturer desirable vehicles at a competitive price and reduce the total vehicle cost by up to 13%. In addition we will offset imports by EU manufacturing of new drive motors, increasing European revenues by \u20ac257 million and profits by \u20ac51 million.", 170590.0, 2604557.0, "SAFEDRIVE", "New motors to boost electric and hybrid cars", "An initiative to advance and unify drivetrain technology for electric and hybrid cars could help European businesses in the field significantly. It will also bring the continent closer to a greener land transport model.", "About 1\u00a0600 European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), mostly automotive industry manufacturers and suppliers, are working on developing cutting-edge hybrid, electric and fuel cell technology for vehicles. These businesses face many challenges, particularly since there is no common drivetrain platform for applications under development, giving an advantage to larger multinational vehicle manufacturers.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'A platform power management system and low voltage drive train for hybrid and electric vehicles' (http://www.safedrive-fp7.eu (SAFEDRIVE)) supported European SME electric vehicle manufacturers in penetrating the electric vehicle market. It worked on developing a scalable, modular electric drivetrain to suit different types of electric and hybrid vehicles such as small cars, trucks and utility vehicles.\n\nEnvisioning a new motor design that requires lowering the voltage of direct current (DC) systems, SAFEDRIVE worked on a new split-Pi DC-to-DC converter and a power management/distribution system. The modular DC motor would eliminate the need for a gearbox, enabling direct drive operation through a drive shaft or as a hub motor. The project team developed an efficient bi-directional DC-to-DC converter in the drivetrain between the modular motors and power sources (super capacitor, lithium-ion batteries, motor-generator set).\n\nTo achieve its aims, SAFEDRIVE brought together SME supply chain partners, associations and end-users from across Europe. The project partners investigated existing technologies and developed the software behind the control and power management of the drivetrain. This was followed by production of new circuit boards, design of the drivetrain component parts and integration into a prototype.\n\nTowards the end of the project the team was very close to completing a fully functional electric vehicle drivetrain with an innovative modular DC motor that produces the desired torque. All the project's results have been disseminated to stakeholders, laying the groundwork for a unified drivetrain that could boost SME results in the field. Thanks to this initiative, Europe has come one step closer to becoming a leader in producing cleaner vehicles.", null, "http://cogent-technology.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112212.jpg", "fp7_95937_997827361"], ["1PE", "An Innovative RFID Security SEAL for Aircraft Galley Trolleys", "Cogent Technology Ltd", "The AIR-SEAL project proposes the development of a second generation RFID security seal, capable of monitoring the integrity of an aircraft galley trolley or transportation vehicle. Since the September 11th terrorism attacks in the United States, catering services through-out the world have been seen as the weakest link in the aviation industry\u2019s service supply chain. Existing sealing technologies are time consuming, ineffective and require a complex paper trail. A reusable and retro-fit, electronic sealing device is therefore required with an ultra-low profile. This new technology will enable the automatic sealing and inspections of galley trolleys, while improving their security by utilising a digital, anti-tamper volumetric sensor. With an initial market value of \u20ac120million retrofitting the technology and an additional \u20ac24milion per year in new trolleys, this market has the potential of significant economic returns. Beyond the catering industry this technology will enable international logistics services and all of the SMEs operating within a secure supply chain to seal their vehicles and reduce their operating costs. Supported by a location dependant (Galileo) tag interrogator and central ICT database, a pair of smart tags will be used to seal and monitor unauthorised access to a trolley, based on a received signal strength indication technology. Upon an authorised activation, the novel security seal will transmit its location and a randomly generated locking number to a central database, using a mobile GPRS communication link in the tag interrogator. By cross-referencing the tag and database values using a standard RFID reader, a security official may ensure that a seal has not been tampered with or replaced. A multi-lingual and bi-colour passive RF display will be installed onto each door of the trolley, for a visual indication of the seal status. Alternatively a RFID reader may be used for an automatic, long range inspection.", 121915.0, 1139572.0, "AIR-SEAL", null, null, null, null, "http://cogent-technology.co.uk", null, "fp7_107791_997827361"], ["1PE", "Development of a non-invasive baby sleep monitoring and intelligent control system for the prevention of unexpected death in previously healthy babies and early detection of risky situations", "Cogent Technology Ltd", "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the highest cause of death in the post\u2010neonatal period (between 2nd and 6th month of life). Only in Europe, each year 2 400 infants still die of SIDS, an unexpected disease happening to infants who die in their sleep with no evidence of accidental asphysia, inflicted injury or organic disease; being a multifactorial syndrome mainly related to overheating, prolonged apnea, gastroesophageal reflux or inadequate bedding system and posture.

Integrated in the cot through biosensing textiles, matrices of sensors will detect the most relevant biological parameters that will enable the detection of potential risky situation and performing preventive actions.

The system itself will initiate preventative actions by stimulating the baby's brain for gentle sleep arousal, thus preventing hypoxia and reinstating breathing activity.\n\nIn the first nine months, the project team defined requirements of both paediatricians and parents, produced a first proposal for user interfaces and described use cases. First tests with babies returned promising results regarding the ability of the stimulation system to generate arousal without waking the babies. Lab-working prototypes of bio-sensing textiles have been obtained and a first lab-scale system for the sensor box has been developed.\n\nPresent work involved trials with babies to define the proper stimulation for each case and the matrix of bio-sensing textiles communicating with the control system. Work is progressing with the input of relevant parties. These include small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) throughout the relevant supply chain (textiles, electronics and communications, mattress manufacturers), a paediatric sleep clinic, developers of biomechanics, smart textiles and intelligent control systems, and an association for paediatric research.\n\nProject work is set to deliver key innovations for a smart real-time bio-sensing textile, intelligent control system, risk assessment and actuation algorithm for SIDS prevention, and management and control user-friendly interface. All together, these will drive development of an integrated system for early detection of risky situations and SIDS prevention.\n\nBABYCARESLEEP's envisioned monitoring and warning system promises far-reaching benefits for families through reduced stress and infant deaths.
