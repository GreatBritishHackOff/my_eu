Novel design tools developed with EU support promise faster delivery of superior products.", "Integrated circuits have revolutionised the electronics industry, reducing size and complexity in a way otherwise impossible.\nA prime example is the evolution of computers from room-size equipment to hand-held portable devices.\nAs application-specific integrated circuits customised for a specific use become increasingly important, streamlined design is critical to competitiveness.Compact models that employ analytical expressions and do not directly model the underlying physics (eliminating the use of empirical parameters) can be superior in terms of computational load for generalised integrated circuit design flow.\nHowever, speed must be balanced with accuracy.\nThe EU-funded project 'Compact modelling network (COMON)' (http://compactmodelling.eu/ (COMON)) developed the required design tools for an advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor and so-called III\u2013IV technologies.\nThe large consortium of 15 universities and companies focused on 3 transistor device classes considered state-of-the-art and most promising for future digital, analogue and high-frequency integrated circuit markets.\nIntensive research and development exploiting complementary experimental measurements and numerical simulations resulted in delivery of six different models for the three device classes.\nThe team also developed parameter extraction techniques to obtain model parameters that best fit available experimental data.\nThe design models were implemented in existing electronic design automation tools and their performance evaluated through circuit simulation.\nResults were also compared to experimental results.COMON's significant advances in the field of integrated circuit simulation have led to 57 publications in scientific journals, 104 conference presentations and 4 book chapters.\nIntegration of the models into electronic design automation tools means industrial partners can begin using them upon completion of the project.\nFaster and less expensive design cycles for novel integrated circuits will have important benefits for manufacturers and consumers alike.\nWith intensive training of early-stage and young researchers, the consortium has strengthened EU integrated circuit design and made a lasting impact.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112642.jpg", "fp7_89679_998608017"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DL5"}
