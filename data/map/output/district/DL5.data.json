Future jobs will require a wide and cross-sectorial set of basic, soft and technical skills that current VET systems are not able to provide today. Automotive sector plays a key-role in Europe and this role in growing continuously. Automotive workers must be prepared in facing emerging needs coming from competitiveness. Several reports and studies on Industry 4.0  highlighted that there are many gaps in levels of competences and certification of workers. In the automotive sector the critical point lies in the fact that it is not clear which will be competences required in 3/5 years, which will be job-profiles needed by companies. That could slow down or even block the transformation underlied in Industry 4.0 with relative negative impacts (decreased competitiveness of automotive sector, considerable growth of unemployment). \r\nSome attempts in anticipating skill needs have been already carried out. But here the project aims to tackle the problem from a new perspective; The problem that this project aims to face is that information provided are still at a general and undefined level that doesn\u2019t allow to pinpoint detailed and specific training contents.    \r\nTwo simultaneous needs come to light:\r\n- To know in details key-soft skills and new jobs needed from companies in order to realise Industry 4.0 changes. \r\n- To understand which are the specific needs for an effective re-training of workers to be done in advance respect to real necessity.  \r\nSpecific objects: \r\n- To develop and test a method able to clarify and describe in details 4.0 key competences and job-profiles used by companies belonging to clusters involved. \r\n- To deternine conscious choices about re-training and career steps for workers involved\r\n- To create OERs useful to develop key-competences for workers and strategic for Industry 4.0 transformation of supply chain involved\r\nProject target group is 200 qualified workers, vulnerable but \u201cre-trainable\u201d respect to 4.0. They can keep or increase their employability level by expanding their set of skills. \r\nThe project will be implemented by a strategic partnership involving:\r\n- a group of European organisations in charge to manage clusters and network of automotive companies (AIC, NAA, Dekra) led by the applicant IAM\r\n- a group of VET providers ((Dekra Akademie, HETEL, KZN Solutions) running in automotive sector\r\n- two specialised VET providers (ilmiolavoro e Steinbeis) with expertise on Industry 4.0 implications of competences and human capitals of companies \r\nPartnership will be completed with Associated Partners as automotive companies, other VET providers and automotive clusters and important stakeholders like Research Institutes, associations of companies, Trade Unions (CISL and IGM METAL) able to involve automotive other automotive companies and workers. \r\nIntellectual Outputs expected: IO1 European Automotive Technology & Skill Foresight 4.0.: it contains description of key-soft competences in Automotive 4.0. IO2 European Automotive 4.0 cross-skills open education resources: it is a set of OERs useful for automotive qualified workers to develop 4.0 cross skills. expected activities are: 1) foresight of key-cross competences in Automotive 4.0 through the use of innovative methodology Technology & Skill Roadmap. 2) development of career guidance and 4.0 OERs tools. 3) test and evaluation of career guidance paths and updating by using 4.0 OERs on online platform. The methodology is based on a system process who draw an evolutive loop. That, moving from Technology & skills 4.0 foresight, help workers and companies in taking 4.0 training decision and in implementing 4.0 re-training actions. \r\nThe project provides positive impacts first of all on automotive qualified workers who will develop their sustainability/employability according 4.0. Secondly it provides positive impacts for clusters that will be able to realise 4.0 transformation and for VET providers who will increase their ability to promote employability according 4.0 revolution.", "http://www.kznsolutions.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA202-006187_7"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DL5"}
