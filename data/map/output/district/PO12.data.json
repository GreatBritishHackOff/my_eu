The training schemes provide a portfolio of courses, training sessions, seminars and workshops for continuous learning, for upgrading knowledge and developing skills. The training schemes allow the individual to acquire qualifications and skills, as required by specific positions in the nuclear sector, which will be documented in a training passport. The essence of such passport is to be recognised within the EU by the whole nuclear sector, which provides mobility to the individual looking for employment and an EU wide recruitment field for the nuclear employers. The recognition is subject to qualification and validation of the training courses according to a set of commonly agreed criteria, which can be ratified by law or established on a consensus basis within a network. The training schemes cover profiles for each of the following: - the basic training in selected nuclear topics of non nuclear engineers and personnel of nuclear facilities contractors and subcontractors;  - the technical training for the design and construction challenges of GEN III plants, and the design of GEN IV plants. The training schemes consists of three distinct phases: - Courses, seminars, learning, scientific and technical visits, case studies; - Participation to selected activities within the scope of the training in different organisations; - Autonomous conduction of activities within the scope of the training under supervision of a mentor in one or in different organisations The first phase can be provided by universities and training centers, the second and third phases can be provided by industries, research centers and future employers.", 3307.0, 1681884.0, "ENEN-III", "Maintaining critical mass in Europe's nuclear workforce", "Europe is experiencing what is being called a 'nuclear renaissance', although progress is being hampered by a shortage of trained talent. An EU-funded project has raised the bar in the training stakes to fill this gap.", "Nuclear research faces a dual challenge in Europe: the greying of the existing workforce and the emergence of new frontiers in knowledge. Ensuring that a new generation of researchers emerges to take over from those nearing retirement and is capable of continuing the nuclear renaissance requires effective and systematic high-level training.\n\nBuilding on the success of a previous EU-funded project, the 'European nuclear education network training schemes' (ENEN-III) project sought to facilitate the emergence of a new cadre of nuclear researchers able to maintain current plants and help develop next-generation facilities.\n\nFinanced by the EU's Seventh Framework Programme's (FP7) European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) programme, ENEN-III focused on four forms of training. The first was basic training in selected nuclear topics for non-nuclear engineers and professionals in the nuclear industry, such as programme, performance, design and safety engineering. The second was specific technical training for the design challenges of third-generation nuclear power plants, namely system and process engineering, and safety analysis evaluation engineering.\n\nThe third focus was on the construction challenges of third-generation nuclear power plants, including heating, ventilation and air conditioning, as well as the construction of fluid systems. The final area of training related to the concepts and design of fourth-generation nuclear reactors, which operate at higher temperatures and thus require innovative cooling systems.\n\nENEN-III not only designed a robust framework for such research but also developed a system for mutual recognition to facilitate the mobility of nuclear researchers within the EU. With such a system in place, Europe can face the challenge of the shortage of personnel in the nuclear sector and accelerate progress towards next-generation nuclear power.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2013-06/55096.jpg", "fp7_93529_998170741"], ["2DG", "Competitive SolAr Power Towers \u2013 CAPTure", "Bluebox Energy Ltd", "The main objective of this project is to significantly reduce costs of concentrated solar power, in order to pave the way for its deserved competitiveness on the power market. Specifically, the solar-to-electric conversion efficiency of the plant will be improved by increased receiver operating temperatures as well as an innovative power cycle configuration also providing advantages regarding plant operation. Additionally, improved control methodologies based on dynamic multi-aiming-point strategies for heliostats will further enhance efficiency. Besides the improvement of the plants efficiency and operation, also the construction and operational costs will be minimized via mass production of heliostats and smart heliostat calibration systems.\nThe global objective of this project is to increase plant efficiencies and reduce levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by developing all relevant components that allow implementing an innovative plant configuration. This plant configuration is based on a multi-tower decoupled advanced solar combined cycle approach that not only increases cycle efficiencies but also avoids frequent transients and inefficient partial loads, thus maximizing overall efficiency, reliability as well as dispatchability, all of which are important factors directly related to cost competitiveness on the power market. The core topic of the project, the innovative solar receiver, will be an open volumetric receiver allowing operating temperatures beyond 1200 \u00baC, providing the absorbed solar heat to the pressurized air circuit of the Brayton cycle via a network of fixed bed regenerative heat exchangers working in alternating modes (non-pressurized heating period, pressurized cooling period).", 594373.0, 5374899.0, "CAPTure", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_193759_942303106"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2BT", "Versenyk\u00e9pes szakemberek, piack\u00e9pes szaktud\u00e1s a D\u00e9ri Miksa iskol\u00e1b\u00f3l", "Norjon Engineers Ltd", 60409.0, "The Szeged Centre for Vocational Training School Deri Miksa continue training in technical fields, especially engineering and information technology fields, but progress has been dealing with the effect of automation and mechatronics training as well, as well as the mechanical and CNC machining is in training.

The applicant institution in the conduct of international mobility can help. The main goal of this project set out that the participating VET students and teachers familiarize themselves with new used technologies in abroad and they transfer these things to domestic practice, teaching practice and thereby strengthen the labor market employment opportunities. During the project, we focus on the development of general and professional language, mobility willingness to promote the development opportunities of the new directions. With the host partners, we put together the work programs for pupils and teachers, allowing the development of professional competencies (linguistic, technical, educational methodology). In the project we used the ECVET principles, which facilitate the adoption of the gained knowledge at home and abroad. Among the primary concerns can be found students develop social skills, their teamwork, communication skills, self-development and strengthening. The positive impact of the participating in addition to the impact of the institutions is also significant, such as curriculum development, promote enrollment.
