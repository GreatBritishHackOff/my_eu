Through SiPs, even small or medium-sized enterprises could gain access to the development of technologically advanced, miniaturized products. However, to date, the lack of appropriate design methodologies and flows hinders the efficient development of SiPs. PARSIMO aims at enabling first time right design of heterogeneous SiP, which can contain sensors, MEMS, RF or other parts beside the micro- and nano-electronics. In order to handle complex systems, models and modelling methods will be developed which improve the modelling accuracy of sensitive SiP parts while reducing simulation time by orders of magnitude. In addition, partitioning algorithms will be investigated to enable cost, performance and power optimisation at early design stages. Furthermore, procedures for the direct data exchange to packaging tools will be developed, so that a complete design flow can be established as basis for automated, fast and cost-efficient manufacturing of SiP based products. PARSIMO aims at initiating standardization, which will open the application of SiP technology for innovative products of European SME and industry. The developed design methodology will reduce design time by several months and significantly save development costs. Eight industry-driven demonstrators from the automotive, aviation and wireless communication domains emphasize the relevance of SiP technology for future products and the need for the design methodology addressed in PARSIMO.", 49605.0, 4102748.0, "PARSIMO", null, null, null, null, "http://www.sarastech.co.uk", null, "fp7_201946_950340041"], ["6LT", "Smart Urban Freight SolutIONs", "Clipper Logistics Group Limited", "The SMARTFUSION public-private partnership (PPP) will build upon existing urban freight development strategies of three demonstration regions and to demonstrate smart urban freight solutions on co-operative and sustainable city distribution in urban interurban supply chains.

However, mobile traffic is still growing at an unprecedented rate and the need for more sophisticated broadband services is still further pushing the limits on current standards to provide even tighter integration between wireless technologies and higher speeds. The increase in number of mobile devices and traffic, the change in the nature of service and device, along with the pressure on operation and capital costs, and energy efficiency are all continuously putting stringent limits on the requirement of the design of mobile networks. It is widely accepted that incremental enhancements of current networking paradigm will not achieve or come close to meeting the requirements of networking by 2020 . This has led to the need of a new generation of mobile communications: the so-called 5G. The interests of stakeholders and academic researchers are now focused on 5G paradigm.
