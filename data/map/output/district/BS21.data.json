Amendment of WISE-RTD to include also other (EC) Directives that relate to water policies will expand the current set of intricate algorithms that define science-policy interactions. In addition, the WISE-RTD structure will be expanded with environmental technologies focusing on water (WISE-RTD\\ Web Portal).\nFP (and LIFE) funded environmental research projects and results with high EU added value will be identified and selected using preset criteria. By uploading these projects/RTD results using a dedicated tool WPIS (Web Portal Input System) to the WISE-RTD\\ Web Portal, the information automatically become linked to the diverse sets of policy instruments (i.c. Directives).\nThe WISE-RTD\\ Web Portal will be used to evaluate whether policy questions have been answered by the RTD outcome (top down, scientific support to policy), and whether needs from identified stakeholders, e.g. from the environmental water technologies sector, are covered by policy issues (bottom-up). Merging of these two approaches will form the gap-analysis, recommendations towards a better uptake of FP environmental RTD results with tangible impact on economic growth and social welfare.\nThe policy and science related contents of WISE-RTD\\, and the two-way gap analyses will form the basis for dissemination using different user-friendly media. Innovative dissemination tools and activities will direct to different audiences/stakeholders at targeted national and/or international level including policy makers, researchers and industries.", 55173.0, 850490.0, "STEP-WISE", "European Water Knowledge Portal", "EU researchers improve the communication between policy, research and industry focusing on water. A better uptake of research results will impact economic growth and social welfare.", "Now nearly a decade old, the Water Information System for Europe (WISE) began as an initiative to modernise the collection and dissemination of information on water policy across Europe. Through previous Framework Programmes, WISE has been complemented with a http://www.wise-rtd.info (web portal WISE-RTD) on research results and the interfacing of them with European water policies\n\nThe EU-funded project 'Science, technology and policy interfacing using WISE-RTD' (STEP-WISE) expanded the WISE-RTD portal to include all major European policies alongside recent research projects in the water area.\n\nIn addition to the EU's Water Framework Directive (WFD), already included in the water knowledge portal, another nine EU Directives relating to water have been selected and their policy tasks extracted. Projects already present in the WISE-RTD database were scanned for their potential support for the new set of directives. Recent projects were added. In order to facilitate the introduction of EU water research in the United States, also the US Clean Water Act was implemented as a user entry. Summaries of research projects and results are \u2018translated\u2019 into laymen\u2019s English and linked to the related policies.\n\nOutcomes of the STEP-WISE project will include increased access to and use of EU research results for economic growth and social welfare by policymakers, researchers and industries. By reducing barriers to the dissemination of water-related RTD results, the project has improved access to scientific knowledge. To facilitate the interfacing between the different stakeholder groups, an e-learning tool was incorporated in the WISE-RTD Web Portal. It allows a better understand the view points of the other stakeholders.\n\nAmong the recommendations coming from the project's final conference was that future European research projects should have a professional communication strategy. Furthermore, the project results should be available online well after the project ends and the project teams should indicate how their results are relevant for Europe.", null, "http://www.hydro-international.biz/", "/docs/results/images/2013-10/56936.jpg", "fp7_97332_986456439"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["7NZ", "ESTRA-ENERGY TECHNOLOGY STRATEGIESLIMITED", 128890.0, "Research programme for coal (08.05.02)", "fts_2016_14809", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "BS21"}
