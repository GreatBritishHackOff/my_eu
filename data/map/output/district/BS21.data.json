Lerum Adult Education, and more specifically their apprentice program for blacksmiths, was invited to the consortium to give new perspective on validation of knowledge obtained at an internship, something which also initiated a cooperation concerning ECVET with our foreign partner organizations. A common trait for all partner organizations is the specific vocational competence they can contribute with \u2013 a trait that enhances the quality of the education we offer our students/apprentices. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of the consortium is to give the participants of our Erasmus+ project the extra dimension that internship/job shadowing abroad can bring. We expect our students to strengthen their vocational skills, vocational identity, language knowledge and understanding of cultural differences and similarities between countries and organizations. As a whole, this will contribute to making our students more attractive as future employees. We expect our staff to further develop their ability to identify different competence levels regarding vocational skills, to enhance quality regarding internship and to learn more about digitalization. All this to improve the results of our students and to contribute to the development of our schools, the industrial society and society as a whole. Mainly, our European Development Plan is about making the students see Europe as ONE employment market. The schools of the consortium will influence the development in society by attracting more young people to technical vocational programs since our focus towards the industry of the future will contribute to enhanced competiveness. \r\n\r\nWithin the project, 219 mobilities will take place. Out of these, 184 mobilities are for upper secondary students at the Industrial technology program, Electricity program and the Technology program, 15 mobilities are for handicraft apprentices and 20 mobilities are for school staff and/or supersvisors at the companies. Generally, students and staff from all schools are required to apply for participation in the project and they will be accepted as long as they are vocationally skilled and are good representatives for their schools, the companies, Erasmus+ and Sweden. An extra requirement for students and apprentices is that they have fulfilled previous internships in Sweden with a satisfactory result. All schools use Learning Agreements to ensure high standards, and Learning Outcomes are documented in the Europass Mobility Document. The OLS language test and the web-based language courses are used to make sure the students/apprentices have linguistic abilities to be able to benefit from their internships. Grant Agreements are established so that the students are in control of their budget. The apprentices at Lerum Adult Education, are given a greater responsibility for their international internship regarding their budget as well as initiating contacts and communicating with their supervisors to be. \r\n\r\nExpected impact and learning outcomes for teachers, supervisors and organizations, are an increased understanding of the production and processes at plants/work places in other countries, a greater understanding of how to use ECVET for validation of knowledge and competences within vocational courses, an improved and quality assured process for internship and an extended network in Europe. Expected impact and learning outcomes for students and apprentices is mainly greater employability due to enhanced vocational skills, stronger vocational identity, improved language skills, a larger understanding of the connection between technical development and the development of a more sustainable society \u2013 ecologically, economically and socially.  Everything to raise the students/apprentices interest concerning future work in Europe.\r\n\r\nEvery school spreads results from the project at their websites, educational fairs and open houses for potential students and their parents. An idea is to give some students the opportunity to create a film that can be used for these purposes. The apprentices from Lerum Adult Education partake in various handicraft competitions and fairs in order to spread knowledge and experiences.

The achievement of these goals will result in improving teaching standards in our school. The participation of our school in the programme Erasmus Plus will add up to improving the image of its graduate among potential employers, it will create his competitive advantage in the job market and will increase the level of attractiveness of the school among students. The programme of the vocational training is compatible with the core curriculum, assuming quick adaptation to the rapidly changing job market, and meets the needs of the students. Another aim is developing creativity through working to fulfill the project tasks. The possibility of having a direct contact with art masterpieces on the highest world level will have a positive influence on the esthetic level of students\u2019 projects. The participants will gain a variety of skills in the periods prior to, in the course of and after completing the apprenticeship, while arranging the activities disseminating the results of the project. The activities preceding the apprenticeship will involve a series of training covering three areas: cultural, linguistic, pedagogical and psychological.\r\nThe cultural training will include getting to know the elements of Italian art and culture as well as regional customs. The linguistic preparation will involve learning Business English \u2013 20 hours and learning Italian at a beginner level \u2013 25 hours. The school educationalist will conduct workshops on the ways of resolving conflicts, dealing with stress and developing the attitude of tolerance towards other cultures. During the apprenticeship the students will gain the knowledge of transportation, distribution and warehousing processes in a modern logistics centre, will achieve the abilities of preparing illustration material to be published on the Internet and will become acquainted with the rules of Internet marketing.  They will develop their abilities of working within an international team, which requires using a foreign language and which will extend their social skills. After completing the training, the students will be able to share their experience and knowledge of new technologies with younger students. In order to make the results of the project common currency, the participants will prepare a presentation about types of operations in a logistics centre, arrange an exhibition of the works accomplished in Italian advertising agencies and will present the results of the tasks created on the level of preparation to mobility. These initiatives will be performed at school as well as in cooperating institutions. These disseminating activities will be addressed and will reach all school students , their parents, teachers, lower secondary school students and local community.
