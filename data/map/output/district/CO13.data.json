The action # 28 has been immediately revealed of crucial importance: it deals with the designation  of a \"Digital Trainer \" for each school, which has a strategic role in the spread of digital innovation.\r\n\r\nThe 37 partner institutions of the consortium, therefore, are particularly aware about the need to allow the digital trainer to have formative experiences abroad, relating to the application of digital technology in everyday teaching.\r\n\r\nThe EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT PLAN of the consortium has a strong intrinsic unity, increased by the fact that all schools participating in the consortium refer to Marconi Service TSI, a national excellence acting as planning and operational branch at the USR. Since 1995 it has been coordinating, following, monitoring, evaluating and disseminating all the activities and experiences related to the implementation of digital skills in the region and it has a major role in the current project.\r\nAll phases of the project also will be unified within an ETWINNING dedicated project/group that, in addition to further strengthen the digital skills of those AD who still do not know the eTwinning platform, will allow an even greater regional and international cooperation, a careful  and constant monitoring of all activities as well as their wider dissemination.\r\n\r\nThe OBJECTIVES of this project are all aimed at increasing methodological and digital skills to the  AD who act as driving force for the whole school community and for the network of regional training.\r\n\r\nThe TRAINING ACTIVITIES will focus all around the attendance of high-level digital technology training as well as job shadowing activities by partner schools.\r\nTherefore, starting from Summer 2018, AD will be able to  take  chosen courses (ie, the York Associates courses in York, at the University of Wolverhampton in the UK or at ETI in Malta; or our best choices, courses at the Future Classroom Lab Brussels) or get in touch  with the partner schools to organise job shadowing experiences.\r\n\r\nThe FOREIGN PARTNERS of the project have been chosen due to a dense network of relationships which the leader of the consortium in the first place (in the figure of Servizio Marconi) and the project participants can boast as a result of long-term activities in this area.\r\nThe regional eTwinning representative  and other eTwinning colleagues have also been able to count on the variety of contacts and experiences already implemented within the platform and ask absolutely reliable and, above all, \"tested\" on the use of digital in everyday teaching foreign partners, to actively join this project.\r\n\r\nThe SELECTION of participants AD has been done  according to objective and qualified criteria: territorial representation for a guarantee of wider diffusion, belonging to the regional network of schools and training center and to the  most active schools on the subject; possession of methodological and technological  expertise that makes the AD already a trainer for other digital trainers and staff of all the schools.\r\n\r\nMONITORING process and EVALUATION methods will be continuous, throughout the project in order to assure quality and sustainability to the project itself.\r\n\r\nThe IMPACT of the training activities conducted abroad by the participants will have a very positive impact of all those involved and in different contexts, from the personal, to the college, from the local to the wider professional community, at regional and national levels.\r\n\r\nThe DISSEMINATION of these experiences will therefore be conducted in \"circles\", gradually larger, in order to reach not only the \"experts\" but the widest possible audience of stakeholders involved and interested in the issues of the application of digital technology in educational settings, thanks to the dissemination that Servizio Marconi, USR and the Ministry of Education will undertake to give prominence to the experience of school-administration synergy that at present is unique within the national scene.", "http://tendringtechnologycollege.org", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT02-KA101-047418_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CO13"}
