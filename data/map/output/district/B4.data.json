They are therefore  largely unprepared to face the increasing demands for health services arising from the expansion of an older population with specific  medical needs related to multiple chronic disorders. As a consequence, the medical conditions of a large and growing segment of the older European population are not efficiently managed by the available healthcare services. Among these conditions, the geriatric syndrome of frailty has emerged as a significant public health priority. It is defined as a multidimensional condition characterised by decreased reserve and diminished resistance to stressors. Such extreme vulnerability exposes the older individual to an increased risk of morbidity, disability, inappropriate healthcare use, institutionalization, poor quality of life, and death. Early detection and prevention of frailty are thus crucial to impede its progression and the development of its detrimental clinical consequences, while ensuring sustainability of healthcare systems of the Member States. Unfortunately, to date, no healthcare programs or pharmacological treatments are available for frail older people. This is largely due to the lack of a precise, universal definition of frailty, linked in turn to the multidimensional nature of the condition. Eventually, the existing gaps in knowledge are reflected by the absence of effective interventions. Such a barrier may be overcome by developing and validating a robust conceptual framework to achieve a practical operationalisation of frailty. This should precisely define its pathophysiological and clinical foundations, to assist in the design and implementation of specific interventions aimed at restoring robustness and delaying the onset of adverse outcomes. The present \u201cSarcopenia and Physical fRailty IN older people: multi-componenT Treatment strategies\u201d (SPRINTT) project is specifically designed to overcome the existing barriers for an efficient public health intervention against frailty, and promote the implementation of successful aging strategies across Europe. \nTo reach such an ambitious goal, the actions of the SPRINTT Consortium are directed towards the achievement of a consensus among academia, regulators, industry (pharmaceutical and medical devices), and patients\u2019 representatives over \n(1) clear operationalisation of the presently vague concept of frailty; \n(2) identification of a target population with unmet medical needs; \n(3) evaluation and validation of methodologies for implementing preventive and therapeutic strategies among frail elders at risk of disability in the European Union; \n(4) definition of an experimental setting as a template for regulatory purposes and pharmaceutical investigations; \n(5) identification of biomarkers and health technology solutions to be implemented into clinical practice. \nThus, the project is expected to pursue all the research deliverables described in nine work-packages.\nThe SPRINTT project proposes a novel operationalisation of physical frailty recognising sarcopenia as its central biological substrate. This approach is based on the fact that the physical frailty phenotype overlaps substantially  with sarcopenia. Indeed, many of the adverse outcomes of frailty are probably mediated by sarcopenia, which may therefore  represent both the biological substrate for the development of physical frailty and the pathway through which the negative health outcomes of frailty ensue. Although physical frailty encompasses only a part of the frailty spectrum, the identification of a definite biological basis (i.e., skeletal muscle decline and loss of mobility function) opens new venues for the development of interventions to slow or reverse the progression of this condition. It is noteworthy that all of the components characterising the Physical Frailty and Sarcopenia (PF&S) model are measurable and qua", 589048.0, 41731203.0, "SPRINTT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.aston.ac.uk", null, "fp7_203718_999896953"], ["7ET", "European Gram Negative Antibacterial Engine", "Aston University", "The intensive use and misuse of antibiotics has resulted in some level of antibiotic resistance in essentially all human bacterial pathogens.  There is a growing concern that the loss of therapeutic options will present us with a post-antibiotic era where present and future medical advances are negated.  Resistant bacteria dramatically reduce the possibilities of treating infections effectively, and drastically increase the risk of complications with a fatal outcome.  Antimicrobial resistance, however, is an unavoidable consequence of antibiotic use and therefore new, effective antibacterials will always be needed and once developed should be used carefully, avoiding the overuse which can drive resistance.  Despite the recognized need for new antimicrobials for clinical use, the reality is that only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to market in the last 30 years and many drug developers have left the field.  This urgency is especially true when considering resistant Gram-negative infections where carbapenem-resistance is rising and use of drugs of last resort, such as colistin, is increasing. The New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs (ND4BB) initiative is a series of programmes designed to directly address some of the scientific challenges associated with antibacterial drug discovery and development.  The ND4BB ENABLE consortium will meet the challenges ahead by creating and optimising a portfolio of new antibiotics ranging from Hits through Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe overarching goals of the ENABLE consortium are to: 1) create a drug discovery platform with the expertise and resource base to prosecute multiple antibacterial programmes in parallel; and 2) increase the overall pipeline in the antibacterial area by applying this platform to optimise a variety of antibacterial programmes.  More specifically the key objectives of the consortium are designed to increase the overall pipeline of high quality, novel mode of action medicines to treat serious systemic Gram-negative infections by identifying three antibacterial Leads, two antibacterial Candidates and progressing at least one compound into preclinical and Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe platform group is made up of academics and SMEs from across Europe with the diverse expertise including from clinical microbiology, in vivo pharmacology, computational and medicinal chemistry, ADME profiling, PKPD modelling, pharmaceutics, assay development and screening all needed to undertake this programme.  This group, coupled with additional expertise and advice from within the EFPIA partners, will bring an unrivalled focus and breadth of judgment to this important area of research.  \n\nThe programmes are coming from institutions across Europe, initially with seven efforts from public partners, and arising from a novel discovery stage alliance between GSK and Sanofi.

They are used in numerous medical and industrial applications, including communications and sensing. Polymer optical cables have lower cost and higher flexibility compared to silica. This, together with their ability to sense much higher strains than silica, makes them particularly useful in fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors.\n\nFBG sensors have perturbations in their refractive indices in their cores that manipulate light in useful ways for measuring strain. EU support of the project 'Polymer grating sensors' (POGS) enabled scientists to push the frontiers of the field, improving the technology behind POF gratings for sensor applications.\n\nModelling and development work that focused on micro-structured POFs (mPOFs) led to fabrication of a fibre for grating sensor inscription used throughout the project. It was the first instance of an mPOF doped with benzyl dimethyl ketal (BDK).\n\nInscription was made possible by creating a new advanced facility with numerous advantages. It scanned the POF horizontally with an ultraviolet (UV) laser rather than vertically through a phase mask to make the structural perturbations. This enabled easy alignment, longer grating lengths and many other benefits.\n\nGratings inscribed in mPOFs doped with BDK produced unusually high UV photosensitivity, facilitating a reflectivity of 99\u00a0% after only 13 minutes of radiation. Results were published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Assessment of the long-term stability of the fabricated gratings yielded novel results and insights leading to another publication.\n\nFinally, cleaving the POF is much more difficult than cleaving silica due to its viscoelasticity. Previously, it required expensive electronics and controllers, making the setup expensive and difficult to move. POGS developed a novel methodology, significantly enhancing portability and approaching the simplicity of a silica optical fibre cleaver. The setup also avoids the need to polish the cable's ends in order to connect it to other equipment.\n\nThe project has significantly enhanced understanding of the inscription process to make highly sensitive FBG sensors while providing a practical technique for cleaving the fabricated cables.

Alongside administration routes and doses, antigen-delivery systems were optimised in animal experiments to achieve the most efficacious combination.

Until now, the implementation of small-scale, direct biomass-to-electricity CHP systems has been limited mainly due to the quality and availability of biomass and its low-energy density.\n\nScientists initiated the EU-funded project 'Engine and turbine combustion of bioliquids for combined heat and power production' (BIOLIQUIDS-CHP) to exploit the benefits of converting solid biomass into bioliquids. In order to do so, they had to adapt engines and turbines to operate efficiently with a variety of bioliquids including pyrolysis oil. Simultaneously, they upgraded bioliquids to improve combustion properties.\n\nInvestigators chose four engines as test cases. They modified an internal combustion (IC) engine to achieve pyrolysis oil-resistant engine parts. The diesel engine operated for 40 hours on pure pyrolysis oil with no change in fuel pump or injector and no significant effect on flue gas emissions. Extensive research on catalysts led to a working CHP plant using a second IC engine with a generator, exhaust gas cleaning system, heat unit and microprocessor control system.\n\nWork on the external combustion engine resulted in an exceptional new heat engine compatible with any heat source and covering a temperature range of 50 to 1\u00a0000 degrees Celsius. Modified design of the MGT combustion chamber enabled a reduction in flue gas emissions using biodiesel and vegetable oil.\n\nScientists also successfully developed tertiary blends of pyrolysis oil, biodiesel and alcohol, for which process a patent has been submitted. In addition, the production of fast pyrolysis emulsions with biodiesel was proven effective and subsequently up-scaled.\n\nBIOLIQUIDS-CHP results should have far-reaching impact on fuels, engine components and engines.

Although over the years, these systems have become increasingly complex, the quality of optical system performance is still affected by the same key physical features: chromatic dispersion, fiber Kerr nonlinearity, and optical noise. Most of the current optical networks exploit the techniques that were originally developed for linear channels. Thus, it is not surprising that nonlinearity has a detrimental impact on such systems. It has been predicted that, within the next decade the existing optical fibre technology will approach the 'nonlinear transmission limit', which caps the achievable rate of error-free data transmission.  Thus, in order to reach a the higher capacity of optical fibres it is necessary to shift the relevant information and communications technology paradigm by introducing truly nonlinear modulation, transmission, and signal processing techniques. The aim of this project is to develop ground-breaking visionary concepts and approaches to unlock the capacity of fiber-optic communications beyond the limits of current technology by treating optical fiber as the inherently nonlinear medium it is. Our paradigm-shifting approach is based on the concept mathematical notion of integrability and the related nonlinear Fourier transform-type processing of optical signal, which allow us to use of the fibre nonlinearity in a constructive way.

ZSM-5 zeolite is the most studied catalyst for this process due to its acidity and shape-selectivity, which favour the conversion of biomass oxygenates to valuable aromatic hydrocarbons and limit the formation of coke. Among the shortcomings of the ZSM-5 zeolite is the small size of its pores; these small pores do not allow the large molecules in the pyrolysis vapours to access the active acid sites. Secondly, its sensitivity to biomass metals leads to poisoning and deterioration of its selectivity. Coupled with the high cost of the ZSM-5, the later leads to significant operating costs that arise from the necessity to replace the deactivated catalyst with fresh material at high rates.\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to investigate and improve on the economics of the process by reduction of catalyst-related operating costs and optimization of catalyst selectivity towards desirable products. This is going to be achieved through utilization of microporous zeolites modified with mesoporosity. Mixed results have been reported with such zeolites in the past. To address this, a suitable experimental procedure will be developed for the systematic study of mesoporosity through assessment of multiple aspects of catalyst performance, such as activity, selectivity, coke suppression and deoxygenation. Increased activity and selectivity is expected to result from increased accessibility of larger molecules to the zeolite acid sites.

This allows us to be confident of the quality of delivery in all three partners and also be aware of the commonality of disciplines taught. The expertise that the partner schools have in international projects is excellent.  This project involves 15 students (aged 14/15) and 3 teachers from a specialist performing arts academy in England visiting a specialist dance school in Denmark and the students and staff from the school in Denmark visiting the Academy in turn. The aims of the project are to share good practice in teaching and learning for the staff whilst at the same time allowing students to learn about new cultures and approaches to the discipline of dance. Students will overcome language barriers through the common practical language of dance.  There will be a range of tasks and team activities involved in the project and communication is therefore the key to success.  Students and staff will be involved in the planning and 'getting to know you' activities using E-Twinspace, Skype and social media prior to the start of the project. They will be involved in a preliminary program in order to get to know their Danish counterparts and learn as much as possible before meeting in person and sharing in dance lessons, whilst also delivering peer learning lessons to each other, teaching their own skills and expertise. Teaching staff will undertake a study of how dance is taught at the partner school and share good practice back at their own schools as well as to the wider local, national and international community.  This study will also include the wider application of methodology of teaching and learning in schools.  Whilst on the exchange visit students will participate in lessons, teach each other and younger students dance and experience cultural activities.  The two mobility flows will culminate in a final dance performance involving the community and be filmed for the partner school involving both sets of students.\r\nThe project will result in a greater shared knowledge of different approaches to teaching and learning in dance but also in a wider school context.  For the students the project will widen their vision of both dance education but also develop a cultural awareness of Denmark and in reverse a UK perspective.  Both sets of students will develop in their application of language and develop communication skills.  The project will foster an interest in further international study or career development for both students and staff.  It is also aimed to develop a cultural awareness within the local community through the performance element of the activities.  The findings and video documentation of the project will also provide a catalyst for discussion and further educational developments to a wider national and international audience through online sharing.\r\nProgress will be documented, at all stages, using a dedicated website featuring contributions from both teachers and students involved. This will allow the wider audience for the project to communicate and ask questions at regular intervals through online blog comment opportunities.  The project will also be promoted through social media featuring a dedicated Facebook and Twitter feed to highlight key achievements and signpost a wider audience to the website and more detail on the ingredients of the collaboration. \r\nThe impact will be both direct in terms of the students who experience the opportunity and indirect with those students who experience the performance or learn from their peers about the experience. The teaching methodologies once shared with other teachers in the schools though training sessions will then impact on the classroom methods of others who are willing to experiment and implement change.  Long term this will hopefully improve the teaching and learning in the subject as a whole.  As dance is often taught at a school by limited numbers of teachers, the network of teachers across the UK is accessible so a small project like this would make a significant impact.

By international \r\nskills we mean courage and initiative of using foreign languages, being aware of cultural differences and ability to solve problematic\r\nsituations caused by them and ability to function in multicultural and global context both in Finland and abroad.  \r\nAlready before implementing Erasmus+ program we have combined our several smaller mobility projects into one common project \r\nfor the whole college's mobility purposes. By doing so we have been able to develop a joint, equal and fair mobility process for both students and staff members and create a cost-efficient mobility operation which meets the needs of all qualifications and  departments of our college. \r\nThe main purpose of the student mobility is to offer to a certain percentenge of our students (the number is defined in our \r\nInternational Plan, which is written yearly under the main strategy of the college) a good quality on-the-job-learning experience in \r\nEurope and to provide the labour market with workforce with good international skills. Student mobility is also seen as a way to \r\nincrease the international skills of those who are staying at home - the whole group can plan the mobilitiy of their classmate \r\ntogether and follow their classmates abroad in social media. We strive to mutual cooperation with our partner colleges, both sending and receiving students.  \r\nThe aim of the staff mobility is to support the student mobility and increase its quality, but also to bring international aspect to the \r\npedagogical developement of the college. The better our staff knows the process of the student mobility and has also experienced it \r\nthemselves by going abroad together with the students, the better they can support their students when they are applying for \r\ngrants and going abroad. From the point of view of developing our organisation and deepening the state of internationalisation \r\nof it, it is essential that the teachers have personal relations with our European partners. Good relations with foreign colleagues also helps in forming strategic partnerships. The number of the grants applied for the staff members is well planned already at the application stage in order to meet the needs and long-term internationalisation plans of each qualification and/or department. Cooperation with working life plays significant role in Esedu's strategy and therefore a part of grants for the staff members are addressed to working life partners. By doing so we want to guarantee that also our international operations serve the working life  and deepen partnerships with companies and other emloyers. Offering our working life partners an opportunity to develop their international skills together with our staff members is also a part of our regional development task. \r\nStaff has an important role also when supporting students when they go abroad. For many of our students the on-the-job-learning\r\nperiod abroad is the first time they go outside the home country, and even for those students who have travelled abroad, the first independent one. We have to take this into consideration when planning and implementing student mobilities.  \r\nOur main value is responsibility and therefore it is very important to develop the student mobility process so that the experience is \r\npositive for the student even in demanding conditions abroad. \r\nWe offer grants for mobilities for all students of our college, both young and adult, and we are mainly sending abroad 2nd and 3rd year students. Our students come mainly from South Savo region, from little towns and villages, and during their basic \r\neducation they haven't necessarily had much contacts with people from different cultural background. They need a chance to \r\nactivate their language skills and gain experience that strengthens their communication skills and multicultural awareness. The\r\nstudents who get the grants are chosen in the beginning of the autumn term and staff of the international services of the college \r\ntogether with the teachers and receiving partners are taking care of the practical arragenments of the mobilities.

There are many good practices among Tredu\u2019s exchanges on different study fields and visible moderate expansion on mobility statistics. The whole concept of Tredu\u2019s international exchanges is wide as Tredu is a very large VET provider in Finland. There are many sectoral work cultures and models. And various work-based development needs on the different study fields, many student profiles and staff work situations. There are also some exchange options for newly graduated students. Student exchange flows are from 2 weeks up to 16 weeks and staff exchanges from one work week up to two, including travel days. Also work-life partners are participating in international mobility actions.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to realize international exchanges in all Tredu\u2019s study fields. Staff exchanges are an important and goal oriented way to develop sectoral and work-based training and an option to personal professional development according to the work tasks. Tredu has started staff development actions with staff learning pathways, one option being international and cultural pathway. This is among the strategic priorities in 2017 and all staff members should place their skills on international aspects during early development discussions and learning marks according to the assigned tasks on development work. One very important way to realize this (competent and skillful learner) is through participation in international exchanges. Other ways to develop international aspects in Tampere region are e.g. work-life exchanges, development projects and active participation in receiving international students to Tredu.\r\n\r\nLong student exchanges (16 weeks) have been a tradition among hotel and restaurant services and they are now extending to other study fields like business and administration. Tredu also provides vocational studies and certificates on these sectors in English language. The most part of student exchanges are from 4 to 10 weeks. The length and scope is decided together with sectoral needs, \u201ctraditions\u201d and receiving partner profiles. Some student exchanges are only 2 weeks and these are mainly aimed for students with special needs. In 2017, the aim is to realize also some exchanges with VALMA (preparatory training) students. These exchanges are accompanied with teachers and professional advisors from Tredu. Also adult VET learners are encouraged to participate on international mobility and there are options for exchanges from 2 weeks onwards. Usually, international exchange period is work-related on-the-job learning periods in local companies abroad. But also work-life visits and study periods in hosting VET schools are expanding the scope of the international experience. According to the experiences, international exchange periods are lifting up the personal independence, responsibility and self-esteem. A well planned period provides a wide conception of European work-life, VET practices and sectoral needs for the participant. It is also possible to learn and experience skills which are not available in Finland. \r\n\r\nTredu has a structured international mobility process that guidelines all the steps in the realization including Tredu\u2019s language and cultural preparation, decision making process and relevant documents, insurance cover etc. Mainly the process is done with online digital documentation in Wilma study register system. Every student mobility is recognized as a part of the learning process according to the ECVET principles. Also informal learning during mobility is recognized in Tredu according to the agreed common principles.\r\n\r\nReceiving partners are mainly organizations with whom Tredu has valid Memorandum of Understanding. These MoUs cover most of the study fields in Tredu. Tredu\u2019s Action Plan for International Affairs was finalized in spring 2016 and the new work model started in the autumn 2016. Since then the process in the real action plan on different study fields have been systematically practiced. International activities and especially mobility among students, staff and company partners have been increasing in recent years.

The School is located in an old palace in the city of C\u00f3rdoba, famous for its historical heritage as well as the mixture of different cultures and religions in the past.  At present, the School is dedicated to the teaching and practice of different studies: Baccalaureate of Arts in Secondary Education but also some artistic vocational studies such as \"Procedures of Gold work and Silver\", \"Artistic Serigraphy\", \"Artistic Ceramics\", \"Artistic Binding\", \"Artistic Gold work and Silver\", \"Cabinet-making Artistic\", \"Moulds and Sculptural Reproductions\", and \"Sculptural Skills\". At the School there is a team of 40 teachers  and about 300 pupils of very heterogeneous sociocultural and economic level as well as different ages, origin and formation.\r\n\r\n2. OBJECTIVES:\r\na) Improve the level of aptitudes and competences of teachers. Encourage education quality and improve the teaching and learning of foreign languages.\r\nb) Introduce a European dimension in the everyday School activities.\r\nc) Encourage the creation of international networks with the aim of future student short and long mobilities.\r\nd) Use the artistic expression as a means for communication, able to go beyond borders. Consider art as an expression tool for the communication of feelings and emotions.\r\ne) Exchange teaching and learning strategies and methodologies with teachers from other countries, spreading results and encouraging collaborative working. \r\nf) Improve the living atmosphere at the School by means of interdisciplinary tasks among departments.\r\ng) Encourage the use of New Technologies in the classroom.\r\n\r\n3. ACTIVITIES:\r\n- 4 training courses for the methodological and linguistic updating of teachers to take place in Italy, Portugal and Ireland.\r\n- 2 job-shadowing stays (one for each academic year of the project). First, in Soares dos Reis School of Art in Porto at the beginning of December in 2018. The second one in Birmingham Metropolitan College in December 2019.\r\nMobilities won't be overlapped. Training courses will be taken in summer holidays to avoid the absence of teachers during schooldays and the difficulties this could cause. Similarly, job-shadowing will coincide with the beginning or the end of a long weekend in December.\r\n\r\n4. METHODOLOGY:\r\nThe first of the two years of the project will focus more on teacher training by means of the four courses and the stay of job-shadowing in Porto. A second stay will take place at the beginning of the second year in Birmingham. In this second year of the project, the knowledge teachers have already acquired throughout the courses and job-shadowing will be transferred as best as possible to Bachillerato students. This second year will be dedicated to the fulfilment of final products.\r\nDuring all the project, a methodology based on \"learning by doing\" will be used. A collaborative working environment will be encouraged. Teachers will bear in mind an active participation in teamwork and the learning process, helping students to develop creativity and critical thinking.\r\n\r\n5. PRODUCTS:\r\nResults will be tangible and intangible. They will be relevant for the improvement of the linguistic and teaching competence, methodological competence, the School management and inclusion. Examples of results will be: audiovisual and multimedia projects, boarding, photography, videomaking, web pages, digital school material, etc.\r\n\r\n6. IMPACT and EUROPEAN VALUE.\r\nThe project will demonstrate clear evidences of being a highly qualified work because it must improve the teaching and learning process; it must be included in students' curriculum and our \"Plan Anual de Centro\"; it must be relevant for the School aims, the rest of educational community and society. The project can be used by other schools in a future so that other students can also take advantage of it.

The participants involved will be those who are attending the level 3, Extended Diploma Art & Design courses within the college. The age range of the students is 17 +. The work produced would also become a key part of their curriculum. The majority of the students are coming from areas which are described as socially deprived, and so this will be the first opportunity that many will have had to participate in such a project.\r\nThe objectives of the project are to give the students the opportunity to experience through practical application the skills that are being taught in specialist artistic areas, to compare the content and quality of the learning, and to see how these skills are being used in the labour market. The project will also give all of the students, and the college, the chance to look at the different traditions and heritage that is prevalent within the European Union, and compare the differences with what they now from their home.\r\nAlong with the increased training in art & craft, the students would also be given the possibility of developing their personal skills through having to work with people from another country, where language barriers will have to be overcome and cultural ways adapted to, and having to learn to work both independently and with others, students and teachers, within a team framework.\r\nDuring this time the students would work on a project within the creative departments in specialist subjects that correspond to their learning at Birmingham Metropolitan College, thus ensuring that they produce work that is relevant. \r\nThe participants will have access to  the facilities available, including the teachers and other relevant practitioners. They will also have the opportunity to work in places of employment, either individual artists/crafts people, or in business and industrial settings. Here they will see how the skills that they are learning are being applied within a real work-based situation.\r\nUpon completion of the project the participants will discuss the placements with other students through workshops, in which they can show the work produced and talk about the experience and what they have learnt from it. There work will also be on show  in an exhibition that will be advertised to the college and externally. It is expected that the students will gain a greater awareness of both the similarities and differences within the European union, yet how these can work together in the act of creation.

In a context of increasing demand of research and industrial applications around these topics, EMIMEO Masters is a concrete solution to improve the number of highly qualified students for feeding the research labs and for meeting the demand of industry. EMIMEO is a thoroughly integrated programme with a jointly developed curriculum. Areas covered range from the fundamentals of microwave electronics and photonics to their implementations with new technologies in wired and wireless communications, moving from components to system architectures for communication systems and networks.  The programmes partners are: The University of Limoges (UNILIM, France), the University of Brescia (UNIBS, Italy), Aston University (UK), and the University of Basque Country (UPV/EHU, Spain). The associate partner University of Cluj-Napoca (Romania) will also contribute to the learning programme. A panel of 15 industrial Associated Partners, including SMEs, large accompanies and associations, will support the EMIMEO programme through concrete contributions and will constitute an effective network for Master\u2019s theses with the prospect for future career development.  The Master study programme is divided into four semesters of 30 ECTS each. The first three semesters are based on lectures, lab exercises and laboratory sessions, while the last one is based on independent work related to the Master thesis. The first-year programme combines the contributions of modules of Masters of UNILIM and of UNIBS: with a first placement period in France and then in Italy the mobility scheme offers a synergic programme of fundamentals in analogue and nonlinear electronics and photonics. Students in the second year will move to one of the four partner institutions intensifying their study around one of the four paths and the associated and dedicated lab equipment for the third semester (S3): Active Management of Power Waves (AMPW) at UNILIM, Remote Sensing (RS) at UNIBS, Communication Systems and Networking (CSN) at ASTON, Instrumentation and Control Systems (ICS) at UPV/EHU. The mobility at this point can widen the student\u2019s choice with respect to the offer of each single university. Finally, the Master thesis (fourth semester) can be carried out in any of the partner institutions or associate partners, under the guidance of a professor from one of the partner universities.
