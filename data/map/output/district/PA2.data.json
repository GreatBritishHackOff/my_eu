These will be enabled/supported by developing: (i) a new machine concept: Micro-FAST CNC Machine; (ii) an innovative inline monitoring and quality inspection system; (iii) innovative multiscale modelling techniques for the analysis of the micro-structural behaviours of materials and its interactions with the production processes; (iv) new tooling techniques for high-performance tools, and (v) high-performance nano-material systems.

With development of high-volume manufacturing capabilities, the consortium sought to deliver economically competitive and high-performance micro-manufacturing processes and products for a wide range of emerging applications.\n\nManufacturing-focused activities included development of polymer microtube shaping and rolling equipment, a polymer microtube expansion/inflation machine, laser forming systems and an online product inspection system. All manufacturing technology was integrated into a common platform and specifications for an e-tool to capture and analyse manufacturing information were defined.\n\nThe Polytubes consortium also optimised and customised processes for product development and successfully designed, manufactured and evaluated first and second functional prototypes. One demonstrator in the pipeline for commercialisation is used for human sperm capture and promises to significantly enhance efficiency while reducing the cost of in vitro fertilisation.\n\nPolytubes results establish the technological readiness for volume production of polymeric microtubular components.
