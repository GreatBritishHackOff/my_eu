However, to contribute to global power this century, growth of around 100% pa is required. The challenge facing the photovoltaic industry is cost effectiveness through much lower embodied energy.

To enable this jump in performance in a timely manner, a paradigm shift is required. The revolutionary approach to these solar cells we are undertaking in the SANS project is exactly that and matches the desires of the IEA for mitigation of climate change. Our objectives are to create: highly efficient panchromatic sensitizers, ideally structured semiconducting metal oxide materials and composites; optimized non-volatile and quasi solid-state electrolyte compositions and solid-state organic hole-transporters; achieve full comprehension of the physical processes occurring during solar cell operation; and realization of a 40,000 hrs out door lifetime, being the springboard for commercialization.", 257275.0, 4454515.0, "SANS", "Low-cost third-generation photovoltaics", "EU-funded scientists made a breakthrough in the development of a nanocrystal dye-sensitised solar cell (DSSC), leading to efficiencies as high as 14\u00a0%.", "Although tremendous advances have been made in solar cell (SC) technology, widespread uptake of inorganic semiconductor solar cells has been limited. The problem is mainly a lack of cost effectiveness related to high energy consumption during manufacturing and processing (high embodied energy).\n\nPlastic electronics and solution-processable inorganic semiconductors offer a promising solution. SCs made with these inexpensive materials already demonstrate competitive efficiencies and better performance than amorphous silicon and copper indium selenide.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'Sensitizer activated nanostructured solar cells' (SANS) delivered a new generation of nano-structured SCs. Third-generation photovoltaic technologies are characterised by high scalability and cheap manufacturing of materials and panels. They can be deployed by traditional markets (solar farms and rooftop panels) or other market-changing applications such as building-integrated photovoltaics. SANS achieved a record efficiency of a low-cost solid-state DSSC (ssDSSC) in the laboratory and produced a module with a lifetime of 20 years of outdoor use.\n\nThree critical sub-systems were the key to SC development: the light-absorbing antenna, the electron-transporting meso-structured oxide and the electrolyte/hole transporter. Within these areas, the team had excellent success in producing better absorbing molecular dyes and inorganic quantum dots, novel mesoporous electrodes and improved electrolytes, and hole transporters.\n\nProject partners produced highly stable solvent-free electrolytes for DSSCs that approached the target of 20\u00a0000 hours of continuous exposure to simulated sunlight. Furthermore, they developed a new family of high-efficiency multi-chromophoric dyes, with a blue dye-sensitised solar cell well-suited for building-integrated SC applications.\n\nNew advanced mesoporous single crystals based on titanium dioxide were licensed. This material allows removal of the sintering step in ssDSSC manufacturing, greatly broadening the substrate choice and reducing costs. These single crystals promise to offer enhanced properties and potential applications of DSSCs in energy storage devices.\n\nEfficiencies around 14\u00a0% were achieved in the laboratory using perovskite absorber materials. Perovskite ssDSSC performance is expected to outperform all hitherto known first- and second-generation SCs.\n\nOver the duration of the project more than 80 scientific publications were produced, a number of patents were filed, and workshops and conferences were organised.", null, "http://www.dyesol.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/153233.jpg", "fp7_97483_986018290"], ["0RN", "Efficient Solar Cells based on Organic and hybrid Technology", "Greatcell Solar Uk Limited", "Widespread uptake of inorganic semiconductor solar cells has been limited, with current solar cell arrays only producing between 4 to 7 GW of the 15 TW (<0.04%) global energy demand, despite the terrestrial solar resource being 120,000 TW.

Their obvious benefits compared to the combustion of fossil fuels include sustainable production (a virtually limitless supply of fuel) and next to no harmful emissions.\n\nConventional photovoltaic (PV) devices use inorganic semiconductor technology. Despite the huge terrestrial solar resource and impressive annual growth of the industry, widespread uptake of inorganic semiconductor solar cell technology has been limited by cost effectiveness when seen in light of energy conversion efficiency.\n\nOrganic and hybrid technology (a combination of organic and inorganic) could revolutionise the industry now that its previously limited efficiency is approaching competitive levels. Solar cells based on such technology are superior in capturing light over a full range of intensity including under cloudy or hazy conditions or at low angles of incoming light. Their ability to produce a stable maximum power output combined with low cost of materials is promising, especially for building integrated and indoor photovoltaic solutions.\n\nEuropean scientists initiated the 'Efficient Solar Cells based on Organic and hybRid Technology' (Escort) project to develop innovative materials and processes for producing enhanced dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs). DSSCs use a photosensitive organic dye to absorb sunlight and create energy from excited electrons in a way that mimics photosynthesis. Electrons are injected onto an inexpensive inorganic semiconductor, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), while holes are transferred to a redox shuttle.\n\nThe consortium is combining DSSCs expertise in the EU and India and using creative molecular engineering and recent advances in nanotechnology.
