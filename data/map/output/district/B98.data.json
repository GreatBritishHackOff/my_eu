Even in the actual economic crisis, global demand of A-B class cars is expected to grow by about 5.3% in 2010, with a positive sale scenario in the next years. In-wheel electric motor architecture holds major advantages for these A-B class, allowing high modularisation of the vehicle architecture, increased interior space and improved driveability. However, current existing solutions for in-wheel motor are still in prototype phases, resulting in non-existence of A-B class EV car commercialized and equipped with in-wheel motor, even though the predicted market for this technology is 100K vehicles for 2015.\n\n\n\nThe main objective of this proposal is the design, development and validation of a complete in wheel motor assembly prototype (electric motor, power electronics, reduction gear, structural parts and wheel), based on a McPherson corner suspension topology, to meet the defined car top level specifications. The main technical risks associated with the use of an in-wheel concept are the thermal stress under extreme operation conditions, vehicle dynamics, driveability, safety and durability. The proposed baseline concept will be based on an air cooled motor in wheel concept, with conventional airflow driven by vehicle, and forced airflow provided by an innovative wheel design. Detailed specifications of extreme operation conditions will be defined and validated by the OEM, during the project, including the hot day-cold day conditions, representative of vehicle extreme use. During the assembly and testing phase, the aspects related to vehicle dynamics, driveability, safety, user acceptance, reliability, previously defined, will be validated with the motor in wheel prototypes installed in a test vehicle. In addition, aspects as eco-desing, LCA of the concept and components, dismantling and recyclability of key materials and rare earths will be considered during the in-wheel concept design.", 255981.0, 3891380.0, "EUNICE", "Novel concept for sustainable electric cars", "Today's electric vehicles (EVs) suffer from relatively high buying prices. An EU-funded project is developing and evaluating a new integrated electric motor concept in which the wheels are housing the entire powertrain except the battery.", "With EU funding of the 'Eco-design and validation of in-wheel concept for electric vehicles' (http://www.eunice-project.eu/ (EUNICE)) project, researchers are working on developing a complete in-wheel motor assembly prototype. Despite an expected market of 100 000 vehicles for the technology by 2015, most existing in-wheel designs are still at the prototype stage.\n\nExcept for the wheel and the electric motor, power electronics, structural parts, brakes and a reduction gear are also parts of the prototype system. The proposed concept is based on a widely used front suspension system \u2014 the MacPherson strut \u2014 and should be able to meet typical B-segment EV requirements.\n\nTo develop and evaluate a concept car, focus will be placed on factors such as thermal stress under extreme operating conditions, vehicle dynamics, driveability, safety and durability. Attention is paid to aspects such as eco-design, component and whole-car life-cycle assessment analysis, dismantling, and recycling of important materials such as rare earths. The in-wheel motor concept provides greater scope for revolutionising the vehicle architecture, greatly increasing the interior space (the only remaining part to be housed in the car body is the battery) and improving driving performance.\n\nProject partners have defined the specifications and performance criteria for the EUNICE solution. Furthermore, they have performed a structural integrity and mechanical integration analysis of the components. Other work has included a thermal assessment analysis of the electric motor and power electronics sub-modules.\n\nOverheating is a great risk for in-wheel motors, particularly since the proposed concept features a fully air-cooled motor, with conventional airflow driven by the vehicle and assisted by an innovative wheel design. This ensures that enough airflow is provided to the in-wheel system to evacuate the heat in urban and motorway driving cycles. In addition, a fan is considered for the standstill case, whenever the car needs to drive slowly when the electric motor is at high temperatures.\n\nWith its activities, EUNICE is establishing the basis for a world-level European industry manufacturing electric motors and components with required performances at competitive costs.", null, "http://www.gkn.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/155650.jpg", "fp7_104622_960728256"], ["9HL", "An innovative environmentally friendly thermo-electric power generation system for automotive and marine applications that is powered by exhaust waste thermal energy to reduce fuel consumption", "Thermex Limited", "Car CO2 emissions are to be limited to 120 g/km for all new passenger cars by 2012. If they are unable to achieve targets, then this may have a significant negative impact on manufacturers. Cars also produce emissions such as Nitrogen oxides, Hydrocarbons, Carbon monoxide and particulate matter which are subject to tight controls. For marine application, existing and forthcoming legislation is aiming at reducing the emissions of Carbon Monoxide, Hydrocarbons and particulate matter. In addition, concerns about rising fuel costs are driving the need for greater fuel efficiencies. As a result, a disruptive technology step is required that will enable the manufactures or cars and marine engines to meet the forthcoming legislative standards. One very attractive way of achieving this is to generate power from the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) waste heat.\nA prototype system created by BMW can generate up to 250W of electricity under normal driving conditions that can cut fuel consumption by up to 2%. However, the thermo-electric materials used for these applications to date have a number of clear limitations as they can be easily thermally damaged, are expensive and only achieve low efficiencies.\nThe POWER DRIVER project aims to overcome the limitations relating to the production of an automotive and marine power generation system by integrating cutting-edge nano-structured silicide and functionally graded telluride thermo-electric materials into a heat exchanger assembly that will enable electrical power to be generated from the exhaust system without affecting back-pressure or engine balance. By doing this, the exhaust system created will offer greatly improved environmental performance due to improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions (CO2, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulates) at a cost that is affordable to the end-user. It is predicted that (even if the additional weight of the unit is considered) fuel efficiency will increase by at least 5%, leading to a corresponding 5% reduction in emissions.", 287662.0, 2530500.0, "Power Driver", "Turning waste heat into energy", "Only a fraction of the energy released by burning fossil fuels is converted into mechanical or electricity energy with most of the energy released as heat and written off as a loss. Thermoelectric materials developed by an EU-funded project may provide the solution to this energy problem.", "Between one half and two thirds of the fossil fuels burnt to generate energy are dissipated as heat into the atmosphere. While it has long been known that waste heat can be converted into energy the efficiency of early thermoelectric power generation systems was so low that it limited their applications.\n\nThermoelectric generators are essentially devices designed to convert heat directly into electricity using two materials and a temperature gradient. The greater the temperature difference between the 'hot' side and the 'cold' side the greater the power that can be produced.\n\nWithin the http://www.powerdriver.info/ (POWER DRIVER) project the focus was to design thermoelectric generators that could be mass produced for use in automotive waste heat recovery.\n\nSpecifically, two small thermoelectric generators have been designed: one based on silicide materials and another on telluride materials. Silicide and lead telluride (Pb/Te) based materials were synthesised and then processed using spark plasma sintering to produce thermo-electric materials with performance comparable to that found in the literature.\n\nThe thermoelectric devices have been integrated with control and power electronics. The most suitable solution was selected for mounting onto a hot air testrig where the exhaust of a 2litre gasoline car was simulated to establish its performance. This, in addition to estimated manufacturing and selling costs, was used to evaluate the new technology's commercial attractiveness.\n\nOnce completed the POWER DRIVER system will extract waste heat from the exhaust that will deliver direct current electrical power to the vehicle electrical system and thus reduce the alternator demand giving improved fuel efficiency by as much as 5 %.", null, "http://www.thermex.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/148548.jpg", "fp7_102258_952894924"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B98"}
