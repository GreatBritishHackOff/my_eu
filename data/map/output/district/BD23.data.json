Water information is highly sought after by many kinds of end-users, both within government and business as well as within civil society. Water touches virtually all societal and environmental domains and the knowledge domain is largely multidisciplinary. New water information and knowledge can thus lead to more efficient use of environmental services and better handling of environmental problems, including those induced by climate and environmental change.  SWITCH-ON will show the benefits achieved through the whole process chain by re-purposing (re-using under different context) open data products into more dedicated and refined water products, which have high value and a broad impact on society.\nThe vision is to improve public services, and to foster business opportunities and growth, by establishing new forms of water research and facilitating the development of new products and services based on principles of sharing. The SWITCH-ON objectives are to use open data for implementing: 1) an innovative spatial information platform with open data tailored for direct water assessments, 2) an entirely new form of collaborative research for water-related sciences, 3) fourteen new operational products and services dedicated to appointed end-users, 4) new business and knowledge to inform individual and collective decisions in line with the Europe\u2019s smart growth and environmental objectives. While focusing on water, the project is expected to inspire a much broader environmental and societal knowledge domain and many different end-users.

The College has participated in Leonardo\r\nfunded programmes since 2007, and was delighted to receive the  Erasmus+ Charter. The College sees European Mobility as a key part of our Internationalisation strategy, a unique opportunity for raising student aspirations and benefits from providing such an enriched curriculum and work experience offer to its students.\r\n\r\nThe College is undergoing significant change, with a core focus on improving student outcomes.  We are rationalising curriculum delivery in response to reduced student numbers and to ensure a focus on the quality of student experience remains. This proposal, therefore, carries forward the 3 most successful projects and partnerships developed by different vocational areas within the\r\nCollege and are now all housed under The School of Professional and Leisure Industries. \r\n\r\nBritish Values and resilience remain a core theme within all of our provision, alongside citizenship and the continuing importance of gaining employability skills. The planned Erasmus+ mobilities allow students to further explore British values in the context of other European countries, and develop their resilience through independent living and working throughout the visit. \r\n\r\nThe visits primarily fall under the first aim of the College's Internationalisation Strategy: 'Explore ongoing opportunities for student and staff mobility to enhance the College\u2019s offer', staff will continue to liaise with partners to inform the College's curriculum and update their knowledge. Work Experience is now a mandatory element of college courses at Level 2 and above. \r\n\r\nThe flows will comprise of the following activities: \r\n\u2022 60  Aviation students will visit Air Malta's Training Centre at Malta International Airport, Luqa (30 in 17/18, 30 in 18/19). Students are studying BTEC National Diploma in either Aviation Operations or Aircraft Maintenance. Participants take part in a structured programme of work placements throughout the airport in a variety of departments. The mobility allows students to access air-side operations which are unavailable to them in the UK due to security restrictions.\r\n\r\n\u2022 32 Business students (including those studying on a tourism pathway) will visit the Tri-City Region, Poland (16 in 17/18, 16 in 18/19). Structured work placements and shadowing are provided in a variety of small business start-ups, alongside visits to Polish organisations within different business sectors (including the large manufacturers and SMEs within Wladyslawowo, Gdansk, Gdynia and Sopot). There are distinct similarities in the regeneration of the Tri-City area and North Yorkshire, from a predominance of primary industry to travel and tourism. The contrasting elements also inform students understanding of regeneration in different areas. \r\n\r\n\u2022  60 Sport students (Football, Rugby and Fitness Pathway) will visit Etel\u00e4-Kymenlaakso, Kotka (30 in 17/18, 30 in 18/19). The project develops participant skills in coaching, training, sports fitness, leadership in sport, assessing risk and sports nutrition, through coaching and officiating opportunities in local schools and teams, along with training with and competing against professional clubs HJK and KTP, and KooTeePee amateur club to develop competency. Coaching and team work skills contribute to BTEC National Diploma units. \r\n\r\nStudents are always accompanied by Craven College staff to support their experience (participants are aged 16-19, with the majority under 18yrs old). We have planned 2 annual flows per partner country, ensuring students are able to participate in mobilities in the College's academic years of 2017/18 and 2018/19.  Each separate 'flow' and the associated student placements and partner liaison will have a nominated leader, normally the Subject Sector Leader and/or someone who has already participated in a European Mobility project.
