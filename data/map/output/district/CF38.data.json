Although the EU policies target increased use of renewable energy to 12% of gross energy production by 2010, this commitment has also highlighted the urgent need for improving the energy utilization of fossil-fuel based power-plants to allow continuation of the energy intensive lifestyle of EU countries.\nThermoelectric (TE) devices can play a very important role in efficient energy harvesting, and recovery. TE devices are \u2018fuel-free\u2019 solid-state devices with no moving parts and therefore are extremely reliable. TEs can harvest residual low-grade energy which otherwise is wasted. To date, their use is limited by low conversion efficiency. The key factor for improving the performance of TE applications is mainly through the development of TE materials as well as corresponding TE module/device technology and design, based on the material types, which can ensure better performance. Recent advances in nanotechnology offer unprecedented opportunities in designing and fabricating increasingly complex material architectures with controlled and hierarchical microstructures. Theoretical predictions showed that low-dimensional TE materials with figure of merits (a measure of the goodness of TE materials) can be spectacularly enhanced from currently ~1 to extremely high values of 5 -10 (up to 20). The present proposal is concerned with applying modern nanotechnology principles to the design and creation of novel material architectures with enhanced TE properties, with close feedback with theoretical studies. The material architectures considered in this proposal are chosen based on suitability for the development of next generation TE modules and devices, designed for a few specific promising applications including harvesting waste energy from automobiles and environmentally benign, efficient cooling systems", 14531.0, 5334367.0, "NEXTEC", "Usable energy from waste heat", "Exploiting nanotechnology, EU-funded scientists worked on improving performance of thermoelectric (TE) materials to turn heat into electric power. Generating electricity from hot waste gases in car exhausts and industrial processes are some exciting applications of the project's technology.", "Small amounts of energy abound in the environment in the form of heat, light, sound and vibration. Most of this energy is wasted. Individual sources are in such small amounts that they cannot really supply useful power to devices, and efficient and cost-effective technology has not been available to exploit them. With energy harvesting, devices capture such energy from one or more sources, storing and accumulating it and even converting it to a more useful form for a given application.\n\nThe EU-funded project NEXTEC (Next generation nano-engineered thermoelectric converters - From concept to industrial validation) used nano-structured skutterudites (SKTs) and bismuth telluride to develop TE modules for electric power and cooling applications, respectively.\n\nThe high-temperature TE properties of SKTs make this material suitable for waste heat recovery in cars in temperatures of approximately 600\u00a0\u00b0C. Other than performing better at high temperatures, the newly developed material also solved many issues associated with thermal expansion and thermal stresses.\n\nScientists also developed test benches and simulation models to test the performance of the developed power generation modules. A comprehensive life-cycle assessment analysis of SKT-based TE modules was performed to determine the environmental and toxicological impact of the nanomaterial for electricity generation from automobile exhaust gases.\n\nCytotoxicity studies of SKTs suggested that their toxicity should likely be similar to that of their metal components.\n\nThe nano-structured SKTs reduce thermal conductivity, helping to deliver more electric power to cars. Such a material could also find use in industries where there is wasted heat. NEXTEC resulted in over 40 publications in conference presentations and journals.

This class of TE material would have the following attractive characteristics: (i) ZT value >1.5 for both n-type and p-type doped material, (ii) operational in the temperature range 300-550\u00baC, (iii) very low density of 2 g/cm3, especially suitable for transportation applications, (iv) high melting point of >1000\u00baC, and good thermal stability up to 600\u00baC, (v) good oxidation and corrosion resistance and mechanical strength, (vi) isotropic thermoelectric properties, (vii) non-toxicity of elements, (viii) widely-available pure materials with very large EU supply chains and (ix) low raw material cost <15 Euros/kg, combined with low manufacturing costs. A number of methods will be looked at to achieve 3D bulk nanocrystalline Mg2Si including low-cost combustion synthesis, mechanical alloying and high-temperature solid-state synthesis in inert crucibles. Various ball milling approaches will be used to produce doped Mg2Si nanoparticle constituents that can then be compressed via rapid spark plasma sintering or hot pressing in vacuum. 3D nanocomposite material will also be produced with the addition or in-situ production of inert nanoparticles, as well as thin films using multilayer approaches. Doping using various elements will be predicted by ab-initio density-functional theory modelling. These methods will lead to the safe production of nanostructured n- and p-type legs for further thermoelectric and materials testing. In order to prove the concept works, demonstrator modules will be assembled that integrate the new energy-harvesting nanostructured material. Such modules have widespread applications in automotive, aerospace and manufacturing sectors, where waste heat can be usefully recovered, with clear environmental benefits.", 36315.0, 5302922.0, "THERMOMAG", "Energy from waste heat", "New thermoelectric materials could help to harvest heat lost by trucks, aircraft and factories. A material's initial composition, the processing techniques, the structures formed and final properties of the material are important.", "Since fuels are costly both financially and in terms of their effects on the environment, they are an obvious choice for improvement of efficienciesMuch of the energy used in trucking, aviation and factories is wasted by heat loss. The figure can be as high as 70\u00a0% of the chemical energy of petroleum fuel.\n\nHigh-performance lightweight modules used for exhaust pipes can convert some of this heat loss into electricity. The 'Nanostructured energy-harvesting thermoelectrics based on Mg2Si' (http://www.thermomag-project.eu (THERMOMAG)) project is mainly aimed at trucks, power plants and factories because they have potential for major scaling-up. \n\nThe principal scientific objective is to understand the behaviour of thermoelectric (TE) materials based on Mg2Si, from the initial composition through to final properties. Processing techniques and the structures formed, at both micro- and nano- levels, are of special interest.\n\nAmong the many project achievements so far are a supply chain analysis for magnesium and silicon, a life-cycle analysis and a cost-benefit analysis for trucks and passenger cars. The researchers studied n-type and p-type doping, and selected higher manganese silicides as alternative p-type materials. THERMOMAG tests also involved inter-lab collaboration. \n\nManufacturing Mg2Si from silicon nanopowder proved difficult at all stages. It was impossible to make pellets with the desired properties, but an alternative method, mixing powders of different grain sizes, was successful. The final nanostructured products did not have the desired thermoelectric properties, and there may be significant limitations on using nanostructuring to improve the TE properties of Mg2Si. Research is continuing on this aspect. \n\nSince so much energy is lost as heat in many industries and processes, even a small percentage of energy harvesting could provide valuable financial savings. It would also lessen environmental impacts.
