This is a problem since as societies become more complex, increasing scope and unpredictability of potential crises and faster dynamics of major incidents put increasingly stringent demands on CM. European CM capabilities already constitute a mature System of Systems; hence wholesale redesign would often be too costly and might critically destabilise existing CM capabilities. Therefore DRIVER\\ focuses on augmenting rather than replacing existing capabilities. DRIVER\\ has three main objectives: 1) Develop a pan-European Test-bed for crisis management capability development; 2) Develop a well-balanced comprehensive portfolio of crisis management solutions, and 3) Facilitate a shared understanding of crisis management across Europe.\n\nThe DRIVER\\ Test-bed will provide the technological infrastructure, the necessary supporting methodology and adequate support tools. The Portfolio of Solutions (PoS) is a database driven web site that documents all the available DRIVER\\ solutions. The PoS includes information on the experiences with a solution (i.e. results and outcomes of trials), the needs it addresses, the type of practitioner organisations that have used it, the regulatory conditions that apply, societal impact consideration, a glossary, and the design of the trials. Initially, the PoS will contain information about the solutions that are already available within the consortium; the PoS will be extended with third-party solutions when required by the trials, and ultimately opened up for any external organisation to share data and experiences on solutions.\n\nA series of trials will be conducted during which solutions will be operationalised and tested. All results of the trials will be stored and made available in the PoS. Several I4CM events will be organized as well as a final conference. In addition to this, a firm link is established and will be maintained with DG HOME\u2019s \u201cCommunity of Users on Secure, Safe and Resilient Societies\u201d and other European stakeholder groups and relevant initiatives, for instance on standardization.\n\nTo maximise impact beyond the scope of the project and of the DRIVER\\ consortium it is necessary to develop the sustainability of the European Test-bed, the exploitation of the DRIVER Portfolio of Solutions and to promote a European CM community, which shares a common CM understanding and is increasingly willing to share capabilities and collaborate in CM innovation. Together this will boost Europe\u2019s ability to continue adapting to new threats and emerging needs, laying the basis for a continuously resilient EU and providing a mechanism to drive innovation in European CM by bridging the gap from practitioners need and R&D to the market.", 306092.0, 36008950.0, "DRIVER+", null, null, null, null, "http://www.disasterwaste.org", null, "fp7_188608_952266849"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5RZ", "EX-CHANGE \u2013 Enhance language exchanges for professional development of educational staff", "Language In Ltd", 81919.0, "In the last ten years the school system has been at the centre of the political debate in Italy with a series of political reforms trying to face new needs and priorities.

The project will offer the chance to meet and talk to other foreign colleagues, exchange ideas and practices, and strengthen key competences such as foreign language skills; digital knowledge applied on tourist marketing (structure course); update of specialized knowledge such as accounting, finance and building sector; and tourism (by job shadowing activities);\r\n-             Improve the methodology to approach to school/work alternation; \r\n- Facilitate the adaptation and modernization of the Institute with the acquisition of new teaching methodologies, kits and tools already implemented in an European context that can be adapted to local school needs and to the main school courses, such as Marketing and Finance and Engineering, Environment and Territory;\r\n- Strengthen, on an European level , the existing and new relations amongst higher education institutes and businesses in order to develop joint activities and collaborations, such as mobility and teaching staff, students and newly graduates training;\r\n- Experience intercultural contexts to improve teaching skills which take into account students\u2019 different needs, with a specific focus on disadvantaged situations experienced by the children of refugees attending the Institute;\r\n- Inform the colleagues not involved in the project of the European existing opportunities, and  launch a new information service that will be called \u201cSportello Europa\u201d.\r\nThe mobility program will allow 35 participants to attend two mobility experiences. Candidates should be:\r\n- foreign language teachers or teachers with a technical expertise in the two main courses of the institute (marketing, finance, accounting, tourist hospitality, building, environment and territory); \r\nThe project activities will last two weeks. There will be an intensive English course, followed by a job-shadowing activity to be delivered in Ireland at Swan Training Institute to develop structured courses in English language and courses in tourism marketing, and in the United Kingdom at The Language in Group for the implementation of job-shadowing activities.\r\n The methodology developed by the partnership follows the main division of the activities into key phases, namely the preparatory phase (with the selection of participants and practical organization of the mobility); the implementation of the mobility and the follow-up phase together with the validation of the results and learning outcomes achieved, and the final launch of the \u201cSportello Europa\u201d service.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the general improvement of linguistic skills, and communicative and management skills, with a greater awareness of cultural diversity which occasions of enrichment will bring a renewed spirit of collaboration with foreign partners.\r\nIn terms of results and impact, an overall improvement of the educational offer and of the services of the institutes is expected, thanks to the use of innovative approaches in teaching activities that combine teamwork and use of new technologies in class. \r\nOn a long-term perspective, a modernized teaching system will have a positive impact on students education and will make them develop essential skills for the challenging job market.

A profound theoretical and practical education and training in the field of tourismas well as a  competent language skills in English and Italian forms a comprehensive educational framework for this goal. \r\n\r\nPart of this work-oriented education are obligatory practical trainings of 12 weeks.  \r\nIn the past two years the interest of the students and graduates of the HLW Lienz in doing a practical training abroad has risen enormously. In order to facilitate all the work regarding practical trainings abroad for all people involved (students, parents, teachers, partner enterprises) two teachers got in charge of co-ordinating the entire Erasmus+ programme for the school and founded the  Verein der HLW / HF Lienz zur F\u00f6rderung von Auslandspraktika in the school year of 2015/16.\r\nWith this additional offer of training places abroad as well as the entire co-ordination of the Erasmus+ programme organised at the school, the internationalisation and the quality management of the two schools could be intensified and the positive reputation of the schools as a contact point for international work experience was established.  Due to the positive  feedback regarding the Erasmus+ programme by students and their parents as well as teachers of secondary schools we can also assume that the option of doing a practical training abroad has already become one of the main reasons why these students choose our schools their next educational step. \r\n\r\nAdditionally to the strong co-operation with the partner enterprises, based on mutual visits and a regular communication and contact throughout the whole year, the Erasmus + programme was promoted at the school and in the whole area with a vast amount of information about it. This included informational meetings as well as a buddy project with former trainees, information evenings for parents and students, permanent information boards introducing the Erasmus+ programme as well as all the parntner enterprises at the school, articles and blogs about the project on the homepage of the school, presentations about it at the parents' day and all secondary schools of East Tyrol etc..  Through this advertising of the programme as well as the personal networking of the trainees regarding this project other schools have already been inspired to consider practical trainings abroad for their students and the news about Erasmus+ programmes is spreading.\r\n\r\nCurrently 33 students are involved in this project. All of them have already signed their placement contracts as well as Learning Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding with the partner enterprises in England and Italy. All the training places have been chosen by the students themselves. They all got a positive reply for a practical training after their application including Europass CVs, motivation letters and personal job interviews. As all partner enterprises only have had positive experiences with trainees from our two schools, this co-operation has turned out to be a win-win situation for both: our schools profit from this additional international offer and the training places can rely on polite, helpful, dedicated and competent trainees for the most hectic period of work.\r\n  \r\nBesides an improvement in practical knowhow, intercultural knowledge and linguistic competences, which all lead to better resuls in the final exams as well as the A-levels, a practical training abroad is especially important for the positive development of all personal and social skills, especially an enhanced self-esteem of the trainees. This huge step in their personal development obviously also has a great impact on their further career at the school and in their later life.  Their career prospects do not only increase because of this international work experience but also due to their - often newly gained - openness, flexibiltiy and professional appearance which they get during an international internship. A large number of students who have done a practical training abroad plan a longer placement abroad after their final exams and they are much more confident and sure about their future plans when they start applying for jobs in international companies.
