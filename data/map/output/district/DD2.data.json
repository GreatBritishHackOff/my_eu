However, types with six rows of grain emerged soon after the domestication of the species and quickly became the dominant form in primitive agricultural systems.  This morphological and developmental switch is generally accepted to result from recessive mutations in a single gene called SIX-ROWED SPIKE 1 (VRS1).  However alleles at several other SIX-ROWED SPIKE genes have since been identified and shown to interact with VRS1 to enhance the six-row phenotype.  The appearance of six-rowed types provided a major yield enhancement in early agriculture and although the gap between two- vs. six. row types has narrowed through breeding, it is clear that considerable potential remains for exploiting the development of up to three times as many grains per inflorescence as a route towards increasing yield.  In this project I will take a novel approach in a crop plant to understand how this switch is elaborated.  I propose using Laser-Capture Microdissection of the group of cells that initiate the development of fertile lateral florets, coupled with RNA-seq of the resulting tiny RNA samples.  I will compare the obtained transcript profiles over developmental time from a pair of nearly isogenic lines that differ only for VRS1 (i.e. Vrs1/vrs1), thus avoiding any genetic background noise.  I will use the comparative data to identify differentially expressed genes and the time series data to investigate the network of interactions that promote this characteristic switch between infertile and fertile inflorescence.  Finally, I will initiate the production of transgenic knockdown plants to explore the functional effects of some of the identified genes on inflorescence development.

To deliver improvement and sustainability in crop production it will be necessary to harness a broad spectrum approaches. Crop improvement will be crucial and a major part in the delivery of this will be based on classical breeding. This harnesses the genetic variation that is generated by homologous recombination during meiosis. Meiotic recombination creates new combinations of alleles that confer new phenotypes that can be tested for enhanced performance. It is also crucial in mapping genetic traits and in the introgression of new traits from sources such as wild-crop varieties. Despite the central role played by meiosis in crop production we are remarkably ignorant as to how the process is controlled in these species. For example, it is not known why recombination in cereals and forage grasses is skewed towards the ends of the chromosomes such that an estimated 30-50% of genes rarely, if ever, recombine thereby limiting the genetic variation that is available to plant breeders. Moreover, as many crop species are polyploid a further level of complexity is added to the meiotic process.

Metabolism and growth at night are fueled by carbohydrates released by degradation of starch, synthesised from photosynthesis in the preceding day. Starch synthesis and degradation are regulated such that starch reserves are almost but not quite exhausted at the end of the night, in both long and short nights. We have recently found that this robust regulation is a function of the circadian clock, an endogenous timer that allows plants to anticipate and prepare for daily changes in their environment, and a paradigm for Systems Biology. The clock controls the rate of starch degradation at night, so that reserves last until the anticipated dawn. Starvation and growth arrest are avoided.

Metabolism and growth at night are fueled by carbohydrates released by degradation of starch, synthesised from photosynthesis in the preceding day. Starch synthesis and degradation are regulated such that starch reserves are almost but not quite exhausted at the end of the night, in both long and short nights. We have recently found that this robust regulation is a function of the circadian clock, an endogenous timer that allows plants to anticipate and prepare for daily changes in their environment, and a paradigm for Systems Biology. The clock controls the rate of starch degradation at night, so that reserves last until the anticipated dawn. Starvation and growth arrest are avoided.

However, powerful molecular technologies can be used to isolate and characterise bacteria DNA, thereby overcoming the problem of cultivation.\n\nAlthough some species of bacteria are abundant in the natural environment, most species are composed of very small populations, the so-called rare biosphere. Therefore, the structure of the bacterial community can provide a powerful tool for tracing the origin of a soil sample.\n\nThe MISAFE project promoted the forensic use of soil microbial communities by developing appropriate technologies to ensure suitable resolution, reliability and robustness of results.

Insecticide resistance in aphids is of particular concern. Besides being major agricultural and horticultural pests, aphids contribute to spread of plant viral diseases. We need to test for resistance traits in aphids to advise growers on the most appropriate insecticide programme required to avoid resistance to insecticides developing in aphids.

However, traditional dose-response testing of pests to determine the nature of their resistance is time-consuming.

CO is exploited in plant breeding through the generation of large populations of recombinants from which genetically improved individuals are selected.  However in some economically important crops such as barley, the rate of improvement has plateaued. One hypothesis is that this is due to constraints on the locations of CO.  In large genome cereals CO is restricted to the ends of chromosomes, excluding approximately two thirds of the genome from the breeding process.\n\nThis project focuses on three critically important questions about CO in barley:  Why is it restricted to the telomeric ends of chromosomes?  What proteins are the key players and what are their roles in controlling CO?  And, what strategies can be established to effectively increase or redistribute CO in CO-poor regions?\n\nI will address these questions in four Work Packages. In WP1 I will induce, identify and molecularly characterise putative meiotic mutants both phenotypically (at the plant level) and molecularly by captured exome sequencing. In WP2 I will characterise these mutants cytologically, genetically and by complementation to understand how the mutations affect recombination.  In WPs 3 and 4, I will apply novel methods to isolate the specific cells undergoing meiosis, and use transcriptomics, targeted proteomics and pull-down assays to investigate how meiosis is regulated.  I will focus on complexes that mark the sites of DNA double strand break (DSB) formation that identify where CO will occur.  I will characterise these sites according to those resolved as either crossing-over or non-crossing-over events and relate their physical location to COs observed in population genetic data.

Our involvement in this project is upskill our varied range of experiences amongst our staff. As part of the Scottish Government 1+2 policy, we are embedding the teaching of foreign languages within our establishment. \r\n\r\nObjectives \r\nOur school based projects aims to provide our teaching staff with resources and teaching strategies targeted to the learning of modern languages. One key area is to increase staff confidence and competence in their French language skills in order to deliver French teaching more effectively. We also wish to develop cultural awareness and understanding of another country within our school community. We are looking forward to having a strong emphasis on the use of ICT, and making use of electronic resources to make links with schools in other countries. \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nWe expect there to be four participants who are all teaching members of staff at Ancrum Road Primary.  One member is our Principal Teacher with teaching experience of 15 years and is currently our 1+2 coordinator.  One member is an experienced teacher of nine years who has promoted and exclusively taught modern languages within the school.  One member is a middle stage teacher with four years experience and is enthusiastic to develop the 1+2 programme within her classroom. One member is an infant teacher who has nine years teaching experience who is confident but would like to continue building upon her relative knowledge of French. \r\n  \r\nDescription of activities\r\nIt is the aim for participants to share their new experiences of a range of classroom based practical activities with all Ancrum Road teaching staff, surrounding topics including: The French alphabet, French pronunciation, getting to know each other, giving personal information, asking/answering questions, giving information about others, vocabulary for physical description, incl. parts of the body, colours, verbs in the present tense, introduction to past tenses and practice, numeracy in French, the French calendar and festivals, use of songs in FL teaching, giving/understanding instructions, increasing fluency in French, exchanging ideas for activities, examples of good practice / professional dialogue, group work and use of ICT in FL teaching.\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nThe initial stage for participants will include course preparation and forming a staff based support network, participating in the immersion course, completing a logbook, collaborating with other participants, asking questions, professional dialogue and thinking about implementation, reflection and establishing next steps. On return to the school, the dissemination of learning with the staff will include sharing learning collegiately with staff, applying learned experiences within the classroom, participating in observing good practice, establishing working group with responsibility for updating School improvement plan, creating and managing physical and electronic resources. The next stage for implementation with pupils will take the form of events and activities such as; classroom based learning activities, whole school assemblies, peer educating, school French cafe, French signage around the school, French Fridays, e-Twinning and ICT based learning.  The follow up course will allow the participants to share and extend on and develop a sustainable change in our French teaching practice. The effectiveness of the project will be evaluated through staff audits and good practice visits with the results being shared with all school stakeholders and pupil progress through the French curriculum will be tracked using the 1+2 Power Language Platform which links with Curriculum for Excellence experiences and outcomes. \r\n\r\nResults and Impact\r\nTeachers will be more confident and competent to teach a Modern Language as a result of the support and experience of the participants. Staff across the school will develop their own French language skills and increase their strategies for teaching Modern Languages.  An increase of spoken French will be integrated throughout the school on a daily basis.  Long term, children will be confident learners in Modern Languages taught within the school and will have an increased awareness of French culture.

This has given us excellent international professional development on how young children begin to learn.\r\n\r\nIt has increased our interest in developing a strategic partnership to address some of our long-term goals for school development and to make a significant difference, contributing to the improvement plans of all our partner schools.\r\n\r\nThe Erasmus+ proposal \u201cHow children learn languages\u201d is a natural extension from our previous work, and provides the chance to focus on a subject which is central to all our schools\u2019 programmes.\r\n\r\nWe plan to look more closely at the learning and teaching of foreign languages with two of our Comenius partners. We have carefully sought and chosen three new partner schools with similar needs for the project, but who have specific recognised best practice in areas different from our own, and are new to international projects.\r\n\r\nWe aim to discover what makes language learning enjoyable and effective for children, resulting in better, more willing and confident communicators in foreign languages.\r\nOur objectives are to\r\nimprove our teaching skills\r\nincrease our pupils' attainment in communicating in one or more foreign languages\r\nprovide lasting school improvement\r\n\r\nThe project partners are all primary schools, of different sizes ranging from 75 to 300 pupils. Some of these schools have separate secondary education departments. Some teach more than one language to their youngest children; some teach other curriculum subjects in a foreign language; some use all their class teachers to teach a foreign language. The age range for the project is 3 to 12, and we will include as many as possible of the pupils in each school in project activities. We will also include as many as possible of the teachers in each school in project activities.\r\n\r\nOur methodology follows a successful format established in our previous project.\r\nSix international project meetings will be held to manage the project and move it forwards. Study sessions are inserted into each of these meetings, when the best practice in foreign language learning and teaching in the host partner schools can be observed and then critically discussed and evaluated.\r\nAfter this, and before the next project meeting, each school will undertake structured trials of new ideas, teaching approaches and resources in their own schools, based on what has been observed. The results of these trials will be analysed and the results reported back to the partners at the next project meeting. Baseline assessments will be used to capture the outcomes in terms of increased pupil and teacher performance and confidence. An external educational research expert will assist the partners to develop this into a credible, reliable and productive process.\r\n\r\nThis process is repeated five times during the project.\r\n\r\nThe major results include a set of reports, recommendations and case studies.
