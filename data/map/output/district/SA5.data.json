They also represent a new employment sector for young people, who show an increasing desire and energy of reinterpreting the traditions and resources of their territory.\r\nThe project Buds Budding Mobility Plus was born by an active cooperation in the field of agribusiness within South Tuscany, that was also strengthened by the creation of three Professional-Technical Centre in the provinces of Grosseto, Siena, Arezzo.\r\nThe members of the Professional-Technical Centre strongly believe in the importance of young people\u2019s training in transnational contexts, in order to give them more employment opportunities, to facilitate their empowerment, to help them becoming aware and active UE citizens and workers.\r\nThe territories have expressed the will to strengthen the combined school/work, to meet the needs of enterprises understood thanks to the new networks, to promote the full employability of young people and the growth of the working level in agri-food business.

The Emilia-Romagna region and, in particular, the provinces of Reggio Emilia, Parma and Modena have obvious potential in these sectors thanks to the great heritage of traditions and food production excellences and are aware of the great impact in terms of tourism as well as the development of territory. During 2015 has, however, production, productivity and added value have fallen in and this has opened questions that have led to different support actions given the high quality of local food products.\r\nTASTE IT is born from these seeds, grows with the interests shared by Emilia-Romagna Region, which has also set up its own collective QC mark (Controlled Quality), which identifies environment&health friendly products.\r\nThe action of protection and promotion of Emilian culinary excellences is of strategic importance for the involved Provinces, that are committed to promote awareness and diffusion of the local specialties. The beautiful products of Emilian agriculture and typical gastronomy are also strengths of local promotion and tourism for the territory.\r\nThe partnership is completed by schools and vocational centers of the provinces, business associations, global enterprises and with a selection of the most appropriate receiving partners.\r\nTASTE IT project arises from the knowledge of the territory, its products and the concept of promotion. With a strong connotation in marketing, e-communication and e-commerce areas and pragmatic references to operative tools, including ICT and social media, the project proposal aims to develop the best possible performance to be spent on the labor market, raising the employability level of participants.\r\nThe concept of \u201ctypical food product\u201d is here defined and 'transferred' certainly not from a closing or defensive point of view, but as GLOCAL RESPONSE to the increasing search for quality.

In this sense, our project offers a great opportunity to train our students professionally in another country. The aim of this project is to give continuity to the one started in 2011; providing the students with specific mobilities, which encourage their European awareness and having the vocational teaching staff involved in the training process as well.\r\nPrecisely, the project is addressed to vocational training students from IES EL BOHIO( Secondary Education and Vocational Training School ). It aims to accomplish 6 mobilities, 2 for pupils who want to become experts in nursery care, 2 for technicians in Emergency Health Care and 2 for Technicians in Computer Network Systems Management.  In addition, 4 mobilities for vocational teachers are included in the project for having a job shadowing training program in France.\r\nIn order to prepare, settle and start these mobilities, teachers from IT, Health, English, French and Professional Orientation Training departments will work together as a team, counting on the full support and involvement of the management board of the school. \r\nDue to the specific features of our vocational studies, the age range of our pupils varies from 17 to 30 years old, so students under 18 may be part of the program. In addition, they come from middle-lower class families so having the possibility of applying for Erasmus + funds will allow them to have access to opportunities that otherwise they would never have. \r\nThese students will have their internships and work placements, assigned according to their profile; fact which will be certified both by EUROPASS and by workplace training agreements. Furthermore, the EUROPASS certificate will be also granted to the teaching staff.\r\nSo as to guarantee a right implementation of these internships, the tutors from the hosting companies will be fully informed about the capacities, skills and competences that our students will have to achieve during their stays. Their tasks will be clearly stated and specified in training agreements, signed by all the parts involved in the process. Needless to say that the hosting company and the tutors in Spain will have a direct and fluent interaction by means of the internet, using tools such as social network sites ( Facebook,...), Moodle, Etwinning and so on.\r\nThe results and conclusions drawn after the end of the mobilities will be shared by all the members of the teaching community of IES EL BOHIO.  Moreover, it will serve as a reference to other institutions located in our region, Regi\u00f3n de Murcia. The job shadowing training program will also allow the vocational training teachers to have a deeper knowledge of the companies which host our students during their internships. To make the project have a valuable impact, the mobilities will be available and shown in most of the relevant social networking sites and web pages.\r\nThese actions will have a great impact on our students since they will be able to improve not only their foreign language skills but also their professional and team ones. Furthermore, the program intends to make our students be familiar with other working environments and cultures from other countries. These experiences will enable them to adapt and cope with unexpected situations. Obviously, all these facts will enhance their professional qualification, future employability and entrepreneur spirit.\r\nWithin the school, students from lower courses will know the possibility of applying for this type of grants. They will, consequently, be highly motivated to study. It is also important to mention the fact that our school will have an innovative and European projection at local and regional terms.\r\nIn addition, the job shadowing process of the teaching staff, part of the vocational training department will cause a major involvement in their education, and professional qualification. In fact, the job shadowing training in a foreign country and the way internships are organized abroad lead to the international improvement of the teachers\u00b4 methods of management and work.\r\nWe strongly believe that in the long run, all the students taking part in this type of programs will be more competent, creative and self-confident professionals.\r\nAs far as the teachers\u00b4 mobilities are concerned, they will reinforce the ties with the hosting institution (Red Cross Training Institute), achieved with the previous projects. This experience will be also enriching since the students and staff from the French organization will have the opportunity of knowing the Spanish National Health System and the way internships take place in our country. The teachers who will participate in the job shadowing program will be those that teach vocational training education and those that are interested and involved in the European perspective of their teaching.", "http://www.64-bit.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-036562_5"], ["5LN", "FAIR PLAY a rule for life", "STREET FOOTBALL WALES (SFW)", 31548.0, "The increasing pluralisation of our society - demographic change, migration, individualization and globalization, - is posing a major challenge for professional organizations in the social field, both on national and on the international level. Especially in Europe, in a continent that has been undergoing high immigration and population shifts, it is important to create innovative practical concepts that will enable success in the field of social work - with children, young people and adults. In this aspect high importance lies in communication, cooperation and exchange of experience \u2013 for instance a professional exchange between different organizations on the international level.\r\n\r\nThe organizations taking part in the project use sport as an instrument and as a platform to develop social competences (in a basic and uncomplicated manner) and to facilitate participation of young people in the society.\r\nBSJ is the largest youth organization in Brandenburg and also a professional social organization with years of experience in the field of international youth work. As the organizer of this international youth exchange, BSJ would like to develop relay bodies, that will further develop the project concept in their own countries; develop networking of the project organizations; implement and facilitate with partners the commonly designed and established concept of Fair play - focusing  particularly to group-specific intolerant behaviour and hostility.\r\n\r\nThe core of the project is the concept \u2018Street-Football for Tolerance\u2019. It focuses on social competence and conflict management that are implemented through the game itself \u2013 also through sport contact, common rules regulation and fair play.\r\nThe project involves 8 multipliers that have gained experience in development, implementation and follow-up of thematically related projects in their own countries. They will integrate their own experience in their own common project.\r\n\r\nThe focus will be on the following:\r\n\u2022 to exchange experiences in street football and fair play\r\n\u2022 to exercise and reflect on intolerant behaviour and develop sustainable ways of actions \r\n\u2022 to exercise selected training modules, which can be integrated into everyday life\r\n\u2022 to empower young people to organise/carry out their own meetings on street football, lasting from one to several days \r\n\u2022 to offer opportunities for exchanges as well as for sport and cultural activities\r\n\u2022 An important part of the project is active involvement of all project partners and participants. T Interactive exercises, small group work, plenum discussions will be performed in such manner, allowing the topic to be presented in an attractive and practically-oriented way. An independent sport module (Intercultural Sport) will be the centre of the project and will enable participants to change their perspectives. Exclusion and discrimination scenarios will be presented in a practice-oriented manner. The activities and workshops will provide multipliers help and support in developing their own projects.\r\n\r\nThe following results are strived for:\r\n\u2022 to raise awareness of fair play and respect\r\n\u2022 (to collect/to gain information from experience in similar projects form other countries\r\n\u2022 to learn about the concept of \"group-focused enmity\u201d\r\n\u2022 to achieve higher self-confidence when resolving conflicts\r\n\r\nA project with sustainable benefits is planned. The partners will continue to work together and strive for a continuous exchange of experience. The experience and the results of the exchange can also be transferred to other projects using the existing networks. The project is a contribution to a transparent and constructive cooperation of professional organizations in the social field on the European level. The results of the project will influence the project work of the partners greatly.", "http://www.streetfootballwales.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE04-KA105-015008_6"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SA5"}
