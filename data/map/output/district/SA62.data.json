The volunteers will be based on a farm near St. Davids, Pembrokeshire, West Wales and another one in Parkmill on the Gower close to Swansea and they will be engaged in a variety of activities based in COCA and Cae Tan, two community supported agriculture schemes. The project will focus on themes such as cultural awareness healthy lifestyle, organic community supported agriculture and intercultural learning. \r\n\r\nThe individual activities will be long term to allow the volunteers time to really get involved with their organisation and the work that they do, as well as having the opportunity to develop their own personal projects. The projects will allow young people from across Europe to interact, share ideas, exchange cultures and learn about each other in a safe and supportive environment.  The volunteers will be fully integrated into the activities of their hosting organisation and will be given the opportunities to focus on elements that most interest them and to develop new skills, experiences and knowledge that will enhance their employability and personal professional development.\r\n\r\nVolunteers will be involved in activities such as;  community growing, digital media work, Events support/ organisation, leadership opportunities, training support/ attendance, promotions, community development, as well as having the opportunity to bring in their own ideas and work on personal projects where appropriate.\r\n\r\nThis project will promote active citizenship and will help to foster engagement in the local community whilst bringing to light both global and local issues. Volunteers will be encouraged to bring ideas and opinions from their countries of residence to the UK to share with others, to break down international barriers, as well as take new ideas back to input into their society, thereby creating a wider European Community.", "http://www.coca-csa.org", "UNA Exchange", "erasmus_2017-3-UK01-KA105-046439_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SA62"}
