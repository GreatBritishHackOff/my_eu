However existing legal framework and administrative processes (LAPs) \u2013 covering areas such as planning, safety, installation and operation \u2013 only reflect use of incumbent technologies. The limited awareness of FCH technologies in LAPs, the lack of informed national and local administrations and the uncertainty on the legislation applicable to FCH technologies elicit delays and extra-costs, when they do not deter investors or clients.\n\nThis project aims at tackling this major barrier to deployment as follows:\n   \u2022 Systematically identifying and describing the LAPs applicable to FCH technologies in 18 national legal systems as well as in the EU proper legal system.\n   \u2022 Assessing and quantifying LAP impacts in time and/or resource terms and identify those LAP constituting a legal barrier to deployment. \n   \u2022 Comparing the 18 countries to identify best and bad practices\n   \u2022 Raising awareness in the countries where a LAP creates a barrier to deployment. \n   \u2022 Advocating targeted improvements in each of 18 countries \\ EU level\n   \u2022 It will make all this work widely available through: (1) A unique online database allowing easy identification, description and assessment of LAPs by country and FCH application. (2) Policy papers by applications and by country with identification of best practice and recommendations for adapting LAP. (3) A series of national (18) and European (1) workshops with public authorities and investors.\n\nHyLAW sets up a National Association Alliance not just for the duration of the project, but for the long term consolidation of the sector under a single unified umbrella.
