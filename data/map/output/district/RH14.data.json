Today such Imagers almost solely address the visible and near-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Many applications would profit from affordable and reliable Imagers for the terahertz band, notably in surveillance and security.The goal of TeraTOP is to develop a new high performance, low cost, THz Imager for passive imaging systems (0.5-1.5THz) based on CMOS batch manufacturing processes: A unique combination of several leading technologies will enable a real quantum leap in THz Imaging in terms of performance, size and costs. THz photonics components (THz lens, optical window and filters), THz antennas, CMOS-SOI (Silicon on Insulator) and NEMS are the key enabling building blocks that will be developed and combined to achieve such a breakthrough in functionality (passive, room temperature operation), performance (NETD of 0.5K), component size (THz imager on a chip) and significant cost reduction (< 7000 \u20ac).The objective is to bring the disruptive technology from the research lab closer to applications, by developing a passive THz Imager for Concealed Weapons Detection. The cost efficient approach will enable a massive deployment of the TeraTOP Imagers, including crowded places, providing therefore a highly efficient response to terrorists' threats.The consortium includes a mix of scientific and technological excellence (University of Wuppertal, the IIT, CEA-L\u00e9ti), as well as leading industrial research groups (IBM, CSEM) and companies (EADS, QMC). The exploitation activities will be led by the key European industrial partner EADS. This will ensure that the project will target the current security needs and the results will lead to product development and promptly implemented on a wide scale across Europe for the benefit of its citizens.", 69987.0, 2569160.0, "TeraTOP", null, null, null, null, "http://www.terahertz.co.uk", null, "fp7_99793_972420054"], ["9SH", "Kinetic Inductance Detectors \u2013 a New Imaging Technology for Observations In and From Space", "Qmc Instruments Limited", "We propose to develop advanced imaging arrays of kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) for space-based observations at mm-far-infrared (mm-FIR) wavelengths. This development addresses the FP7 topic SPA.2012.2.2-01: Key technologies enabling observations in and from space.\nFuture space science and earth observation missions are limited by the availability of imaging detector array technology for the mm-FIR wavelength range (3 mm to 30 \u03bcm). For the wavelength range 28-45 \u03bcm there is currently no high performance technology with space heritage. For longer wavelengths, 45-2000 \u03bcm there is European expertise in a range of detector technologies, including photoconductors, bolometers, and transition edge superconducting (TES) detectors. However these technologies present significant fabrication difficulties, and lead to a high degree of complexity of system integration and readout electronics for the large format arrays demanded by the next generation of astronomical and Earth observing missions such as FIRI, SPICA, CoRE and Millimetron.\nThe KID is a relatively new and potentially game-changing superconducting detector technology which can provide photon noise limited sensitivity over the entire mm-FIR wavelength range. KIDs are extremely simple both to fabricate and to integrate. Crucially, they can be read out with a high multiplexing ratio which dramatically reduces the complexity of cryogenic interconnections, cabling and electronics enabling larger format arrays than ever before. The reduction in complexity at the cryogenic level in contrast with other ultra-sensitive cryogenic detectors is extremely attractive and enables a dramatic increase in mapping speed for broad band imaging as well as novel applications in spectropolarimetry and hyperspectral imaging.\nThis proposal draws together some of the leading European institutes with experience and expertise in FIR detector technology and includes key members who have made the most significant recent advances in the field", 98822.0, 2090118.0, "SPACEKIDS", "New detector technology for Space", "EU-funded scientists are developing and optimising large imaging arrays of superconducting detectors for satellite applications. These will enable novel mission concepts and a new generation of scientific instruments for astronomy and Earth observation.", "The choice of detector technologies traditionally available in the far-infrared to millimetre wavelength range (30 ?m - 3 mm) has up until now been very limited, and costly and difficult to implement.\n\nFor the shorter wavelengths there is currently no high-performance technology with space heritage. For longer wavelengths, detector arrays are complex and difficult to manufacture and operate.\n\nSatellite-based observations in this wavelength range are very important to astronomers who want to investigate the origins of stars, galaxies, and indeed the Universe. Observations of the Earth from space in this wavelength range will provide climate scientists with crucial data to constrain their predictions of climate change. Additionally, meteorologists will benefit from improved global maps of atmospheric temperature, humidity and precipitation.\n\nThe Kinetic Inductance Detector (KID) is a new superconducting detector technology suitable for detecting electromagnetic radiation at far-infrared to millimetre wavelengths. The EU-funded project 'Kinetic inductance detectors \u2013 a new imaging technology for observations in and from Space' (http://www.spacekids.eu/ (SPACEKIDS)) is focussed on the developments needed for implementing KIDs on new generations of satellite instruments.\n\nA variety of detector materials have been explored to optimise the KID detectors for different specific applications. Tests have shown that aluminium films can achieve the ultimate required sensitivity over the entire far-infrared to millimetre wavelength range. Tests on other materials continue.\n\nA large part of this work was the development of the readout electronics for large arrays of detectors, which have now been demonstrated and work to specification.\n\nA detailed study into the coupling of electromagnetic radiation to different implementations of KID detectors (antenna-coupled and lumped-element) has been carried out, and the issue of cross-coupling in an array has been addressed and solved. KID performance in the presence of a cosmic ray flux, representative of a space environment, is being optimised through modelling and testing.\n\nA number of mission concepts for astronomy and Earth observation have been identified for which KIDs can be a competitive detector choice. These mission scenarios have been analysed, and the detector requirements for each have been derived.\n\nLarge demonstration arrays of detectors are being fabricated and will be tested in dedicated systems to prove the performance required for such future satellite missions.", null, "http://www.terahertz.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/148225.jpg", "fp7_106575_972420054"], ["9SH", "Plasmon Enhanced Terahertz Electron Paramagnetic Resonance", "Thomas Keating Limited", "We propose to establish Plasmon-enhanced Terahertz Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy and scanning microscopy as a unique Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) platform for high-sensitivity local analysis of paramagnetic organic and inorganic species and materials. Here, we will deliver novel hardware and infrastructure providing ground-breaking innovation in the magnetic sensing and imaging. The platform is conceptually based on incorporating THz plasmonic antennas onto surfaces (spectroscopy) and scanning probe tips (microscopy), resulting in a strong, local enhancement (about two orders of magnitude) of the magnetic sensing field. \nExtending to the THz region enables effective utilization of plasmonic structures resulting in a radical improvement of EPR sensitivity (about four orders of magnitude) and spatial resolution going beyond the diffraction limit, and thus introduce a scanning probe microscopic regime into this field. This will make it possible to map the sample over its area and so to localize its properties with unprecedented resolution (below 1 micrometre). Such a significant enhancement of the EPR performance will open new ways in magnetic sensing technologies enabling for instance to study in situ functional centres in a wide variety of materials, and, generally, set a new direction in the development of the EPR-employing industry. \nEPR finds its applications in many scientific areas covering chemistry, biology, medicine, materials science, physics, etc. Hence, introducing this new method would have a profound impact on scientific, technological and societal stakeholders in many research and industrial communities.", 687144.0, 2528630.0, "PETER", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_211923_952016395"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["9SH", "THOMAS KEATING LIMITED*", 687078.0, "Strengthening research in future and emerging technologies (09.04.01.01)", "fts_2017_13680", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "RH14"}
