In addition all feedback from the participants, partners and management team will be collated and used to improve any future mobilities undertaken. \r\n\r\nThe programme will be targeted at benefiting participants who are disadvantaged in the labour market which, by virtue of the competitiveness of professional football, the learners inevitably are.  Often players come from socially deprived areas, have learning difficulties and have limited interest or ability in academic education. Each participant will benefit from improved employability, enhanced career progression and greater job security following the mobility.\r\n\r\nA key objective for participants is that they will benefit from up-skilling and improved employability.  EBFC will track participants' employment history for a period of three years, updated annually, following the mobility in order to establish key data and trends regarding the direct correlation between a successful European mobility and improved employability. In addition, our team\u2019s performance will similarly be measured annually for a period of three years following the mobility. \r\n\r\nThe Project Manager, Jay Lovett, Academy Director, will be key to the evaluation process.  Knowing the candidates personally and being on the mobility, he will be able to provide a balanced judgment in relation to individual benefits and enhanced learning for each participant. \r\n\r\nFollowing the mobility both participants and the partner organisations will be required to produce a final report identifying project outcomes and areas for improvement of future mobilities; critically assessing skills acquisition, language training and cultural integration.  \r\n\r\nAll parties\u2019 contributions will be correlated in an overall report evaluating the merits of the project in relation to the learning objectives and outcomes as well as identifying areas for improvement for subsequent coaching study visits within the EU. This final evaluation report will be publicised on our website and shared with other Conference League clubs.", "http://www.ebfc.co.uk", "Eastbourne Borough Football Club CIC", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-013076_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BN23"}
