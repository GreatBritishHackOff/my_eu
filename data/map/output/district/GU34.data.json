An integral part of the training is an internship in a company in another European country which is supposed to last several weeks. As many trainees as possible will take part in the Erasmus+ project in their second year of training. Some companies already have partners with whom they exchange workers frequently outside Europe and therefore do not participate in this project.\r\n\r\nThe Chamber of Commerce considers an internship lasting several weeks as a prerequisite to achieve the additional qualification \u201cEuropean Business Management\u201c. This experience as an intern in another European country is essential for the course \u201cEuropean Business Administration and Economics\u201d as part of their curriculum.\r\nTheoretical knowledge gained during the first two years of study will be improved by gaining practical working experience.\r\nDifferent consumer types, product and assortment strategies, market communication strategies, service and price strategies (as in unit 4.3 of the curriculum) should be experienced and put to the test during the internship. \r\nOther topics, which will be experienced first-hand and then reassessed after being thoroughly prepared in the lessons, are personnel quality management (curriculum unit 3.3) and the difficulty of acknowledging different training qualifications (curriculum unit 3.6). \r\nThese issues should be dealt with within the topic \u201ccontinued education in companies\u201d. \r\nThe curriculum explicitly asks for an internship in a foreign country for the trainees: \u201cEuropean exchange programmes for young employees\u201d and \u201coptions for an internship abroad\u201d should be shown and discussed according to curriculum unit 3.7. \r\nIn general the trainees should have acquired high intercultural and social skills during their training, which should enable them to deal with European business partners adequately and competently. \r\nThis can be best achieved by doing an internship of considerable length abroad. \r\nOne goal is to enhance their personal experience, language skills and knowledge in their field of business and with respect to the curriculum. Another very important goal is to share the gained experience with the other trainees of this programme. From July to October 2017 the trainees should do their internship in different EU-countries. To gain an even wider picture it is important that as many participants as possible go to different places to gather different insights and share those with their classmates once they are back in school for their final year. The participants have to put down their experiences in a final report and give a presentation about their time abroad, both then get evaluated, discussed, documented and presented in the local press.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-004079_8"]]}}, "outwardCode": "GU34"}
