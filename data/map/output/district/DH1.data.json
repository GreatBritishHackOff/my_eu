The network connects 11 research centres in Europe with 18 associated partners from around the world in a consortium that engages key stakeholders in the most ambitious experiments underway.\n\nConsortium members gathered more than 200 physicists to work together on a flurry of fundamental theories involving new particles and their interactions.

Two types of structure at opposite ends of the cosmological scale, the Milky Way and the large-scale distribution of galaxies at redshifts z<1.5, are ideally suited to this purpose. Studies of the Milky Way will test LCDM predictions for the hierarchical assembly of galaxies and the structure of their dark matter halos. Studies of the galaxy distribution will test LCDM predictions for the growth of structure and the connection between galaxies and dark matter.

The aim is to test the hypothesis that intergenerational influences are important determinants of fertility, from fertility intentions to timing of births to number of children. The theoretical rationale derives from a hypothesis emerging from evolutionary biology that humans are  cooperative breeders : mothers need help from others to raise children, because human children are too costly for mothers to raise alone. The support of relatives, particularly intergenerational support, is thus vital to women in determining how many children they have. If so, there is a major gap in our understanding of fertility, since such influences have not been systematically studied.

Dark energy, on the other hand, is pushing the Universe apart, increasing the rate with which the cosmos expands. Scientists believe that dark energy could make up about 70 % of the Universe while known particles make up just 5 %.\n\nWhat dark matter and dark energy actually has remained a mystery until today, despite many potential explanations suggested for both. Scientists working on the EU-funded 'Understanding the dark universe with 3D weak gravitational lensing' (DARKMATTERDARKENERGY) project have used the most successful technique yet developed to investigate this dark sector: gravitational lensing. \n\nDark matter does not interact with electromagnetic force operating between charged particles and therefore, does not emit or reflect light. However, it seems to play the most important role in shaping the Universe on large scales, interacting with the force of gravity. The curvature of time-space near gravitating mass, including dark matter, deflects passing rays of light, thereby distorting the images of background galaxies.\n\nMeasurements of the distribution of dark matter seen by gravitational lensing in 65 galaxy clusters were compared with the distribution of gas determined from X-ray emission and scattering of photons from the cosmic microwave background. This comparison led to unexpected findings, such as the luminosity-temperature relationship remaining constant for the past 5 million years in the clusters of varying mass.\n\nEven more puzzling were the findings from the analysis of collision between galaxy clusters.

I will achieve this goal using a novel multidisciplinary framework incorporating cutting-edge redox sensitive stable isotope proxies (Mo, Fe and Se isotopes) of iron and sulphur cycling and oxidation state  to unique glaciated regions.  Using a combination of archived samples and focused field campaigns I will study subglacial outflow environments that differ in bedrock geology, regional climate and type of individual glacier drainage basins (e.g. ice cap, ice sheet and alpine glacier) in order to evaluate the importance of these parameters in weathering processes and ultimately the release of bio-available elements from the sub-glacial environment to rivers and oceans. Key questions I am to answer are how is the release of bioavailable elements a function of the redox state of the subglacial environment? Which of the three key parameters plays the most significant role? To what extent is this reflected in the enrichments of elements in solid/liquid phases? and how does this affect biogeochemical cycling downstream and nutrient supply?", 37758.0, 151874.0, "ICE-OTOPE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.dur.ac.uk", null, "h2020_195977_999866010"], ["3LE", "Green Flash, energy efficient high performance computing for real-time science", "University of Durham", "The main goal of Green Flash is to design and build a prototype for a Real-Time Controller (RTC) targeting the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) Adaptive Optics (AO) instrumentation.

The combination of vocational and higher education degrees enables students to proceed to bachelor top-up programmes, for example in International Management, Marketing Management or Health & Well-being. \r\n\r\nWithin the project, a two-year vocational training and a joint vocational and academic education programme with New College Durham are the basis for individual development and different options to obtain further qualifications or find employment. Work placements during and after the vocational qualification programme help students to develop employability skills, search for professional opportunities, but also support the development of academic key competences and  qualify for a bachelor top-up degree. \r\n\r\nAbout 90 vocational education students between 16 and 25 years and 10 teachers benefit from the project through mobility and learning opportunities. Students in programmes that require a university entry qualification aim at a two- or three-semester top-up degree whereas those who left school with o-levels usually look for alternative opportunities and educational concepts that not only qualify for university but also facilitate the entry into the labour market. After a two year foundation degree these students have three options: employment, a higher diploma followed by an international bachelor\u2019s top-up  degree or higher education at a German university. The German system requires between 11 and 12 semesters including the vocational education period whereas the international track in cooperation with foreign university partners takes 8 to 9 semesters in total (depending on individual qualification levels).\r\n\r\nThis concept aims at young people who would like to qualify for university through a vocational education programme and obtain a formal qualification as well. Many school leavers do not have the necessary employability skills to qualify for a vocational training in the German dual system. Though many young people have a university entrance qualification, they do not have the necessary self-confidence and skills to cope with independent and research based learning models. They are afraid not to find a job after a conventional university education that very often does not include any work-based elements. \r\n \r\nMany students at Euro Akademie Oldenburg have a strong and intact multicultural background. They are very interested in foreign languages and would like to use the special interpersonal skills their personal backgrounds give them professionally. This group of young Germans sees a multicultural heritage as an opportunity and has realised that this is an informal qualification many employers and industries look for. They start their careers abroad and usually find good employment in Germany after a period of professional development and orientation. \r\n\r\nThe project therefore\u2026:\r\n\u2022 enhances immediate employment opportunities for graduates of vocational education programmes in Germany \r\n\u2022 creates flexible learning pathways between vocational and higher education\r\n\u2022 uses European key competences as the basis for the establishmen", "http://www.newcollegedurham.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-002170_2"], ["5UJ", "Entrepreneurship: a gateway to a growing education", "DURHAM COUNTY COUNCIL", 232236.0, "The ENGAGED (Entrepreneurship: a gateway to a growing education) project involves the collaboration among IIS Scalcerle, other schools  in the area, Xena  for competence monitoring, City Hall and the Province of Padova, F\u00f2rema from Confindustria.\r\nThe partners are in 9 European countries.With some there is a situation of reciprocity, both in the Mobility and other LLP programs; the foreign network includes business companies, chemistry labs, public administrations, educational institutions, universities, museums, hotels and other partners in the fields of tourism, culture, commerce.\r\nWe aim at consolidating and developing the mobility to keep offering many students the possibility to have temporary work placements abroad (Obj.ve 1 of the strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (ET 2020).\r\nThe work placements abroad will be organized, monitored and evaluated according to ECVET criteria and they will be planned with the aim of acquiring increasing skills that can be acknowledged in several national and international contexts.\r\nThe skills acquired in non-formal contexts can enhance a young person\u2019s professional assets and they will be useful in a labour market that is evolving fast (Europe 2020 on increasing the employment rate).

These are soft skills that are developed also through non-formal and informal learning, which is particularly significant in the context of a work placement experience abroad managed autonomously in many ways by the beneficiaries.  On a European level, this aim cannot be reached without competence in foreign languages and a deeper awareness of European citizenship.The work placement experience is only one step along this process of growth and awareness and it needs coordinated and solid planning and implementation of preparatory activities that invade the sphere of traditional teaching and modify contents and methodology of the students\u2019 curricula.The beneficiaries of the NAIL IT IN EUROPE project are 105 students of IIS Scalcerle and other schools of the province, selected according to shared criteria which are described in the quality procedures of the school. They are trainees at their initial training stage who will get a High School or Technical School Diploma corresponding to level 4 of EQF. They have concluded the 4th year of their educational training (either the Foreign Languages course or the Chemistry, Materials and Biotechnologies technical course). Immigrant students and an elevated percentage of women are involved.

Many projects under the framework of the programmes Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus+ supported this award as \"Europaschule in Niedersachsen\". \r\n\r\nHanover has about 550000 inhabitants and is a multicultural city. About 30% of the population have a migration background and represent about 125 nationalities in total. This demographic development is also reflected in school enrollment numbers. \r\n\r\nAbout 50% of the students at Euro Akademie Hanover have an intact multicultural background and thus are very interested in foreign languages and intercultural communication. They see their multicultural heritage as a chance to be successful on the German labour market, especially in a multicultural city like Hanover. This project supports the preparation of young people for a role in the global labour market and provides them with the necessary skills and competences to work in an international, multilingual and multicultural environment.\r\n\r\nAt Euro Akademie Hanover, a two- to three-year vocational programme is the basis for individual development and different options to obtain further qualifications or find employment. International placement opportunities help the students to develop employability skills, search for professional opportunities, and support the development of academic key competences and qualify for a bachelor top-up degree. The combination of vocational and higher education degrees enables students to proceed to bachelor top-up programmes. This project helps to maintain existing academic partnerships and develop new academic pathways for students.\r\n\r\nQualifications and job requirements have changed significantly as globalisation makes high demands on the labour market and require the mobility of labour. At the same time the idea of a European Union is threatened. This development challenges the way vocational education is structured and organized. Young people need expert knowledge and interdisciplinary skills, proficiency in foreign languages and profound intercultural skills. \r\n\r\nSome of the qualities and attitudes that graduates of the 21st century should possess include the ability to deal with uncertainty and change, flexibility and mobility. International placement opportunities enhance the students' knowledge of skills and competences that are expected by employers. \r\n\r\n The staff mobilitities within this project aim at the development of e-learning initiatives that prepare students for their international placement opportunities and help them to organize their activities. About half of the teachers at Euro Akademie Hanover have a multicultural background. This has proved to be an asset in an international classroom where language and cultural differences are both, added value and a constant challenge. \r\n\r\nIn a time when the idea of Europa is threatened from several sides, education plays a crucial role in supporting and securing past achievements and preparing the way for future development.
