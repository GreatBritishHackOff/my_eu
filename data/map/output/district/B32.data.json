The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other in order to develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and this job shadowing project is part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe consortium consists of the Childcare and education department and five schools: Lagersbergsskolan, H\u00e5llsta skola, Fristadsskolan, Skogstorpsskolan and Djurg\u00e5rdsskolan.  During the years 2017 \u2013 2019 we are planning to send a total of 22 staff members from these schools on job shadowing activities in Birmingham (head teachers, deputy head teachers, leaders of learning, teachers of Swedish as a second language and also special pedagogy teachers).   They will spend a week at one of our partner schools within the BCPP where they will have the opportunity to learn and get valuable experience that will be used in the quality development of their own schools.  \r\n\r\nIn this project the consortium has three objectives:\r\n\u2022 We want to gain knowledge and experience that will lead to a positive development of our schools with the aim to improve the quality of teaching and improve the pupils\u2019 results.   Besides looking at teaching methods, we would like to see how the staff and the teaching are organized in order to make the most optimal use of the resources and also how different schools work with collegial learning.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Through the job shadowing activities we want to gain knowledge and experience which leads to a development of methods in order to take care of and educate pupils who have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  We want to develop their knowledge of Swedish and to maximize their learning and results in the multicultural classroom.  Eskilstuna is a multicultural city where 31% of the pupils have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 We want to improve the quality and results within special pedagogy by educating the staff in finding and developing different teaching methods and tools in the teaching of special needs pupils.  We especially want to focus on methods and tools involving ICT.\r\n\r\nAfter the job shadowing activities the school development will progress at the individual schools, based on the needs of the school, what experience and knowledge that the staff has gained and also based on the reflections of what already works well.  Collegial learning will be a different factor in this work.\r\nThe development will also be driven forward by the Development unit at the Childcare and Education department.  Here there are networks for head teachers, deputy head teachers and leaders of learning where discussions and dissemination activities will take place, in order to share the experiences that have been made during the job shadowing activities with colleagues who are not in the project.  This way, the job shadowing activities can lead to positive development at other schools as well.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the knowledge and experience which we gain from the job shadowing activities will contribute to an improved quality of teaching and better results in general, but also more specifically within the teaching of Swedish as a second language in the multicultural classroom and within special pedagogics.   We hope that this project will help give the pupils a good foundation to stand on so that they can succeed in their future education and working life.", "http://www.bcpp.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA101-034303_4"], ["3NT", "The exchange and development of transnational innovative and effective practice in schools through job shadowing", "Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership", 39573.0, "The exchange project (coordinated by BCPP in the United Kingdom and Eskilstuna Kommun in Sweden) is designed to facilitate and enable schools in different countries but faced with similar challenges, to compare and exchange ideas, values and practices that will support school improvement and improving pupil outcomes for children and staff within the European Union.\r\n\r\nThe project will allow senior leaders and current classroom practitioners in different European countries to learn from each other through a focus on, comparison of and sharing of approaches to school management, curriculum delivery and cultural pedagogy across transnational boundaries. \r\n\r\nThe headteacher job shadowing opportunity will focus on demonstrable processes that have supported the development of effective school settings resulting in improved pupil outcomes. This will provide impetus for school improvement for all levels of senior management within schools. It will encompass aspiring, newly appointed and established Headteachers. IT coordinators and leaders of learning job shadowing opportunities will enable practitioners to focus on ways and means of evaluating the most effective ways of promoting improved educational outcomes particularly for the educationally and socially disadvantaged. The review will focus on effective educational practice and provision as well as cultural outreach to parents and hard to reach groups as well as the in-school values and priority given. Safeguarding practitioners will be able to compare and contrast the pedagogical and social welfare approaches that define two different educational and cultural systems and how the fusion of best practice from both, within different cultural settings can improve the life chances of the children in the communities they serve.\r\n\r\nThe project will involve: \r\nseven aspiring head teacher job shadowing exchanges over the period of the project\r\nfour newly appointed head teacher job shadowing exchanges over the period of the project\r\ntwo head teacher job shadowing exchanges over the period of the project\r\ntwelve \"Leaders of Learning\" job shadowing exchanges over the period of the project\r\nthree IT coordinator teacher job shadowing exchanges over the period of the project\r\none Safeguarding/child protection job shadowing exchanges over the period of the project\r\n\r\nAs a result of schools establishing an international link and embedding practice learned to aid school improvement, it will enhance \r\n* the exchange of information and practice digitally (through websites twitter, blogs etc) \r\n* the exchange of views and practice digitally [staff and children] through skype and video conferencing etc. spreading the relationship as wide as possible\r\n* increase cultural awareness, understanding and tolerance\r\n\r\nIn the longer term the impact of the project will be seen in many ways. \r\nIt will be seen in the quality and effectiveness of institutions as they adapt and evolve to meet the needs of a world that requires a global economic workforce. \r\nIt will be seen in institutions that are prepared to look to the world rather than the locality for best or innovative practice that it can share, evaluate or adapt to improve outcomes for children. \r\nIt will be seen in communities with a wider cultural understanding of the world resulting in tolerance, harmony and social justice underpinning interaction within and between communities\r\nIt will be seen in an enthused and motivated workforce committed to ideals that will move the world forward for all\r\nIt will be seen as a start in the drive to reduce the gap for those in our communities perceived as economically or educationally disadvantaged with their neighbour.", "http://www.bcpp.org.uk", "Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035513_coordinator"], ["3NT", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "NEWMAN UNIVERSITY", 50749.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.newman.ac.uk", "NEWMAN UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035516_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B32"}
