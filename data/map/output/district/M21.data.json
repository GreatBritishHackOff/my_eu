Other cities across Europe are investigating their options for municipal energy and are looking to learn.\n\nmPOWER will map existing municipal energy policy and identify innovations, best practice, as well as obstacles and barriers. The action will enable participant authorities across Europe to (a) learn from replicable best practices, (b) recognise risks, obstacles and blockages, (c) identify and commit to replication pathways that best suit local needs, (d) incubate at least 30 new and improved municipal energy policies and projects within the project duration. Lessons learnt will be disseminated publicly and through target networks in easily accessible format for replication.\n\n30 cities and city networks from 14 Member States have already expressed interest in participating.\n\nAn estimated 3.9GWh/year can be saved and 40.8GWh/year renewable capacity installed through replicating practices between participant cities within the action (respectively 9.8GWh/year and 108.8 GWh/year within three years of project end). This can be scaled up around Europe through wider replication, promoted by Energy Cities and partners beyond the project\u2019s lifetime.\n\nmPOWER\u2019s project consortium brings access to an active network of cities committed to energy transition (Energy Cities, IPE), experience in energy policy (Platform, Energy Cities, IPE) and energy innovation (Carbon Coop), public services experts (UGLA, Basque University, TNI), and years of innovative peer-learning projects (Platform, TNI, IPE).", 259634.0, 1741253.0, "mPOWER", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_213584_939967831"], ["8UP", "New Cost Efficient Business Models for Flexible Smart Grids", "The Society for the Reduction of Carbon Limited", "NOBEL GRID will develop, deploy and evaluate advanced tools and ICT services for energy DSOs cooperatives and medium-size retailers, enabling active consumers involvement \u2013i.e. new demand response schemas \u2013 and flexibility of the market \u2013 i.e. new business models for aggregators and ESCOs.\n\nThrough the dual-use of telecommunication networks, and validating the integration of renewable generation presence and demand response systems, NOBEL GRID will offer advanced services to all actors in the retail markets of the electricity system in order to ensure that all consumers will benefit from cheaper prices, more secure and stable grids and low carbon electricity supply. \n\nThe project results will be demonstrated and validated in real world environments with active involvement of all the actors, and based on the new business models defined during the project.", 489939.0, 11290805.0, "NOBEL GRID", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_194422_939967831"]]}}, "outwardCode": "M21"}
