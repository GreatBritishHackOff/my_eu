This project builds upon previous  projects which comprised 11 visits by 60 VET Lecturers to Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Czech Republic, Finland and Sweden, Lithuania, Cyprus, Portugal and Finland. The lecturers and managers representing 11 ACER colleges were drawn from specialisms including Construction, Motor Vehicle, Electronics, Agriculture, ICT, and Business Studies, Health and Social Care, Hospitality and Catering, Travel and Tourism and Leisure and Sport. The participants also explored to what extent the host country has matched its National Qualification Framework against the EQF and implemented the ECVET system. Resulting from these visits, networks, partnerships and two-way exchanges of staff and learners have already been established. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mobilities project will contribute to both individual continuous professional development (CPD) plans as well as continuing to develop long term strategic partnerships between Est of England Colleges and EU VET providers. Individuals will have the opportunity to widen their knowledge and expertise, including experience of different teaching and learning methodologies, innovations in technology and learning and diverse cultures to help to adapt training courses to meet employers changing skills needs.  All participants will engage in learning the basic language of the host country. Participants are concentrating on the organisation of and preparation for Apprenticeships and Entrepreneurship and Learner guidance and support during the visits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will specifically focus on arranging mobilities for 60  East of England college staff- providing them with the opportunity to explore the organisation and management of:\r\n\r\napprenticeship schemes, \r\n\r\ninnovative mathematics teaching, \r\n\r\nuse of skills competitions\r\n\r\nworking with young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the host countries. Within this we will look to learn more about how the host utilise the supportive involvement of employers and business support agencies. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the short term we envisage that participating managers and practitioners will learn new ways of delivering vocational training which address the above priorities, as well as sharing their own experiences with the EU VET counterparts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the longer term we envisage that participating colleges will come to see this activity as an essential component of their staff's professional development programme (as has already begun to be the case with some of our colleges). More strategic/longer term  impacts will be as colleges continue and develop the visits and relationships to form longer term strategic partnerships with their European hosts through which further collaborative working/projects can be developed. This is something we have seen already evolve from previous ACER managed mobilities projects which have resulted in colleges developing their own partnership projects with hosts from previous visits.", "http://www.oaklands.ac.uk", "Association of Colleges in the Eastern Region", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000523_5"], ["9NX", "DEIMPS", "Alban Academies Trust", 18273.0, "Sandringham School has been an innovator in the use of mobile technologies to enhance learning. Mobile devices have been used in school since 2011 and each child has had a one-to-one device since 2014. We are now seeking to forge partnerships across the EU to evaluate the most effective pedagogies and tools that can be used to enhance student learning across a range of subjects. \r\n\r\nBy participating in job shadowing and training course offered by the \"Designing and Evaluating Innovative Mobile Pedagogies' (DEIMP) project\", we hope to realise our school's  project goals of:\r\n\" enhancing participants' understanding of how mobile technologies can promote transformative and inclusive pedagogies\r\n\" increasing participants' abilities to design and evaluate innovative and inclusive mobile pedagogies\r\n\" linking teacher educators and teachers together to develop and research mobile pedagogies\r\n\" promoting a transnational network to validate and disseminate national examples of innovative pedagogies beyond the life of the project\r\n\" supporting decision and policy-makers in adopting, promoting and investing in more innovative mobile pedagogical approaches.\r\n\r\nOur overriding goal is to make our use of digital technology as effective as possible in our own school, maximising student outcomes and developing students' abilities to be citizens in a globally connected world. Our commitment is also to support other schools, regionally and nationally to make best use of mobile technologies. As a national Research School and a local Teaching School, we are able to disseminate the results of this research work on a local and national level. There is strong interest in 'what works' when it comes to educational technology - forging international partnerships will allow us to share our experience and also benefit from the experiences of others from different cultures.\r\n\r\nOur International Schools status will be further enhanced by job shadowing and language training courses. These mobilities will complement our exchange programmes in France, Spain and Germany and allow teachers to develop further skills in both language and pedagogy, for the benefit of our students and those within our network.", "http://www.sandringham.herts.sch.uk", "Alban Academies Trust", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047024_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "AL4"}
