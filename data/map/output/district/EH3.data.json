This fact, together with the loss of natural habitat, may weaken the ability of species to respond to change through migration, adaptation and acclimation.\n\nMoreover, individuals, populations and species do not exist in isolation. Therefore, one of the main challenges in biodiversity studies is to explain how interactions among species might affect a response to a changing climate. This question was addressed by the EU-funded EPACS (Ecological process and climate change) project, which used interactions between lichens as a study system.\n\nLichens are a symbiotic association between a fungus, which builds the lichen structure, and algae or cyanobacteria (called a photobiont). The photobiont produces food in the form of carbohydrate through photosynthesis.\n\nThe EPACS study focused on lichen epiphytes, which are found growing on trees in Europe's oceanic temperate rainforests. Scientists investigated several hypothesised interactions involving lichen-fungus and the photobiont, which are relevant to climate change impacts on biodiversity.\n\nResearchers successfully developed and tested microsatellite biomarkers for two closely related lichens with similar environmental requirements but different forms of reproduction. The results support the hypothesis that the species that reproduced sexually (Nephroma laevigatum) had greater genetic diversity than the species that reproduced asexually (N.\u00a0parile).\n\nAn additional hypothesis was that lichen-fungus combine with photobiont types that optimise ecological fitness in a local environment through a process known as selectivity. This is a potential route for acclimation among lichens. A gene region that is variable among different strains of the photobiont (Nostoc) was tested to determine whether Nephroma species show selectivity in different conditions and habitats.\n\nEPACS also showed that spore-dispersed lichen-fungus (N.\u00a0laevigatum) depend on the prior colonisation of habitat by an asexual species, which 'seed' the photobiont into the habitat. The ecologically similar but asexually dispersed lichen-fungus N.\u00a0parile showed no such dependency. This contrasted with the traditionally held assumption that spore-dispersed lichen-fungi can migrate more easily in the face of climate change.\n\nProject results demonstrated how species interactions can alter expectations under climate change at two levels. These are the interaction of fungus and photobiont to create a lichen and the interaction among lichens in an epiphyte community.

Transition processes are highly dependent on the innovative potential of community-based initiatives and their articulation with appropriate institutional architecture. Community-based initiatives are  potentially more adaptable and less constrained by current structural circumstances than top-down policies and can give impetus to large-scale and technology driven changes.  TESS will provide an understanding on the upscaling possibilities of such high-potential community-based initiatives by addressing two main questions: What is the impact of community-based initiatives in terms of carbon reduction potential and economic effect? What institutional structures (values, policies and mechanisms) support these initiatives in persisting beyond the initial phase and moving into an acceleration phase, spreading desired impacts? Answers will be provided through (1) a novel measuring, reporting and verification (MRV) framework for benchmarking community-based initiatives. This will enable quantifiable, comparable and standardised evaluation, and (2) the identification of success factors for the emergence, persistence and diffusion of promising initiatives, including online initiatives. We will identify these initiatives through case studies across regions and sectors and produce a systemic understanding of their impact on societal transitions towards sustainability. Our research will be integrated and transdisciplinary, with the unique opportunity to bring together social and natural scientists to foster a transition towards European societal sustainability.

ADEPT will develop a tool that will guide software developers and help them to model and predict the power consumption and performance of parallel software and hardware.<br/>The strength of the HPC world lies primarily in software application parallelisation: concurrent computation is used to speed-up the overall time an application requires run to completion. As a result, HPC software developers are also experts in parallel performance analysis and performance optimisation. The Embedded systems sector on the other hand excels in its management of energy usage because they are often constrained by fixed power and energy budgets. The strengths of one sector are the relative weakness of the other: power management and power efficiency in HPC are in their infancy, but they are becoming increasingly important with HPC systems requiring more and more power; and while continuing to be constrained by energy and power budgets, recent advances in low-power multi-core processors have widened the choice of hardware architectures for Embedded systems and are increasingly forcing Embedded programmers to use parallel computing techniques that are more familiar to HPC programmers.<br/>ADEPT will investigate the implications of parallelism in programming models and algorithms, as well as choice of hardware, on energy and power consumption.

The aim is to enable a patient\u2019s nervous system to communicate with new devices that replace or supplement a malfunctioning organ, for example to restore hearing or eyesight or to treat degenerative diseases like Parkinson\u2019s.   Human functional enhancement technology refers to a wide range of converging technologies which have the potential to enable significant modification of the systems of the human body, beyond what might be seen as medical purposes. The subjects of the ETHENTECH project address some of the most far-reaching fields among new and emerging technologies today - in terms of their potential social impact and the challenges these will pose to ethical issues and values of European citizens and societies. The project\u2019s two fields of implant and human enhancement technologies both lack ethical frameworks and European and international guidelines. This absence reflects the emerging and complex nature of both areas. They also represent cases where issues of dual use are a significant and further complicating factor.
