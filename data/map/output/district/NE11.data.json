Nevertheless, at least 20% of patients are not cured by current therapies and a significant number experience debilitating toxicities. Given the high cure rates and potential life-span of survivors of childhood cancer, it is particularly important to minimize the impact of potential chronic toxicities. For several of the most widely-used drugs, little is known about their pharmacokinetics and metabolism in children, particularly very young children (&lt;3 years). There are many examples where such knowledge has been used to optimize the use of chemotherapeutic drugs, both to avoid toxicity and to maximize the therapeutic effect. The need for further research to investigate these drugs in children is acknowledged in the Priority List for Studies into Paediatric Medicinal Products, issued by the EMEA. Doxorubicin is on this list and is one of the most important drugs used in the treatment of childhood cancers. Several national groups have been successful in studying the pharmacology of drugs used in paediatric oncology. However, in order to recruit sufficient patient numbers for meaningful studies it is necessary to establish a wider group, bringing together the successful elements of established national organizations. The EPOC group combines leading pharmacologists, paediatric oncologists, regulatory organizations and a management structure which will successfully deliver data of appropriate quality on which to base future clinical use of this drug and to meet the demands of the EMEA priority list. Such data will form the basis of future applications for Paediatric Usage Marketing Authorization for doxorubicin. The overall aim of the consortium is to provide data that will guide the optimal use of this drug in the clinic, and also meet the regulatory requirements of the EMA.", 72112.0, 2205825.0, "EPOC", "Determining the right dose for child cancer patients", "Although chemotherapy is very successful in the treatment of childhood cancers, 20\u00a0% of patients are not cured and those who are often suffer toxic effects.

However, a wider, larger group of child patients is needed to really get enough information.\n\nAn EU-funded project, ?European paediatric oncology off-patent medicines consortium? (EPOC), is addressing the issue with the help of leading pharmacologists, paediatric oncologists and regulatory organisations.\n\nDoctors usually determine dosage based on studies done in adult patients. They lower the dose for safety, but often toxic effects will persist or the dose will be too low to destroy the tumour. In other words, a narrow window of effective therapy exists, which must be determined by characterising how the drug is absorbed and metabolised in children. This is known as the pharmacokinetics of the drug.\n\nBy taking various child age groups into account, the research is set to greatly improve the treatment of paediatric cancer.", null, "http://www.powertrial.com", "/docs/results/images/2013-02/53984.jpg", "fp7_89715_997698254"], ["0NG", "EUropean software defined radio for WireLEss in joint secuRity operations", "Prismtech Limited", "The EULER project proposal gathers major players in Europe in the field of wireless systems communication integration and software defined radio (SDR), is supported by a strong group of end-users, and aims to define and actually demonstrate how the benefits of SDR can be leveraged in order to drastically enhance interoperability and fast deployment in case of crisis needed to be jointly resolved.

This project is based on the integration of (a) test traces exploitation (generated by test execution in the software integration phase induced by the industrial development process, to validate the requirements of the system) along with (b) platform models and (c) design space exploration techniques. The expected result of the project is to enable functional and performance analysis and platform optimisation at early stage of the design development. The approach of PRESTO is to model the software/hardware allocation, by the use of a modelling framework based on the UML profile for model-driven development of Real Time and Embedded Systems (MARTE). The analysis tools, among them timing analysis including Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis, scheduling analysis and possibly more abstract system-level timing analysis techniques will receive as inputs on the one hand information from the MARTE performance modelling of the HW/SW-platform, and on the other hand behavioural information of the software design from tests results of the integration test execution. Of particular novelty in PRESTO is the exploitation of traces for the exclusion of over-pessimistic assumptions during timing analysis: instead of taking all possible inputs and states into account for a worst-case analysis, a set of relevant traces is analyzed separately to reduce the set of possible inputs and states for each trace.\n\nA particular attention will be given to industrial development constraints, which means 1) as little cost as possible in term of extra specification time and need of expertise, 2) a simple use of the tools, 3) a smooth integration in the current design process, 4) a tool framework flexible enough to be adapted to different process methodologies, design languages and integration test frameworks, 5) analysis results\n\n\nDoW (TA) Approved by the ARTEMIS JU on 26/05/2014", 48937.0, 6525207.0, "PRESTO", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_103426_999437367"], ["0QD", "Electric LOsses Balancing through  integrated  STorage and power Electronics towards increased synergy between Railways and electricity distribution networks", "Turbo Power Systems Ltd", "European distribution networks and light-railway networks present common issues: both have been developed as independent networks, relying on the resilience and robustness of existing power supplies. However, RES progressive penetration introduced an increasing degree of uncertainty on the direction of power flows. Both networks are looking at integrated solutions targeting: i) reduction of electricity losses ii) increase the grid stability in a high local RES penetration scenario iii) accommodate the needs of new energy actors such as EVs, electrical storages and prosumers. Electrified transport networks such as light railways could act to enhance distribution grid stability providing ancillary services inter-exchanging electricity. However such potential is still unexploited. E-LOBSTER intends to capture such potential through the development of an innovative, economically viable and easily replicable electric Transport-Grid Inter-Connection System that will be able to establish synergies between power distribution networks, electrified transport networks (metro, trams, light railways etc.) and charging stations for EVs. The proposed solution encompasses the integration of high power flow Electric Storage with smart Soft Open Points providing flexible control. The system will be managed by an integrated Railway \\ Grid Management System which starting from the real time analysis of energy losses will be able to optimize the interexchange of electricity between the networks maximizing local RES self-consumption. The hardware and software control platform will be demonstrated at TRL 6 in one substation owned by Metro de Madrid.
