Within this context READY4SmartCities cover a unique role thanks to its specific mission of bringing together relevant stakeholders including engineering specialists, ICT software and equipment providers, RES providers, energy companies (including ESCOs \u2013 Energy Service Companies), construction sector companies, as well as local and regional authorities. In co-operation with these stakeholders, the aim is to deliver:\u0095\\tA new energy data ecosystem that will accommodate cross-domain data (climatic, occupation, pollution, traffic, activity, etc.) and will allow the exploitation of such data at global scale; by identifying the set of ontologies relevant to energy-efficiency in Smart Cities and the different requirements and guidelines on how to use (publish and interchange) data described according to those ontologies.\u0095\\tAn holistic and shared vision, allowing feasible step-by-step action plans for city authorities and other relevant stakeholder groups to develop and use ICT-based solutions for energy system in urban and rural communities towards future Smart Cities, and thus, leading to reduced energy consumption and CO2 emissions.", 65050.0, 1068150.0, "READY4SmartCities", null, null, null, null, "http://www.aec3.com", null, "fp7_110042_996417757"], ["6HP", "Semantics-driven Design through Geo and Building Information Modelling for Energy-efficient Buildings Integrated in Mixed-use Healthcare Districts", "Aec3 Ltd", "STREAMER is an industry-driven collaborative research project on Energy-efficient Buildings (EeB) with cases of mixed-use healthcare districts. Such districts are the best real examples of neighbourhood with integrated energy system consisting of mixed building types (i.e. hospitals and clinics; offices and retails; laboratories and educational buildings; temporary care homes, rehabilitation and sport facilities). The energy use of 1 healthcare district could exceed that of 20,000 dwellings. In almost every European city there is at least one healthcare district making a huge impact on the whole city\u2019s energy performance.\nSTREAMER aims at 50% reduction of the energy use and carbon emission of new and retrofitted buildings in healthcare districts. Healthcare-related buildings are among the top EU priorities since they play a key role for a sustainable community, but their energy use and carbon emission are among the highest of all building types. Take for instance a typical hospital building that is part of the healthcare district. It uses 2.5 times more energy than an office. In the EU, there are some 15,000 hospitals producing 250 million tonnes of carbon per annum.\nThe EeB design complexity is extremely high; and therefore, both holistic and systemic approaches are crucial. STREAMER will resolve this by optimising Semantics-driven Design methodologies with interoperable tools for Geo and Building Information Modelling (Semantic BIM and GIS) to validate the energy performance during the design stage. STREAMER will enable designers, contractors, clients and end-users to integrate EeB innovations for: 1) building envelope and space layout; 2) medical, MEP and HVAC systems; and 3) building and neighbourhood energy grids.\nSTREAMER results will be validated in the 4 real projects involving the Implementers Communities.

The objective is to close the gaps between existing intelligent building/facilities data so that complex lifecycle simulation can easily be done in all design, refurbishment and retrofitting phases where the largest energy saving potentials exist. This will be achieved by (1) extending existing BIM, energy simulation and cost calculation tools, so that they can seamlessly exchange the required data, (2) integrating advanced energy simulation tools into the design and FM process, so that BIM-CAD and FM tools can be used as building energy simulator and gap identifier, (3) developing new applications that can visualize building performance in easy to understand way and can quickly display impacts of changed building/space parameters, (4) developing new 'Cockpit functionality' in BIM-CAD on EPBD basis to provide fast feedback of the impact of design parameters on lifecycle energy performance, (5) extending BIM-CAD to model and manage buildings and surrounding areas, and (6) ex\u00actending BIM-CAD by web services to act as Integrated Virtual Energy Laboratory (IVEL) enabling the study of design and retrofitting alternatives concerning energy performance and total costs. An innovative SOA around the kernel functionality of BIM-based CAD/FM will be applied.

Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a concept which has arisen to address the management and interoperability of the data exchanged between different computer aided tools employed at different stages the BLC, including design, construction, commissioning, operation, refurbishment and demolition. BIM therefore plays a key role in all aspects of energy management across the BLC. The W3C Data Activity makes use of Linked Data, which is a structured form of data storage, distributed across the web, and which is supported by tools to easily query that data. By integrating BIM into the wider web of data, building information can be queried alongside all other Linked Open Data (LOD) sources, which include data on materials and systems (e.g. sensor and state of building devices data) which make up the building, profiles of occupants, and information about weather patterns and regional and global energy prices. Together this information can make for more meaningful analysis of energy consumption and its relation to the localised costs of materials, systems and personnel in existing and future buildings. Therefore, by using BIM and LOD technologies EeB projects will be better able to exploit their results beyond their own particular stage in the BLC and as a result benefit from greater overall impact. The \u2018SWIMing\u2019 project will bring together existing EeB projects under clusters categorised by which stages of the BLC the project is applied and energy savings are achieved and the particular domains within those stages to facilitate knowledge sharing and increase the impact of project results.
