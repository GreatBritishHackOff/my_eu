At Bishopbriggs Academy we believe that investing in language learning is a key method of providing our young people with the necessary skills for the best possible future. The EU promotes the introduction of language learning at an early age and this is reflected in the Scottish Government's 1+2 policy, which we anticipate will create an increased number of language learners coming to secondary school. \r\n\r\nWe aim to equip staff with the skills to offer a wider range of languages for pupils to study, meaning that pupils can both continue to build on the language skills learned in primary school or choose to learn a new language. This will allow them the element of personalisation and choice in their learning and will allow them to use their transferable skills, developing a more in-depth understanding of their native language and modern foreign languages. Participation in this project will allow us to develop the school's international element and demonstrate that the ability to speak more than one language is something to which pupils should aspire. The structured language learning course we have identified will provide us with new ideas, access to authentic, up-to-date classroom resources and opportunities to share successful teaching methods with colleagues, both in the primary and secondary sector.\r\n\r\nWe have already begun to introduce Spanish to the curriculum as an L3 option. Laura has completed one and a half years of the CCEd Spanish course at Strathclyde University and this has allowed her to contribute to the introduction of Spanish for Life and Work Purposes as well as the S3 elective course. Laura's participation in the LFEE 3-week immersion course is crucial to her becoming GTCS registered in Spanish and being able to teach Spanish at all levels, including SQA certificate courses, meeting pupil demand for the subject. It will also help improve her fluency, cultural awareness and she will gain knowledge and understanding of new and innovative teaching methods. She will also be able to access authentic teaching resources and materials and forge partnerships with European colleagues. Laura will also be able to liaise with primary colleagues who wish to introduce Spanish as their L3.", "http://www.bishopbriggs.e-dunbarton.sch.uk", "Bishopbriggs Academy", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035490_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "G64"}
