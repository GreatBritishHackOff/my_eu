The  detection of intracellular DNA as PAMP has emerged a key event in the innate immune response to DNA viruses, retroviruses and intracellular bacteria. In some circumstances the body\u2019s own DNA can also be also detected as a danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), e.g. when DNA from dying cells is not cleared effectively, and this can play a role in the development of autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus.\nOne of the responses to foreign DNA is the secretion of interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which then help to establish an antiviral state in the infected cell and its neighbours, and alert more specialised immune cells to the danger. Several proteins have been proposed to act as interferon-inducing DNA receptors, including most recently the enzyme cyclic GMP-AMP synthase, which provides a particularly elegant signalling pathway through production of cyclic GMP-AMP as second messenger. However, it is no yet know whether other receptor proteins also utilise this signalling pathway, how signalling is regulated, and how foreign DNA is distinguished from the cell's own genome.\nThe objectives of this project are:\n1.) To test the involvement of DNA receptors in the recognition of DNA as 'stranger' and 'danger' signal in human cells\n2.) To examine the interplay between DNA receptor candidates\n3.)

The approach used was based on integrated water irrigation management. This method considered improved water-use efficiency at farm, irrigation district and watershed scales.\n\nProject partners assessed different irrigation scheduling techniques and environmental sensing tools on open crops and greenhouse tomatoes. As a result, several deficit irrigation (DI) strategies were shown to increase crop water productivity by 20-50\u00a0%, with no significant effect on the quality or quantity of the produce.\n\nThe DI strategies focused on irrigation during drought-sensitive times with minimal or no irrigation when rainfall was adequate. This approach resulted in saving 5-30\u00a0% of the irrigation water that would have normally been consumed. Furthermore, the covering of water reservoirs was a simple and effective measure that reduced the loss of water by 80\u00a0%, with the additional benefit of limiting algal growth.\n\nA key factor to SIRRIMED's success was the outstanding collaboration with local growers and other stakeholders. This included holding meetings in order to identify and prioritise problems and goals at the farm and district levels.\n\nCooperation also resulted in the acquisition of critical field data, which was needed for the calibration and validation of tools for the district information system (DIS). The DIS combined field data with remote satellite images, which were used to simulate the distribution and allocation of water resources. This enabled effective daily scheduling and strategic long-term planning.\n\nA better understanding of the impact of different irrigation strategies on soils and crops will allow improving the current level of productivity in line with sustainable practices. Therefore, improving irrigation technology will enable European farmers to become more competitive as one of the direct consequences will be an increase in net revenues.\n\nAnother benefit is that new irrigation management practices will make the farming system more flexible and adapted to European regulations and to socioeconomic changes. In addition, Mediterranean Partner Countries will profit from the technological innovations.\n\nSIRRIMED represents a significant joint effort between scientists and farmers and other stakeholders to reduce irrigation water consumption.

A set of five islands creates a diverse OpenFlow infrastructure that allows experimentation on multi-layer and multi-technology networks provided by the different islands. The facility will extend all the way from standard Ethernet to optical and wireless transmission and it will also include an emulation wall for scalability tests comprising thousands of nodes.The facility will grow in three phases to, on the one hand provide an early access to the facility (after 6 months already) and, on the other hand to evolve during the project lifetime, incorporating the feedback of the user community and extending its reach to other test facilities. Two open calls will be published to invite experimenters that bring their use cases and scenarios to the facility creating a feedback loop to extend the OFELIA facility according to the needs of the user community.", 80276.0, 5218416.0, "OFELIA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.lancaster.ac.uk", null, "fp7_95927_999840984"], ["4YW", "GRaphenE for NAnoscaleD Applications", "Lancaster University", "The semiconductor industry has been able to improve the performance of electronic system by making ever-smaller devices.

In AD brain, A\u03b2 is released in a soluble form that progressively becomes insoluble forming aggregates; extracellular plaques mainly composed of A\u03b2 are a hallmark of post-mortem brains. These premises strongly suggest brain A\u03b2 as a possible target for therapy and diagnosis of AD.

Accordingly, it has been reported that removal of blood A\u03b2 may withdraw the excess of brain A\u03b2 by a \u201csink\u201d effect. Thus, blood A\u03b2 is another potential target. The aim of this project is to utilize nanoparticles (NPs) specifically engineered for targeting brain A\u03b2, for the combined diagnosis and therapy (theranostics) of AD.

In a product line, the production of a variety of products is simplified by capturing the common properties of the products in reusable building blocks. Specific products are realized by extending the functionality of the blocks using sophisticated variation mechanisms. While product lines offer an effective approach to handle product families, their design is a very complex activity, which requires a considerable amount of information. Accurate information on the variance in products is required for the product line to be effective.

PATS follows an approach known as Constructive Technology Assessment (CTA). One central attempt of it is to broaden the design process of new technologies through dialogue between innovators and the public so that developments meet social needs and mismatches, wrong investments, and possible social conflicts can be minimized. The aim of PATS is to increase privacy awareness across various sectors, from firms to government agencies focussing especially on the development and use of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) and biometrics. On the basis of a socio-technical mapping the idea is to create security brand indicators that refer to the value of privacy. It is well known that neither laws nor other organizational practices can exclusively provide a reasonable level of protection for privacy today. There is some evidence that its protection may well be linked to higher levels of trust and that is a powerful motive for serious self-regulation. What is necessary is to build into the security agencies and actors itself a reflexive capacity that encourages more critical communication and awareness among the stakeholders. The overall objective of PATS is to demonstrate how certain standards of privacy can become a brand label for security organisations on a voluntary but binding basis.

The information was compared against the respective historical/cultural contexts, varying national notions of security and modern international situations. As a result, the project devised a classification system for industry players, covering security providers, technology producers, research organisations and other relevant groups.\n\nIn the second phase, work included interviewing security representatives, which revealed a generally low awareness of privacy and occasional rejection of responsibility. The project identified the following reasons for this: industry players are not inclined to discuss privacy, nor does the issue feature in their representations of themselves. Additionally, economic forces do not encourage data protection, meaning that self-regulation is poor.\n\nPATS' main contribution was a multi-dimensional branding/communication strategy that promotes the value of privacy. A resulting roadmap for development will provide security companies wishing to work towards privacy awareness with a plan for doing so. Using the above concepts, the consortium devised policy recommendations for national and EU frameworks. \n\nThe study group organised several dialogue workshops, focus groups and two sizeable conferences.

Given that forest soils represent the largest terrestrial carbon pool, priming effects could cause a major release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.

If compared to existing facilities, the proposed facility will benefit from a lower electron beam energy, due to the enhanced undulator performance, be significantly more compact, as a consequence both of the lower energy and of the high-gradient X-band structures, have a much lower electrical power demand and a smaller footprint.\nCompactLight gathers the world-leading experts in these domains, united to achieve two objectives: disseminate X-band technology as a new standard for accelerator-based facilities and advance undulators to the next generation of compact photon sources, with the aim of facilitating the widespread development of X-ray FEL facilities across and beyond Europe by making them more affordable to build and to operate.", 92686.0, 3106502.0, "XLS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.lancaster.ac.uk", null, "h2020_213791_999840984"], ["4YW", "Enable Ancillary Services bY Renewable Energy Sources", "Lancaster University", "The stability and security of the traditional electrical power systems is largely based on the inherent properties of synchronous generators (SGs).

The emphasis is on a work placement and in all instances there are opportunities for training and more intense linguistic preparation for particular vocational fields such as hospitality and health care.\r\nMobilities are normally three weeks (two for football coaching). This is the optimum time based on staff and student feedback over recent mobility projects. Mobility dates are agreed well in advance of the activity and shared with students, usually after the first term. This itself we have found to serve as a motivating force for learners. Therefore, the impact on the students is positive even before any mobility preparations have taken place. \r\n\r\nIn all projects a timetable of activities is agreed in advance and worked out by key staff and the hosts who manage the training. This ensures a realistic and manageable project with all expectations and requirements clearly laid out. This design of the programme is often adapted for specific needs of participants with specific skill sets. For example, in summer 2014 LMC Sports and Public Service students demonstrated their skills in advance for the host organisations in both Slovakia and Bulgaria. This allowed the hosts to programme activities on their side, based on the skills of the outgoing students. \r\n\r\nIt is intended The Netherlands and Czech mobilities will be carried in 2015/16 in only one flow each.\r\nAll the others will happen over two flows in 2015/16 with a safe, realistic number of accompanying people.\r\n\r\nAccompanying people will remain with the participants for the entire duration of the placement only if the students are under 18 years old. All but two of the projects involves the students staying abroad without staff and therefore getting the best independent life experience. \r\n\r\nResults and impact\r\nLMC attracts a lot of students from deprived areas and its typical student profile is one of very little exposure to different cultures and little or no experience of travelling away from the region. This project will provide a tremendous opportunity for broadening their horizons and developing an appreciation of European Citizenship as well as introducing new employment opportunities. \r\nIn recent years the impact on students has been immense.

In order to succeed, an experimental project has been set up and aims to award schools an academic label called \u201cEuropean School\u201d. The schools involved in this project must develop activities which open the pupils european outlook; encourage them to take part in trips and study programs of all types but also allow each pupil to attend non-linguistic lessons taught partly in a foreign language. The main aim is to give pupils as many possibilities to use the English language in different subjects and projects as well as the language course itself, thus allowing them to acquire the necessary skills for their future life as an European citizen. The setting up of this experiment involves proposing a series of training programs to the involved staff. The consortium is made up of 16 schools for this particular mobility program, all of which are part of the European school project. Thus, in the 2 years of the project, 141 participants will be able to carry out a mobility in England by attending organised lessons, adapted to the specific needs of each participant and/or a shadowing period in a European partner school. It principally concerns teachers of non-language subjects who wish to improve their English language skills but there are also language teachers, management and administrative staff who have been picked for their specific training needs.  Each person has been selected on the basis of specific criteria which have been defined by the Academy: committment to innovation, willingness to train in order to develop their skills and the committment to partake in a training program which not only includes an European mobility but also includes preparatory activities and the use of their new skills as part of the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe training program is based on a diagnostical evaluation of the linguistic capacities of the participants and defines the training activities which will take place before, during and after their mobility. The skills to be learnt and the way they will be used in a pedagogical approach are specified. The Europass language passport constitutes the instrument of measure of the training program, underlined in a mobility contract binding each of the different persons (the Local Education Authority, the participating school, and the training college or partner school). Except for our English teachers, the language skills of our trainees will be attested either by the \u201cDCL\u201d (which is a national professional diploma giving a level of the European Framework of Reference for Languages) or by the \u201cCertification compl\u00e9mentaire\u201d which certifies a recognised level of language skills in order to teach a non-linguistic subject in English.  The follow-up will be conducted by the Academy\u2019s Project Team which is composed of the Head Teachers of the consortium schools, a Project Leader Teacher in each school and several Team Leaders responsible for the day-to-day follow-up of a group of schools, under the responsability of the Academy\u2019s Delegate for European and International Relations, who manages the whole project with a Team Leader.\r\n\r\nThe training courses followed by each participant must help towards developing each pupil\u2019s English skills to a level where they can communicate, by increasing their time spent in presence of the language. Their acquired skills will lead to their success and improve their personal development and their employability on the national, European and international job market.\r\n\r\nThe trainees will be able to improve their English skills and the quality of their teaching in terms of language, culture and educational methods. They will also be able to constitute a network of European contacts in order to develop multidisciplinary educational cooperation projects. By improving the capacities of each of the participants, their mobilities will enhance the international dimension of their school which will be rewarded by the issuance of the academic label \u201cEuropean School\u201d.\r\n\r\nThese innovative projects will contribute to the evolution of our educational system. The experiment carried out in the Acad\u00e9mie de Reims is destined to be taken on board by a larger number of schools in the Academy. It is also easily transposable to other territorial contexts. This innovative project is in line with the strategic goals of \u201cEurope 2020\u201d defined by the European Commission in terms of education, for lowering school drop-out rates and increasing the number of higher education graduates.", "http://lancasterhigh.lancs.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA101-013922_3"], ["2TY", "Auslandspraktikum f\u00fcr Sch\u00fclerinnen und Sch\u00fcler der Berufsbildenden Schulen", "Lancaster and Morecambe College", 58334.0, "The primary aim of the placements abroad is to give 62 participants the possibility of acquiring different competences concerning knowledge, skills and attitudes. In this way, not only the personal development of the learners is promoted but also the possibility of getting a job on the (European) labour market. Additionally, it counteracts prospective youth unemployment. Therefore, the Elisabeth-Selbert-Schule can support the professional development of  the students and promote the quality of the apprenticeship and the further education. \r\nWithin the scope of this project the participants should be able to recognize the differences of the vocational systems and evaluate them. Moreover, practical skills are provided, a sensitisation for other cultures is initiated and flexibility and independent working are ensured. \r\nThrough the work in other vocational- or social facilities the participants are able to learn new methods and gain experience, which can be applied in their own working environment and it can be passed on to other learners. In this way the learners\u2019 competences are promoted and the curiosity towards new trends is aroused. Especially jobs in the catering trade require local flexibility. Therefore, the first steps within the programme are decisive for the further process.   \r\nFurthermore, a placement abroad supports the natural handling with other people and foreign cultures. These are factors that play a great role in the service sector and also in jobs that deal with people, who have special needs. This target group is particular important because they are a minority of whom the learners can profit a lot. After successfully completing the stay abroad the sense of self-esteem and the personality of the learners are strengthened.   \r\nBack in their home country the learners pass on their newly learned knowledge and experience along with a detailed evaluation of the vocational system. \r\nThe intercultural aspects play a substantial role for the nursery nurse trainees, because they are visiting countries without speaking the native language. Therefore, the students have to be more sensitive towards requirements and the behaviour of people of the target culture. Cultural openness and curiosity are essential, especially regarding the work with parents of children who have a migratory background. But also getting into contact with children by using the body language enables the learners to lay special focus on gestures, mimic and the overall behaviour. This is usually not possible in the dense school curriculum of the learners. Everyone included in the exchange can only profit from such cultural diversity. The acquired experience of the nursery nurse trainees can be applied to different working fields during the training course. E.g. the learners are able to find different ways of communicating. This can be helpful if the communication of a child is restricted in some way. \r\nForeign language learning should be an additional goal in the different branches of the work experience. Standardized learning results and the specific understanding between the partner institutions are the criteria for a quality-assured assessment. This makes the acknowledgement of the acquired knowledge and competences possible. \r\nFor this it is necessary that every person involved, including the participating learners, have to have a clear understanding of what has to be learned and how this is documented within the scope of the Europass. The utilisation of the standardized ECVET-Instrument (Memorandum of Understanding/Learning Agreement/Learning standards/Europass) makes the transfer of duties for the quality-assured mobility project easier.", "http://www.lmc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-001946_7"], ["2TY", "Introducing EU opportunities 2", "Lancaster and Morecambe College", 21461.0, "Background Borders in Europe are fading, therefore, the importance of the European citizenship is increasing. In order to improve the feeling of \u2018being a European\u2019 an experience in a different country is a must. Not just a holiday, but a work placement, so that people can experience what the labor market has to offer in the rest of Europe. In the new Erasmus+ program it is possible for Vocational Education (VET) students to do a work placement a year after they have graduated. This is an golden opportunity to help those graduates gain work experience, as the current project \u2013Introducing EU Opportunities-  has shown. In order to improve the current project teachers will be included in this project as they are a primary source of knowledge for students and offer a perfect position to inform and encourage students about internationalization, The Project The idea of the project is to improve the current project \u2013Introducing EU Opportunities- and to introduce recently graduated VET-students and their teachers to the European labor market. The goals of this project are; Firstly, to improve the participants labor market perspective and career possibilities. Secondly,  to increase entrepreneurship and initiative. Thirdly, to boost the participants self-confidence, self-awareness and independence. Finally, to raise their intercultural awareness and create a more positive outlook on Europe and European values and projects. There are three outcomes behind this initiative: Firstly, mobilize graduated VET-students in Europe and make them go where there is enough work in their field.  There is a good chance they stay with the company that has a job offer.Secondly, introducing graduated VET-students to different work techniques and give them valuable work experience they can take back home in order to gain a better position in the local labor market. Thirdly, creating a modern viewed teacher when it comes to internationalization. This means that teachers will be open minded when it comes to the opportunities the European labour market offers to their students. The aim is that this positive outlook will reflect on the students and encourage them to take the step towards an international mobility. DetailsThe participants in this project will be recently graduated VET-students (max. 1 year), because they will not be aided by the schools and will most likely be a left over group. The beauty of this group is that they have no obligations back home (i.e. they do not have to make a school exam or worry about school guidelines) because they have finished their education. Making them the perfect group to explore the rest of Europe and experience firsthand the chances the continent has to offer. The work placement does not have to be a long one, it will last for two weeks. With a preference for two weeks if the participant does not speak the language of the destination country properly. This period is long enough for the participant to get a taste of Europe and decide whether they want to stay in the country they did their work placement or go back home and share their experience on the local labor market. In addition, the period is long enough for employers to see if the participant has what it takes to be taken on full time.  This means that the work placement can have two outcomes. The first being that the student will stay for a longer period of time, because they have gained employment at the company they did their internship (job shadowing) for. And the second being that the participant will return home with increased knowledge, experience, self-confidence, self-awareness, independence and an appreciation of Europe and European values and projects. By undertaking such an experience the participant are already improving their entrepreneurship and initiative taking.

During the setting creation process, the coordinators will provide guidelines and restrictions to the participants that will have been agreed between the coordinators at the preparatory phase. This will ensure game focus on one of the project's main aims, the understanding of European Union shared values such as freedom, solidarity, respect towards minorities etc. After the setting is complete, the participants will take the role of specific characters who act in this setting and will collaboratively face challenges that will have been prepared by the coordinators. Cooperation between the players is established by the fact that each character will have a restricted set of skills in the setting whereas for success to be accomplished several skills will be required. In the end of each day during the event, every player will participate in reflection meetings supervised and guided by the coordinators in order to discuss their views on the challenges and the European shared values they corresponded to.\r\nApart from the understanding of the European Union shared values, one of the project's main goals is the development of a strong European identity among the participants and the creation of a core group that will act in the youth sector at a local, national and international level. This core group will try to evolve into an active, multinational and multicultural European community that is interested in passing European Union shared values and ideas to new people in the rest of Europe. The core group creation goal will be achieved during the event as the coordinators will use team-building techniques to make sure that all participants are collaborating in a friendly, pleasant environment. Besides these, several social, communication and English language skills will be practiced and knowledge of several mythologies (primarily the Greek one) will be acquired by participants. Last but not least, the project aims to further develop the teaching method that will be used during the event.\r\nThe project will be completed in 3 phases: in the first, preparatory phase, all practical amendments will be taken care of (flights reservations, accommodation etc), research on several ethnic mythologies will be undergone and in general all necessary action will be taken to ensure the event runs smoothly, without surprises and with the expected learning outcomes. Phase 2 is the actual youth exchange in Athens, while in phase 3 coordinators will contact participants to write down their impressions and assist them to take initiative at a local level to expand the community and multiply the benefits of the event.\r\nParticipants will be chosen through informal youth groups that act in the youth and role-playing games sectors. All partners will do their best to include as participants young people with less opportunities, mainly youths with educational and financial difficulties. The collaborative framework within which the event will have been structured (coordinators will make sure that all teams formed during the event will have members of each and every nationality and background and will do their best to keep people moving among teams to amplify inter-cultural relations) will help participants understand European Union shared values and how these are perceived by European citizens of different culture.

This applies not only quantitatively but also qualitatively in relation to learning potential and in the spreading internally at school \u2013 i.e. involvement of more colleges, education programs, student types and staff categories.ACTIVITIESA1) Shorter mobilities in companies for VET studentsThis is mobilities of 4-7 weeks\u2019 duration and therefore they may fit into the new Basic Course 2 with specific learning objectives that are achieved in a company abroad. Most mobilities will be carried out for individuals or pairs, when suitable in the individual student\u2019s education plan and to a destination/company that matches the student\u2019s wishes and the defined learning goals. Only in the case of Holland (F2), a fixed schedule is made, whereby 4 groups of 4 Media-students are doing mobilities of 4 weeks with one group every half year. The perspective is increased qualification for subsequent apprenticeship in Denmark or abroad (PIU). A2) Longer mobilities in companies for VET studentsFor Norway (F1) this is SKP students in construction trades, who released from their main course will do a longer work placement in selected companies in Bod\u00f6 and possibly elsewhere in Norway. In Cyprus (F2) this concerns a group of chef students, who starts at school in the spring and therefore is able to do 8 weeks of work placement over the summer holiday at hotels in the Paphos area. Also here the perspective is increased qualification for subsequent apprenticeship or PIU.A3) Shorter mobilities at colleges for VET studentsIn Tampere, Finland (F1), TCAA arranges a 3 weeks\u2019 school period for EUX students as part of their main course. The professional content is log house building (carpenters) and mass ovens (masons). Due to detail planning this mobility will not be carried out until the autumn of 2017. For Leeuwarden, Finland (F2), Media College is sending 2 groups of 10 students, who will do a children\u2019s book project together with Dutch students. This will include a similar activity I Aalborg. In both A3 activities, the idea is completion of specific learning objectives, but also increased qualification for subsequent apprenticeship or PIU.A4) Shorter mobilities at colleges for TCAA and UU staffTCAA sends 4 groups of 4 staff members on 1 week\u2019s mobility to selected colleges around EU to see how they cope with the  challenge of guidance to the VET system and incorporation of an international element in the individual student\u2019s education program. Each group is composed of 2 TCAA people (international coordinators, teachers etc.) and two counsellors from Youth Guidance Centre Aalborg (UU). The participants all have an important role in relation to the student\u2019s choice of VET and a possible international element, and they will be strengthened in their role as counsellors and motivators.TARGET GROUPSIn compliance with the school\u2019s globalization strategy, TCAA has included a broader array of participant groups \u2013 particularly among the students, who form the majority. Thus, some flows are planned for specific target groups like SKP and EUX, while the rest are primarily for basic course (GF2). Due to the VET reform, it has not been possible to find ways, whereby GF1 students can participate in mobilities. TCAA is also still working on including new graduates in mobility, but the interest has been very low so far. Therefore no specific activities are planned for this group.Another new development is that TCAA plans to send out a larger part of participants in groups. This has previously proven difficult, but this time the initiative comes directly from leaders responsible for EUX and Media, and the preparatory work is already going on with the partner colleges abroad.In connection with group mobilities, TCAA sees a pedagogical and logistical need for accompanying teachers \u2013 especially in the start. The same applies to one student mobility in Spain to allow at least one socially weak SKP student to take part.PARTNER CHOICE AND STRATEGYContrary to what would be expected, the VET reform has not had a particular influence on the partner composition in this project. Out of 11 partners, 9 took part in the previous project (in one case only the coordinator), and both of the two new ones are well-known from previous/other projects. All school partnerships are formalized as MoU's in ECVET-like format at part of TCAA's gradual introduction of this QA tool.However, the reform has had its bearing on TCAA\u2019s composition of activity types. This is seen partly by putting more emphasis on new participant groups (e.g. SKP and EUX), and partly by using parts of school periods (and the associated learning objectives) as a new activity type for VET students compared to previous years, which is clearly in line with the aims of the new globalization strategy.", "http://www.lmc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA116-022032_5"], ["2TY", "Opportunities for Working and Learning in Europe", "Lancaster and Morecambe College", 88346.0, "This project will enable students from across the wide ranging curriculum offer of Lancaster & Morecambe College to undertake structured work and learning placements overseas with established vocational training centres and host organisations in Europe.  \r\n\r\nWork experience is a vital part of the personal and professional development of all students at Lancaster and Morecambe College and every effort is made to validate and match that experience with the students' course of study. Backed up by ET 2020 \u201cAn EU average of at least 6 % of 18-34 year-olds with an initial vocational education and training qualification should have had an IVET-related study or training period abroad.\" \r\n\r\nAs well as preparing the student for their next steps into the world of meaningful employment, it is also expected that this opportunity will give them cultural insight and a valuable personal experience that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nThe project is a balance of past mobility actions that have run for several years with the inclusion newer destinations and vocational areas to maximise the impact on the whole organisation and benefit a wider range of learners. In this application a substantial but manageable number of learners will be able to improve their employability prospects and broaden their horizons with a structured placement in one of the following countries:\r\n\r\nLevel 2/3/4 - Sports & Public Services students in Slovakia and Bulgaria\r\nLevel 3/4 - Engineering & Construction students in Denmark.\r\nLevel 2/3/4 - Catering, Hospitality & Tourism, Business and IT students in Italy\r\n\r\nThe outgoing numbers are aligned with past project applications to ensure realistic quality and consistency for all participants. The competition for places is high, with all students having to meet strict selection criteria to be considered. The faculties represented deliberately start with smaller and manageable numbers to ensure safety and quality, and only then can consider increasing the number of outgoing placements. \r\n\r\nThe placements are negotiated and developed between the International Team, LMC teachers and host organisations, and are cited in a learner and a partner agreement. This is a continual quality process to help refine activities for future students and improve the project. The emphasis is on a working placement but in all instances there are opportunities for student training cultural and linguistic preparation for particular vocational fields.\r\n\r\nMobilities are two or three weeks, balancing the optimum time/absence balance and based on staff and student feedback over past  mobility projects. Mobility dates are agreed well in advance of the activity and shared with students, usually after the first term. This itself we have found to serve as a motivating force for learners. Therefore, the impact on the students is positive even before any mobility preparations have taken place. \r\n\r\nIn all projects a timetable of activities is developed by the key staff and the hosts who manage the training. This ensures a realistic and manageable project with all expectations and requirements clearly laid out. This design of the programme is often adapted for specific needs of participants with specific skill sets and goals. For example, in summer 2015/16 LMC Sports and Public Service students demonstrated their skills in advance for the host organisations in both Slovakia and Bulgaria. This allowed the hosts to programme activities on their side, based on the skills of the outgoing students. \r\n\r\nAccompanying staff will remain with the participants for the entire duration of the placement only if the students are under 18 years old. All but two of the projects involves the students staying abroad without staff and therefore getting the best independent life experience. \r\n\r\nLMC attracts a lot of students from deprived areas and its typical student profile is one of very little exposure to different cultures, as well as little or no experience of travelling away from the region. This project will provide a tremendous opportunity for broadening student's horizons and developing an appreciation of European citizenship as well as introducing new employment opportunities. \r\n\r\nIn recent years the impact on students has been immense.

The mobility of students to undergo unique work experience placements abroad is a major and highly relevant part of this strategy; to give the learners a wider and more valuable learning experience as well as to boost their technical skills. \r\n\r\nOur main motives to carry out this project focus on the development opportunities, both personal and professional for the learners involved and to link to the specific course skills and requirements for every trainee, in a manageable and scalable way. The direct objective of this project is to provide a unique work placement for participants to get structured, practical and validated training experiences as well as experience of another country and its culture. \r\n\r\nParticipants will be transparently and carefully selected by staff and teams from the various programmes at LMC. However, encouraging independence is also a focus of the project, and the accompanying tutors will monitor and evaluate the work programme to ensure the students meet their work place objectives and develop themselves professionally as well as personally. \r\n\r\nThe indirect objectives of the project are to ensure that the young people who take part are more employable, with a broader understanding of their own professional areas and other cultures. The proposal provides learners with appropriate opportunities in acquiring skills and knowledge for their personal development and employability. The feedback from past mobility experiences backs up this objective, where students cite their overseas experiences as a pivotal moment in their lives and careers. \r\n\r\nThe mobility and life experiences this project offers have a greater value than local training, and those experiences are not available in the UK. The added value of the EU aspect of the project might be just as valuable as the work and learning aspects of the project, and the benefits on the individuals taking part are as much cultural as educational.\r\n\r\nLMC is uniquely positioned to meet the needs of the learners and of employers, this project aims to deliver a more skilled, developed and experienced level of trainee, recruit or employee whilst producing high quality learning outcomes and reinforcing the capacities of the organisations involved. The number of learners is planned to ensure the safest manageable and proportionate experience.           \r\n\r\nLMC are now linking, more than ever, to industry, technical and work based partners to prepare the learners for meaningful employment. This is evidenced locally and regionally, where strategic approaches are needed to address crucial changes in working practices and employment culture.

Sport & Public Services, Business & Recreation, Hospitality & IT professions are vital to the local economy, and by up-skilling and widening the outlook of the young people this project aspires to have a significant outcome and long lasting impact.\r\n\r\nThis project will enhance our students opportunities to enter their chosen professions and rise to the current challenges of the labour market, creating skilled and experienced workers with a more culturally sensitive and aware outlook; participants will be better people, culturally aware and inevitably more employable after this experience.\r\n\r\nThe Europe 2020 strategy with its demands for a closer cooperation between vocational institutions and the common transparency instruments require an international focus.

The main innovation of the project as opposed to other proposals is that it replaces traditional lecture with actual experience.

In the first phase, all preparation matters will be taken care of. This includes all organizational matters for the main activity (i.e. flights, food, hotel reservations, transfers to and from airports, participants selection), but also the creation of a set of restrictions by the coordinators, that will will be used as a base for the creation of the virtual environment in the main activity. Preparation phase will begin with an Advanced Planning Visit where all tasks will be organized and delegated to the partners. During preparation, the partners will research the Greek mythological background in order to be able to add elements to the virtual environment. During the main activity, which will last for 12 days, participants will be divided into groups of six and, under the supervision of a coordinator, will create characters in a virtual environment and then assume their roles and face challenges that will have been prepared before-hand by the coordinators. The main goal of the coordinating group is to create internal conflicts among participants in order for them to understand better EU values. The groups will often play outside, wandering through the landscape that helped inspire Greek mythology. The importance of the mythology and experiencing the landscape is that they had a major influence on the development of modern culture. Going back to the roots of the culture will provide a good background for discussions about values and the modern way of life. The project foresees reflection at the end of each day. After the end of the main activity, all partners will organize a meeting locally with their repsective participants in order to receive feedback and figure out ways to make them more involved in the newly formed community.\r\nThe learning goals of the project include the development of teamwork, collaboration, the improvement of social skills and cultural understanding as well as knowledge of Greek mythology, raising awareness over distinctive value systems and beliefs and improvement of English language and communication skills.\r\nThe coordinating group will involve several youths with less opportunities, that will mainly come from the UK partner. For them, the project offers the potential of orienting themselves better in society, learning how to express themselves and opening their minds, all in a setting of activities that they excel at, opportunity that might have never been available to them otherwise.\r\nThe groups involved will use the opportunity of the event to expand the community that already exists from previous actions of the coordinating group and to improve and establish the alternative teaching method used. To that end, the Greek partner Pandora has gotten in touch with ASPAITE, the Greek public institution in charge of the long term training of teachers of all levels in Greece, in order to bring its expertise into the project. \r\nGiving young people the opportunity of cooperating, developing an understanding for each other and building a lasting friendship can have a huge impact on society. The young people involved are actively involved in helping others, and thus they will have an influence on others and help create an open, tolerant, and united society in Europe.", "http://www.lurps.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-BE05-KA105-002333_2"], ["2TY", "Free speech as the bedrock of liberty", "Lancaster and Morecambe College", 36579.0, "Historical and political background, the process of peoples\u2019 migration, wars and conflicts led to the fact that billions of people have to leave their houses and to look for another home. Unfortunately, the statistics show us sad numbers of countries that are faced with conflicts within its territory. People in the European Union and many other partner countries are being considered as a minority, usually, with rather a negative characteristic, they are treated with bias. This attitude is a product of the negative impact of the hate speech, manipulation, and some information fake. The two-stage project \u201cFree speech as the bedrock of liberty\u201d was designed to provide the target audience the greater understanding of social and cultural diversity, which strongly connected with the language of hatred and neglect in our society. We seek to develop methods of youth work that can contribute to solving the problem of hate speech, young migrants, issues of radicalism, minorities of regions and political societies. \r\nThere are general objectives for both stage of the project:\r\n- to exchange experience between 30 participants by social dialogue and develop new tools and knowledge in media topic;\r\n- to make reportage using real people from the real world;\r\n- to separate propaganda, fake new, manipulation, learn how to find the truth, where to take the real information;\r\n- to draw a parallel between the two countries (Malta and Ukraine) through two stages of Training Courses: to identify the causes of the emergence of hate speech and adopt experience of resolution.\r\nBoth stages will accept participants from each cooperation country. In accordance with the project aim, for both stage main target group:\r\n- Without any limit of age;\r\n- Have previous experience in social or political activities; interested in social life;\r\n- Awareness of journalistic principles and photography will be taken into account;\r\n- Have some background in creating youth political parties and creating media products;\r\n- Have the good level of English;\r\n- Bring energy and enthusiasm and are prepared to participate in all activities.\r\nThe participants will be selected by partners in cooperation with the applicant and host organization. The selection process will be based on applications (including motivational statement), CV, and Skype interview. The selection process will help to assess real needs, experience, the background of the participants and how relevant to the project will be to their future goals and work.\r\nThe project opens its doors for the representatives with a disadvantaged background such as IDPs, Refugees, minority groups (ethnic, LGBTQ, etc.), and those with fewer economic possibilities. We believe these participants can help reach a broader range of people once they return home, and give participant better understanding of hate speech exists in the modern society.\r\nWe expect this project to have a great impact on the participants, partners and the other target groups involved in the project activities. \r\nThe desired impact on the participants on both stage of the project:\r\n- to motivate young people to develop the social projects that can reduce the hate speech in the society; \r\n- to encourage them to spread the ideas of equality and humanity in every country;\r\n- cultural exchange between participants helps facilitate better understanding and cooperation at all levels;\r\n- to integrate good practices and new methods of non-formal education and social advocacy into daily basics.\r\nParticipants will receive new knowledge on contributing to solving the problem of hate speech, young migrants, issues of radicalism, minorities of regions and political societies. \r\nOn the first stage in Malta participants will be able to obtain theoretical knowledge, improve their skills in working with information, study methods of counteracting the hate speech and get practical skills necessary to identify and counteract human rights violations. On the second stage in Ukraine participants will be able to demonstrate their skills and knowledge of working with information in practice. They will prepare its own media-product about the personal experience of minorities of collision with hate speech and develop ways to deal with it. \r\nThe project will provide the target audience the greater understanding of social and cultural diversity, which strongly connected with the language of hatred and neglect in our society.\r\nWe think two-stage project \u201cFree speech as the bedrock of liberty\u201d has really big perspective, cause the host and organizing organization are going with the help of these important and serious evaluations monitor the continuation of the participant's lifestyle after the projects are finished.

This application focusses on EU, and it is purely targeted at the VET section of the college. The aim is not only quantitative, but also to secure and further develop the quality of the mobilities in relation learning potential and continued dissemination and anchoring at the college - in other words continued involvement of more college departments, education paths, student types and staff catagories. As shown in the school's Globalisation Barometer (see appendix) this process is already moving ahead in this Charter period.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\nA1) Short term mobility of VET learners\r\nThe first flows (F1-11) deal mobilities of 3-4 week's duration in companies within a broad array of companies in EU countries in cooperation with well functioning partner organisations. The target group is primarily students from the new basic course (GF2) and from the college's placement centre, SKP. In the case of GF2-students, mobilities are arranged so that they fit into the individual learning plan of the student, and go to a destination/company that matches the student's wishes and defined learning objectives. In the same manner, a large number of SKP-students are offered work placements in \"real\" companies, as they are released from their main course to company based learning (VFU). Due to changed VFU rules, these mobilities are cut down to 3 weeks, but it is the hope of the college that the they will still lead to paid employment under the Danish apprenticship abroad scheme (PIU) for many SKP-students. Converning destination and target group, the details of the first 11 flows are:\r\nF1: Placements in and around Bod\u00f6, Norway for SKP-students (construction, restaurant etc.) and VET students\r\nF2: Placements in Southern Norway for Agri-students (farmer etc.) and VET students\r\nF3: Placements  in and around Leeuwarden, Holland for SKP-students and VET students\r\nF4: Placements in and around Reykjavik, Iceland for SKP-students (electrician, metal, mechanic etc.) and VET students\r\nF5: Placements  in Southwestern Iceland for Agri-students (farmer etc.) and VET students\r\nF6: Placements in and around Berlin, Germany for SKP-students (electrician, machine etc.) and VET students\r\nF7: Placements at Gran Canaria, Spain for SKP-students (data, IT-supporter etc.) and VET students\r\nF8: Placements in and around Dublin, Ireland for SKP-students (data, IT-supporter etc.) and VET students\r\nF9: Placements around the country side of Ireland for Agri-students (farmer etc.) and VET students\r\nF10: Placements in and around Lancaster for SKP-students (plumber, mason etc.) and VET students\r\nF11: Placement in or around Maribor, Slovenia for VET student at new destination\r\n\r\nOne group of 10 EUX students (F12) from the construction industry will be sent to Mallorca, Spain for 3 weeks' work placement as part of their main course in order to gain  practical experience in an international setting. In the springs of 2019 and 2020, 2 groups of 10 media students will do 3 weeks' school based mobility in Leeuwarden (F13), where they produce a childrens's book together with a Dutch group of students, who afterwords will continue the project in Denmark for their own Erasmus+ funds. And as something new, 2 groups of chef students from the main course will go to a college in France for 3 weeks (F14) on an optional specialisation subject focussing on excellence in gastronomy.\r\n\r\nTo Cyprus, TECHCOLLEGE will be sending 2 groups of GF2 students (F15) over the summer holidays of 2018 and 2019. These students use their holiday in addition to a couple of weeks of the basic course and thereby get an 8 weeks' work placement at luxury hotels in the Paphos area. The same model is tried out with a hair dresser student both summers at Crete (F16) with a new and promising host company. In both cases the aim is to fulfill specific learning objectives, but at the same time also to increase chances of apprenticeship in Denmark  or abroad (PIU). \r\n\r\nA2) Staff training abroad\r\nWith the aim ogf exchanging experience regarding best practice within guidance towards VET programs and incorporation of an international element in the individual student's VET, TECHCOLLEGE sends 4 groups of 4 staff members (F1-4) on a 1 week's mobility stay at selected partner schools in the EU to see how these challenges are tackled here. Each group consists of 2 TECHCOLLEGE staff and  2 counsellors from Youth  Guidance Centre Aalborg. The participants have a key role in attracting students to VET and in adding an international dimension to VET programs.\r\n\r\nACCOMPANYING TEACHERS\r\nIn connection with the larger groups (F12-15), extra accompanying teachers are added as they stay only 1 week each and as the students are devided in 2 stays.

However, teachers often lack awareness, training and resources to cater for DLs' special needs in mixed ability classes as indicated by previous projects (DysTEFL 1-2, CalDys2) we intend to build on. Although there are some English resources meant for DLs on the international market, materials in German are scarce, and in the target countries of designed task bank (Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland) there are no bilingual learning materials for individual learner use or differentiated classroom work to provide targeted support for DLs. To cater for this educational need, the project aims to produce a flexible, thematically organised English and German digital task bank for DLs participating in integrated primary school education across classes 4th-8th (age group 10-14), up to proficiency level A2 according to CEFR. It will contain skills development tasks addressing the difficulties of DLs, graded tasks allowing for alternative solutions of the same assignment, as well as open-ended individual and group project tasks encouraging a task-based approach and cooperative learning.

It fosters a multisensory approach to learning with more than ten task types and the possibility to integrate a wide variety of materials (games, videos, pictures, word and pdf files, etc.), as well as a monitoring function for teachers to follow and shape learner progress individually.\r\nThe project will be realised in the cooperation of seven partner institutions from four countries: the University of Miskolc, the University of Szeged, Lingua-Met Gp. and Navigates Up. from Hungary, Lancaster University (UK), Masaryk University (Czech Republic) and Warsaw University (Poland). The partners contribute to the project a broad spectrum of expertise including educational research and teacher training practice in the field of learning with SEN, and developing digital learning platforms and printed course materials for the targeted age group with and without SEN. As associated partners, primary schools from each target country will join the project to try the material and provide feedback. Six national language teaching associations from the partner countries have also volunteered to help disseminate the results of the project. \r\nThe activities to be completed within the framework of the project will include the development of the ENGaGE digital course in English and German with audio recordings and animated audiovisual materials produced with the Powtoons Animated Video Builder platform, built-in language games, sample lesson plans, teachers' manual and learners' guide. The material will be tested in the associated partner schools, where the partners will collect feedback, conduct classroom observation and subsequently report the outcomes.

This understanding is highlighted in the EU economic strategy \u201cEurope 2020\u201d and embedded within the detail of its various flagship Initiatives such as:  \u201cSmart Growth: Innovation Union\u201d, \u201cYouth on the Move\u201d, which among other things seeks to better equip our young people to achieve  successful employment in adulthood and the \u201cNew Skills for New Jobs\u201d agenda. This 30 month project seeks to address the new challenges in the labour market by exploring all the factors above & developing practical, user friendly and transferable solutions by nurturing & capitalising on the good work already happening in the partner countries and across Europe. By the same token, local economies also require specialist research to ensure the labour market is adequately served. As stated by The UK Secretary of State for Education and Minister for Women and Equalities makes clear in the English Apprenticeship 2020 vision, \"Nobody understands the skills employers need better than the employers themselves. That is why we are placing them in the driving seat. They are designing apprenticeships so that they focus on exactly the skills, knowledge and behaviours that are required of the workforce of the future\".The target group in this project are organisations and employers that work directly with young people who are facing significant challenges securing meaningful careers, as well as the young people themselves who often need extra guidance when making the transition from education to the world of work. The preparation and guidance for transition from education to employment readiness is a key focus of this project. To support this notion and develop new approaches to handling this transition process are the main objectives of the training elements in this project and also why we are also seeking employer, SME and other professional voices. Cedefop Director James Calleja said: \u2018SMEs, who are drivers of economic growth and job creation, are natural partners with vocational education and training (VET) which provides the skills they need.\"By gaining a unique level of access to young people who in the process of transition from education to work, we can get invaluable feedback about the State of the Art pertaining to Career Guidance whilst working together to develop new approaches matching the ever changing nature of the job market to the vocational skills of those entering work.We will create a suite of modular resources, testing tools, a training framework and CPD training packages and pilot test them in real training situations with career guides and trainers, and upwards of 200 young people. Materials can be adapted by partners to fit different sectors and educational levels. We hope to run several events to maximise the interest in the final tools and share them with local, regional and international actors. Socio-economic challenges in all of the partner countries mean that new ways to guide and steer young people into a stable working life, to avoid transient career choices, spiralling debt and reliance on state support; towards a better standard of living, can in someway contribute to a more harmonious society. The unique experience of the partners and their level of access to different target groups; youth, higher education, trainees, apprentices, volunteers, school leavers, unemployed and those pursuing a vocational education or re-entry to the labour market, will ensure not only a truly transnational project and outputs, but also ones that are adaptable to different socio-economic and educational groups.The migration of labour and the free movement of people within the EU should make the project's inter cultural findings and activities more pertinent in all of the partner countries. This experience and the import / export of new approaches dealing with a rapidly changing labour market with new skills demands, can help organisations and communities meet the need to prepare 'Generation Y' with the new skills and approaches for work readiness.   Before the project started, partners conducted research to establish a need for the project in each country and to lay the foundations for future activities. The findings of these eight reports highlights the need more a consistent, yet adaptable approach to guide people at a vital stage in their lives.Every year we hear in the media about different approaches to education internationally with much political posturing, however by simply taking the best approaches from the partner countries in a pilot such as this, we can directly benefit the Career Guidance and Vocational preparation on a local, regional and international level whilst bringing together a diverse range of partner organisations with a range of experiences.", "http://www.lmc.ac.uk", "Lancaster and Morecambe College", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA202-024558_coordinator"], ["2TY", "Quality management for Internship", "Lancaster and Morecambe College", 44776.0, "The main objective of our project \u201cQualiship\u201d is an exchange of different support systems of internships on a national level. This includes an exchange of basic models of competences and instruments, which are relevant for the preparation, implementation and evaluation of internships. \r\nErasmus+ offers standardized instruments (e.g. learning agreements), but we will focus on the state of the art on the national level in the project countries. Our goal is to study and compare the different support systems of internships. The project involves 3 VET schools from Austria, Spain and the UK and 2 VET NPO's from Spain and Italy. The Austrian organization is the project coordinator.\r\n\r\nBackground in Austria: The Federal Ministry of Education developed a model of social and personal competences for VET schools \u2013 not specifically conceptualized for internship. There was also a working group to develop instruments for supporting internships at VET schools.\r\n\r\nPhases and work schedule: Start of the project: October 2017 \u2013 preparation for the project kick-off meeting in November 2017. Staff training in March 2018 in Spain. Partner meeting in autumn 2018 in the UK and partner meeting in spring 2019.

How to evaluate the internships? Moreover, at the first meeting strategies on how to spread the results should be worked out together. At the staff training there will be a meeting with colleagues who support internships to compare theory and practice. \r\nNevertheless, the project partners are responsible for the regional implementation of the project results.

Videographics (the use of visual images) and infographics (the visual representations of data) are areas of increasing importance. Forbes Insights (\u201cExecutives embrace non-text world\u201d, 2010) highlight that executives and business people prefer using non-text formats for a wide range of goals. Visual thinking strategies, video storytelling and Vlogs (video diaries/blogs) for reflection are also on the rise. The National Commission on Writing (2006, p.15) says \"Thinking on the screen\" is as important as \"thinking on paper\" in the 21st century. This under researched area is rising in importance and competence in video and visual thinking is crucial for communication in education and business.In Higher Education(HE), the EU is lagging behind the rest of the world in modernisation and internationalisation, e.g. in the UK the bienniel UCISA Technology Enhanced Learning survey (2014) found that Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have made little impact on HE however, video recording of lectures is increasing. Video technologies are being increasingly used in online learning and particularly in MOOCs. MOOCs have great potential for opening up education and making it accessible to all irrespective of institutional boundaries, national borders, or educational context. The need for competences in video/visual thinking is increasing and especially useful for supporting dyslexic learners.- Objectives The ViLi project aims to improve the performance and efficiency of education and training by:- developing the competences of educators in video and visual thinking strategies, by delivering a MOOC that is open to all in e.g. vocational training, business and further education.- supporting the opening up of education by providing pedagogical materials and open educational resources (OERs) developed and evaluated through two MOOCs on video/visual thinking strategies.- Activities and MethodologyTo achieve these objectives the project will:- research current practice in the use of video/visual thinking strategies and to combine it with a review of literature to develop an innovative theory that encapsulates best practice and theory and draws from experience in multiple fields. Pedagogical materials will be developed based on this new theory with a mosaic of case studies that show how to improve knowledge representation or construction exploiting the potential of visual/video thinking strategies.- to promote the use of video and visual thinking strategies in online learning and MOOCs through the dissemination of OERs developed and evaluated through two MOOCs on video/visual thinking strategies.A design based research methodology will be used to develop and evaluate the OERs and pedagogical materials and informed grounded theory methodology will be used to generate the innovative theory of best practice in video/visual thinking. Social media will be used to inform stakeholders and recruit participants to the MOOC. The MOOC will enable testing and evaluation to lead to refinement of the resources, as well as the creation of a supportive learning community that co-creates a WIKI of case studies to showcase examples and encourage re-use of resources. - ImpactThere are two major intellectual outputs produced: pedagogical materials; and open educational resources (e.g. MOOC on video/visual literacies, WIKI, videos). The pedagogical materials and OERs can be freely reused by educators, vocational trainers and those working in human resources, wholly or in part. The supportive learning community and WIKI will help to ensure the sustainability of the resources produced. The potential impact on HE, vocational training and business is increased competences of educators in communication through video/visual literacies, and support for the development and use of MOOCs within Europe through open educational resources and the MOOC on visual literacies. Papers in academic and practitioner conferences and journals will open up further research and innovation on video/visual literacies and MOOCs in education.

Within the framework of these societal challenges, technological development \u2013though necessary- is not enough to guarantee social change and innovation. Yet, we still know very little about these innovation processes in social contexts, what institutional conditions are key, the role of culture and values in their development, and why this happens in some countries more easily than in others. The point is to shift from \u201cscience in society\u201d to \u201cscience for society\u201d. This has to do directly with the education of Early Career Researchers (ECRs), particularly PhD students and post-PhD researchers, who in recent years have experienced an increase in their responsibility and need for transversality and applicability of their results. This is also in line with the European policies concerning the training and promotion of new generations of researchers \u2013 of which the numbers are increasing. \r\n\r\nThese concerns compel us to develop our proposal around two nuclear goals:\r\n\u2022 To reconceptualize the role of ECRs in order to enable them to successfully face current societal challenges and establish satisfactory careers.\r\n\u2022 To enhance the development of ECRs\u2019 identities and careers through training.\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:\r\n1. To design, create and assess interactive on-line research-based resources to help ECRs (PhD students and post-doc) to face research challenges and strategies for developing resilience and regulating emotions.\r\n2. To develop, validate and set up digital tools that contribute to develop ECR identity and career trajectories through effective participation in the professional and scientific communities of reference.\r\n3. To raise awareness within the European scientific community of the importance of researcher identity and career development.\r\n4. To showcase and disseminate proven methodologies, tools and practices for ECR to successfully address challenges faced in advancing their careers.\r\n \r\nThe RID-SSISS addresses the following target groups: ECRs across disciplines, Higher Education institutions and educational stakeholders (doctoral school directors, graduate program directors, supervisors within and outside academia), and Research funding agencies and policy makers.\r\n\r\nRegarding results, RID-SSISS will create not only a training on-line platform but also a social networking space, in the process of becoming the first European community designed for ECRs in Europe. Through this social interactive platform \"A researcher like me\", the exchange of best practices and a rapid replication of best cases will be promoted. The platform will be complemented and connected to a complete set of interactive tools also launched by the project (Android and iOS mobile apps, twitter and blogs).\r\n \r\nOutputs of the project will also consist of a set of validated training courses, workshops and interactive questionnaires that will provide ECRs with the unique opportunity to develop effective strategies to negotiate their research careers. Institutions and stakeholders will be integrated into the process of validation (design and piloting) and implementation of the training outputs to make effective changes at social, institutional and work-condition levels. \r\n\r\nThese materials will contribute to ECRs gaining the following competencies: \r\n- Most suitable strategies to manage innovative scientific communication addressed to different audiences. This implies participants being able to master not only scientific writing (journals, conferences, reports and reviews, grant applications), but also alternative genres to disseminate research (blogs, wikis, websites) and networking (social and professional platforms and consortia).\r\n \r\n-Resources to grow as independent researchers looking for funding their own projects; develop and consolidate new research profiles, looking for research ethics, sustainability and equity; and negotiate their career trajectories by analysing their potential and real affordances and limitations according to international job market possibilities. Such researchers might contribute to substantial changes in European research in terms of developing interdisciplinary projects required to face societal challenges.\r\n \r\n-Knowledge and strategies to appropriately balance work demands with personal life since research has shown this is a competence, which has been overlooked in European countries, in which junior researchers feel unable to develop their research careers along with a satisfactory personal life.

Moreover, a local partner is also included in the project as this partner has a key role in implementation and production of the intellectual output. The roles of each partner are defined in detail and a clear task sharing has been accomplished among the partners. In order to reach the stated aims, a project management and implementation team is established at every partner institution. These teams have important responsibilities such as conducting preparation duties, evaluating the quality of activities during the visits and so on.

Dyslexia is a specific learning disability characterized by difficulties with word decoding, spelling, handwriting, reading, memory and attention span (Kormos & Smith, 2012).  The British Dyslexia Association say that 10% of the population have dyslexia, although figures quoted in the USA can be 15-20%, so the need to improve support for this learning difficulty is widespread (http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk).  \r\n\r\nThe CIELL project is a collaboration between comic artists, language teachers and learning technology researchers, to create innovative open educational resources that enrich teaching practice  and support dyslexic learners.  The CIELL project is an extension of the ERASMUS+ ViLi project (https://www.viliproject.eu/) that aims to improve the visual literacies of educators, making learning more visual through static (e.g. comics, mind maps), dynamic (e.g. video) and interactive visuals (e.g. virtual reality).  The CIELL project further develops static visual representations in learning.\r\n\r\nThe CIELL project aims to address the EU policies on social inclusion and digital competence by:\r\n- enhancing the digital competence of second language teachers by providing a Compendium of open educational resources including a Teacher\u2019s Pack and examples of the good practice in the use of comics in education, and\r\n- developing innovative teaching materials delivered in a mobile application (app) to support more visual teaching and learning practices and increase the social inclusion of dyslexic learners.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the app will support dyslexic students studying for the British Council examination (IELTS) and Cambridge University English proficiency (C2), with a focus on opinion essays, reviews and article writing.  For example, writing guidelines and sample essays will be created in comic form and other visual representations such as mind maps.  The topics of the essay writing will be based on the 17 United Nations goals for 2030 (http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) as they have global relevance and appeal.\r\n\r\nEducational researchers, language teachers and comic artists will create and refine the innovative teaching content and practices and these open educational resources will be shared freely, worldwide.  Dyslexic language learners (60) and language teachers (30) will work closely with developers to refine the app, the teaching content (comics) and the Teacher\u2019s Pack.  A survey will also be conducted to discover examples of good practice in the use of comics in education, for inclusion in the Compendium, and it is expected that there will be 100-200 respondents.  A conference for 100 researchers and practitioners will be arranged on the use of comic art for serious educational purposes.  Dissemination is expected to reach 8000 through social media and inclusion within two massive open online courses. \r\n\r\nThe project will adopt an Educational Design Research methodology (McKenney & Reeves, 2012) that aims to design an intervention in a real educational setting, it is practice oriented as it is assessed by its practicality to users, it is interactive and participatory, as end-users are involved in a cyclical approach to design and evaluation where user perceptions influence redesign and redevelopment thereby maximising practical relevance.  It also aims to improve theoretical knowledge by increasing understanding of what works best in teaching practice.\r\n\r\nWe will strengthen the skills of educators in higher education and other educational settings by designing new content, linking visual approaches to language teaching to facilitate more socially inclusive education.

However, as HEIs we are also becoming aware of the collateral repercussions of digital overload and uncontrolled use of digital communications and social media, from the mental health of individual students, to societal impacts, such as the controversies surrounding free speech and radicalization. \r\n\r\nThe crux of the challenge is that access to digital media has outpaced our ability to guide its responsible use. Many teaching staff feel disadvantaged by having grown up in a pre-digital world, and yet are concerned with the wellbeing of their students and their ability to thrive in digital settings.\r\n\r\nIn response, Digital Wellbeing has a clear objective: increase the capacity of lecturers and teachers to integrate digital education in a way that promotes the digital wellbeing of students. Through building teacher capacity, the project will improve students\u2019 abilities to manage their online time, make the most of digital learning, critically assess the media they consume and create, and become responsible, confident digital citizens.\r\n\r\nWe will achieve this by pursuing the following specific objectives:\r\n- Identify and showcase innovative, participative approaches to developing digital wellbeing in education (IO1: Compendium of Best Practice)\r\n- Upskill teachers in confident use of digital education, combining digital wellbeing with effective development of other digital competences (IO2: Digital Wellbeing Education OERs & APP)\r\n- Develop a Digital Wellbeing App to be used as a stand-alone resource for students, and as an additional teacher resource to be used alongside the OERs(IO2: Digital Wellbeing Education OERs & APP) .  \r\n- Produce a Teachers\u2019 Digital Pedagogy Toolkit to support teaching staff in developing their own digital competences and mainstreaming digital literacy skills in their teaching activities.

The barriers faced by migrants for finding a job in the receiving country include, among others, insufficient skills and experience (especially language barriers, low level of education or a lack of local work experience) and difficulties in navigating host-country labour markets (including poor information about how to present themselves and look for a job). \r\nWorKit will address the above needs and challenges through the application of innovative context-related and learner-centred tools providing language information linked to the migrants\u2019 immediate needs for employment. The main project products (Job Language Kit for Migrants, WorKit Online Interactive Tool and WorKit Mobile App) will provide language information on work and employment, addressing specific areas in the process of seeking, finding and keeping a job.

For example, there have been significant developments in new digital technology platforms such as mobile technologies, cloud computing, social media, open educational resources (OERs), free and open-source software (FOSS), as well as the associated hardware (e.g. mobile phones, tablets, e-readers, interactive whiteboards). Opportunities and demands of globalisation and technology are fuelling transformations of educational practices and school infrastructure quickly t. The evolution of educational systems and digital technology also provide additional challenges to framing our perspectives, including the emergence of virtual and networked schools that share courses and programmes within countries and across regions (Davis, Eickelmann & Zaka 2013). Utilising these technological advancements to support good-quality training and reflective professional development are fast becoming essential parts of a teacher\u2019s professional life. Supporting teachers in their professional development leads to improved outcomes for teachers, trainers and learners alike. In former projects many good tools were developed with great enthusiasm and piloted in the area of second chance education that supported teachers to become more confident, responsible, reflective, innovative and engaged. The tools include competence cards, quality cycles, assessment software, evaluation methods, mobility practices, teaching programmes and mentor trainings alongside a number of other tools that supports the education and employability for the NEET-group  in Europe.  In 2014 the Digital Second Chance Opportunities (DISCO) project began building the foundations of an online European infrastructure framework in second chance education. Now it is time to go a step further by moving DISCO onto the next level of development in terms of its content and service delivery.  The online European infrastructure in second chance education will be built on three pillars:1. SERVICES: under the SERVICES-umbrella existing quality tools will be made available and continuously upgraded. These quality tools are partly developed for a) quality assurance of international placements b) online community building  c) quality assurance of educational organisations and d) good practice testing.2.

The subject of the project is computer service training including personal and professional development. The target group of the project are adult persons (in particular aged 50+) who have lack the skills in the field of computer service. In many European countries are organized training courses related to computer service, which are designed to reduce the digital gap dividing older and younger generations. The vast majority of these courses aim to provide adult learners with the technical skills connected with computers and basic programs. Adult people (especially aged 50+) belong to the people of the difficult situation on the labour market. In connection with the economic crisis, whose effects are still being felt to a large extent, many workers in this age have lost their jobs and are now unemployed. Adult people, in particular those who are struggling with difficult situation on labour market (e.g. unemployment) are also at risk of social exclusion and isolation. The project has been created in order to support adult people in social and professional development through computer service training.

In addition, the lack of language skills can be a great barrier to understanding the functioning of the health system. On the other hand, language and communication barriers also hinder the healthcare providers in the receiving country in ensuring proper accessibility, acceptability and quality of services offered to migrants. \r\nFALK will address the above challenges through the application of innovative context-related and learner-centred tools for (self) learning developing health-related language and communication skills and providing on-the-go information for immediate access to health services by migrants. The main project outcome (First Aid Language Kit) will provide migrants with country-specific information on the healthcare systems as well as language skills for successfully seeking and receiving medical help.

In this project when the term NEET is used it specifically refers to young people with a previous negative educational experience, or early school-leavers, who have failed to complete formal education.\r\n\r\nThe share of young people between the ages of 20 and 34 years neither in employment nor in education and training in 2016 stood at 12.4% in DE; 21.3% in CY; 14.8% in UK; 18.5% in IE; 18.0% in PL; 15.0% in FI; 16.2% in CZ and 22.5% in HR. With a record number of NEETs following the financial and economic crisis, there have been concerns among policymakers that a whole generation of young people in the EU could remain out of the labour market for years to come. Research evidence suggests that young people can deal relatively well with short spells of unemployment. Longterm disengagement, however, is likely to have a scarring effect on future labour market participation as well as earnings over the life course and thus may lead to social exclusion for those affected.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of the project is to design and develop a bespoke challenge-based educational intervention aimed at re-engaging NEETs and supporting them to build skills and competences to assist their reintegration to education or employment. Partners will initially focus on building trust and confidence which may have been broken by past negative experiences and on addressing motivational deficits that act as barriers to engagement. Once NEETs are re-engaged the online escape room challenges will focus on the development of market oriented key competences. For the adult education professionals who will ultimately be charged with delivering and sustaining this new intervention partners are proposing a comprehensive in-service training programme to support them in using these new resources but also developing key skills to enable them create new challenges in the future.\r\n\r\nThe online escape room challenges will use an embedded learning approach to re-engage NEETs in education and training.

This understanding is transposed in the EU economic strategy \u201cEurope 2020\u201d and embedded within the detail of its various Flagship Initiatives. However, this recognition is set within a context where EU\u2019s performance in successfully fostering the entrepreneurial spirit of its YP lags behind the optimum and endangers us in comparison to some of our global competitors. It is also the case that comparative performance of member states & their regions in this regard is variable across Europe, suggesting significant scope for learning from each other and for spreading best practice across the EU\r\n\r\nAcross the EU, there is a plethora of initiatives operating at transnational, national, regional and even local levels.  Whilst the volume of activity is good, there are concerns that the landscape of provision is too complex, and that many \u201call-age\u201d initiatives in relation to entrepreneurship are not suitable for YP.

The question that seemed like an exaggeration a few years ago is today important concern in hundreds of cities across Europe.\r\nWhat can your organization do when you notice that intolerance is spreading among young people? The issue of intolerance and radicalization was one of the main priorities of the recent Dutch EU Presidency. One of the biggest challenges yet to come is also increasing popularity of radical, extreme social views that are receiveing increasing support in the European political arena and thus attacking the very fundamentals of the European idea.\r\nAnd who can you ask for advice and help when you deal with the above issues?\r\nProject Strategic Partnership between Slovenia, Great Britain, Poland and Turkey seeks to answer all three key questions through the development of three intellectual results that are beneficial for young people, youth workers and youth organization and local communities on national as well as on international level.\r\nIntellectual results are:\r\n- Non-formal education method entitled Suitcase; group simulation game that enhances intercultural competences of young people and provides greater empathy and understanding of issues related to refugees and immigrants. \r\n- \"First aid; multicultural guide\u00ab is a handbook of  several examples of good practice from across Europe that  presents quality local measures that helps to promote and develop multicultural society.\r\n- \u00bbSafe haven; network of organizations\u00ab is a network of reliable and quality organizations, much needed infrastructure to prepare and develop future project ideas that could properly address topics raised by refugee-migrant crisis.\r\nIn the first half of the project we develop intelectual results in the second part we diseminate them.

One significant change that has resulted is that high levels of stress in the workplace are now experienced across all pay grades, by all staff categories. According to a study on work-related stress from the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, stress is the second most frequently reported work-related health problem in Europe. Up to 60% of all lost working days can be attributed to work-related stress and psychosocial risks.\r\n\r\nWhile occupational psychologists accept that in today\u2019s modern workplace, a certain level of pressure is completely normal and to be expected, when this pressure develops into a persistently stressful working environment, with little or no supports in place, people can find it difficult to cope and some may develop a range of health issues as a result. The biggest stress factor identified is concern around possible job loss, which increased the odds of poor health by up to 50. In Europe today, a significant cohort of young people run a high risk of unemployment for a number of reasons; (a) their low skill levels; (b) the skills miss-match between the skills they have and the skills now required; (c) their inability cope with current market needs; (d) their inability to manage and plan an effective and appropriate career trajectory that suits their own specific skills, characteristics and ambitions.\r\n\r\nhe objectives of the UNWIND project are to:\r\n- develop a totally new suite of career management resources that address the 4 key thematic areas identified in the Career Management Skills Framework for Scotland:\r\nSELF - competences that enable young people to develop their sense of self within society; \r\nSTRENGTHS - competences that enable young people to build on their strengths to pursue rewarding learning or work opportunities; \r\nHORIZONS - competences that enable young people to visualise, plan and achieve their career aspirations; \r\nNETWORKS - competences that enable young people to develop networks of support.\r\n\r\n- develop a bespoke curriculum of mini-learning format resources for young people that support the acquisition of high-value labour market oriented skills. \r\nCOMMUNICATION - building the skills to be an effective communicator and developing an understanding of different communication styles; \r\nTEAMWORK - building the capacity to combine individual skills in pursuit of a common goal by helping, persuading, sharing, being flexible, and showing commitment; \r\nPROBLEM SOLVING - building the skills to effectively define a problem; determine the cause; identify, prioritize, select and implement a solution; \r\nLEADERSHIP - building the skills to be an effective leader able to motivate and inspire those around you.\r\n\r\n- develop a comprehensive range of self-help resources to support young people to effectively manage stress in the workplace. These resources will address a number of critical work-related stress areas such as:\r\nKNOWING WHAT IS IMPORTANT - important techniques that can help young people to prioritize their workload;\r\nLESS ANGER; LESS STRESS - anger is a stress emotion young people can do without and learning how to control the expression of anger is an important skill;\r\nBEING ORGANIZED - feeling a sense of control over your environment and knowing how to spend your time for the best results;\r\nSUPPORT SYSTEMS - 'no man is an island' and it is essential that young people surround themselves with individuals they can trust and relate to\r\n\r\nUNWIND partners will also develop an induction programme for front-line trainers supporting young workers and an online learning environment that will function on a full range of fixed and mobile technology platforms.

The guiding principle is to challenge the misconception that citizenship within Europe threatens our sense of national identities hence confronting negative perceptions of Europe often advocated in the media and to offer an alternative to an isolationist paradigm of nationhood. \r\n\r\nThe project seeks to promote the benefits of closer integration with our European neighbours and peers and to highlight the life-long economic, cultural, educational and social benefits that young people can expect to receive as a result of being a part of Europe  as well as to encourage entrepreneurship amongst our students by developing innovative approaches to communication technologies.
