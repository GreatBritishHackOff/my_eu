Art in public space is a developing discipline which mixes performance, visual and digital arts, creators and local people, artists and audience.

A two-week course at Norwich Study Centre \u2013 Flying Classrooms will strengthen their language abilities and reduce learning deficits in order to prepare them for the demands of the European labour market. \r\n\r\nOur trainees at the CJD Berchtesgaden are part of a rehabilitation program for chronically ill young people. Because of their severe illnesses (among them asthma, severe allergies, diabetes, adiposis, and mucoviszidosis in combination with comorbitidies such as non-compliance and psychological illnesses), as well as their difficult educational biographies, they are unable to participate in individual programs or internships abroad. They need a safe and carefully structured mobility-project that takes into account their special needs. \r\n\r\nA good command of English, intercultural understanding, as well as international work experiences are essential nowadays, especially in our students\u2019 field of work (such as hospitality, sales and administration).

The program is tailor-made to meet the individual needs of students and staff: language training and specialist, work-related English for the students, general and specialist English, as well as teaching methods, for our staff. Our groups will be accompanied by medical staff to ensure well-being and stability. \r\n\r\nThe added-value of our program will be specific work-related modules: company visits on two afternoons will allow the participants insights into their field of work in Britain. Another visit to a vocational college will bring exchange opportunities with vocational students and teachers, and a better understanding of vocational training in the UK. Our teaching staff will also benefit from this program - they will be able to form international partnerships and boost their teaching methods and English skills. \r\n\r\nThe CJD Berchtesgaden lies in a remote mountainous region in the very south of Germany.
