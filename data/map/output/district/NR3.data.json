It will be achieved by means of powerful planning algorithms and integration in a liveable environment of big data related to public transport, carpooling and crowdsourcing in order to provide the final user with a simplified travel experience allowing comparison and choice between multiple options/services.\nSocialCar will take advantage Social Media to communicate, share information and  provide the best just-in-time notifications to the travellers.\nSocialCar will  take advantage of the ever growing connectivity of people and objects and the propagation of Internet services, the potential of Future Internet and the availability of GNSS based location and social media to create an integrated mobility service with the potential to sensibly reduce mobility problems of European citizens.\nSocialCar will capitalise on a strong pan European team with a solid background in social, psychological and economic sciences, the involvement of 10 European urban sites will prove the concepts' validity and business case. \n\nSocialCar General Objectives are to: \n\u2022 contribute to the EU2020 targets on energy efficiency and renewable energy sources reducing congestion by improving and maximising connectivity and information in real-time \n\u2022 overcoming the limitations of current carpooling practices moving from long trips to effective urban and peri-urban use\n\u2022 validate green driving support systems, active management based on European GNSS\n\u2022 identify a suitable big data management architecture for integrating mobility data\n\u2022 produce a city-based open integrated mobility repository of public transport and traffic city-based data", 173031.0, 4897791.0, "SocialCar", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_193402_951623933"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1HF", "IN SITU ACT", "AUGUSTINE STEWARD LIMITED", 1692524.0, "Art Context  TerritoryThe IN SITU ACT project is a tool for structuring artistic creation in public space across Europe. Art in public space is a developing discipline which mixes performance, visual and digital arts, creators and local people, artists and audience. It is an artform built around sharing, where involvement is part of the creative act; a contemporary, contextual artform for a broad audience; a European artform that is increasingly in demand on other continents.Ambition Creativity Transnationality IN SITU ACT has four objectives, based on a shared diagnosis that sees transnational mobility as a need and a strategic response during a period of major upheavals: - Promote artworks which operate with, in and for public spaces.- Test and implement a European model for integrated artistic support, involving artists, producers and the public in the creative process.- Develop an ecology of creation that connects artistic works with the economic, political and social realities in Europe.- Pool our skills and resources and bring together those who locally influence and drive change in public space.Action Cooperation TransmissionSeveral concrete actions are to be implemented:- A collaborative process for supporting artists:  project development seminars, collective mentoring, adaptation residencies, support for mobility and public presentations.- Pilot projects, prototypes for shared creation between authors, organisers and public.- Training modules for young professionals.- Consultancy services for European cities and Capitals of Culture.- \u201dSatellite\u201d partners in non-European countries.- European think-tank bringing together key influencers in urban and territorial development.This is an ACT that will engage thousands of citizens in works presented to a million spectators.This is an ACT to develop a \u201ccloud\u201d model, a horizontal, participatory and sustainable network, drawing on the experience, durability and breadth of the existing partnership", "http://www.nnfestival.org.uk", null, "creative_570563-CREA-1-2016-1-FR-CULT-COOP2_4"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NR3"}
