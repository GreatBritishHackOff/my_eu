Industrial wastewater, contaminated by heavy metals,  migrates to surface and underground water sources. Heavy metals are elements that have a high density and are toxic or poisonous even at low concentrations. In addition to wastewater, sewer sludge, the residual semi-solid material remaining from urban and industrial wastewater treatment processes, also contains high levels of heavy metals. Consortium members of the current METELCAD project recognize that with the advent of increasing environmental EC Directives, there is a critical need in Europe to develop a low cost, and efficient detection technology for metal contaminated wastewater to safeguard public health and reduce pollution and clean up costs. METELCAD will allow consortium SMEs to detect heavy metal presence in industrial wastewater before it is released into the environment or before it reaches the sludge stage. The commercial objective of the proposal is to develop an on-line, low maintenance, on-site, continuous monitoring technology utilizing electrolyte cathode glow discharge technique to monitor heavy metal contaminated wastewaters that are loaded with high fat emulsion. This cost-effective technology will facilitate compliance with EU environmental legislation in a business-friendly manner, facilitating industrial wastewater management. The proposed technology is also relevant to other industrial sectors including ferrous and non-ferrous metals industry.", 181789.0, 1217978.0, "METELCAD", null, null, null, "http://www.metelcad.eu", "http://www.permastore.com", null, "fp7_99391_998529059"], ["7HS", "Farm and Agriculture Stabilised Thermophilic Anaerobic Digestion", "Permastore Limited", "EU farmers face significant costs related to the management and disposal of on-farm organic waste arisings such as manures and slurries through having to comply with specific EU legislation such as the Nitrates Directive and the Landfill Directive. Rising waste disposal costs have been cited as a contributing factor to the estimated closure of 7,000 EU farms per annum. Our consortium consists of five SMEs who manufacture and supply a range of equipment for anaerobic digestion (AD) systems in agricultural, wastewater treatment and municipal waste management markets. Whilst AD-based markets are growing and are expected to continue to grow over the next 5 years and beyond, they are dominated by larger enterprises - eight companies provide 80% of the municipal solid waste market in the EU - which makes competition on a cost basis difficult. Existing technologies for the anaerobic digestion of agricultural waste at the farm-scale are based on mesophilic processes and have a number of associated limitations, such as the requirement for codigestion with a high percentage of energy crops, a high capital equipment cost and a long payback period. The Smart-Tank project will develop a reliable thermophilic AD system with closed-loop control that will give us a clear technology differentiated product and offer the following benefits to farmers: \u2022 Standalone operation. \u2022 Demonstrate minimum biogas production levels of 90m3 per tonne feedstock from codigestion with a minimum manure or slurry content of 60%. \u2022 Have a payback period of less than 6 years. The development of the Smart-Tank system will allow our SME consortium to compete in the growing market in Germany, France and the UK for agricultural AD technology and the estimated \u20ac2.13Bn EU market for the AD of municipal solid waste.", 202315.0, 855641.0, "SMART TANK", "New anaerobic digester for farm waste", "Scientists have developed a new generation of biomass digesters that are cheaper to produce than currently available models and that can operate autonomously. The digesters make use of heat-loving, or thermophilic, microorganisms.", "Waste disposal costs for farms in the EU are steadily rising due to tighter legislation, contributing somewhat to the 7\u00a0000 annual farm closures experienced recently. Anaerobic digesters (ADs) offer an attractive way to save on some of these costs, but currently require input of high-energy crop waste.\n\nFunded by the EU, the 'Farm and agriculture stabilised thermophilic anaerobic digestion' (http://www.smart-tank.eu (SMART TANK)) initiative was established to develop an autonomous thermophilic digester that uses a minimum of 60\u00a0% manure or slurry. SMART TANK also aimed to design the digester in such a way that it would pay itself off (through waste disposal savings) in less than six years.\n\nThe project reviewed the legislation and literature around thermophilic ADs, and studied the effects of various conditions on metabolic rates of the bacteria in these digesters. Sensors and actuators that could be used to monitor and control these conditions were identified.\n\nAfter completing the design specifications, SMART TANK built a mobile prototype in a shipping container, which functioned as expected during testing at several farms. Since then, a permanent prototype has been installed for testing and process optimisation on a farm in Germany.\n\nThis prototype has already provided researchers with a better understanding of how to control the process of anaerobic digestion more effectively. The lessons learnt will be applied to the design and construction of a final commercial model.", "http://www.smart-tank.eu", "http://www.permastore.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20141124132317.jpg", "fp7_96926_998529059"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8DP", "Modes d'ORGANisation des pratiques AICL (apprentissages int\u00e9gr\u00e9s de contenu et de langue)", "MELLIS CHURCH OF ENGLAND VOLUNTARY CONTROLLED PRIMARY SCHOOL", 93044.0, "The MORGAN project: ways of ORGANIZATION of the CLIL practices   is a project arisen from meetings and from previous collaborations established at bilateral levels between France, Belgium and United Kingdom.
