Its low cost, light weight and small size will enable flexibility in the design of hot water systems minimising cost and energy consumption. Furthermore, zero heat loss will be produced from our RapidHeat technology which goes beyond standards set by the EuP directive.", 297891.0, 1119178.0, "RAPIDHEAT", "Next-generation electrical water heaters", "Electrical water heaters continue to grow in popularity among consumers, but the conventional types consume energy. An EU initiative is developing a cost- and energy-efficient alternative.", "Up until 2020, estimates show that about nine million water heaters will be installed yearly in new buildings. One million of those will be instantaneous electrical water heaters \u2013 models that combine a heating element through which hot water is produced on demand. Traditional units that provide hot water take time to reach preferred temperatures, thus wasting water and energy.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.rapidheat.eu/ (RAPIDHEAT) (The development of a high power density rapid response on demand water heating technology) project is working on a water heater for flexible and rapid response to hot water demand that will use new technologies for its heating element and controls. There will be no standing heat losses incurred with the innovative technology, saving both energy and money while improving overall efficiency.\n\nDuring the first reporting period, innovation workshops were held to identify the core technology's technical applications. This helped determine potential end users, who were then evaluated to establish the future product's target market and commercial potential and viability.\n\nWork has begun on key components such as the heating element, insulation layers and primary outer casing, and secondary ones like the control system, safe electrical connection and overall system packaging. The core components have already been modelled.\n\nFollowing materials assessment, the graphite element, aluminium nitrate plates and silicon carbide adhesive were identified as the most appropriate combination. The three materials were characterised and then measured, modified and tested in whole or in part.\n\nA prototype of an on-demand electric water heater has been tested in field trials. It may not be long before smaller, lighter and lower-cost RAPIDHEAT products are seen in commercial, industrial and public buildings.
