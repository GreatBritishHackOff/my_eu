Its low cost, light weight and small size will enable flexibility in the design of hot water systems minimising cost and energy consumption. Furthermore, zero heat loss will be produced from our RapidHeat technology which goes beyond standards set by the EuP directive.", 297891.0, 1119178.0, "RAPIDHEAT", "Next-generation electrical water heaters", "Electrical water heaters continue to grow in popularity among consumers, but the conventional types consume energy. An EU initiative is developing a cost- and energy-efficient alternative.", "Up until 2020, estimates show that about nine million water heaters will be installed yearly in new buildings. One million of those will be instantaneous electrical water heaters \u2013 models that combine a heating element through which hot water is produced on demand. Traditional units that provide hot water take time to reach preferred temperatures, thus wasting water and energy.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.rapidheat.eu/ (RAPIDHEAT) (The development of a high power density rapid response on demand water heating technology) project is working on a water heater for flexible and rapid response to hot water demand that will use new technologies for its heating element and controls. There will be no standing heat losses incurred with the innovative technology, saving both energy and money while improving overall efficiency.\n\nDuring the first reporting period, innovation workshops were held to identify the core technology's technical applications. This helped determine potential end users, who were then evaluated to establish the future product's target market and commercial potential and viability.\n\nWork has begun on key components such as the heating element, insulation layers and primary outer casing, and secondary ones like the control system, safe electrical connection and overall system packaging. The core components have already been modelled.\n\nFollowing materials assessment, the graphite element, aluminium nitrate plates and silicon carbide adhesive were identified as the most appropriate combination. The three materials were characterised and then measured, modified and tested in whole or in part.\n\nA prototype of an on-demand electric water heater has been tested in field trials. It may not be long before smaller, lighter and lower-cost RAPIDHEAT products are seen in commercial, industrial and public buildings.

It was found necessary to improve the following areas: the inclusion of children from different cultural backgrounds in the educational process and the development of their national identity, development of teachers\u2019 and pupils' ICT skills and improving the quality of education through creativity and  internationalisation.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to promote citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination, as well as enhance the quality of education and internationalization, enable the school staff to raise their professional qualifications, to improve the educational process, integrating the skills acquired through mobility, and to expand the opportunities for European cooperation in order to modernize and internationalise the curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe project mobilities will involve 13 teachers who specialize in different areas of the curriculum and who work with different age groups from our youngest children in Nursery to our oldest children in Year 6.  Each teacher has a specific area of responsibility within the school as well as personal areas of interest.  Literacy, Maths, Science, History, STEAM (including Art and Design and Technology), Music, ICT and Religious Education are all subjects led by the individuals concerned.\r\n\r\nThe main activities involve targeted courses in Lithuania, Iceland, Barcelona and France (Guadeloupe). The courses are managed by a number of providers who all have their courses registered on the School Education Gateway website:\r\nNGO Kaunus Biennial - Mosaic of Communication, A Classroom with a Door on the World, Hidden in the Open Space\r\nPrimera Group - Teaching creativity in schools, inspired by Edward de Bono\r\nITC International - Encouraging Creative Thinking\r\n\r\nThe project methodology responds to our school's strategic and European development plan - in all phases of the project participants will focus on meeting the objectives and applying their knowledge in their work, enabling positive changes in the school: innovation of the curriculum, methodology and ICT.  At the preparation stage, the participants will focus on the cooperation with other colleagues abroad and develop their ICT skills through their use of the eTwinning TwinSpace. During the courses, participants will focus on the target competencies, knowledge and skills, while the follow up will uptake reflection, improvement and dissemination of good practices.\r\n\r\nProject management is focused on quality - with clear procedures: supporting participants during the preparation process, engaging eTwinning program tools for the smooth execution of the project, providing participants with monitoring techniques and principles, setting clear terms. This will help to ensure the quality of the project in order to achieve envisaged project goals.\r\n\r\nExpected results of the project: the participants will acquire and improve, not only general educational competencies, but also will absorb the various inclusive approaches actively engaging children from different cultural backgrounds in the educational process, develop their computer literacy, will gain a broader and inclusive understanding of education programs in the European context, acquire knowledge and the ability to plan and carry out international projects, improve communication and collaboration skills working with international partners, and improve their foreign language skills.\r\n\r\nThe long-term effects and benefits: It is expected that the thirteen teachers who attend the courses will have a significant impact on the experience of all the employees - using new methods, changing the learning environment, developing an inclusive curriculum - significantly will improve the quality of education in our school. We hope that the participants will become more open to change, the modernization of the educational process and internationalisation of school curriculum and will be willing to share their knowledge and disseminate best practices in the school, the city and in the country.", "http://mayflower.j2webby.com", "Mayflower Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036229_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LE5"}
