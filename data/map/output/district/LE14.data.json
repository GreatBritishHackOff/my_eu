Beside human losses, these incidents cost SMEs time and the availability of specific human expertise which directly translates into money and competitiveness.\n\nMoreover, to reduce time to market, shorter decision times and high speed productivity are demanded, and this might potentially lead to more risks for safety and health. On the other hand, and although occupational safety and health (OSH) regulations are obligatory and enforced by legal authorities, SMEs have limited resources in time, money and personnel, so it tends to be not regarded as a priority.\n\nTherefore, it seems necessary to stimulate awareness and to provide European SMEs with modern and user-friendly tools to support their understanding and compliance of OSH regulations. The IMOSHION project will establish novel methods to enhance SMEs productivity at both organisational and technological levels through better integration of OSH into their daily workflow. The project is targeting all manufacturing sectors (e.g. construction, machine building, metal working, aerospace, food industry) for which OSH concerns are the most challenging.\n\nInitial work will be carried out to elicit the technological requirements of SMEs by providing the RTD performers with a further definition of the tools to be developed. The RTD performers in collaboration with the SME associations will develop the set of OSH-related tools of the IMOSHION project. This will include (a) an OSH knowledge and learning management system, (b) a workplace simulation for experimenting and training on OSH issues, (c) an immersive training and learning tool for OSH procedures, and (d) a planning tool for OSH prevention at workstation and workplace levels. The SME associations will support validation, training as well as dissemination activities to transfer the project results to their SME members and beyond.", null, 2414868.0, "IMOSHION", "Tech innovations for safety", "This initiative addressed the fast pace of contemporary occupational safety and health (OSH) goals. European enterprises, both small and medium-sized (SMEs), can better understand and comply with OSH regulations using newly developed technology.", "Providing low-cost and easy-to-use tools that help address OSH concerns in EU manufacturing sectors was the main goal of this project. The project 'Improving occupational safety & health in European SMEs with help of simulation and virtual reality' (http://www.imoshion.eu/ (IMOSHION)) set out four main objectives.\n\nWorking groups were an important project aspect, providing real-life feedback on the tools in development. Workshops in Bulgaria, Germany and Spain were organised by SME associations taking part in the project.\n\nResearch work focused on development of the tools, with initial activities dedicated to technical specifications of the IMOSHION tool set and the data exchange format. For tool\u00a0A, Moodle is the necessary open source knowledge management system used and provides the learning management system facility. There is an option for the use of an open source tool, Xerte, to compile additional SCORM-compliant interactive learning objects that can be embedded into Moodle. Tool\u00a0A was demonstrated during the final consortium meeting.\n\nWith Unity3D selected to support tool\u00a0B, a new module was developed after first demonstrations where SMEs raised concerns about applying the tool on their building. The new module, called Factory Creator, allows end users to mock-up their building. Based on feedback, the Workplace Editor and Scenario Editor were merged into one editor, and scenarios of fire and smoke emergencies plus explosions were implemented.\n\nTool\u00a0C is made up of two primary components \u2014 the training session composition tool and the virtual reality session player \u2014 that were refined and enhanced. Specifically, the training session composition tool, a plugin to SketchUp, was developed, which implements a behaviour model concept for 3D objects. For the second component, the virtual reality session player, Unity3D was enhanced to be able to load the scenario models modelled in SketchUp and display them in stereo 3D on a 3D TV set.\n\nTool\u00a0D created a standardised operating procedure for evaluating current and new procedures. The reporting of the hazards and risks on two levels \u2014 process step level and function level \u2014 was a new development in the evaluation process.\n\nFinally, a model to integrate the various tools was discussed and defined. The main idea is that tool\u00a0A forms the basis of all tool applications. From tool\u00a0A, the other tools can be launched and then the outcomes (reports, drawings and databases) are saved in tool\u00a0A. Integration of the tools and the methodology to develop 3D working environments continues.\n\nThe outcomes of this project will raise awareness and know-how for better application of OSH regulations, translating to enhanced worker safety and improved SME productivity and competitiveness.

They play a key role in achieving sustainable food production and optimising the use of agricultural resources. This proposal explores the properties of AMIXTM technology in producing inherently healthy plants and simultaneously enhancing the activity of tank-mixed pesticides, facilitating reduced application rates; addressing the call \u2018SFS-8-2015\u2019.\nThe pressure to increase food production is a global phenomenon, caused primarily by increasing world population and climate change. Cereals in particular are in high demand for both food and animal feed purposes. By 2050, when the world population is estimated to reach 9 billion individuals, cereal production is projected to represent 3 billion tons per year. In particular, this challenge affects the EU\u2019s ability to remain competitive and assure its food security, and makes food less affordable for the population. The largest cereal producers - France, Germany, Poland and the UK, add up to 160 million tonnes per year; at least 50% is estimated to be subject to loss of productivity due to the limitations imposed by both current and impending pesticide regulation. AMIXTM uniquely promotes the active uptake of nutrients (as opposed to passive absorption) together with tank-mixed pesticides at the leaf surface. It offers significant and easily measurable nutrient efficiency, consistent yield benefits even in the absence of a detectable nutrient deficiency, with uptake and translocation benefits over other formulation types. AMIXTM can: (i) reduce the amount of pesticide required; extend the effect of the pesticide, increase the effectiveness of less efficient or older generations of pesticides formulations.\nThis business opportunity can support Micromix\u2019s strategy of growing its turnover by a factor of 3, reaching a annual sales volume of 50,000 units (\u20ac11 million) by 2018, adding over 30 extra highskilled jobs.", 35835.0, 51194.0, "MICROMIX-ECO-2015", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_197569_934962922"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LE14"}
