The proposed process is based on the cascade combination of three catalytic transformations: catalytic pyrolysis, intermediate deoxygenation and hydrodeoxygenation. The sequential coupling of catalytic steps will be an essential factor for achieving a progressive and controlled biomass deoxygenation, which is expected to lead to liquid biofuels with a chemical composition and properties similar to those of oil-derived fuels. According to this strategy, the best nanocatalytic system in each step will be selected to deal with the remarkable chemical complexity of lignocellulose pyrolysis products, as well as to optimize the bio-oil yield and properties. Since hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is outlined in this scheme as the ultimate deoxygenation treatment, the overall hydrogen consumption should be strongly minimized, resulting in a significant improvement of the process economic profitability. The use of nanostructured catalysts will be the key tool for obtaining in each chemical step of the cascade process, the optimum deoxygenation degree, as well as high efficiency, in terms both of matter and energy, minimizing at the same time the possible environmental impacts. The project will involve experiments at laboratory, bench and pilot plant scales, as well as a viability study of its possible commercial application.

Moreover, the ACs can be tuned according to requirements with varying porosities and pore size distributions.

This chronic non-communicable disease is increasing at an alarming rate due to increasing European obesity, alcohol use and ageing. The three main causes of the disease; alcohol, fatty liver and viral hepatitis are amenable to prevention and treatment. Gut-derived endotoxins and bacterial translocation are central factors implicated in the pathogenesis of fatty liver disease and, the development and progression of cirrhosis. In cirrhosis, current state-of-the-art therapy to prevent recurrent complications of advanced cirrhosis is to use poorly absorbed antibiotics but long-term antibiotic therapy has problems associated with bacterial resistance, infection with resistant organisms and the cost. Treatment of fatty liver and modulation of bacterial translocation in early cirrhosis to prevent complications is an unmet need. Our academic-industrial consortium has developed a novel, patented, safe and cheap nanoporous carbon that modulates the effects of bacterial translocation in animal models of liver disease. Our feasibility studies demonstrate that this product advances the current state-of-the-art, is a TRL 4/5 and is now ready for validation through clinical trials. We propose to investigate the safety and efficacy of this novel nanoporous carbon in patients with fatty liver disease and cirrhosis. If successful, we will be able to confirm an innovative, cost-effective and novel strategy for the management of this chronic disease in a European population.

Our school has the task and mission to develop an intercultural teaching practice supported by innovative methods and entrepreneurship to achieve a more entrepreneurial learning for the benefits of our students. For some years now, we have run a number of international projects to develop our school and the training provided, and our experience is that it is a successful means to foster an international spirit to help make young people mobile and apt to actively seek a career or education in other European countries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe method to obtain the targets is to enable our teachers and students to develop their own learning as well as the learning of others through a greater intercultural understanding, improved lingusitic skills, stonger professional skills and an enhanced self-esteem. The international perspective provided by the project makes it possible to view oneself from a European perspective, which helps the individual to (also) take the step to work and live elsewhere in Europe. The participant teachers learn new methods to develop their teaching to make a greater number of students succeed in their learning. Thereby, our teaching staff help increase the students'  employability all over Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe add to our vocational students' opportunities by making them more attractive in their future work fields by making them develop entrepreneurial skills, their professional special skills as well as their cultural know-how and understanding.  We do this by developing the entrepreneurial learning by  focusing on ICT pedagogy, collaboration between education and enterprises (big and small in various fields of work), increased student influence and tutoring/mentoring as well as by by adding to their linguistic competences and sense of democarcy as a result of inclusion in an international environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this stage, sixteen of our teachers in vocational training will perform work shadowing and study how teachers in carefully chosen schools work with a strong development in the chosen fields of interest.  Our partners for work shadowing are Newton Abbot College, Tavistock College and South Devon College. In addition, a great number of our vocational students, 146 to be precise, will do work experience with numerous organisations and enterprises in England, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Poland. All organisations to be receiving partners have had vocational students from us in previous projects, which ensures that they will take on our students in the very best way and provide them with supervision, relevant work as well as plan, carry our and assess to what degree the learning outcomes have been reached in the time of work placement. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participants will be selected upon submission of an application, and they will then prepare for the time abroad linguistically and culturally.

The group is in charge of and responsible for selecting participants, communicating with partners, establishing various agreements/contracts, practicalities such as bookings, economy, evaluation and dissemination of the project results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy partaking in this project, we expect of participating teachers to develop their teaching practice to a more entrepreneurially featured kind that supplies the students with tools to succeed in their field of training.

Within this project we would like to combine/unite several partners/countries. The project and the training will be part of the pupils' thesis. They will choose a subject about which they do research during their training.  If possible, the training places will be chosen according to specific features of a country (eg. moose and forestry in Sweden, ICT in big hotels in Prague, veterinaries in the UK...). Our network is varied and cross-sectoral. All our partners have expressed full engagement and willingness to participate.\r\n\r\nThe aims of the project are:\r\n-to let our pupils gain a real and stimulating on-the-job experience, to let them find out how company cultures might differ, which tools and methods are being used on the working floor in other European countries, to let them gain expertise and to help them to grow towards becoming skilled young professionals.\r\n-to increase our pupils' language and intercultural knowledge\r\n-to help our pupils become responsible European civilians, who realize what the significance of 'Europe' can be in everyone's life\r\n-to increase our pupils' tolerance, cross-cultural awareness, social skills and problem-solving capabilities\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting for pupils to make a comparison between the different countries. Depending on the topic, they can help each other to collect information (pictures, brochures, oral explanations...). Secondly, by working in a foreign country, they will learn new working methods, competences and approaches. They can apply their usual activities in a completely new situation and find out what the differences are and also the pros and cons.\r\nFinally, but even more importantly, the pupils also live in the host country for a couple of weeks. This gives them a unique insight in life in another European country. This also needs to be described in their training report/thesis.\r\nBeing submerged in a foreign country, motivates pupils to communicate in a foreign language and also to make their own decisions and take initiative. Intensive preparation for a few months prior to the training will help them to deal with this more easily. \r\n\r\nFinally we look at our pupils' future: increasing employment for our pupils and involving them more and more in the present day Europe. Besides all the experiences and valuable encounters, this training will have a 'comparative advantage' for the future of our technical and vocational pupils, both for their personal development and the chances they will get on the labour market. The expansion of the EU nowadays has triggered an expansion in the labour market. A training abroad gives our pupils an opportunity to learn about their strengths and weaknesses, and it will make an impression on their future employers. It shows that also secondary pupils are able to take risks, show entrepreneurship, have the ability to adapt and be flexible in many ways.\r\n\r\nBesides, teachers will follow a training in the companies that accept pupils as trainees. They will:\r\n- go on job shadowing en do some observations;\r\n- look for probable new partner companies;\r\n- make cross-sectoral contacts with local actors to expand our network;\r\n- follow an in-house training in one of our partner companies;\r\n- take part in in-house workshops.", "http://www.endolite.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-BE02-KA102-012210_9"], ["4AH", "Training In Progress LED reloaded", "CHAS A BLATCHFORD AND SONS LIMITED", 185750.0, "KOGEKA school group organizes mobilities within the TIP LED Reloaded project for pupils and teachers, because our extended experience has taught us that these international experiences create a massive added value, and this in the field of personal as well as professional development of our pupils and staff.\r\n\r\nOverview of activities and developments\r\nPupils mobilities:\r\n-Internships abroad, in a company, institution or organization which closely matches the field of study and interests or fascination of the participants.\r\n-Working in an environment in which the pupils kan apply known (studied during their education) techniques in an unknown, new situation (the singularity or uniqueness of the hosting country) and this in an environment in which there appropriate support is available.\r\n-Living in another European country, being open to and actively participating in daily life (via host families, well-prepared cultural and social weekend programmes,...).\r\n- Having access to a wide variety of information sources in the host country, in order to collect as much information as possible.

In short: an exchange of best practices, e.g. in animal health, orthopedics, techniques.., with as most important outcomes: increased competence in the respective professional fields, thanks to carefully selected internship partners and mentors, better social skills because of the period spent together in a new environment and another culture, and cultural and social enrichment by actively participating in the cultural and social life during free moments and during the weekends.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we have strongly embedded our 'LED learning' dimension in our international internships with LED standing for: 'Levensecht, Eigentijds en Duurzaam leren', or: Lifelike/True to real life, contemporary and sustainable learning. We hold these three components dear in our school group. The European internships challenge our pupils and staff to, in team, think and work in a cross-cultural context. Doing so, pupils and staff discover and use new techniques and the most modern tools. They learn how to communicate efficiently and in a (media) responsible way.\r\n\r\nConcrete, within our internationalization strategy, we actively continue working on an increase in the number of departments and fields of study that get access to European internships (e.g. within the food department: confectioner/pastry baker-chocolate making & processing, pastry & caterer; and within the people care department: social and technical sciences), a further increase in the number of mobilities, combined with a further strengthening of our qualitatively high internship network, an increased accessibility and democratization for all motivated potential participants.\r\n\r\nAccompanying persons\r\nBecause the pupils in traineeship are of minor age, the Swedish and Aruban partners demand the pupils to be accompanied by a teacher of KOGEKA.
