Eradication programmes based on a test-and-slaughter policy in the EU have proved successful in some countries, however, have been unable to eradicate the infection in others despite the use of vast economical resources. A relevant problem is the existence of infected wildlife; the best known examples are the European badger (Meles meles) in UK and the Republic of Ireland, and the wild boar (Sus scrofa) in Spain. Besides this fact, there is only a limited knowledge about other potential underlying causes, such as (1) the real contribution of cattle-to-cattle transmission at the same area (neighbouring farms and communal pastures) or after movement of animals; (2) the role played in the epidemiology by other domestic animals, or (3) the effect of interferences in the diagnosis tests.

These tools are designed to be applicable under commercial conditions at the end of the project. They will allow increased use of the genomic diversity in cattle breeds, e.g. use of selective cross-breeding to best exploit the local production environment. They will also allow farm managers, their advisors, and policy-makers, to assess the relative importance of breeding for animal resilience vs breeding for efficiency, with respect to system resilience.

ARCH programmes have seen over 1,000 learners from a wide range of government and non-governmental organisations within Scotland visit a variety countries within Europe to learn about the different ways in which new skills and competencies in nature conservation and cultural heritage interpretation can be delivered.  \r\nNature Exchange Two (NET) aims to provide adult learner participants with a focused, ready-made opportunity to take time out from their every-day work to learn about how conservation, education and interpretation work is undertaken elsewhere in Europe and give them an opportunity to consider new ways of working.  \r\nNET  will collaborate with partners throughout Europe from Iceland and Norway in the north to Cyprus and Bulgaria in the south. The aim is to develop knowledge exchange trips (typically of 8-10 days) that focus on the management of our natural and cultural heritage.  NET is developed around the priority areas of work within natural and cultural heritage, conservation interpretation and education in Scotland today.  Each training visit will be associated with a broad theme, which will provide a focus for activities through the week.  Emphasis will be placed on exchange of knowledge, ideas, issues and solutions between the participants and hosts. Informal talks by participants on their work in Scotland and challenges they face, as well as talks from the hosts, encouraging focused discussion on how both participants and hosts can benefit from each other\u2019s knowledge and experiences and how they can  build this into ongoing adult education courses.  \r\nAs in previous years, we will work with our partners to develop adult education training placements, which focus on new skills and knowledge and have the capacity for the exchange of best practice that fits with participants needs. For example in Germany the programme will focus on the wildcat and on preserving and managing its habitat, In Iceland the focus will be interpretive techniques for understanding and conserving the cultural landscape, including the traditional skills of turf building. In Finland and Slovakia the programme theme is forest schools and environmental education.  In Norway the themes are large mammal management, fishery management, predator control and balancing hunting and conservation interests.\r\nOur partners all  share our aim of providing high quality and innovative vocational training.  Receiving partners have been chosen because they are recognised by the UK consortium as being able to provide examples of best practice in the key areas identified as most important for our Scottish practitioners to learn.

Since 2004, this project has consecutively been the twelfth to be carried out and coordinated by the regional federation and is the most important further to a voluntarist policy to promote the european mobility that has been implemented for over ten years. In a context where the inward-looking attitude keeps increasing, the opening onto the world and towards others, interculturality, the strengthening of the professional, linguistic and personal skills constitute the aims of this project.\r\nAlthough every MFR has specifically defined its own aims, common objectives were upstream determined by the steering committee. They concern:\r\n-Significant improvements in language learning.\r\n-The strengthening of integration and adaptation capacities thanks to immersion work in a professional environment.\r\n-The development of professional skills specific to the enterprise, to the professional system of reference through carrying out activities determined beforehand by the partners.\r\n-The discovery of a country of the European Union and its culture.\r\n-The accession to autonomy and self-confidence, the capacity to take care of oneself and the development of adaptability.\r\n-Education in the opening-up to the world and towards others. Far from being innate, openness towards others requires a daily education that reaches its climax during the stay. Young people have a lot of prejudice, their judgment towards foreigners is often negative. Experience in immersion and meetings constitute an excellent means to perceive otherness that, despite differences, reveals more convergence and common grounds.\r\nThe ambition of this project is to enable 351 students in vocational or technical high school to enjoy a three-week stay in a European country selected by their MFR. They are in fifth, sixth or final year of high school with the following options: Services to people and territories, Business studies, Horticultural production, technicians , sale in pet shop, management, administration, landscaping, farm management. They are between 16 and 20 years old, most of them coming from a rural background, they think of living and working in a rural environment. They have little or no experience of mobility abroad, consequently we are convinced that this stay will benefit them and their future employability. In the sectors: Service and Business, the proportion of female students is very important, it is the opposite in the other sectors.\r\nIn methodological terms, project activities are managed by the promoter and the MFR involved and distributed between them. The promoter is in charge of promotion, of administrative and financial management, of the follow-up and technical support, of the quality control of the project and its dissemination. The steering committee made up of the 3 official representatives appointed by the promoter, of the director of the MFR regional federation ,of the directors of every MFR and the technical committee made up of the 3 representatives and of every project leader, plan and supervise all project stages. To do that, numerous meetings are planned.\r\nThen, after appointing a project leader,  every  MFR involved is responsible for preparing, informing students and their families, organizing the  stays,  for the follow-up and on-the-spot support, for determining training course work and the restitution work required, for the exploitation and valuation of the acquired skills and for the dissemination of the results. All this should be achieved in accordance with the schedule of conditions determined by the promoter and the steering committee.\r\nIn the short or middle term, the results and impacts expected concern the widening of the beneficiaries\u2019 professional skills, improvement in linguistic understanding, above all orally, the awareness of the necessity to practise  another language than theirs so as to be able to exchange and communicate in any circumstances, personal development, a synonym of self- confidence and autonomy.\r\nIn the long term, the aim is the opening onto Europe, the awareness that we are all European citizens with rights and duties as well, the desire to travel and grow rich of the interculturality that ennobles every individual.

They will be invited and guided to express their opinions in a creative way about complex, intricate, non-manichaean issues.The project will be composed of 5 types of activities :- During recruitment and preparation (from September to November), the young people will be invited to think about and express what is important in an artistic piece of art for them, how one can relay a message, an emotion. They will get an opportunity to foster their curiosity, to question themselves and to start expressing their ideas while analysing the way they communicate. - During the exchange itself, they will discover innovative, striking, surprising artistic presentations (at least 4 pieces of living arts and 1 exhibition) at the occasion of the international, metropolitan and cross-border festival NEXT. The shows will be chosen especially for their ability to be a support for discussion, because they are audacious, sometimes provocative and very often leave the audience divided in opinion.- They will participate to critique workshops (led by 7 professionals artists and critiques from different countries), using writing, image and movement to elaborate critiques, reviews or responses to these shows.

Therefore EUROPEA-Denmark now apply on behalf of the majority of its members for support under the ERASMUS+-program to fund a new version of the activity called \"JORU 2.0\". Lessons learned from the first project are underlying this activity. In JORU 2.0 36 teachers will travel 4-5 days in groups of 2-3 people in 12 European countries .\r\n\r\nSome member schools of EUROPEA-Denmark have been involved in various smaller national and international networks in recent years. Here they have developed and implemented ERASMUS +-supported activities for students in the form of internships for work based learning and schooling abroad. Especially international course modules of 3 weeks is a new offer in the sector, but for a single school on it's own is it difficult to attract enough students to continue operating. The same has proved difficult with a broad offer of internships abroad for students within a smaller network of EUROPEA Denmark's member schools (project \"Local Skills\", 2015-17).

It will be a collective experience which will also permit them to become more autonomous, confident and proactive ! We want to make them actors of their own experience !\r\n\r\nThe project will be composed of 5 types of activities :\r\n\r\n- During recruitment and preparation (from May to November), young people will be involved in the organisation of the project.

We want them to be proactive.\r\n\r\n- During the exchange itself, they will discover innovative, striking, surprising artistic presentations at the occasion of the international, metropolitan and cross-border festival NEXT. The shows will be chosen especially for their ability to be a support for discussion, because they are audacious, sometimes provocative and very often leave the audience divided in opinion.\r\n\r\n- They will participate to critique workshops (led by 7 professionals artists and critiques from different countries), using writing, image and movement to elaborate critiques, reviews or responses to these shows. They will affirm their ideas and culture and share them with the others\u2019. This will be a chance to discover new ways of expressing oneself and to acquire new competences. It will offer them artistic tools to enhance their ability to reason, to express their ideas and emotions and to present their arguments (using language, image and body movement). It will therefore strenghten their capacity to communicate with other people.\r\n\r\n- They will also get opportunities to reflect, discuss and debate over what they have seen/lived, to foster their sense of belonging to a same world, despite their differences. They will be encouraged to express their opinions, to produce argumentation and to enrich each other's ideas through dialogue. Those moments will train young people to build analytical minds and therefore, encourage pluralism and prevent one-track thinking.\r\n\r\n- To share and promote their experience, they will take in charge the management of social networks linked to TeeNEXTers such as Facebook, Instagram and SnapChat. Those social networks would be a kind of discussion area, a free space for young people to express their thoughts and permit interactivity. It would be a kind of collective and interactive notebook, diary. They will have to organize themselves, choosing their own community manager (project manager, spokesperson) to take responsibility for words and pictures published and they will have a transmission work to make between groups. It would be a collective learning while remaining autonomous. \r\n\r\n- Finally, we will share the results of the project (that is to say some tools about how one can use artistic practice to express an opinion) with local audiences and professional networks, in order to promote critical thinking with exercises or games than can be used by/with young people.

The host project partners are vocational schools, a forestry training center and a forestry operation in Finland, Austria, Poland, Scotland and Sweden.\r\nFrom 1998 to 2000, the NFBz participated in the pilot project IEFMO, from 2012 to 2014 in the innovation transfer project TOOLS for SKILLS and since 2015 has been involved in the strategic partnership TOOLS for SKILLS - Teacher Training of the Swedish project partner. The NFBz is represented in the NeMo, the Mobility Network of the Lower Saxony Ministry of Education for Vocational Schools and other institutions that carry out mobility projects.\r\nThe results of the project TOOLS for SKILLS, a two-volume English-language textbook for forest machine driver training, an English-language learning platform on the Internet and a multilingual forestry dictionary as a free app for smartphones are used.\r\nThe aim is to increase the quality of learning stays through the use of ECVET as a tool of transparency and quality, thus contributing to improving the training of foresters. In addition to the technical aspects, the project aims to promote the personal development of learners and educational staff. The language competence in the project language English is promoted. This is especially true for a learning stay or training at Barony College, but also for stays in Finland, Sweden and Poland. The social competence as well as the own initiative and the entrepreneurial competence are promoted by the independent organization of the journeys to the partner devices in small groups.\r\nDuring the project period of 24 months, 24 forest forestry apprentices are expected to take part in a 3 or 4-week study stay, either in autumn or winter 2018, in spring and autumn 2019 and in spring 2010. Educational staff should train 26 people in 5 flows, each for 5 to 6 days in the same time periods, to undergo further education and training in one of the partner institutions.

The vocational training staff will work on the program under the direction of an employee of the NFBz together with the colleagues in the partner institutions. The participant agreements, Europass CV and Europass Mobility will be used.\r\nOne result of the project is that all requested places are used by learners and educational staff. In addition to their participant report in the online database, the learners also write a report for their report booklet and make a presentation for their classmates, trainers and colleagues. Participants use these materials for their presentations, which they consider multipliers to be their successors. The educational staff expands their technical, methodological and intercultural competences through the contacts to the colleagues in the partner institutions.\r\nThe attractiveness of the training profession Forstwirt is significantly increased by the learning stays in other European countries. These develop in the long term to a unique feature of the training profession Forstwirt in Lower Saxony.

The consortium is also meant to allow staff members of the vocational schools to get trained at a company or a partner vocational training centre from other EU countries  where they can discover the education systems, other technical or pedagogical approaches and get more confident about  their language skills.

The shared objective to increase mobility in vocational education promoted in the European Commission recommendations is especially meaningful in a region where employment is predominant in the sector of agriculture and rural activities. The aim is to enhance the adaptability and the open-mindedness of the pupils, to reinforce their interest in foreign languages and better understand the evolutions of the Common Agricultural Policy or make them more able to work in the fields of agricultural production and food-processing, environment, agro-tourism and other activities in rural areas, in which  exports and contacts with foreigners tend to become  common practice.
