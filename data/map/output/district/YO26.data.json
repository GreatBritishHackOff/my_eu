The project will mobilise both outgoing (32) and incoming (30) vocational training staff in parallel to 104 level 3 NVQ/diploma students and apprentices (supported by 29 accompanying professionals)\r\nFinishing Strong  is co-ordinated by Everything is Possible and includes three further UK VET training partners in the consortium, Askham Bryan College (a York based college offering landbased, motor vehicle and sports vocational and higher education programmes),  Wigan Warriors under the education programme of Pro-Co NW (a Wigan based training provider offering opportunities in sport study programmes, apprenticeships and work based learning) Liverpool Football Club Foundation (through their training arm SALT education) a training provider specialising in sports vocational education and football. \r\nThis two year project will offer trainees, apprentices and staff placements in the field of Sports Coaching \u2013 with \r\n- Youth in the Town Martinique working in two sports clubs and across high-school and primary school provisions as well as local and national football, rugby and cycling clubs.\r\n- IDEUM in Lapland (northern Sweden) offering winter sports and Sami training and education programmes with local government partners managed under the same subsidiary structure\r\n- AGORA - working with their basketball and football provision and also with Valencia FC to offer access to sports training and work at a professional and amateur level\r\n- Etna finder (Ante srl) offering environmentally sound sports activities and tours up and around Mount Ena in Sicily\r\n\r\nPlacements will host alone or in co-operation with the other partners in their location, depending on the identified learning needs of the participant(s). Trainees experiences will be determined by the course they are studying in the UK and their learning aims identified either through through a mobility passport during preparation of trainees and apprentices. \r\nThirtytwo UK based strategic, management, guidance, teaching/training staff will have the opportunity to undertake job shadowing and training assignments in one of the partner countries, where they will work within the host projects, to inspire them, help them develop new knowledge about the vocational practices of these countries, experience working hands on with them and also share skills they have already developed in their own institution. 30 international VET staff will have the chance to come to the UK to deliver training in UK institutions and inspire staff teams in the UK. 104 trainees/apprentices will be mobilised in small groups supported by 29 accompanying staff who will accompany two week placements for the full duration and longer placements for at least a week.\r\nFinishing Strong contributes to the international plan of all the UK organisations and offers international partners opportunities to internationalise their organisations. All partners will be involved in two direction mobility. The significant results anticipated through this project are, increased co-operation between UK/European VET training providers/colleges/companies, increased awareness of professionals from partner organisations in VET practices in wider Europe, for UK learners with fewer opportunities, and the possibility to increase confidence, life and work experience and employability skills in UK learners in addition to the wealth of vocational sector  knowledge and experience which will be shared amongst trainees, apprentices and staff alike. It is anticipated that this project will contribute towards new and improved teaching methods and raised awareness within the colleges and training providers and an increase in knowledge in the Erasmus+ programme to partners in the UK, Italy, Sweden, Martinique and Spain. It is also anticipated that partners will build on this collaboration to create future collaboration projects, to continue to share and develop good practice in the fields of VET.", "http://www.everythingispossible.eu", "EVERYTHINGS POSSIBLE LIMITED", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-035586_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["6PA", "HOPE LEARNING TRUST, YORK", 21939.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European youth area and the participation of young people in European democratic life (15.02.01.02)", "fts_2016_45854", 2016], ["6PZ", "EVERYTHING POSSIBLE CIC", 1576.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European youth area and the participation of young people in European democratic life (15.02.01.02)", "fts_2016_45856", 2016], ["6BL", "EDMUND OPTICS LIMITED", 1483.0, "Euratom activities of direct research (10.03.01)", "fts_2017_48194", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "YO26"}
