K\u00e4o Elementary School has been running for the past three years, therefore getting important information from other schools\u2019 experiences could be necessary. Even though it is possible to find similar schools in Estonia, teachers still need to further their knowledge in other countries where they have longer history in that field. K\u00e4o Elementary School works closely with K\u00e4o Day Care Center \u2013 it enables students to get different therapies (occupational therapy, music therapy, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy etc.). K\u00e4o Day Care Centre educators help students during their schoolday and in the afternoon. \r\n\r\nThe main goals for the project are:\r\n- examine the use of intensive interaction and ABA, which are essential part of working with autistic children. According to K\u00e4o Elementary School, these methods are not widespread in Estonia.\r\n- examine different augmentative and alternative communication opportunities that are used in UK special needs schools\r\n- examine different opportunities for sensory rooms\r\n- get knowledges about planning a lessons and schoolday for students with severe cognitive/ developmental and multiple disabilities \r\n- get knowledges about how teachers cooperate with other professionals (social workers, occupational therapists, music therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists etc.).\r\n\r\nThere will be three teachers participating in the job shadowing in special education schools in England. All the teachers have their own (home)groups. Additionally, they teach following subjects to all studens: cognition and perception; art and fine motor skills; social relationships and group work. Therefore teachers need to use augmentative and alternative communication and intensive interaction every day. Even though all the partner schools have students with severe with severe cognitive/ developmental disabilities, each school has an individual approach that the teachers from K\u00e4o Elementary School would like to familiarize with. \r\n\r\nDuring the job shadowing, teachers can broaden their knowledge and get practical experience working with similar study methods. Gained knowledge could raise the competency that again would help to create better environment for a personal growth in obtaining secondary education according to ones capabilities. With this current project, K\u00e4o Elementary School is also hoping to find long time partners from abroad with whom the partnership could continue even after the project. \r\n\r\nThe main communication between partners will take place via email (through the contact person of the school). Schools in England offer suitable dates for the job shadowing. Main goals of the visit will be specified again prior to travel. \r\n\r\nAfter the job shadowing, all the participating teachers share the new information and knowledges with the staff of K\u00e4o Elementary School, K\u00e4o Day Care Center and parents. Additionally, all the relevant information about the project will be revealed on the schools\u00b4 official website. Participating teachers will write an article about their job shadowing experiences to \u00d5petajate Leht (weekly newspaper).", "http://www.perseid.merton.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-EE01-KA101-000106_3"], ["5LT", "Projekte Diakonie 2014", "Perseid School", 72679.0, "Summary\r\n\r\nThis is already our sixth application for learning mobilities of individuals in the field of vocational education and training (former Leonardo da Vinci Programme), and we are very happy to note down a continuous increase in our students' interest in doing work placements in different foreign countries. In 2009 we started with three interns abroad - today in 2014 we have more than 20 students who want to do placements for 6 weeks or for one year at our partner organisations all over Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first time we would also like to apply for two staff mobilities. On the one hand for a teaching assignment of one of our arts teachers at our partner organisation in Palermo, Italy. In cooperation with the local staff, she wants to offer a creative workshop for children and teenagers entitled \"Imagining Ideal Living\". This workshop might hopefully initiate a strategic partnership in the long run. On the other hand we apply for a staff training mobility for one of our foreign language teachers and project co-coordinators in form of a job shadowing/observation period at our partner schools in England. The main objective here is to gain a deeper insight into the British educational system. This seems vital to us with regard to a professionalisation in giving advise and support to our interns at English partner institutions and to modulate and match our joint vocational training programme for the students' \"year of acknowledgement\". We plan to present the outcome of these experiences at our school/ on our homepage etc. and hope to motivate and encourage other staff members to benefit from a mobility abroad. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides intensifying and consolidating our contacts to already existing partner institutions for long term mobilities, one of our objectives for 2014 is to enlarge the possibilities for short term mobilities for our educators and educational therapists in order to encourage them more easily to go abroad, develop their professional skills and intercultural competences and widen their horizons. Altogether we would like to offer 7 short term mobilities for educational therapists at institutions in Austria and 7 short term mobilities for educators at institutions in Austria and Denmark. 14 long term mobilities we would like to offer to educators and educational therapists at institutions in Italy, Turkey, Austria and England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared, however, that we might not be successful in achieving our last objective as requested, because the new Erasmus+ grant support for long term mobilities for German students has been cut considerably (around 30 % compare to the former Leonardo grant support). The consequence of this is that the students in their \"year of acknowledgement\", especially those who do their work placements at communal schools in England, would need to be economically priviledged and be able to finance their mobility abroad from own resources. We can't expect them to work for an additional income because they have to do full time work placements.", "http://www.perseid.merton.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000162_11"], ["5HP", "Ladys in Aktion- Mit  Comedy zum Erfolg im Beruf", "kvnuk ltd", 46248.0, ".", "http://www.kvnuk.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-2-DE04-KA105-000961_3"], ["5LT", "Projekte Diakonie 2015", "Perseid School", 24637.0, "This is already our seventh application for learning mobilities of individuals in the field of vocational education and training (former Leonardo da Vinci Programme), and we are very happy to note down a continuous increase in our students' interest in doing work placements in different foreign countries.

Therefore they are not compatible with the end of the school term.

Offering the chance of successfully completing the whole \"year of acknowledgement\" abroad still remains an important objective for us, and is one of our college's special features. Since we are putting this into practice since 2009, we have by now developed well-tested administrative structures.
