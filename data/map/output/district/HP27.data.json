Equally, researchers and research organisations, ethics boards, governments and health system agencies, courts for social justice, pharmaceutical companies and all professional groups of the health care system are dependent on unbiased information.\nResearch projects have consistently shown that for approximately 50% of all launched trials results or reasons for their failure are never published. Not only pharmaceutical industry, but also researchers and their organisations, ethics boards and scientific journals are actively contributing to the general failure to come close to a 100% publication rate. An obvious reason is the complexity of the system as well as the limitation of resources, giving ample space for all stakeholders to avoid appropriate changes and draw attention to deficiencies outside their responsibility.\nThis project is based on the assumption that the existence of broad publication bias with seriously harmful impact has been accepted by all stakeholders and does not require further evidence. The current knowledge on publication bias and its impact will be summarized by systematic reviews of the relevant literature, with emphasis on the situation in the EU.\nOPEN focuses on the investigation of attitudes and handling of stakeholders involved in the whole knowledge translation process. Surveys, case studies and analyses of policies to reduce publication bias will be conducted to describe the current views and practice of stakeholders who are involved in knowledge translation. These results will be brought together to describe the status quo. Based on those insights recommendations will be derived to reduce publication bias and thus foster the provision of relevant results from clinical trials to citizens and organisations in the EU.", 28236.0, 463365.0, "OPEN", "Reducing dissemination bias", "Publication bias, or dissemination bias, reflects a tendency on the part of researchers to submit and journals to publish, articles that have strong, positive findings. As a result, medical decision-making is based on a skewed evidence base.", "To address this problem, an EU-funded project, 'Overcome failure to publish negative findings' (http://www.open-project.eu/ (OPEN)), aimed to develop evidence-informed recommendations focused on reducing dissemination bias.\n\nThe first phase of the project involved systematic reviews to identify the current evidence on dissemination bias. This step also included a review of the literature to clarify terminology used to describe various aspects of dissemination bias.\n\nDuring the second phase, researchers sent out surveys to various groups of key stakeholders to assess their awareness of the problem and steps they had taken to address it. Stakeholders included funding agencies, the pharmaceutical industry, research ethics committees, research institutions, researchers, trial registries, journals and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe survey results showed that while many stakeholders have policies in place to prevent dissemination bias, most find it difficult to enforce them. For example, 68\u00a0% of funding agencies said they had a policy, but less than half actively follow up with grantees. Journal editors noted their reluctance to require trial registration and their preference for publishing positive trials. The survey did find, however, that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has launched a website, with the goal of improving transparency.\n\nAfter compiling survey findings, the OPEN team sponsored a recommendations workshop. Of the 70 recommendations put forth by the project, 47 tailored to key groups were jointly agreed on, along with 4 general recommendations. All the recommendations aim to strengthen policies, facilitate implementation and increase transparency.\n\nThese findings have been disseminated through OPEN's website, journal publications and presentations at scientific meetings. By raising awareness of this issue, the team hopes to facilitate a change in practice, leading to less dissemination bias.\n\nThis outcome will improve knowledge about clinical trials so that apparent drug efficacy is not inflated. As a result, it will be easier to distinguish effective drugs from ineffective ones and to see what treatments could cause harm. Clearly, patients will benefit from a more comprehensive and unbiased evidence base.", null, "http://www.lizwager.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/147610.jpg", "fp7_100957_972730454"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0PP", "PREMIERS PAS VERS L'INTERNATIONALISATION DE NOS JEUNES BRETONS EN MFR", "THE HORSE TRUST ANDREWS Angela", 93201.0, "First steps towards the internationalization of our students from Brittany in the MFR schools\r\n\r\nWe wish, as the MFR from Brittany network, to boost mobility activities in order to promote students formal, non formal and informal skills in an international and European economic context.\r\n\r\nThe Regional Federation of the MFR in Brittany (FRMFR) is involved in the Erasmus program and leads 5 schools all over the Breton territory.  61 young students are concerned by the European program, they will leave to 9 different countries: Denmark, Croatia, Poland, the Netherland, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Finland and Greece for a four week- work experience in Spring 2018.\r\n\r\nThis training is a part of their vocational or technical A level studies specializing in farming; Personal help and Territory support, Agronomy and sciences.\r\n \r\nThe mobility project aims to improve the youth employability, by getting abroad new professional skills as part of a reciprocal approach of sharing the knowledge whilst respecting the diplomas framework. Moreover the training masters and the teachers in charge of the mobility project in each school write the work experiences \u2018purposes in order for each student to discover the business, its way of working, the work progresses and the responsibilities assigned.\r\n\r\nThe MFR are associative schools which have contracts with the government and the Breton council. They suggest an alternative way of learning (students are part time at school and part time in a business) and they work for the youth social and professional integration. So a stay in a European country should allow young students to adapt themselves to their future jobs. Getting a new experience with different professional tasks (according to the chosen country) and discovering foreign cultural aspects are a guarantee to be more confident and open-minded.

An integral part of the training is an internship in a company in another European country which is supposed to last several weeks. As many trainees as possible will take part in the Erasmus+ project in their second year of training. Some companies already have partners with whom they exchange workers frequently outside Europe and therefore do not participate in this project.\r\n\r\nThe Chamber of Commerce considers an internship lasting several weeks as a prerequisite to achieve the additional qualification \u201cEuropean Business Management\u201c. This experience as an intern in another European country is essential for the course \u201cEuropean Business Administration and Economics\u201d as part of their curriculum.\r\nTheoretical knowledge gained during the first two years of study will be improved by gaining practical working experience.\r\nDifferent consumer types, product and assortment strategies, market communication strategies, service and price strategies (as in unit 4.3 of the curriculum) should be experienced and put to the test during the internship. \r\nOther topics, which will be experienced first-hand and then reassessed after being thoroughly prepared in the lessons, are personnel quality management (curriculum unit 3.3) and the difficulty of acknowledging different training qualifications (curriculum unit 3.6). \r\nThese issues should be dealt with within the topic \u201ccontinued education in companies\u201d. \r\nThe curriculum explicitly asks for an internship in a foreign country for the trainees: \u201cEuropean exchange programmes for young employees\u201d and \u201coptions for an internship abroad\u201d should be shown and discussed according to curriculum unit 3.7. \r\nIn general the trainees should have acquired high intercultural and social skills during their training, which should enable them to deal with European business partners adequately and competently. \r\nThis can be best achieved by doing an internship of considerable length abroad. \r\nOne goal is to enhance their personal experience, language skills and knowledge in their field of business and with respect to the curriculum. Another very important goal is to share the gained experience with the other trainees of this programme. From July to November 2018 the trainees should do their internship in different EU-countries. To gain an even wider picture it is important that as many participants as possible go to different places to gather different insights and share those with their classmates once they are back in school for their final year.
