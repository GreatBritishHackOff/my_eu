Equally, researchers and research organisations, ethics boards, governments and health system agencies, courts for social justice, pharmaceutical companies and all professional groups of the health care system are dependent on unbiased information.\nResearch projects have consistently shown that for approximately 50% of all launched trials results or reasons for their failure are never published. Not only pharmaceutical industry, but also researchers and their organisations, ethics boards and scientific journals are actively contributing to the general failure to come close to a 100% publication rate. An obvious reason is the complexity of the system as well as the limitation of resources, giving ample space for all stakeholders to avoid appropriate changes and draw attention to deficiencies outside their responsibility.\nThis project is based on the assumption that the existence of broad publication bias with seriously harmful impact has been accepted by all stakeholders and does not require further evidence. The current knowledge on publication bias and its impact will be summarized by systematic reviews of the relevant literature, with emphasis on the situation in the EU.\nOPEN focuses on the investigation of attitudes and handling of stakeholders involved in the whole knowledge translation process. Surveys, case studies and analyses of policies to reduce publication bias will be conducted to describe the current views and practice of stakeholders who are involved in knowledge translation. These results will be brought together to describe the status quo. Based on those insights recommendations will be derived to reduce publication bias and thus foster the provision of relevant results from clinical trials to citizens and organisations in the EU.", 28236.0, 463365.0, "OPEN", "Reducing dissemination bias", "Publication bias, or dissemination bias, reflects a tendency on the part of researchers to submit and journals to publish, articles that have strong, positive findings. As a result, medical decision-making is based on a skewed evidence base.", "To address this problem, an EU-funded project, 'Overcome failure to publish negative findings' (http://www.open-project.eu/ (OPEN)), aimed to develop evidence-informed recommendations focused on reducing dissemination bias.\n\nThe first phase of the project involved systematic reviews to identify the current evidence on dissemination bias. This step also included a review of the literature to clarify terminology used to describe various aspects of dissemination bias.\n\nDuring the second phase, researchers sent out surveys to various groups of key stakeholders to assess their awareness of the problem and steps they had taken to address it. Stakeholders included funding agencies, the pharmaceutical industry, research ethics committees, research institutions, researchers, trial registries, journals and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe survey results showed that while many stakeholders have policies in place to prevent dissemination bias, most find it difficult to enforce them. For example, 68\u00a0% of funding agencies said they had a policy, but less than half actively follow up with grantees. Journal editors noted their reluctance to require trial registration and their preference for publishing positive trials. The survey did find, however, that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has launched a website, with the goal of improving transparency.\n\nAfter compiling survey findings, the OPEN team sponsored a recommendations workshop. Of the 70 recommendations put forth by the project, 47 tailored to key groups were jointly agreed on, along with 4 general recommendations. All the recommendations aim to strengthen policies, facilitate implementation and increase transparency.\n\nThese findings have been disseminated through OPEN's website, journal publications and presentations at scientific meetings. By raising awareness of this issue, the team hopes to facilitate a change in practice, leading to less dissemination bias.\n\nThis outcome will improve knowledge about clinical trials so that apparent drug efficacy is not inflated. As a result, it will be easier to distinguish effective drugs from ineffective ones and to see what treatments could cause harm. Clearly, patients will benefit from a more comprehensive and unbiased evidence base.", null, "http://www.lizwager.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/147610.jpg", "fp7_100957_972730454"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["0AN", "MELLISH RISK & RESILIENCE LIMITED", 2103.0, "Other management expenditure (25.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_47018", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "HP27"}
