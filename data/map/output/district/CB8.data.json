Three work packages (WP 2, 3, 4) aim to increase the knowledge of the epidemiology and evolution of swine influenza (SI) virus (SIV) in European pigs through organised field surveillance programmes (WP2).  Virus strains detected in these programmes will be subjected to detailed characterisation both antigenically (WP3) and genetically (WP4) using standardised methodology. Specifically this will involve timely information on genomic data and generation of antigenic maps using the latest technology. These analyses will provide significant and timely added value to knowledge of SIV. A strong focus will be monitoring spread and independent evolution of pandemic H1N1 2009 virus in pigs. All these data will in turn be used to improve the diagnosis of SI by updating the reagents used in the recommended techniques (WP2). The virus bank and electronic database that were established during ESNIPs 1 and 2 will also be expanded and formally curated with relevant SIV isolates and information for global dissemination within and outwith the consortium (WP5). ESNIP 3 represents the only organised surveillance network for influenza in pigs and seeks to strengthen formal interactions with human and avian surveillance networks previously established in ESNIP 2. A timely and transparent interaction with these networks will be a key output. These approaches are entirely consistent with improved pandemic preparedness and planning for human influenza whilst providing an evidence base for decisions in relation to veterinary health.  The project consortium consists of 24 participants, which contribute a blend of different specialism\u2019s and skills ensuring multi-disciplinary cutting-edge outputs. The vast majority of the partners are actively working with SIV including in a field setting. Twenty-one participants are from 11 EU member states, seven of which were actively involved in ESNIP 2.

It achieved this in conjunction with SI monitoring partners in China and the United States, as well as human health organisations in the EU.\n\nThe consortium primarily aimed to collect and store information about the various strains of the virus found in European pigs in a database. The project also focused on standardising collection and monitoring methods.\n\nResearchers started with Europe-wide herd surveillance to better understand the genetic diversity of SI in European pig populations. To aid in this effort, surveillance programmes, collection protocols and testing methods were standardised across all research centres involved in the project.\n\nA database was designed and implemented to store genetic information from the virus strains collected earlier in the project; it is the most comprehensive SI database ever created. This information was also used to create maps of SI genetic diversity in Europe.\n\nESNIP\u00a03 found that more than 30\u00a0% of pig herds in Europe were infected with SI, but there were few genetic differences between countries. However, the strains did show some divergence from the strain used to create a vaccine.\n\nThanks to the knowledge generated during ESNIP\u00a03, monitoring of swine flu outbreaks in Europe will become much simpler and faster.

Components and systems for extracting oil and gas need to be neutrally buoyant, in order to maintain them in the desired position. Buoyancy modules for drill risers used in exploration lines are currently made from syntactic foams using micro and macro-spheres. Macro-spheres offer buoyancy advantages, but become increasingly unreliable at greater depths due to manufacturing inconsistencies. A typical deep-water buoyancy module will contain thousands of tightly packed spheres, and when a buoyancy module fails this can necessitate costly repairs and lead to environmental harm\n\nThe current technology for buoyancy modules operating at less than 3km uses spheres made of Expanded PolyStyrene (EPS) balls which are then coated with a shell of epoxy resin.

The diseases of particular focus for this project are osteochondrosis  (OC), insect bite hypersensitivity (IBH) and chronic progressive lymphedema (CPL). The occurrence of these diseases is a significant problem for horse owners and breeders and leads to poor animal welfare and severe economic losses. The initiative of this project is mainly based on the strong wish from the studbooks to obtain a genetic alternative to the more traditional breeding methods which are often not feasible in the smaller breeds. For each disease, a genetic component to disease susceptibility has been confirmed and several research groups in Europe have independently carried out small to medium-sized studies in order to find the causative genetic mechanisms underlying the disorder. However, the mode of inheritance for these diseases appears to be complex, and no genes or mutations have been identified yet, suggesting that analysis of much larger sample sizes is required or across datasets. This project aims to bring together the efforts of European research groups that are currently working on the genetics of disease susceptibility in horses. This collaboration will enable the groups to pool data for meta-analysis leading to more rapid progress in the identification of the genes and suitable gene markers for use in genomic selection against disease susceptibility. The SME associations, in close collaboration with the RTD performers, will develop breeding strategies that are optimized to the specific situation of that SME association.

It is studying genetic factors both in purebred dogs and in mixed breeds for more efficient localisation of key genetic factors.\n\nThe main goal of LUPA is to identify genes and mutations that account for the high incidence of certain diseases in specific dog breeds. The culprit genes are identified by looking at the entire gene mapping sequence of dogs - or their genome - using what's known as genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Genetic material is being identified for five different categories of illnesses: cancers, cardiovascular disorders, inflammatory disorders, neurological disorders and monogenic disorders (those caused by a mutation in a single gene).
