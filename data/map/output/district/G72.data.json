The proposed project Energy Systems in Transition (ENSYSTRA) aims to train 15 ESRs in this field. The objectives of ENSYSTRA are 1) to develop state-of-the-art science of energy systems transition, scenario analysis and energy modelling tools with emphasis on interdisciplinary model collaboration, 2) to provide ESRs with interdisciplinary, inter-sectoral and applied perspectives on the energy transition, 3) to provide new skills and competences for interdisciplinary analysis, 3) to establish collaboration between key universities and their networks, 4) to create and increase linkages between different academic disciplines, applied research, industry and the public sector, 5) develop links and synergies between relevant scientific arenas, and 6) to contribute to accessible energy science based on open source work environments. By focussing on a prominent \u2018\u2019living lab\u2019\u2019 of the energy transition, the North Sea region, the project will bring together a strong network and analytical capacity to understand energy system & scenario modeling; new energy technologies & infrastructures; actor behavior & interactions; and policy & market design, linking the regional to the international scale. Through a carefully designed training programme, ESRs are trained in both scientific and transferable skills with ample opportunity to collaborate between different projects and partners.

However, to this day, most wave energy R&D does not have access to open-sea operating data as they are not shared by the companies that sponsored open-sea tests. \n\nOPERA will remove this roadblock by collecting and sharing two years of open-sea operating data of a floating oscillating water column wave energy converter. In addition the project will be the first open-sea deployment for four cost-reducing innovations that will be advanced from TRL3-4 to TRL5. Together, these four innovations have a long-term cost reduction potential of over 50%. These are: a 50% more efficient turbine, latching and predictive control, a shared mooring system for wave energy similar to those that have reduced mooring costs 50% in aquaculture, and an elastomeric mooring tether that reduces peak loads at the hull-mooring connection 70% and thus addresses one of the most pressing challenges for structural survivability of wave energy devices. \n\nDocumenting and sharing this open-sea experience will also induce a step-change in our knowledge of risk and uncertainties, costs and societal and environmental impacts of wave energy. The consortium brings together world leaders in wave energy research from four European countries and the IPR owner and most advanced teams to exploit each of these innovations. \n\nLast but not least, the project brings national in-cash co-financing of over \u20ac2 million to directly fund the open-sea testing.", 124724.0, 4932050.0, "OPERA", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_200240_929111591"], ["0HT", "Massive InteGRATion of power Electronic devices", "Scottish Power Energy Networks Holdings Limited", "By 2020, several areas of the HVAC pan-European transmission system will be operated with extremely high penetrations of Power Electronics(PE)-interfaced generators, thus becoming the only generating units for some periods of the day or of the year \u2013 due to renewable (wind, solar) electricity. This will result in i) growing dynamic stability issues for the power system (possibly a new major barrier against future renewable penetration), ii) the necessity to upgrade existing protection schemes and iii) measures to mitigate the resulting degradation of power quality due to harmonics propagation. European TSOs from Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and UK have joined to address such challenges with manufacturers (Alstom, Enercon, Schneider Electric) and universities/research centres. They propose innovative solutions to progressively adjust the HVAC system operations. Firstly, a replicable methodology is developed for appraising the distance of any EU 28 control zone to instability due to PE proliferation and for monitoring it in real time, along with a portfolio of incremental improvements of existing technologies (the tuning of controllers, a pilot test of wide-area control techniques and the upgrading of protection devices with impacts on the present grid codes). Next, innovative power system control laws are designed to cope with the lack of synchronous machines. Numerical simulations and laboratory tests deliver promising control solutions together with recommendations for new PE grid connection rules and the development of a novel protection technology and mitigation of the foreseen power quality disturbances. Technology and economic impacts of such innovations are quantified together with barriers to be overcome in order to recommend future deployment scenarios.
