The transport sector is a major contributor to these emissions, but the targets for this sector cannot be met with currently available materials technology. Due to the direct link between weight and energy consumption, EU investment in advancing lightweight technologies is crucial. Therefore, fibre-reinforced composites are a key technology, but they are not yet widely used due (1) to their high price, (2) overdesign due to a lack of toughness and (3) difficulties with recycling. Addressing these challenges through fibre-hybridisation requires a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with a strong background in both modelling and experimentation. Since such combined expertise is scarce, HyFiSyn aims to train 13 early stage researchers to become interdisciplinary, multi-talented experts. The 8 universities, 5 industrial partners and 2 professional training organisations offer the researchers a unique opportunity to be trained by world-leading experts in cutting-edge technologies, where they are supported by a strong network and industry participation. The training programme strongly emphasises entrepreneurship and innovation skills to maximise the impact of the project, thereby increasing the EU\u2019s innovation capacity. Simultaneously, the researchers will be trained through research by developing and experimentally validating advanced simulation tools to predict optimal microstructures for fibre-hybrid composites. These microstructures will then be manufactured and verified in industrial applications. To further increase its impact, HyFiSyn also designs hybrids with smart and functional properties, and will investigate strategies for more efficient usage of recycled fibres through fibre-hybridisation. The overall goal is to fundamentally understand synergetic effects, so that they can be maximally exploited and unprecedented composite performance can be achieved.", 237965.0, 2935903.0, "HyFiSyn", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_215990_934265783"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["6DE", "\u201eJa dla Europy - Europa dla mnie \u2013 zagraniczne sta\u017ce zawodowe uczni\u00f3w Kopernika\u201d", "Polaris EU Enterprise Limited", 108581.0, "\u2018I am for Europe \u2013 Europe is for me\u2019 is the title of the project carried out by Copernicus Secondary School of Economics in Kielce with co-operation with foreign companies: Polaris EU Enterprise Limited and Training Vision Ltd and ETN Training Vision from Ireland.\r\nThe main aim of the project is increasing the level of professional and linguistic competence by allowing students to use and broaden the knowledge and professional skills acquired during vocational subject lessons at school and practiced during vocational training periods abroad.\r\nThe implementation of the project will prepare the students for mobility at the European education and job markets.

We want to change that. The participants of the experience gained will certainly be valued and sought after employees in their respective industries. In the opinion of our local employers (conducted talks with the employers of the tourism industry, manufacturing, construction, economic and information technology) ideal employee should be characterized not only diligence, honesty and integrity, but also to high professional qualifications, experience acquired during apprenticeships and speak at least one foreign language, because a lot of companies carries out orders abroad. Therefore the idea of creating a project in cooperation with our regional entrepreneurs.\r\nYouth ending school education can be classified as disadvantaged groups in the labor market. This involves little professional experience of young workers entering the labor market and the lack of funds for training courses. Employers demand for show experience in the industry. This fact shows the need to strengthen practical training at school and the use of EU funds for educational activities throughout their lives. In this situation, a good strategy is to participate in Erasmus +. A student gains additional prestige here, what is its positive value and increases the chance of getting a graduate job, because he or she meets the greater expectation of a potential employer. A student also gets a lot of other possibilities, such as - the European dimension of his training, training in the use of foreign language training, a certificate of Europass Mobility. These benefits to some extent improve the situation of young worker on the labor market and increase their chances of getting a job.
