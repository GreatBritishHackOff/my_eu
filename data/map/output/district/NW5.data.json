The goal is to increment the number and success rate of initiatives that use collective awareness approaches to respond to high-impact societal challenges. To do so, the project will:- engage a large base of organizations, networks, and programs that already operate successfully in the areas of social innovation, entrepreneurship, early stage business incubation, service design, and creativity. This CHEST Community has been started with 18 important organizations already involved as  supporting partners;- create a liquid information and social deliberation platform, based on a cooperative awareness approach and implemented on top of a broad spectrum of social media, which gives voice to communities bearing interests about hard-to-solve, high-impact social problems. The platform promotes the emergence of innovative solutions and allows a transparent and collective testing and selection of social innovation experiments;- launch and manage three rounds of open calls to distribute a consistent part of our project budget (around 2,5 Million euro); these funds will be allocated with a public competition for ideas with social innovation, and measure the effectiveness of proposed responses to social problems.  This evaluation and co-funding scheme includes public assessment of proposals with  crowdfunding and crowdsourcing (for optimal combination of expert/stakeholders input).The beneficiaries of the project are individuals, companies and organizations that want social innovation projects, and need to have their original ideas field-tested by an intelligent ad hoc crowd of experts and stakeholders.", 39413.0, 3011734.0, "CHEST", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110594_934270439"], ["1DN", "Promoting Open Source in European Projects", "Origin Limited", "Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) is creating new R&D opportunities across Europe, particularly in an ICT context where projects require an adequate cooperation environment. Despite the numerous advantages of FLOSS as a cooperation model, however, most developed software faces a limited life cycle and applicability. The absence of a common platform where projects can publish their software - with reliable and trustworthy usage terms/conditions - creates adoption difficulties. As a result, software is re-invented within the ICT community, leading to duplication of effort and failed R&D opportunities.Adopting FLOSS paradigms will extend the lifetime and sustainability of ICT software, increasing contributions to and from the community. To achieve this vision it is necessary to: promote FLOSS for ICT projects, by removing existing obstacles, especially legal and business barriers; create a feedback loop for FLOSS usage in ICT projects that encompasses the EC and enables them to assess the true benefits of a FLOSS-driven model; enable long term exploitation of FLOSS through a sustainable model for ICT contributions.The PROSE proposal is a Coordination Action (CA) that targets these goals through a three-fold, complementary approach:(a) Create and manage a shared platform for FLOSS, capable of generating the required feedback loop;(b) Develop a training program that provides knowledge and learning about this shared platform, as well as legal and business aspects regarding the adoption of FLOSS;(c) Execute a dissemination program to increase awareness of the advantages of adopting a FLOSS-driven model in ICT projects.With these three coordination elements, the PROSE CA will increase the sustainability of FLOSS in ICT; thereby extending the reach of ongoing FLOSS efforts beyond their current boundaries, and thus increasing the R&D opportunities in the European space.", 36749.0, 497988.0, "PROSE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_188908_950463425"], ["1LP", "Advanced high-resolution printing of organic Transistors for Large Area Smart Surfaces", "The Shadow Robot Company Limited", "Bringing intelligence and communication to everyday objects is a major challenge for future electronics.

In 2016, we will primarily focus on 3 countries: Spain, Portugal and Italy, where local distributors are joining as co-beneficiaries of the action.

The analysis realized starting from these activities of discussion and sensitization highlighted the need of implementing transnational mobility activities for the strengthening and updating of professional competences, both of recent graduates and staff, in the sectors identified in the project. In fact, they are sectors extremely relevant for the national economy (tourism, fashion, commerce), constantly increasing (ICT, electronics/electrotechnics, mechanical engineering/mechatronics, marketing), and in which the request of specific competences has grown (social field, mechanical engineering/mechatronics,  environment and territory). \r\nBesides the technical-professional competences related to the identified sectors, the project contributes to enhance the European identity and to improve intercultural, linguistic and digital skills, allowing the development of a set of personal and transversal abilities, essential in the current occupational scenario. \r\nThe realization of the project \"E.A.S.Y.
