The goal is to increment the number and success rate of initiatives that use collective awareness approaches to respond to high-impact societal challenges. To do so, the project will:- engage a large base of organizations, networks, and programs that already operate successfully in the areas of social innovation, entrepreneurship, early stage business incubation, service design, and creativity. This CHEST Community has been started with 18 important organizations already involved as  supporting partners;- create a liquid information and social deliberation platform, based on a cooperative awareness approach and implemented on top of a broad spectrum of social media, which gives voice to communities bearing interests about hard-to-solve, high-impact social problems. The platform promotes the emergence of innovative solutions and allows a transparent and collective testing and selection of social innovation experiments;- launch and manage three rounds of open calls to distribute a consistent part of our project budget (around 2,5 Million euro); these funds will be allocated with a public competition for ideas with social innovation, and measure the effectiveness of proposed responses to social problems.  This evaluation and co-funding scheme includes public assessment of proposals with  crowdfunding and crowdsourcing (for optimal combination of expert/stakeholders input).The beneficiaries of the project are individuals, companies and organizations that want social innovation projects, and need to have their original ideas field-tested by an intelligent ad hoc crowd of experts and stakeholders.", 39413.0, 3011734.0, "CHEST", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110594_934270439"], ["1DN", "Promoting Open Source in European Projects", "Origin Limited", "Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) is creating new R&D opportunities across Europe, particularly in an ICT context where projects require an adequate cooperation environment. Despite the numerous advantages of FLOSS as a cooperation model, however, most developed software faces a limited life cycle and applicability. The absence of a common platform where projects can publish their software - with reliable and trustworthy usage terms/conditions - creates adoption difficulties. As a result, software is re-invented within the ICT community, leading to duplication of effort and failed R&D opportunities.Adopting FLOSS paradigms will extend the lifetime and sustainability of ICT software, increasing contributions to and from the community. To achieve this vision it is necessary to: promote FLOSS for ICT projects, by removing existing obstacles, especially legal and business barriers; create a feedback loop for FLOSS usage in ICT projects that encompasses the EC and enables them to assess the true benefits of a FLOSS-driven model; enable long term exploitation of FLOSS through a sustainable model for ICT contributions.The PROSE proposal is a Coordination Action (CA) that targets these goals through a three-fold, complementary approach:(a) Create and manage a shared platform for FLOSS, capable of generating the required feedback loop;(b) Develop a training program that provides knowledge and learning about this shared platform, as well as legal and business aspects regarding the adoption of FLOSS;(c) Execute a dissemination program to increase awareness of the advantages of adopting a FLOSS-driven model in ICT projects.With these three coordination elements, the PROSE CA will increase the sustainability of FLOSS in ICT; thereby extending the reach of ongoing FLOSS efforts beyond their current boundaries, and thus increasing the R&D opportunities in the European space.", 36749.0, 497988.0, "PROSE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_188908_950463425"], ["1LP", "Advanced high-resolution printing of organic Transistors for Large Area Smart Surfaces", "The Shadow Robot Company Limited", "Bringing intelligence and communication to everyday objects is a major challenge for future electronics.

Beyond current TOLAE demonstration, a major technology jump driving the scalability towards nanoscale resolution via high-definition cost-effective printing is required to deliver the properties and electrical performances expected by applications. ATLASS Innovation Action takes this huge step by bringing high resolution technologies to the printing industries for the demonstration of products at TRL6 in high impact markets. New multifunctional high-performing inks (semiconductor mobility >1cm2/Vs, dielectrics, ferroelectrics) and high-resolution (down to 500nm and ~100nm thickness) R2R/S2S printing including nano-imprinting and gravure printing will be engineered and scaled-up on pre-industrial pilot lines, enabling high performance devices (speed ~ 10 MHz). In-line control and novel automatic optical inspection tools and methodology will be installed to ramp-up the yield of developed processes (>99%) thus enabling cost-efficient fabrication of advanced circuits (>1000 transistors, 50kHz clock rate). The technology capability is benchmarked with conventional TOLAE process and demonstrated with 4 applications in the field of Interactive objects and Sensing surfaces (temperature tag for smart food packaging, electronic label for logistics, impact force sensing foils for automotive safety -, proximity sensing for safer human-robot collaboration ).

As of today, the results have been significant with 47 releases for 9 films covering 15 territories. In addition to the Day-and-Date model, TIDE also experiments, since 2015, with Festival-to-Date releases, where films are simultaneously released in festivals and on VOD platforms. TIDE 4 has 5 main objectives: 1. Strengthen the experimentation of D&D releases in the most suitable markets.  In 2016, we will primarily focus on 3 countries: Spain, Portugal and Italy, where local distributors are joining as co-beneficiaries of the action.  However, each TIDE 4 release can include additional releases in other EU territories. 2. Develop the Festival-to-Date scheme, which enables to reach out to new types of audiences and films. 3. Continue to support each release with specific promotion and marketing actions adapted to the audience targeted both at local and transversal levels. 4. Continue the work of collecting and organizing data sharing systems with stakeholders in the European film industry.
