Thirty BTEC students from the Pontefract area and sub-districts will travel to Malta on a work-based placement and align their training units to the Maltese Government's Sport and Public Health agendas.  One of Malta's leading sport provider, Luxol Sports Foundation will act as their host partner and provide access to their services, target audience and accredited partners in helping the students deliver schemes and programmes to their membership. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to highlight the relationships between sport, health and lifestyles and demonstrate that industries that support the named sectors are intrinsically linked, supporting wider employability pathways. The students, mainly from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds will spend 2-weeks operating within their respective discipline in providing sports coaching activities to children, young people and adults and exercise and health programmes to the adult membership raising awareness around the issues of obesity, a commonality shared by both Malta and UK. The inclusion of Media students studying Creative Media Productions will piece together promotional videos highlighting the benefits of engaging in physical, recreational and healthy activities, as well as capturing the entire mobility experience on film. \r\n\r\nThe planning and design of the project will allow students the opportunity to gain accreditation through the ECVET framework set against student training units, the development of both hard and soft-skill learning through formal and informal activities, and built into the project are opportunities to gain further certification through volunteering with children's sport and holiday camps. In addition, the students will participate in cultural activities, engage in team-building activities with their host partners and attend a formal presentation evening as part of an award ceremony. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of providing mobility opportunities for those considered with fewer opportunities aligned with their background are far reaching with respect to the distance they will travel in terms of personal development; students will return to College much more informed which in turn will help support both their vocational studies and eventual grades. The impact on the student is often evident through increased confidence, a sense of self recognition and awareness and a much more engaged student in College-life and the community. Longer term benefits include a higher level of employability and career choices, the opportunity for higher education and overtime eventual employment in their area of interest or specialism. For the college, the monument is to continue to work on behalf of students to secure funding within mobility planning and that mobility be built into future curricula as part of vocational and academic study.", "http://www.ncpontefract.ac.uk", "New Collaborative Learning Trust", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036091_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WF8"}
