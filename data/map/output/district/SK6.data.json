Moreover, STORM will determine how different vulnerable materials, structures and buildings are affected by different extreme weather events together with risks associated to climatic conditions or natural hazards, offering improved, effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, systems and technologies. An integrated system featuring novel sensors (intra fluorescent and wireless acoustic sensors), legacy systems, state of the art platforms (including LiDAR and UAVs), as well as crowdsourcing techniques will be implemented, offering applications and services over an open cloud infrastructure. \nAn important result of STORM will be a cooperation platform for collaboratively collecting and enhancing knowledge, processes and methodologies on sustainable and effective safeguarding and management of European Cultural Heritage. The system will be capable of performing risk assessment on natural hazards taking into account environmental and anthropogenic risks, and of using Complex Events processing. Results will be tested in relevant case studies in five different countries: Italy, Greece, UK, Portugal and Turkey. The sites and consortium have been carefully selected so as to adequately represent the rich European Cultural Heritage, while associate partners that can assist with liaisons and links to other stakeholders and European sites are also included.\nThe project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team providing all competences needed to assure the implementation of a functional and effective solution to support all the actors involved in the management and preservation of Cultural Heritage sites.", 352888.0, 6329542.0, "STORM", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_202681_926377452"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5BR", "Language Learning for Everyone in Our School Community", "St Marys Catholic Primary School", 20105.0, "This project, Language Learning for Everyone in Our School Community, using the Erasmus+ Key Action 1 programme, has been proposed by St Mary's Catholic Primary School, a small school of approximately 250 pupils in Marple Bridge, a suburb of Stockport in the North West of England. \r\n\r\nOver a period of two years, the school plans to send ten staff members, including Teachers and Teaching Assistants on eight-day immersion courses in Carcassonne, France.  The project's objectives are to develop the linguistic competency, confidence and intercultural awareness of staff to enable them to teach French to primary school children within a cross-curricular context.  The participants currently have little or no experience of living in France and the majority have no language qualifications higher than a GCSE in French. \r\n\r\nParticipants will receive 14 hours of intensive, personalised language training in small ability groups. They will also be set activities and tasks to allow them to become immersed in the local culture and develop the confidence to apply their language skills in real-life situations. They will gather authentic resources to engage children in language learning.   Additionally, participants will have the opportunity to spend time in a French school, allowing them to develop their understanding of life in a French school and foster links for future partnerships. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the project, teachers will have higher confidence and competency in teaching French within a cross-curricular context and sharing their intercultural knowledge.  Children at the school will be highly engaged in language learning and will demonstrate the confidence to apply their language skills in a variety of curriculum areas.  Children will also demonstrate a higher level of intercultural awareness and make significant progress with their French language skills as they move through the school and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the project will be disseminated throughout the school community and beyond. In the longer term, it is planned that the school will support other local schools by sharing knowledge, experience and inspiration gained through the project.", "http://www.st-marys-marplebridge.stockport.sch.uk", "St Marys Catholic Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035609_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SK6"}
