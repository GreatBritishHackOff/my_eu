This example shows several things. First, the approval requirements do not guarantee a longer term positive benefit risk profile. Second, large scale postmarketing studies are desperately needed to monitor the benefit risk profile throughout the lifecycle of T2DM drugs, and to achieve the required scale collaboration across countries is mandatory. Many novel T2DM drugs have come to the market, all on the basis of the same surrogate endpoints. New safety issues are constantly arising, such as potential associations with pancreatitis, pancreas cancer, bladder cancer, acute renal failure, etc.  In the SAFEGUARD Consortium we have assembled an excellent multidisciplinary group of experts who collaboratively aim to quantify the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and pancreatic safety risk of the T2DM drugs, in particular the more novel drugs by investigating  1) published clinical trials and observational studies;  2) spontaneously reported adverse event  reports in national and international pharmacovigilance databases; 3) data from nine population-based health care databases in six countries capturing longitudinal drug exposure and event data on more than 1.7 million T2DM patients. Data elaboration will be distributed but standardized through common protocols, data models and scripts. To put the epidemiological results into perspective, intensive monitoring mechanistic studies in human will be conducted to further understand how and why these T2DM drugs may affect the cardiovascular, digestive or renal system. The SAFEGUARD consortium will yield a harmonized epidemiological data platform on a large T2DM population, which could easily be used to address newly occurring safety issues in the future.'", 146767.0, 3136844.0, "SAFEGUARD", null, null, null, null, "http://www.dsru.org", null, "fp7_100121_997621818"], ["1AA", "Arrhythmogenic potential of drugs", "Drug Safety Research Trust", "The ability of some compounds to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram and to precipitate Torsade de Pointes (TdP, a potentially fatal arrhythmia) has caused several regulatory interventions, including drug withdrawals. Specific guidelines have been implemented to detect QT liability of new compounds as early as possible. However there is growing evidence that an increase in the QT interval does not necessarily lead to TdP which further increased the regulatory and clinical difficulties. This proposal will assess the arrhythmogenic potential of antipsychotics, antihistamines and anti-infectives (&gt; 250 compounds). It will fulfill this aim by: reviewing the literature on in-vitro and in-vivo preclinical evidence; conducting in-silico modeling to predict the arrhythmic potential through target profiling and docking molecules in existing atomistic models and predicting the effects on hERG K\\, Na\\, Ca\\\\ channels; analyzing the information in national and international pharmacovigilance DBs of spontaneous reports; conducting prospective case control surveillance on symptomatic QT prolongation; conducting cohort studies in psychiatric and hematology patients; analyzing information from existing studies to assess the association between drug use and various arrhythmia outcomes; and collecting blood samples from cases and drug-matched controls to investigate potential effect modification by candidate genes and a hypothesis generating approach including more than 2000 genes. Healthcare DBs on 27 million persons in 5 countries will be used to calculate rates and relative risks of arrhythmic events during drug use. Predictions on arrhythmic potential will be compared with actual postmarketing risk to assess the predictive value of preclinical markers. All information will be integrated to allow for ranking the arrhythmic potential of all the 250 study drugs and creation of risk charts that will allow for more informed treatment and decision making.", 184441.0, 3065654.0, "ARITMO", "Assessing drugs for risk of arrhythmia", "Many drugs have been taken off the market because they have been linked to a potentially fatal heart arrhythmia. A new project revisits these drugs to determine if there is a link with this serious, though rare, event.", "Concern has been expressed about drugs that prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram, precipitating torsade de pointes (Tdp), a potentially fatal arrhythmia. However, a growing body of evidence is showing that an increase in the QT interval does not necessarily lead to TdP, casting doubt on clinical and regulatory decisions that have been made.\n\nThe 'Arrhythmogenic potential of drugs' (ARITMO) project was designed to examine the relationship between medications and arrhythmia.\nTo date, it has assessed three classes of drugs: antipsychotics, antihistamines, and anti-infective agents. Literature reviews, databases with pharmacokinetic parameters, and databases with a cardiac safety profile were used to study the drugs.\n\nIn addition, researchers examined the relationship between these drugs and ventricular arrhythmia (VA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). They also looked at patient profiles to see if they could find new parameters that would predict TdP. Finally, the investigators conducted genetic analyses.\n\nOut of 450 drugs under study, a comparison between literature review and database analysis could be provided for 205 drugs: 26 antihistamines, 36 antipsychotics, and 143 anti-infective agents. ARITMO provided new information for 16 antihistamines and 20 antipsychotics and confirmed that anti-infective agents were generally in the low-risk category.\n\nThese and similar results have numerous implications. They can be used to help regulators make decisions about the risk associated with these drugs. They also can be used to prioritise drugs that should be evaluated. Finally, the findings can be used to quantify risk and validate preclinical predictive models.\n\nThe integrated evidence that has emerged from the ARITMO project will allow for better regulatory and clinical decision making. Furthermore, an infrastructure has been established that can be used for other drugs.

Established diagnostic imaging modalities (e.g. X-ray Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography) provide 3D anatomical, functional or pathological information with spatial resolution in the millimetre range. However, these methods cannot be applied continuously or at the bedside. Diffuse optical imaging is expected to provide a valuable complementing tool to assess perfusion and blood oxygenation in brain tissue and their time evolution in a continuous or quasi-continuous manner. The devices will be portable and comparably inexpensive and can be applied in adults and in children. Time-domain techniques are acknowledged as offering superior information content and sensitivity compared to other optical methods, allowing for separation between contributions of surface tissues (skin and skull) and brain tissue. Time-domain imaging can also differentiate between the effects of scatter and those of absorption.The consortium plans major developments in technology and data analysis that will enhance time-domain diffuse optical imaging with respect to spatial resolution, sensitivity, robustness of quantification as well as performance of related instruments in clinical diagnosis and monitoring. The diagnostic value of time-domain diffuse optical imaging will be assessed by clinical pilot studies addressing specific neurological disorders, in comparison with established neurophysiological and neuroimaging techniques. Perspectives regarding clinical application of time-domain diffuse optical brain imaging will be estimated and a reliable basis for a potential commercialisation of this novel technique by European system manufacturers will be created.", 189282.0, 6468443.0, "NEUROPT", "Innovative solutions for brain imaging", "A European consortium worked towards the development of advanced non-invasive imaging methodologies for in vivo diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis of major neurological diseases.

However, these methods cannot assess systemic parameters such as heart rate or blood pressure, and they cannot they be applied at the bedside. Electroencephalography (EEG) constitutes a long-standing technique that can continuously and non-invasively monitor the brain.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Non-invasive imaging of brain function and disease by pulsed near infrared light' (NEUROPT) consortium was motivated to generate a clinical tool for continuous monitoring of the haemodynamic parameters of cerebral oxygenation and perfusion. This tool should also complement MRI/CT/PET methods and at the same time be compatible with existing neuro-monitoring techniques (EEG, Doppler ultrasound).\n\nTo achieve this, partners had to improve spatial resolution of current imaging techniques, remove artefacts and enable the absolute quantification of physiological parameters. To this end, they employed time-resolved techniques that offer greater sensitivity than most optical methods and distinguish between surface tissues (e.g. skin and skull) and brain tissue.\n\nNovel photonic devices were constructed as well as device prototypes for use in the clinical setting, including a specialised helmet for attaching the optical fibres to the head. Through software development, researchers could also analyse the time-resolved measurements on the head and calculate the oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin concentrations. Additionally, NEUROPT researchers worked on realistic modelling and computation, especially with a view to improving light propagation in the human head.\n\nThe feasibility of this combinatorial approach was tested in separate visual and motor studies in healthy individuals. It was further successfully applied to perform measurements in patients with acute neurological conditions, photosensitive epilepsy or stroke.\n\nGiven the non-invasive nature of the NEUROPT approach and its potential to be continuously applied at the bedside, it should facilitate the diagnosis of functional brain impairment and monitor its progress. As a result, it should improve the prognosis of patients with serious neurological conditions and could also be applied for imaging the brains of infants.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2011-01/56085.jpg", "fp7_88164_999684135"], ["4RA", "White Light Fibre Lasers - Highly Disruptive Illumination Technology for Industry and Medical Surgery", "Fianium Ltd*", "WhiteLase-2020 addresses the need in semiconductor manufacturing and medical markets for a high-end, industrially-robust, high-brightness illumination source having the spectrum of a lamp and the beam quality and reliability of a laser.
