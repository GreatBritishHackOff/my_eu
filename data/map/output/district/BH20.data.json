However, existing technology suffers from limited temporal and spatial resolution: positioning data are too coarse to determine how animals behave relative to their environment and each other. In other words: one can measure where an animal approximately is, but not what it is doing. Current GNSS-based tracking systems are not able to track moving objects at short time intervals. Furthermore, software tools capable of processing large volumes of GNSS data and converting those into meaningful metrics describing animal behaviour are missing. The E-TRACK project concerns the development of a system for measurement and analysis of movement, behaviour and interactions of wildlife. The system will consist of EGNOS-enabled GNSS receivers, efficient data communication and an innovative software application. E-TRACK will take advantage of EGNOS and EDAS to provide adequate resolution for behaviour analysis. In addition, EGNOS and EDAS data will be used in post-processing to analyse the data points.\nIn order to execute the project, a consortium has been formed of six partners, including three SME companies: a software company (Noldus Information Technology) with many years experience in measurement and analysis of animal behaviour; a manufacturer of wildlife telemetry hardware (Biotrack); a consulting firm in the domain of remote sensing and geo-informatics (AeroVision); a university group with expertise in behaviour and ecology of large mammals (Resource Ecology Group, Wageningen University); and two research institutes with expertise in behavioural ecology of birds (NIOO and IZW). The project will develop a fully working end-to-end system that will be tested, validated and demonstrated by the scientific partners. The project will also develop a business plan how to launch the system in the market.", 64310.0, 604620.0, "E-TRACK", null, null, null, null, "http://www.biotrack.co.uk", null, "fp7_208253_968928636"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5QP", "Nature for Youth and City", "Butterfly Conservation", 233783.0, "Sustainable cities is a topic gaining prime importance throughout Europe. A range of environmental action plans and policy instruments are put in place for this aim. Establishing the link between urban population and nature is increasingly considered as an important way towards sustainable cities, as it also contributes to improving life quality and public health of the society. Yet, intense urbanization pressure is acting negatively on natural areas in and around the cities. Similar to many of the developing countries, the pace of urbanization has increased tremendously in Turkey. Ankara, the capital of Turkey, is also following this trend; existing urban life style in Ankara is detached from nature to a great extent. Middle East Technical University (METU), situated at the heart of Ankara, only 5 km to the parliament, covers 4,500 hectares of area made up of mostly natural and pristine ecosystems. The presence of such a big natural reserve in the capital city is a unique commodity and it provides the possibility of experiencing and spending leisure-time in nature. Yet, the importance of such an oasis in the middle of the city is not well recognized and benefited from. In this project, we aim at re-establishing the link between people of Ankara and nature through focusing on the youth of the city. We believe learning about nature around us is an essential component of establishing this link. Dynamism of young people and the access to young people through the campus are valuable opportunities. The project therefore is based on training young people to take a leading role in developing and implementing a nature education program and in establishing an operational centre in the METU Campus, i.e. \u201cNature for Youth and City Centre (NYC-C)\u201d. We recognize that extensive know-how and experience exist in EU countries on this topic. Thus the project aims at benefiting from this experience via effective exchanges carried out to observe similar programs and activities in Europe. Partners from UK, Greece and Italy are selected in this respect. The project has 4 main activities:1. Mobilisation and capacity building of young people for experience sharing on nature education programs;2. Preparation of education programs;3. Establishment of the \u201cNature for Youth and City Centre\u201d;4. Dissemination of the developed model in other selected university campuses and in available institutions.Our method is based on training young people through a program developed by professionals on nature conservation, education, sustainability and work with them closely. As a result of these capacity building activities, learning by doing, and peer-to-peer learning experiences, young people will significantly improve their skills and qualifications and will become trainers themselves. They will implement programs which have 5 modules (butterflies, plants, steppe ecosystems, sustainability and climate change). Throughout the 30 months of the project duration, we expect 18,000 people to directly or indirectly benefit from the activities of the project:- At least 60 trainings realized and 3,000 young people participated to nature education programs implemented in the METU Campus,- At least 50 primary and high schools visited and in each visit 100 students followed educations on sustainability, nature conservation and biodiversity of Ankara. - At least 1/3 of the METU students (~ 10,000) made aware of the program and respectively esteem the METU Campus nature.- 5 nature education training programs and related materials prepared and made available;- NYC-C established to support Ankara on sustainability, nature conservation and nature education issues.The project is innovative in many terms, i.e. learning nature in nature and young people becoming trainers and advocates. Yet, the establishment of a centre in METU specialised on nature education is going to be first of its kind in Turkey and it will secure the sustainability of the project\u2019s outcomes. We believe the centre will act as a hub and will attract other initiatives on nature education in Ankara and elsewhere. It will create synergy and as a result, will be amplifying the impact of such programs at local, regional and national scales. The centre will also contribute to conservation of nature conservation. Finally, the project will serve to empowering youth on becoming knowledgeable and skilled on sustainability and nature conservation topics, and becoming active citizens promoting these issues in their life. The project aims at canalising the energy of youth to promoting concepts of sustainable and nature friendly cities and urban ecology in the capital of Turkey. The activities of the project might lead to young people starting professional careers in fields of sustainability, nature conservation, and/or gaining a hobby contributing to healthier and happier life opportunities. In the long term, all these will feed into the establishment of sustainable cities in Turkey.", null, null, "erasmus_2016-2-TR01-KA205-036224_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BH20"}
