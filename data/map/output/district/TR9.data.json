Conventional, centralized approaches have failed in many areas and will hardly be able to solve potential problems in rural, hilly and rapidly developing urban areas in India. Instead, innovative, decentralised systems aiming at various benefits are needed. A main benefit in the context of SARASWATI is the reuse of treated wastewater for different purposes. Other benefits include reuse of energy and nutrients, which are also important. Despite the overall poor condition of wastewater treatment across South Asia, India has already considerable experience with such decentralised approaches. Over the last decade, hundreds of decentralised wastewater treatment plants of different technology types have been installed all over India. However, not all are functioning well and several also failed, due to various reasons. Also, there is no consolidated evaluation and review of all those existing plants available. As a result there is only very limited knowledge on the performance of those existing technologies available and a review and evaluation of those plants is very timely in order to derive sound conclusions and recommendations for future wastewater management strategies in India. SARASWATI will perform such a comprehensive and independent evaluation and hence provide key suggestions for the improvement of existing technologies.  In addition, SARASWATI aims at deploying selected proven EU technologies with a potential for solving grave water challenges in India (water pollution due to discharge of untreated wastewater and storm-water, water scarcity and groundwater depletion, unhygienic sludge handling practices due to lack of suitable technologies). Water challenged sites have been identified in 5 Indian States comprising almost all regions.", 280671.0, 2354664.0, "SARASWATI", "Options for Indian wastewater treatment", "A joint EU-India team is evaluating the performance of decentralised wastewater treatment technologies in India and piloting selected proven European wastewater treatment technologies.", "The EU-funded project SARASWATI (Supporting consolidation, replication and up-scaling of sustainable wastewater treatment and reuse technologies for India) aims to contribute to the decentralised wastewater treatment in India.. Researchers will document and evaluate several wastewater treatment technologies in India. Further goals include piloting proven European technologies, providing tools to assist such implementation and suggesting technical improvements.\n\nWork during the second year focused on evaluation of existing wastewater treatment plants in India, and on piloting European technologies. Project members conducted a qualitative evaluation of approximately 55 existing Indian wastewater treatment plants. Analysis is underway \u2013 around 15 plants have been selected for more detailed evaluation, for which a monitoring protocol has been defined.\n\nSecond-year work also saw continuation of feasibility studies for eight EU technologies. The extent of implementation varied. Two pilot exercises remain in planning stages. Most of the rest have been at least designed and tendered, and two are operational.\n\nThe SARASWATI project will result in evaluation of wastewater treatment technologies in India, and implementation of selected proven European technologies. The work should have an economic impact, contribute to the development of treatment technologies and assist policymakers.", null, "http://www.hydrok.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/160952.jpg", "fp7_105178_958728407"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TR9"}
