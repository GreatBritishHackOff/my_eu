By far the most promising replacement fuel for road transport is hydrogen because of its abundance, efficiency, low footprint for carbon and the absence of other harmful emissions. In 2015 it is expected that the number of hydrogen fuel installations will exceed a hundred thousand units.\n\nBecause hydrogen can react explosively with air there is inevitably public apprehension about using hydrogen as a mass market fuel that can inhibit wider commercialisation. Technical issues regarding hydrogen storage leakage are (i) the small size of the H molecule which causes it to diffuse through relatively open structured materials such as composites, and (ii) the phenomenon of Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE) which seriously reduces the strength of metals in extended contact with hydrogen. In order to greatly improve public confidence in the safety of hydrogen fuel, to address the technical issues, and thus facilitate the rapid commercialisation of hydrogen powered road transport, this project will develop a technology that will detect leaks and structural weakening of containment vessels caused by HE. This will prevent catastrophic failure of vessels which can actually occur before even small leaks arise. Particularly, the project goal is to develop novel tangential neutron radiography and acoustic emission (AE) techniques in combination for the reliable and cost effective continuous monitoring of the integrity of hydrogen storage tanks at central depots, service stations and on vehicles i.e. at every point of hydrogen storage along the supply chain from the production plant to the fuel tank on a hydrogen powered vehicle. The novelty of neutron radiography is that it exploits stored hydrogen as a contrast medium for the exposure of tank defects.", 32861.0, 938670.0, "SAFE H POWER", null, null, null, "http://www.safehpower.eu/", "http://www.pureenergycentre.com", null, "fp7_192112_949980462"], ["9QF", "Novel high performance, waterbased \u201chigh solids\u201dand bio-based industrial wood coating", "Bod Ayre Seaweed Products Limited", "The stringent Solvent Emission Directive (1999/13/EC), fully transposed in 2007, imposes limitations of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) due to the use of organic solvents in paints and varnishes. The most economical way of limiting VOC emission is using water-based coating formulas in which water replaces a substantial amount of the organic solvents traditionally used. Unfortunately, water-based formulas have deficient properties in comparison to solvent-based, primarily as a consequence of using water as a solvent: poor wood wetting, high grain raising, longer drying times, foam formation, insufficient glossy aspect, and deficient overall resistance. Coatings (varnishes and paints) are of key importance to the final products of our industries: coatings define the visual aspect and softness of the furniture piece, influencing its effective purchase; also the durability and resistance of a coating is a measure of the quality of the whole piece. The aim of NEXT1KOAT is to give European woodworking and furniture manufacturers a long-lasting solution by developing a first triple system (exterior uses impregnation; interior uses undercoat and topcoat) of one-component (1K) \u201chigh solids\u201d (>70%) water-based coatings. NEXT1KOAT will be produced by European SME coating manufacturers due to its affordable chemistry based on seaweed polymers, and it has been designed for European woodworking and furniture small and medium coating installations. NEXT1KOAT will have the following advanced properties: Less water content (30%), reduced drying time and less grain raising, improved wood wetting without the use of surfactants, less foam formation, more glossy final aspect and increased hardness.", 7825.0, 1964064.0, "NEXT1KOAT", null, null, null, "http://www.next1koat.eu/", "http://www.seaweedproducts.co.uk", null, "fp7_106527_958544495"]]}}, "outwardCode": "ZE2"}
