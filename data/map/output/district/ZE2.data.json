By far the most promising replacement fuel for road transport is hydrogen because of its abundance, efficiency, low footprint for carbon and the absence of other harmful emissions. In 2015 it is expected that the number of hydrogen fuel installations will exceed a hundred thousand units.\n\nBecause hydrogen can react explosively with air there is inevitably public apprehension about using hydrogen as a mass market fuel that can inhibit wider commercialisation. Technical issues regarding hydrogen storage leakage are (i) the small size of the H molecule which causes it to diffuse through relatively open structured materials such as composites, and (ii) the phenomenon of Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE) which seriously reduces the strength of metals in extended contact with hydrogen. In order to greatly improve public confidence in the safety of hydrogen fuel, to address the technical issues, and thus facilitate the rapid commercialisation of hydrogen powered road transport, this project will develop a technology that will detect leaks and structural weakening of containment vessels caused by HE. This will prevent catastrophic failure of vessels which can actually occur before even small leaks arise. Particularly, the project goal is to develop novel tangential neutron radiography and acoustic emission (AE) techniques in combination for the reliable and cost effective continuous monitoring of the integrity of hydrogen storage tanks at central depots, service stations and on vehicles i.e. at every point of hydrogen storage along the supply chain from the production plant to the fuel tank on a hydrogen powered vehicle. The novelty of neutron radiography is that it exploits stored hydrogen as a contrast medium for the exposure of tank defects.", 32861.0, 938670.0, "SAFE H POWER", null, null, null, "http://www.safehpower.eu/", "http://www.pureenergycentre.com", null, "fp7_192112_949980462"], ["9QF", "Novel high performance, waterbased \u201chigh solids\u201dand bio-based industrial wood coating", "Bod Ayre Seaweed Products Limited", "The stringent Solvent Emission Directive (1999/13/EC), fully transposed in 2007, imposes limitations of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) due to the use of organic solvents in paints and varnishes. The most economical way of limiting VOC emission is using water-based coating formulas in which water replaces a substantial amount of the organic solvents traditionally used. Unfortunately, water-based formulas have deficient properties in comparison to solvent-based, primarily as a consequence of using water as a solvent: poor wood wetting, high grain raising, longer drying times, foam formation, insufficient glossy aspect, and deficient overall resistance. Coatings (varnishes and paints) are of key importance to the final products of our industries: coatings define the visual aspect and softness of the furniture piece, influencing its effective purchase; also the durability and resistance of a coating is a measure of the quality of the whole piece.

This demonstrates our passion for looking at the world around us, however we want to extend our links to increase the European dimension.

In a new initiative, pupils from Primary 1 will learn and additional language other than their mother tongue on an ongoing daily basis to improve their language skills, furthermore in Primary 5 pupils will learn a second language other than their mother tongue on an ongoing basis.  Pupils will then have the opportunity to take their first and second foreign languages to qualification level in the Senior phase and will certainly have access to both languages during the Broad General Education which finishes in S3.  Teachers in Shetland are currently required to embed French into the day to day curriculum certainly at Primary 1 this year but most schools have engaged in a process where all primary year groups are receiving Modern Language teaching and learning.  Thus, it is imperative that as an Authority we provide appropriate training of the highest quality to our teaching staff across both sectors.  Primary colleagues are already being supported by Trainers and the 1+2 Coordinator who also have secured resources and appropriate training from outside professionals.  However, in discussions with colleagues it is apparent that one of the major challenges facing the effective implementation of this strategy is linguistic competence and crucially confidence.  To this end, as  part of a package of training opportunities, colleagues across Shetland and cross sectorally have been offered the opportunity to apply for funding to attend the LFEE immersion courses.  Many of our primary colleagues are already familiar with and have worked with Richard Tallaron of LFEE as he is acting as a principal trainer for the Authority.\r\nThe objective of this project is to ensure that colleagues are given effective pedagogy, strategies and linguistic competence to successfully and confidently deliver a language learning and teaching experience to our pupils of the highest possible quality.  Not only will it offer the participants the acquisition of skills they feel they need to do this but will also afford them the opportunity to establish support networks and professional dialogues with other schools and practitioners from across Britain and Europe.  In boosting, participants confidence it will also have a motivational effect in terms of the dissemination of information and good practice across the school, the cluster and ultimately across Shetland as a whole.  Quality learning and teaching experiences will motivate pupils to see Language learning as a worthwhile and meaningful activity and will ultimately ensure that our pupils acquire the skills and knowledge to competently and confidently communicate with others in Europe and around the world and will provide the skills that employers in the UK are desperately needing.  Teaching and learning will be informed by a greater appreciation of the diverse cultures and ways of life which should engender a more tolerant population and it will also offer both teachers and pupils the opportunity to compare and contrast different and similar strands in cultural experience in Europe as a whole.  A greater appreciation of what it is to be European and our role in it in this geographically isolated situation would also be a significant positive outcome.\r\nThis will also be advantageous in light of our twinning project with colleagues from Nice which is to be a mutually supportive and benefical project.  This is currently being developed by Thomas Chaurin, our global education colleagues and the 1+2 Coordinator.\r\nAt present we have 8 potential participants, two of whom are Headteachers along with 4 Primary colleagues who wish to build on  their linguistic competence and important cultural knowledge to bring \"life\" to their activities.  In addition, there are 2 Secondary colleagues who would like to improve their linguistic competence so they can be more effective in the classroom setting as well as being able to embed language learning and thus increased literacy into their day to day teaching.  It will also ensure that pupils are offered a greater variety and access to diverse employability skills and qualifications.\r\nMeetings with groups of staff and individual staff have already taken place to encourage attendance at these events, meetings will be planned to both provide support for the acquisition of transactional language and also to support colleagues with their individual needs before the training takes place.  After the course then colleagues will be supported to apply for Professional Recognition from the GTCS and also will be supported and encouraged to enter into professional dialogue with colleagues within their individual schools and then into the clusters.\r\nOur cluster currently had 95 members of staff and 463 pupils on its roll.", "http://www.brae.shetland.sch.uk", "Brae High School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035462_coordinator"], ["9LJ", "Language Training", "Whiteness Primary School", 7553.0, "From a teaching staff of 7 we have 4 teachers who are very keen to attend the immersion courses in France in the summer of 2016 (with one representing the school at a refresher course the following spring).  \r\n\r\nDue to changes in national policy on modern languages and a rethink of our school's aims and objectives for Global Learning, we are examining how we teach primary school children modern languages.
