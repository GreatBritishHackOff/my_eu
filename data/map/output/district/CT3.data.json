The general aim of the project is to contribute to draw an easy-going model for Film Literacy that could improve Film Literacy skills among the audience in order to foster Audience Development and Engagement towards film as an art form and as a cultural matter. The platform consists of an interactive narrative-based environment with game-based didactical resources integrated the user can interact with that will be both based on generic Film Literacy skills and on a set of EU films.The platform will also integrate a personal area with access to the survey for evaluation and quality assurance. Some sections of the platform will be accessible for free and others will have access reserved to schools. The platform is to be developed in at least 4 EU languages including english, french, italian and serbian.In the first part of the project, the partner institutions will share their expertise and best practices in order to draw a methodological didactical concept. On the basis of this methodological framework the platform and its content will be designed. The platform designed will be then technically realised by professional providers. The second part of the project is dedicated to testing: the platform will be tested by partners on students and teachers involved. Offline knowledge transfer activities will be held with teachers and students aimed to share the platform with them and to explain how it works and how it can be used for pedagogical purposes in class. Students and teachers will fulfil questionnaires of evaluation. Those data will be further collected and analysed.During the whole duration of the project, dissemination and communication take place.", "http://www.thefilmspace.org", null, "creative_577573-CREA-1-2016-1-IT-MED-AUDEV_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CT3"}
