The project will demonstrate how DSOs may enable all stakeholders to actively participate in the energy market and distribution grid management and develop and implement new business models, making use of new data management and consumer involvement approaches. Moreover, the consortium will demonstrate scalable and replicable solutions in an integrated environment that enables DSOs to plan and operate the network with a high share of DRES in a stable, secure and economic way, using flexibility inherently offered by specific technologies and by interaction with different stakeholders. To achieve these objectives, a complementary partnership covering the distribution system value chain has been established. The consortium includes three DSOs from different countries and their retailers, innovative ICT companies and equipment manufacturers as well as customers, a start-up in the area of community engagement and excellent R&D institutions. InteGrid\u2019s concepts and approaches are based on the these two elements: 1. the role of the DSO as system optimiser and as market facilitator and 2. the integration of existing demonstration activities in three different regions allowing to move from single solutions to an integrated management at a higher scale while focusing on the scalability and replicability considering current and evolving market (and regulatory) conditions.  The three conceptual pillars \u2013 proactive operational planning with DER, business models for flexible DER, information exchange between different power system actors \u2013 offer an opportunity to maximize the economic, societal and environmental gains from the combined integration of DRES and flexible DER.

To offer unique cross cultural opportunities for young people through European partnership and co-operation.\r\n2. To enhance social and cultural understanding and interaction between people of different genders, cultural and economic \r\n    backgrounds. This will take place through celebrating their own culture, engaging with other cultures and creating space for  \r\n    dialogue between groups to form relationships and understanding.\r\n3. To enhance European youth activities and structures through collaboration, partnership and the sharing of ideas and best\r\n    practice.\r\n4. To promote a healthy lifestyle by promoting participation in sport, active team games and outdoor activities, amongst young   \r\n    people who in turn promote this to children in the community.\r\n5. To promote volunteering and an awareness of the needs of disadvantaged groups, minorities and individuals.\r\n6.

Through the cultural celebrations and interactive seminars the young people will have extensive opportunities to share their own culture and learn about other cultures. This will highlight the need for unity and underline the harmful affects of disunity and the resulting unrest. The groups will have the opportunity to celebrate diversity and see how this doesn't mean disunity, but that a tolerant attitude fosters an understanding of diversity within unity. \r\n\r\nDeveloping skills: through group participation, leadership challenges and a wide range of experiences throughout the project in the preparation stage, (interviews and application) implementation stage, (leading peer learning and dialogue) and evaluation the stage (giving constructive feedback and reporting back to local youth groups) the participants will gain transferable skills that will help them with future study and employment opportunities.\r\n\r\nDeveloping a healthy lifestyle through outdoor activities and team sports plus a healthy and balanced diet being provided, the participants will enjoy a balanced and healthy lifestyle while participating in the program. \r\n\r\nEach participant will complete a questionnaire aimed at the quality of program and their own learning.

This action will respond to the strategy of enabling a new way of \"doing school\" through the continuous training of teachers and technical staff of the school; raise the quality of mobility experiences of the students and their certification of skills.\r\nBoth macro-actions will contribute to achieving the objective of consolidating the local network, regional and international level between the worlds of education and employment.\r\nSince the implementation of the internationalization plan in 2015 the Sarrocchi Institute established the relationships with training centers and international companies, (eg Foyle, Cap Ulysse) and created new contacts with companies able to identify the quality of training paths in accordance with the professional figures in output by the Institute. The Institute has consolidated relationships with local companies, available to participate in the candidate selection process and moments of the final evaluation of the project and its impact.\r\nFinally Sarrocchi identified the alternating training of teachers in tutoring and counseling for 2018-2019, supplementary to the mobility actions.\r\nThe project management actions correspond to established practices as:\r\n- Signing of the MOU for single professionals;\r\n- Information and selection of candidates and staff through the procedures included in the request for Vet Charter. For staff the selection criteria are as follows: experiences related to international mobility 50%, 20% language skills, 30% motivation and ability to impact at the return.\r\nDefinition of LA in collaboration with international partners\r\n- Mobilities for students and staff as following flows:\r\n25-06/ 2018: 25 students in UK, 10 students in France\r\n01-10/ 2018:  4 staff in UK and 3 staff in Malta\r\n24-06/ 2019:  15 students in UK and 15 students in Malta\r\n02-09/2019:   15 students in Spain\r\nEvaluation of the results, recognition and certification of skills and ECVET points. Development of Europass certificates and review of CV for students and staff.\r\n- Dissemination, project evaluation and impact by developing a survey to gather feedback from students and the participating staff mobility to be used to reprogram and center more accurately other mobility initiatives\r\nThere is no change of purpose than envisaged in the strategy of internationalization. Primary goal is to improve the professional skills, language and key to all the participants.
