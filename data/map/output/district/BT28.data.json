The project will demonstrate how DSOs may enable all stakeholders to actively participate in the energy market and distribution grid management and develop and implement new business models, making use of new data management and consumer involvement approaches. Moreover, the consortium will demonstrate scalable and replicable solutions in an integrated environment that enables DSOs to plan and operate the network with a high share of DRES in a stable, secure and economic way, using flexibility inherently offered by specific technologies and by interaction with different stakeholders. To achieve these objectives, a complementary partnership covering the distribution system value chain has been established. The consortium includes three DSOs from different countries and their retailers, innovative ICT companies and equipment manufacturers as well as customers, a start-up in the area of community engagement and excellent R&D institutions. InteGrid\u2019s concepts and approaches are based on the these two elements: 1. the role of the DSO as system optimiser and as market facilitator and 2. the integration of existing demonstration activities in three different regions allowing to move from single solutions to an integrated management at a higher scale while focusing on the scalability and replicability considering current and evolving market (and regulatory) conditions.

The participants will be 15 - 18 years old, male and female and from diverse backgrounds and cultures with at least British and Irish culture represented in the Northern Ireland group and Spanish and Catalan cultures represented in the Spanish group. There will be 48 participants: 24 from Eluzai and 24 from Exodus, reflecting the scale and capacity of the organisations. \r\nMany of the participants face obstacles in taking part in this type of project, especially economic and cultural obstacles with at least half of the participants in this category. \r\n\r\nThe program will include preparation in small groups where the participants can shape the program and prepare to lead, especially focusing on planning the 'Impact' community events which they will run during the program in the Salou Community. \r\n\r\nThe program focuses on informal and non-formal learning with interactive seminars, peer to peer activities, discussion small groups and high energy, fun team builders. The project will focus on building a culture of creativity, innovation, leadership, selflessness, inclusivity and building deep relationships, all skills which young people need for thriving in a multicultural European context.\r\n\r\nThe follow up will include activities to ensure learning from the participants last long beyond the end of the project with participants having the opportunity to keep in touch, meet again as a small group, take part in a recommissioning service to share highlights with parents, peers and supporters in their own community and receive the opportunity to volunteer in Exodus or Eluzai in future projects. \r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\n\r\n1. To offer unique cross cultural opportunities for young people through European partnership and co-operation.\r\n2. To enhance social and cultural understanding and interaction between people of different genders, cultural and economic backgrounds. This will take place through celebrating their own culture, engaging with other cultures and creating space for dialogue between groups to form relationships and understanding.\r\n3.

To foster skills and competencies  within the participants which will promote entrepreneurial attitudes and be relevant for, as well  as enhance, job applications.\r\n\r\nImpact and results:\r\n\r\nCultural awareness and Inclusivity:  through shared activities involving Northern Ireland and Spain strong, mutually respectful relationships will be formed. Through the cultural celebrations and interactive seminars the young people will have extensive opportunities to share their own culture and learn about other cultures. This will highlight the need for unity and underline the harmful affects of disunity and the resulting unrest. The groups will have the opportunity to celebrate diversity and see how this doesn't mean disunity, but that a tolerant attitude fosters an understanding of diversity within unity. \r\n\r\nDeveloping skills: through group participation, leadership challenges and a wide range of experiences throughout the project in the preparation stage, (interviews and application) implementation stage, (leading peer learning and dialogue) and evaluation the stage (giving constructive feedback and reporting back to local youth groups) the participants will gain transferable skills that will help them with future study and employment opportunities.\r\n\r\nDeveloping a healthy lifestyle through outdoor activities and team sports plus a healthy and balanced diet being provided, the participants will enjoy a balanced and healthy lifestyle while participating in the program. \r\n\r\nEach participant will complete a questionnaire aimed at the quality of program and their own learning. These results will be collated by Exodus and shared with all leaders. The results will shape future youth exchanges, leaders training initiatives and other partnership ideas between Exodus and Eluzai, increasing the long term impact on the organisations.\r\nThe participants will all also be given opportunities to volunteer and take part in leaders training programs, increasing the long term impact of the project on the individuals.", "http://www.exodusonline.org.uk", "Exodus Trust", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA105-047675_coordinator"], ["1XE", "Crecemos con Europa", "R.E.Gibb Internacional", 58994.0, "The CIFP Hesp\u00e9rides is a Vocational Training Centre which, since its creation, has committed itself to the importance of achieving that the students have higher job prospects beyond our borders. The certainty that the best way to pass on this concern to them is that the students discover for themselves the great range of choices in the rest of the European countries, is the one that inspires us to carry out our new internationalisation strategy promoting our mission, vision and values regarding cooperation and international development. \r\nFrom the Centre, it is more and more evident that, once the vocational training programmes end, there is a lack of awareness about the working systems in other countries among both the students and the teachers which makes it difficult their employability. It has been also discovered that the number of students who start looking for a job actively in a different country is almost insignificant, that there is a low level of foreign language knowledge and a relative lack of motivation in improving these foreign language skills. \r\nAs a consequence of this Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats Analysis (SWOT) and the assessment of the surveys carried out among students and teachers in our centre about the level of satisfaction and quality of our teaching process by means of the Quality Management system ISO-9001, it has been detected that both the students and teachers need to increase their knowledge, expectations and working experience to an international level \r\nHowever, we highlight, as an innovation, that after some years since the implementation of the Bilingual programmes of Microcomputing and Networks, Subaquatic and Hyperbaric operations and Maritime Transport and Deep-sea Fishing, the current concerns and the future interests of the students and the teaching staff to gain professional training in productive atmospheres in other countries have been quadrupled. As a result of this evaluation regarding last year and the  publicity campaign of the program carried out by the E+ committee since the beginning of the course, the centre is working hard on applying for more Erasmus mobilities for students, teaching staff and pupils with the certificate in Professionalism, and encourage the rest of the vocational training programmes in the centre. \r\nFor this reason, the Centre needs to meet these needs identified in our analysis by means of your internationalisation project. \r\nThe presence of several collaborating partners throughout out extensive career related to these project guarantees the success in the internship that will take place in the different enterprises in Norway, England, Germany, France and Ireland, and, at the same time, the international character of new dimension will be strongly supported. For this project, we can also take into consideration the support of our new collaborating partner, which is the Ardentia Marine S.L. enterprise (Portugal) that carries out a complete service for the management of Subaquatic operations, the development of maritime rescue operations and the fight against pollution. \r\nIn terms of the activities, fourteen two-month student mobilities (two for each professional family in the centre that will take place during the second course of the Intermediate Vocational Training Programme  and the Certificate of Professionalism, with ages between 16 and 50 years old) will be carried out in entreprises to obtain in-depth knowledge about how they operate and participate in an immersion programme. These mobilities will take place in the Norwegian training ship Statsraad Lehmkuhl, the German training ship Alexander von Humboldt II, the Bergen Maritime Skole regarding Computing, the IMC Diving in Norway for Subaquatic and Hyperbaric operations, and the REGibb International which is a leading company in innovating treatments and equipments for personal beauty and hairdressing. In addition, two one-year Erasmus+Pro mobilities will take place thanks to the IMC Diving entreprise which deals with Subaquatic and Hyperbaric operations and is a top company in the field in its country. In fact, IMC Diving has confirmed us its collaboration and interest in this new type of mobilities, describing them as innovating and as a big opportunity for out students. \r\nFinally, five mobilities for the teaching staff will also take place to increase their linguistic skills related to the very technical aspects that are present in our productive sector. These mobilities will also provide them with the opportunity to observe the teaching and the working methodology in the maritime, the subaquatic operations, the computing and the personal beauty enterprises analysis in this way the possible adaptation of the employee to the centre. This process will increase the motivation among the teachers to continue taking part in the process of educational innovation in our centre for its Vocational Training Programmes in which there is a high need of a European impulse.", "http://www.regibbinternational.co.uk/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA116-048653_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT28"}
