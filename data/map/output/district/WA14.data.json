COSIGN aims to move away from today's vendor specific, manually controlled, performance and scale limited DCs towards scalable DC solutions able to support future-proof dynamic, on-demand, low-latency, energy efficient and ultra-high bandwidth DC solutions. COSIGN introduces disruptive transformations in the data plane, significant advances to the control plane and major innovations in the DC virtualization and service orchestration:\u0095 In the DC Data Plane, COSIGN will deliver an entirely-optical solution enabling scalable top-of-rack switches, ultra-low latency and high volume DC interconnects with high spatial dimensioning.\u0095 In the DC Control Plane, COSIGN will build upon and extend the Software Defined Networks (SDN) paradigm leveraging capabilities from high-performance optical technologies while developing technology agnostic protocols for software/user defined routing and control. \u0095 For the DC Management and Orchestration, COSIGN will implement a coherent framework for optical network and IT infrastructure abstraction, virtualization and end-to-end service orchestration.COSIGN brings together a unique combination of skills and expertise able to deliver, for the first time, a coordinated hardware and software architecture, which will guarantee the scale and performance required for future DCs.

This information will enable improved control and management, resulting in real time synchronization between forces on the ground (police, rescue, firefighters) and out-of-theater command and control centers (C&amp;C). The approach guiding the ESS project is based on the fusion of variable forms of field-derived data within a central system which will then provide information analysis and decision support applications at designated C&amp;C locations. To do this, ESS will achieve the following objectives: i) Improvement of front end data collection technologies (radioactivity, bio-chemical, audio-video, etc.) installed both on portable and fixed platforms, providing a flexible yet comprehensive coverage of the affected area; ii) this data will then be fused and analyzed to provide real-time decision support; iii) ESS will make these resources readily available to commanders through the use of easily accessible web-portals. Thus, ESS will minimize the uncertainty that characterizes crisis events, thereby limiting their scope. The ESS will then be field tested at three different scenarios, including a stadium evacuation, a forest fire and toxic waste dump accidents. The ESS consortium consists of 19 partners that will bring together a wide spectrum of European SME\u2019s, industrial and academic partners from a variety of fields, ranging from sensor design and electronic communications to civil protection. The resulting cooperation will help provide an added measure of security to European citizens.

Often, collaboration between on-site rescuers and off-site crisis managers is not at its best when every minute counts to save lives and safeguard assets.   \n\nAgainst this backdrop, the EU-funded project 'Emergency support system' (ESS) worked to finalise a set of real-time technologies to communicate critical emergency information to crisis managers much more efficiently. To achieve its aims, the project is bringing together 19 partners from different fields, including academia, industry, civil protection and technology companies.  \n \nThe proposed technology solution enhances synchronisation between ground forces (e.g. police, firefighters) with command and control centres. This is done by fusing different field data to provide information analysis and decision support. Specifically, the developed technology improves front-end collection of data such as audio, video, radioactivity levels and biochemical parameters. It then combines and analyses the data to enhance decision support and transmit it to command centres through web-based means, minimising uncertainty in crisis events.   \n\nESS' technology suite is being tested in different environments, namely in a forest fire, a toxic waste accident and in the evacuation of a stadium.  \n\nThe various completed project components include the data collection tool, data fusion system, ESS portal and PDA application.
