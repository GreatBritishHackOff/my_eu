The concept invokes a series of barriers, both engineered and natural, between the waste and the surface. Achieving this concept is the primary objective of all disposal programmes, from site appraisal and characterisation to repository design and construction. However, the performance of the repository as a whole (waste, buffer, engineering disturbed zone, host rock), and in particular its gas transport properties, are still poorly understood. Issues still to be adequately examined that relate to understanding basic processes include: dilational versus visco-capillary flow mechanisms; long-term integrity of seals, in particular gas flow along contacts; role of the EDZ as a conduit for preferential flow; laboratory to field up-scaling. Understanding gas generation and migration is thus vital in the quantitative assessment of repositories and is the focus of the research in this proposal for an integrated, multi-disciplinary project.  The FORGE proposal is for a pan-European project with links to international radioactive waste management organisations, regulators and academia, specifically designed to tackle the key research issues associated with the generation and movement of repository gasses. Of particular importance are the long-term performance of bentonite buffers, plastic clays, indurated mudrocks and crystalline formations.

The reference solution for their long-term management is disposal in engineered facilities. But burial in these structures built deep below the surface to contain the waste through both natural and engineered barriers is not the end of the story.\n\nOver time, metal corrosion and radiolysis produce a variety of gases, including hydrogen. Some waste may also contain organic material that generates methane and carbon dioxide as it decomposes. Understanding where these gases form and how they move through the repository is important to long-term safety and is the topic of the EU-funded project 'Fate of repository gases' (http://www.bgs.ac.uk/forge/ (FORGE)).\n\nScientists approached this problem through a combination of laboratory experiments and large-scale field tests at underground research laboratories. As experiments can only be successfully operated for a few years at a time, they also used mathematical modelling of potential future conditions to get the complete picture. Modellers and experimentalists exchanged their data to get the best possible results.\n\nThe FORGE team examined how irradiation affects bentonite backfill materials in contact with metal under simulated repository conditions, to determine the rate of hydrogen production. The transport of gas through the engineered parts of a repository was studied in full-scale experiments. These covered bentonite-based and cement-based backfills as well as the interface between the host rock clay and backfill materials.\n\nLab-scale and full-scale laboratory experiments were also carried out to improve our understanding of gas flows through fractures in clay host rocks and the effect of stress on this.

During operation, the graphite and other carbonaceous materials like carbon brick, pyrocarbon and silicon carbide coatings are contaminated by fission products and neutron activation. These irradiated carbonaceous wastes are problematic due to their content of long-lived radioisotopes (e.g. Carbon14, Chlorine 36) and due to their large volumes. About 250000 t of i-carbon are existing, worldwide. Acceptable solutions have not yet been established to handle this kind of waste. This fact also represents a significant drawback for the market introduction of graphite-moderated reactors like Very/High-Temperature Reactors (V/HTR) as a promising Generation IV system candidate.  Graphite moderated reactors represent the very first generation of nuclear reactors and therefore need to be decommissioned ahead of other reactor types which evolved later. Presently, accelerated decommissioning of GCR and RBMK and subsequent disposal of i-graphite is the preferred option for not leaving this waste as a legacy for future generations.

One of the challenges is to take into account initial heterogeneities introduced in the system by conception with a combination of block and pellets or due to the size of the bentonite component (several 100 m3). It will require a more detailed understanding of material properties, of the fundamental processes that lead to homogenisation, of the role of scale effects and improved capabilities for numerical modelling.

The overall driver for the project is the assessment cases that will be defined at the onset of the project (WP1). The quantitative models currently available are not fully able to represent all the complexities of the evolution of an installed bentonite. A substantial effort is needed to improve both the conceptual approaches and the numerical solutions in the current models (WP3). The updated/newly developed models need to be tested and verified using available data (WP5).  There are some areas where fundamental data and the understanding of materials are incomplete. An efficient experimental programme will support model development and testing (WP4). There is already a large database from experiments performed within EC projects and national programmes, both laboratory and Underground Research Laboratory (URL) experiments. Many of the tests have been performed with other purposes in mind, but the results can be used in the Beacon project. The objective of WP2 is to collect the relevant information and process it to a level where it can be used in this project", 54337.0, 3542021.0, "Beacon", null, null, null, null, "http://www.nda.gov.uk", null, "h2020_210819_934057136"], ["3HU", "Towards a Joint Programming on Radioactive Waste Disposal", "Radioactive Waste Management Limited", "The goal of this project is to prepare the setting up of a \u201cJoint Programming on Radioactive Waste Disposal\u201d that would be established to coordinate at the European level, national research programmes and the associated research and development (R&D) activities on geological disposal for high activity long lived radioactive waste. This action includes reviewing of all strategic aspects linked to a stepwise move towards a Joint Programming in this field.\nThis project will involve organisations that are active in the safety, management and disposal of radioactive waste and research entities.\nThe first step of this project will be to engage in discussion with Member States representatives in order to clarify the organisation of their national R&D consistent with the implementation of the Council Directive. The second step will be to identify existing research programmes that could contribute to the identification of common scientific objectives and activities as well as specific aspects that the organisations would like to develop in the Joint Programme. The third step will be to draft the joint \u201cProgramme Document\u201d that should be the technical background of the Joint Programming. \nThe outcomes of the project will be (i) a preliminary evaluation of a potential in-kind and financial commitment of organisations, (ii) a \u201cProgramme Document\u201d consisting of large programmes focused on key priorities of WMOs, TSOs side and Research Entities and (iii) a \u201cSummary report\u201d comprising a proposal for the implementation of this Joint Programming.\nThis action will lead to the further integration of the interested research community and hence help to maintain and develop the EU leadership in knowledge and expertise for innovative radioactive waste management solutions that effectively matches public expectations.

The work is established to understand what should be monitored within the frame of the wider safety cases and to provide methodology on how monitoring information can be used to support decision making and to plan for responding to monitoring results. Research and development work aims to improve and develop innovative repository monitoring techniques (wireless data transmission, alternative power supply sources, new sensors, geophysical methods) from the proof of feasibility stage to the technology development and demonstration phase. Innovative technical solutions facilitate the integration and flexibility of required monitoring components to ease the final implementation and adaptation of the monitoring system.
