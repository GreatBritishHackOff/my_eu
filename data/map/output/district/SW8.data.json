With continued European growth in demand for water, finite reservoirs of readily-treatable water, rising energy costs and increased environmental legislation, EU industry is experiencing significant competitive threats with regard to cost-efficient supply and treatment of water.\n\nMicrobial Fuel Cells (MFCs) utilise electrochemically-active microbes to convert the inherent energy of organic chemical bonds to electrical energy. MFCs encompass unique features that offer advantages for the treatment of wastewater, including: efficient electricity generation; minimal sludge formation; operation at low temperature; and modular cell design, enabling operation at small scale and customisation to specific end-user requirements.\n\nA core group of SMEs have identified a unique opportunity to advance MFC technology for industrial wastewater treatment, thereby generating sustainable and competitive business growth. Key innovations include MFC integration with photocatalytic advanced oxidation and a membraneless MFC air cathode design; and a scalable cost-efficient MFC and architecture design incorporating innovative process monitoring & control strategies. System features and benefits include:\n\n- Capital cost equivalence with existing aerobic treatment solutions\n- Significant operational cost savings, realised through:\n- Recovery of organic content as electrical energy & achieving system sustainability (self-powering);\n- Enhanced treatment efficiency enabling water reuse for on-site non-potable applications;\n- Significant cost reductions for sludge disposal and treated wastewater discharge to sewer\n- Flexible design and operation customised to specific end-user (sector) requirements and enabling treatment of wastewaters of varying composition and containing hazardous micropollutants\n\nThe project will result in a pilot-scale MFC system demonstrated for a target industrial wastewater.

Such attacks might be jointly imparted so as to affect large portions of the European grid, make repair difficult and cause huge societal impact. The outstanding importance and the far more complex level of interconnectivity of electricity distribution / transmission / generation \u2013 compared to the supply through other energy carriers - makes the development of a highly focused toolkit for its protection an essential and urgent task.

This DSS enables to:\n\u2022 identify the vulnerabilities and to detect their origins,\n\u2022 estimate the damage / impact of real or simulated network failures,\n\u2022 identify the possible measures for prevention of outages and acceleration of automatic restoration,\n\u2022 rank these measures according to their effectiveness and their cost-benefit ratios,\n\u2022 carry out contingency analyses of the transmission / distribution network and generation facilities,\n\u2022 detect long-term erroneous trends in the security of energy supply and counteract against them by adjusting the market mechanisms.\nThere do not exist State-of-the-Art approaches incorporating all of these core dimensions of the problem: the increase in complexity of the security of energy supply requires a comprehensive and multi-disciplinary solution.
