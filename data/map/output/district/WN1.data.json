The College will engage and recruit learners from the Sports department, Travel and Tourism and Catering and Hospitality to complete work placements in Portugal, Italy and France.\r\n\r\nThe main aim of the project is to provide participants with the opportunity to experience a different culture and gain relevant knowledge and skills for their chosen career.  The objectives of the project are:\r\n\r\n\u2022 To provide students with an enhanced learning experience allowing them to gain knowledge and skills to help them achieve their qualification and improve their employability.\r\n\u2022 To enhance their existing vocational programme by providing an innovative opportunity for participants to experience a different culture and way of learning and working. \r\n\u2022 To enable participants to experience an exciting and different pedagogical approach to learning and work experience, providing them with the relevant skills and knowledge sought by employers.\r\n\r\nThe industries the participants are looking to enter are highly competitive and the College is looking to give them every possible opportunity to gain an advantage to achieve and succeed. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Football students will undertake a two week football coaching work experience placement with Sporting Lisboa E Benfica, a Football Club in Lisbon, Portugal.  Working with this partner will give the participants the opportunity to engage with an organisation operating in the highest echelon within their chosen field of study. Participants will benefit from learning and implementing different philosophies and ways of coaching.  This will improve their employability by giving them a competitive advantage when applying for jobs within the UK and abroad.  Participants will also develop their interpersonal skills through cultural and language training prior to their visit and through interaction with the Portuguese during their placement, adding additional value to the project.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Rugby students will undertake a two week rugby training camp in South France with Catalan Tours, who work closely with the professional rugby club Catalan Dragons. They will use specialist Olympic equipment, have access to state-of-the-art facilities and high altitude training that is unique to the geographical area. They will observe first team training as well as training with the youth academy and taking part in competitive matches against local teams.  They will benefit greatly from their experience in France by improving their training and coaching knowledge and being provided with a vital insight into the challenges of being a professional athlete.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Sports students undertaking work placements at the ski resort will be provided with the opportunity to work within different areas of the resort.  They will be undertaking activities which will assist them in completing their qualification.  Such activities include allowing participants to shadow ski instructors and work in the gym therefore enhancing their ability in coaching and analysing sports performances.  They will be given the opportunity to organise evening sporting activities which will assist them in completing units in organising sporting events and they will be able to contribute towards units involving outdoor adventurous activities and the work placement element of their course.  Students will also develop new language skills which will help them communicate on their placement.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Travel and Tourism and Catering and Hospitality students will attend work placements in Braga in Portugal with a company called Braga Mob who specialise in delivering youth mobility projects in the area. They will undertake work placements in their chosen fields with local employers. They will have the opportunity to work in different roles and be taught hands-on, practical skills as they work with professionals from their chosen occupational field. They will be mentored one-to-one to ensure that all of their needs are met and that their experience is as useful and rewarding as possible.\r\n\r\nAs a partnership Wigan and Leigh College and Sport Lisboa e Benfica will work together to ensure an appropriate placement is provided with the necessary support mechanisms in place.  Roles and responsibilities will be allocated accordingly and through effective communication and co-operation will ensure participants benefit greatly from this opportunity.  It is expected that participants will return from their placement having gained valuable knowledge and skills to enable them to achieve their qualification and a wealth of experience to help them progress into their chosen career.  It is envisaged that the partnership will develop and benefit all organisations in many ways from the engagement of new learners to improving stakeholder relationships.", "http://www.wigan-leigh.ac.uk", "Wigan and Leigh College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036366_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WN1"}
