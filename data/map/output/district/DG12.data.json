It responds to one of DAREIC's missions : promotion of European and international mobility of the academy.\r\nThe GIP \"Lifelong Learning\" is the promoter of the project: it ensures the financial aspects and the DAREIC the administrative and pedagogical aspects that it shares with the members of the steering committee, namely pedagogical advisers of primary school , inspectors of secondary school and an inspector, delegate to continuing education for the Nancy-Metz Acad\u00e9mie.\r\nThe Nancy-Metz Academie has a unique geographical situation because it has three border countries, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg and the flow of frontier workers is very important and will remain so if \"lorrains\" people can justify sufficient language skills. The MIRABEEL 2 project responds in terms of language learning to the objectives and priorities set out in the 2014-2018 academic project, namely to enable each pupils to learn a foreign language at an early stage in school, to promote the setting up innovative and effective pedagogical devices, making the international component of the project of establishment a lever of collective ambition and developing the teaching of different subjects in a foreign language. The aim is to ensure that, thanks to European mobility, the linguistic and cultural competences of primary school teachers and teachers of non-linguistic subjects at secondary school are discovered, innovative teaching methods for foreign language teaching and other subjects  teaching in foreign language, new pedagogical tools, other time schedules, other evaluation systems, and other learning organizations in different European school systems.\r\nThe MIRABEEL 2 consortium combines 23 primary schools, 4 colleges and 15 secondary schools, most of which offer one or more European sections. It will organize 260 mobilities of teachers , trainers, pedagogical advisers, teachers of foreign languages, teachers of non-linguistic disciplines who have foreign language certification and teachers who wish to teach their discipline in a foreign language . These mobilities are distributed as follows: 99 mobilities for structured courses and 161 mobilities for job-shadowing. They will take place over a period of 5 to 12 days, in 16 European countries, over a period of 2 years.\r\nFor the structured courses, the participants will use the training organizations or training institutes they will choose according to the linguistic and intercultural program they propose. The job-shadowings will take place in partner schools  that the sending schools have already identified or that relay organizations in different European countries, partners of the DAREIC, will offer them within the framework of the chosen theme. The internship program will be established in liaison with the steering committee.\r\nWithin this committee, the DAREIC and the GIP, with their experience of cooperation on grouped mobility projects, will monitor and coordinate the project; They will facilitate the pooling of tools to enable a better implementation, from the point of view of financial and administrative management as well as the pedagogical, cultural and linguistic preparation, if necessary, or evaluation. The DAREIC will propose a continuous follow-up and accompaniment of the schools at all the stages of the project.\r\nThis consortium will allow sending schools to respond to their European development plan either by providing language instruction in primary schools with B2 level teachers or by developing innovative pedagogies in foreign language teaching and in other differents subjects teaching in foreign language both in primary school and in secondary school, and in the long term, by having, in the lyc\u00e9es which have one or more European sections, several teachers who will pass the certification in foreign language in order to be able to teach all or part of their discipline in foreign language.\r\nThe pedagogical advisers, trainers and inspectors will use the methods, tools, practices especially related to the digital to propose renewed trainings to all the teachers of the Nancy-Metz Acad\u00e9mie .\r\nParticipants in job-shadowing will establish new partnerships with European schools that will ultimately develop new virtual or physical mobility for pupils or strategic Erasmus + partnerships projects.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA101-036403_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DG12"}
