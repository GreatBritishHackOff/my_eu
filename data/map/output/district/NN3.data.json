But these systems can only achieve efficiencies of around 45 to 50%, pose safety risks as the use high voltages (5kV) and the magnetrons have a short lifespan requiring frequent replacement. Magnetron technology does not allow for the automatic adjustment of power level to match the load variations. These limitations have a huge cost to industrial microwave processes and there are calls for more efficient solutions.  Across Europe, microwaves consume over 9.6 TWh of electrical energy annually.\nF&M seeks to upscale its 200W solid state continuous wave microwave system to address these limitations. The 1kW gallium nitride based microwave system will save at least 25% on electricity consumption, operate at more than 70% efficiency, allow automatic adjustment of power level in response to load variations and significantly reduce equipment size. It will also provide increased lifespan eliminating the need for frequent and costly replacements.  With all these excellent features and performance advantages, our product also comes at a very competitive cost to the user which lies in the same range with the magnetron systems.\nSolid state microwave technology can be used in moisture meters, medical applications like RF-Surgery, and microwave ovens for the manufacture of electronic assemblies. It also offers opportunity for automatic power matching that enhances energy efficiency and faster processing speeds. Full adoption of our technology in both domestic and industrial microwave ovens would lead to potential energy savings of 6.74TWh of electrical power across Europe.", 286490.0, 1114978.0, "CLEAN-HEAT", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_197136_935522418"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9EH", "Language development through play and inclusion", "Standens Barn Primary School", 17344.0, "We are a British school and have 400 children in our school.  We are set in an urban context in the middle of England, within the town of Northampton. We have rapidly expanded over the last 5 years. Our school community has changed significantly in that time with our demographic changing from 5% of the children speaking English as an Additional Language to 35%. At the same time, the percentage of children from Minority Ethnic Groups has changed from 15% to over 50%.  This large increase is mainly from families coming in from European Countries. The number of children entitled to Free School Meals is above the national average. We have a very strong ethos based upon the core values of being Brave, Enthusiastic, Safe and Thoughtful. This forms part of our vision which is build upon and academic and social aims for each child in the school.\r\nWe believe that education is seen as relevant when it is delivered in an exciting and stimulating way.  We encourage children to be creative, to try out ideas and explore their learning.  We also believe that this is best achieved alongside the teaching of reading, writing and mathematical concepts in order for the children to have a good grasp of the basics. \r\nOur motto supports us with this work and the 'My Best, Your Best, Our Best' is about the children developing as individuals and together and we have a great team here to help your child do that. \r\nTherefore, our project is to further develop the  learning our children with EAL and SEND primarily and this will build in the effective strategies we already have in place as identified by Ofsted.  This is alongside the continued development of speaking and listening and reading and writing skills, ensuring that this development is rapid and leads to good outcomes for the children. \r\nThe project main objectives are:\r\nTo develop and enhance the early year provision\r\nTo develop an understanding of curricula in other country\r\nTo develop outdoor learning and specifically forest learning\r\nTo develop our SEN provision\r\nTo develop strategies for increasing literacy and language skills\r\nTo develop  links in Europe\r\nThe main activities chosen for this project are a number of structured training courses in Europe:\r\n- Understanding the Finnish Education System, Joensuu, Finland\r\n- Visual Narrative in teaching Literacy and Languages, Malaga, Spain\r\n- Teaching and Learning in Special Education: The Icelandic Perspective, Reykjavik, Iceland\r\n- Forest learning, Lidkoping and Vara, Sweden\r\n10 staff over 24 months will take part in these structured courses chosen on their role,within the school, motivation and ability to impact and change provision.\r\nThe outcomes we are looking for include the children improving their vocabulary, developing good learning learning behaviours such as language and thinking skills and those associated with the Prime areas of learning. In turn this will lead to a greater ability to  decode words and apply reading skills and using these to aid writing. We believe that this unique course opportunity will provide the relevant skills and knowledge to not only improve our current performance, but to enhance the vocabulary development of children with EAL primarily and all children in turn. \r\nCombining existing teaching approaches with those promoted through the Finnish model and through technologies course in Spain to enhance learning. This will then be further developed in Sweden  through the outdoor learning approaches and will enhance and develop the work we started in September 2016, from the training we had on play learning.  These outcomes will be shared by other teachers and course trainers and will support the children in developing positive learning behaviours that can be utilised as part of their life long learning.\r\nThis would involve staff and governors undertaking research into  the various education systems and using this overarching framework to understand how visual literacy, inclusive technologies and outdoor learning can all contribute to language acquisition.\r\nThrough the school blog and online community they would record their findings and then upon their return they would implement elements into their own practice as part of a piece of research to see if this helps us achieve the outcomes mentioned above. \r\nWe aim to create a collaborative research model so that information can be shared between schools and between countries, through the use of ICT and to build up an block of evidence that is researched based. Information can then be disseminated with other local schools.\r\nOur enhanced provision will impact on our school's teaching and learning in the future and will provide our children and communities with skills to better integrate and live in today's  multicultural society.", "http://www.standens.northants.sch.uk", "Standens Barn Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035500_coordinator"], ["2NS", "Approaches to Nurture and Well being within a European school context", "Northampton Primary Academy Trust", 62643.0, "The Northampton Primary Academy Trust Partnership  is a collaboration of 7 primary schools.\r\nWe are  responsible for approx 2780  children.
