In the light of the environmental relevance of chitins and lignins (as natural compounds recalcitrant to degradation) and halogenated aliphatic and aromatic compounds (anthropogenic recalcitrant compounds), the enzymatic activities that we will target are functions able to degrade these compounds. A database of gene functions will be established and maintained. Next to its great relevance to environmental biotechnology including bioremediation, a spin-off of the work will be the discovery of novel biocatalytic functions of industrial relevance. We will in particular address the catabolic potential that is encoded by the mobilome, the collective pool of mobile genetic elements in the microbiota. We will further apply high-throughput (454-based) sequencing to rapidly unravel the metabolic complement in this mobile gene pool. The project brings together a suite of 15 contractors across Europe, encompassing 21 laboratories spread over 11 copuntries and including 4 SMEs.  Most of the partners are renowned laboratories which have vast experience in metagenomics of environmental samples, biotechnology, enzymology, bioinformatics, the mobilome, waste management and bioremediation and enzyme production.", 59596.0, 6866298.0, "METAEXPLORE", "Nature's enzymes go to work in industry", "Certain natural and synthetic compounds are resistant to degradation by natural enzymes. Scientists have conducted comprehensive genetic screening of aquatic and terrestrial organisms to find and design the appropriate enzymes for the recalcitrant molecules.", "Bioremediation has been used successfully for oil spills, chlorinated solvents and pesticides, but many compounds are resistant to degradation (recalcitrant). Using genetic material from the EU-funded project 'Metagenomics for bioexploration - Tools and application' (http://www.rug.nl/research/metaexplore/ (METAEXPLORE)) has helped to develop a wide range of improved enzymes.\n\nIn particular, the researchers focused on the naturally recalcitrant molecules chitin and lignin. Anthropogenic-sourced materials include halogenated and organic compounds as well as xenobiotic compounds foreign to biological systems, herbicides for example.\n\nFollowing pre-screening of a large number of terrestrial and aquatic habitats with specially developed tools, the team cloned and sequenced promising enzymes from selected environments. A total of nine metagenomic libraries were produced from selected environmental habitats. A software platform (MetaSAMS) with search routines, genomic mapping and tools for comparative analysis of metagenomics data has been successfully developed. All data warehouses contain functional genes and operons to provide genetic resources for future explorations.\n\nDerived from industrial demand, these collections were screened for improved enzymes, including novel chitinases, laccases/ligninases, and aerobic and anaerobic dehalogenases. Another target was the beta-amino transferring enzyme family involved in the production of a wide range of pharmaceuticals.\n\nA large proportion of the gene sequences coding for the enzymes are housed on the mobile genetic element of microbes, the mobilome. After characterisation of structure and function and expression in suitable hosts, the researchers extended their activities of the cream of the enzymes for use in industry using directed evolution.\n\nMETAEXPLORE deliverables are expected to have an important impact on sustainability and EU environmental goals. Alternative raw materials are needed for the future supply of energy and chemicals. Recalcitrant waste materials like lignin and chitin contain various building blocks for chemical production. Disposal of waste is expensive and creates numerous environmental and public health challenges.\n\nBioremediation not only helps keep nature clean in a natural way, it is also a low-energy process for decontamination of water and soil.

The NEMESIS model builds on a combination of innovative pedagogies and learning models, open technologies and participatory relations and processes. It also creates bridges between the learning communities and real world social innovation experiences by creating a European wide community of social innovation practitioners eager to interact with students, facilitating interdisciplinary and intergenerational learning. To foster its potential to scale and be adopted by educational institutions around Europe, the project develops a Social Innovation Open Learning Platform to grant access to the specific educational model and resources to all with emphasis on those from disadvantaged environments. This platform also facilitates the creation of a Community of Practice of teachers, school leaders and relevant stakeholders willing to break silos, engage in dialogue, drive organizational change and experience the value of the NEMESIS educational model.

BFF have established that the required knowledge cannot be acquired using the learning services available at national level. It has been noted that the amount of business disputes submitted to civil courts considerably lengthens the resolution process and increases the cost of settlement. In view of the incurred process length and high level of expenses, BFF has seen an increase of queries regarding options of mediation and support for out of court settlement of business conflicts. Requests have come from a wide range of business representatives not limited to franchising. All have expressed their dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs and the legalistic approach. We believe that this method of efficient business conflicts resolution is required and have turned to business mediation as a solution. Business relations among Franchiser and Franchisee are explicitly asymmetric. BFF considers that deeper knowledge and skills of narrative coaching are needed to ensure that equal support is provided to both sides in franchise. That would include support on mobilizing internal and attracting external resources, conceptualizing, managing and initiating business processes at a new level of quality. The attention of BFF has been drawn towards social entrepreneurship widely spread in the EU and its offered possibilities of qualitative growth in form of Social licensing or franchise. While the concept of social entrepreneurship is yet to be defined by Latvian legislator, this Project aims to research EU\u2019s social entrepreneurship experiences. The outcomes of the research would contribute to the facilitation of such enterprise establishment and development at national level. It would drive the further growth of social entrepreneurship facilitated by development social franchising or licensing models. To enable the activities, we would have to become knowledgeable and skillful in social enterprise management and the opportunities for improvement, understand the legal context of social enterprise; carry out a detailed examination of real life examples of social enterprise growth, research the strategies of integrated marketing communications within the field. Participants both have more than 20 years worth of experience in business management and consulting, and have been closely involved in franchising. Activities are firstly orientated towards acquiring comprehensive knowledge of business mediation in order to use the advantages of this method and spread these competences among business consultants and coaches.  While popularity of narrative coaching is increasing activities in this respect will be oriented towards detailed learning of this method. We aim to use this approach when dealing with small and medium size enterprises, develop this knowledge for further dissemination beyond national borders. Other activities will be devoted to the acquisition of experience in the field of social entrepreneurship to help understand the social enterprise paradigm, answer the specific questions regarding the motivation of Stakeholders, intellectual property, growth prospects and the macroeconomic impact. The methodology used is both a qualitative and quantitative approach, for example, the establishment of appropriate focus groups and discussions within their remit, provision of the seminar sessions and finally the consistent application of SMART method to goal-setting. The Project aims to drive cooperation within a virtual environment, as well as include face to face collaboration with the European Social Franchising Network (ESFN), the national franchise associations, individual members of such organizations - companies, respectable business training and consulting companies. The result would be measured in the first instance by the increase in the overall scope and quality of participants\u2019 competencies that are to be used in their everyday\u2019s professional activities, as well as to ensure the dissemination of knowledge among partners and customers, including professionals outside the national scope. It would further be measured within the field of social entrepreneurship, where achievements will be marked by the increasing popularity of social entrepreneurship amidst so-called \u2018new EU countries\u2019. In medium and long term perspective the follow-up of the Project would entail the opportunity for the participants to make their own investment (social and material) in this business area. On the other hand, we aim to continue the collection and systematic study of social entrepreneurship experience in order to establish a model for growth using social franchise and/or social license means.", "http://www.socialenterprise.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-LV01-KA104-000263_2"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["4RQ", "SOCIAL ENTERPRISE INTERNATIONAL LTDE", 229511.0, "Fostering inclusive, innovative and reflective European societies (08.02.03.06)", "fts_2017_15760", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "YO22"}
