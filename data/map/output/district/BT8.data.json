In line with the need to equip the local and regional labour market of professionalism, fulfilling the needs of smart factory 4.0, a Consortium, formed by Polo Fermi-Giorgi, ISI Garfagnana, IIS Galilei-claw, ITI Ferrari, has been set to develop and implement international 4.0 WBL experiences.\r\nSpecifically, the Consortium, with the TECNO RETE 4.0 project, aims to promote personal, civic, cultural and professional growth of its students and offer training courses aimed at the acquisition of specific skills in the area of 4.0.\r\nThe project aims at sending abroad 160 students (IV year of study) with specializations in the following areas: COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, ELECTRONICS and ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, MECHANICS AND MECHATRONICS.\r\nAmong 160 students, 5 students will be selected from the ones with BES and/or disabilities.\r\nIn continuity with the alternance of \u201cschool classes and work experiences\u201d, the aim of the project is to enrich the preparation of participants to address the demands of the local labour market and acquire independence and maturity in their personal choices. Participants ' needs are at a glance:\r\n-to acquire/improve their technical and professional skills within international 4.0 Smart Factories\r\n-improve their language skills and communicative skills\r\n-improve their intercultural, socio-relational, civic skills\r\n-make themselves more competitive and be ready to enter the local labour market at the end of the studies\r\nThe Consortium has the following objectives:\r\n-improve their training offer-strengthen the skills of its students by offering innovative and quality paths\r\n-strengthen the capacity of staff in terms of management, mentoring and monitoring training paths\r\n-improve their skills in managing international mobility experiences\r\n-improve cooperation with companies at local and international level\r\n-better use of ECVET and EUROPASS devices and systems\r\nAs for the international project partners, the project aims to improve the quality multi-actorial networks that implement international work experiences; foster their growth as well as improving their ability to manage international placements and monitoring procedures.\r\nFrom the project, the expected results are:\r\n-for participants: more technical and professional skills in the field of specialization in order to easily enter the labour market; more linguistic and transversal skills; acquisition of certification (evidence of validations) to be used in the local and international labour market; \r\n-for the Consortium: better and increased educational tools and methods as well as the better training programs focusing on alternating lessons to work experiences;  shareable and transfereable instruments aimed at the validation and recognition of learning outcomes; staff able to manage European paths and also able to improve school curricula.\r\n-international partnership: ability to use tools for monitoring, evaluation, certification of trainees' skills; better and wider international network of partnership.\r\nThe project aims to impact on local and regional education systems, improving educational offers, improve the collaboration with companies and trade associations; it is expected an impact on national and European policies going to facilitate the review of the professional figures 4.0 in different directories; the improvement of certification and recognition of skills at national and international level; an increased number of international mobility projects for both students and staff of schools and companies in order to promote \"the circulation of knowledge\" and active exchanges in addition to the construction of networks and synergies.\r\nProject activities will be implemented from October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2019, for a total of 24 months. Expected mobility flows are 10 with16 participants each. \r\nMobilities will be organised in the summer of 2018 and summer of 2019 according to two main work-flows. \r\nEach mobility flow will last 28 days + 2 for travelling in the United Kingdom, Portugal, Malta, Cyprus, Slovenia.\r\nFor each mobility flow is foreseen a teacher who will accompany and supervise the project and the students.

The project is a continuation of an approved project in 2015, aiming to meet the training needs presented by local youths. The main objective is to promote student mobility in VET intermediate level of the following professional sectors: Vehicles electromechanics and Telecommunications facilities (IES San Jose), Administrative Management (IES Carmen Laffon), Aesthetic (IES Miguel de Ma\u00f1ara) and Welding and Boilers (IES Antonio Ulloa), to complete their training in a professional environment and increase their chances of integration in the labor market. \r\nThe internships will contemplate two modalities:\r\n- Practices for second year students who perform their FCT compulsory internship abroad, concluding the program with the acquisition of their title.\r\n- Practices for young graduates, who will make their experience as an extracurricular training\r\n\r\n25 participants will be involved, aged between 18 and 25 years without previous work experience (in the majority of the cases),  and selected through a public and common process between centers.\r\nThe training periods last 8 or 12 weeks, doing internships in companies in Italy, United Kingdom and Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe results and expected impact of participants will be clear: \r\nTo complement their academic education with an internship \r\nTo have their first work experience\r\nTo increase their language skills\r\nTo acquire a profile of versatile skills\r\nTo learn to use new technologies and work tools\r\nTo develop their transversal skills (autonomy, maturity, observation, reflection and adaptation)\r\nTo get a formal recognition of competences acquired through the Europass mobility document \r\nTo get to know new cultures and social habits\r\nTo promote their interest in lifelong learning \r\nTo increase their chances of recruitment once they have completed traineeship\r\n\r\nRegarding the members of the consortium, the results are: \r\nTo offer young people of La Rinconada (Spain) attractive possibilities to complete their training\r\nTo develop programs that encourage new recruitment opportunities\r\nTo reduce the unemployment rate in the municipality\r\nTo enhance local, regional, national and international economic development\r\nTo create a local network working\r\nTo create an international network\r\nTo acquire new working methods and technologies used in companies.\r\nThe project maintains a line of work initiated in the previous edition of the project, and the prospect is to make it sustainable over time.
