Moreover, with the introduction and building of a big number of new ships, their monitoring and inspection from both regulatory bodies and Classification Societies has become more and more difficult in order to obtain the optimum inspection results and eliminating the hazards posed by high-risk and sub-standard ships. In this respect, the INCASS (Inspection Capabilities for Enhanced Ship Safety) project brings together a range of experienced and dedicated partners in order to tackle the issue of ship inspection, identification of high-risk ships, providing access to information related to ship surveys independent of the ship\u2019s flag and inspection regime and moreover incorporate enhanced and harmonised cooperation of maritime stakeholders in order to avoid ship accidents, promote maritime safety and protect the environment. The INCASS consortium aims to bring an innovative solution to the ship inspection regime through the introduction of enhanced inspection of ship structures based on robotic platforms, providing ship structures and machinery monitoring with real time information using \u2018intelligent\u2019 sensors and incorporate Structural and Machinery Risk Analysis. Moreover, by introducing Condition Based inspection tools and methodologies, reliability and criticality based maintenance, providing an enhanced Central Database including ship structures and machinery available to maritime authorities (e.g. EMSA, Port State Control), Classification Societies and ship operators and eventually by developing a Decision Support System for ship structures and machinery for continuous monitoring and risk analysis and management of ship operations.", null, 3290370.0, "INCASS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.apanda.com", null, "fp7_186995_952232414"], ["3TJ", "Safety Enhancements in transport by Achieving Human Orientated Resilient Shipping Environment", "AP&A Ltd", "'Within the aeronautical industry it is critical to have safe and reliable operations in order to prevent accidents and mistakes which can potentially cause a huge loss of life and destruction. In this respect, the aeronautical industry has led the way in terms of understanding and implementing tools, methodologies and systems to combat human error within a system. One such principle which has been highlighted as being particularly successful is the integration and adoption of resilience engineering principles. Resilience engineering within the aeronautical industry has been very useful on board aircraft where the number of accidents and incidents have been shown to decrease through the utilisation of resilience engineering.\n\nIn order to achieve successful transfer and implementation of the proven resilience engineering concepts and tools from the aeronautical industry to marine transport, a systematic approach needs to be adopted. Therefore, within the SEAHORSE project it is our aim to TRANSFER the effective and successful safety concepts utilised in the aeronautical industry, adapting and tailoring them to the unique needs of marine transport in the following manner:\n\nFirstly, the best practices in aeronautical industry with regard to managing errors and non-standard practices will be identified. Then, the current practices in marine transport will be assessed and gap analysis in order to identify any potential gaps that may affect the successful implementation of safety management will be conducted. Finally, a \u2018Multi-level Resilient Marine Transport Framework\u2019 will be developed through the adaptation of the identified resilience engineering principles of the aeronautical industry to the unique needs of marine transport.\n\nThrough the concepts of the SEAHORSE project it is envisaged that more resilient and safer shipping operations will be achieved.'", 103113.0, 2509321.0, "SEAHORSE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.apanda.com", null, "fp7_110892_952232414"], ["5TH", "Bridges Across the Language Divide", "Red Bee Media Limited", "Today Europe is facing larger and more critical language challenges than ever before.

Thus, effective and innovative alternatives must be provided to Europe's citizens and businesses. High performing machine translation technology can be part of the solution.Recent advances in machine translation (MT) technology now show great promise, as systems can be trained automatically from data and achieve respectable performance, even from speech input. However, MT still has very high maintenance costs, and is unsuited to cope with many of today's digital media's relentlessly changing streams of information, across different topics, styles, and genres.'Bridges Across the Language Divide' (EU-BRIDGE) proposes to advance speech translation to the point where it can deal with the varying input conditions occurring in digital media, and is able to automatically adapt itself to the changing domains.Training data for modern state-of-the-art statistical speech translation models has become a valuable resource that is difficult and expensive to collect in sufficient quantities for all languages and domains of interest. EU-BRIDGE will therefore seek to reduce the cost of data collection and the dependency on collected data.In its research EU-BRIDGE will address European and non-European languages of high importance to the businesses and citizens of Europe, also dealing with the problem of addressing under-resourced languages and their specific peculiarities.EU-BRIDGE will further be working on European infrastructure and network services in order to provide European businesses with a tangible benefit when operating in a multilingual market, e.g. TV captioning and translation.

People tend to underestimate the importance of advanced materials, since they are mostly focused on the final consuming products, instead of appreciating the underlying materials technologies.\n\nIn order to uncover this hidden role, we propose a cross-platform media approach, integrating onto a web portal, online educational resources, a web-based serious game and a character-led documentary film that will be translated in all the official EU languages.\n\nTo achieve this task we involve a multidisciplinary team of experts (in advanced materials, documentary filming, game based education, e-learning, scientific journalism etc) that are combining their expertise in order to create a coherent set of media products.\n\nThe educational, \u201cSerious Game\u201d, will be targeted towards teenagers (between 14 and 17 years old) while the character-led documentary will be targeted towards the general public and especially the younger people.

While the system for metals recycling is already well established, the rising volumes of waste plastics point to stalemates in the current plastics economy, which hamper its shift to a more circular model. Although there are individual efforts to improve the collection and recycling of WEEE plastics, the plastics value chain is still too fragmented and WEEE recycled plastics seem unattractive material for the end-user. To shift towards circular economy a systematic transformation is required, involving all actors in the value chain and encompassing the entire lifecycle of plastic materials.  \nWhile substantially reducing the WEEE plastics generation and enhancing the use of recycled plastics in new applications, PolyCE will demonstrate the feasibility of circular plastics supply and value chain. In particular, PolyCE will elaborate harmonized set of technical requirements addressing the entire value chain and develop grade system for recycled plastics according to their material properties and final application suitability. Accordingly, PolyCE will strengthen the market for recycled plastics through an online platform integrating the different plastic grades. In parallel, the technical and economic feasibility as well as environmental benefits of using recycled plastics will be validated in several electronics demonstrators. In addition, PolyCE will provide Guidelines for designing new electronics products with recycled plastics.
