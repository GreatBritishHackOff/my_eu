OPV has followed this tremendous growth and makes important additions to the motivation: low cost and easy manufacturing on flexible substrates by printing technologies. The problem of harvesting energy from light naturally presents a large area challenge and no manufacturing technique is faster than printing and coating under ambient conditions in terms of manufactured surface per unit time. This is in reality what gives OPV the competitive advantage over all other PV technologies.Power conversion efficiency of OPV cells has relatively been growing \\0.5% per year from 1990.
