Unfortunately, as this dependency has grown, the motives and capabilities of cyber adversaries to attack these systems are also increasing. Attackers are often able to penetrate computer systems to extract sensitive information, tamper with accuracy of the information and prevent access to essential services. Given the organizational dependency on the systems and services, any one of these tactics can have significant negative impacts on an organization's business capabilities, reputation and liabilities. In the era of open networks and platforms, attackers continue to find more venues to exploit these systems to cause substantial damage.<br/>Despite the well-known need for continuous monitoring of ICT systems to detect vulnerabilities and attacks, as well as the need for rapid incident response, commercial solutions do not meet the demands of modern networks and systems.<br/>The PANOPTESEC prototype will address these challenges by proactively and reactively evaluating system weaknesses, identifying potential attack paths, providing a list of prioritized response actions, and delivering a means to execute these responses; all supported by automated analysis engines.

GNSS-R technology aims at measuring the GNSS signals reflected on the ground, and, compared to the direct signals, permits a measurement of the soil humidity (from 0 to 100%) as well as flooded extend. The use of GALILEO signals will significantly improve the precision of mapping. The operational system will integrate three main axes of development: adapting the GNSS-R technology for the requirements, making a compact GNSS-R receiver and optimizing an existing RPAS.\nUsing EGNOS and GALILEO in the project will also improve navigation capabilities of small RPAS (<4Kg) and contribute to the development of regulations for their integration in airspace.\nWe assembled a consortium that addresses all aspects of the project : four SME specialized in GNSS receivers, GNSS-R technology, operational applications and dissemination, two labs for RPAS and GNSS-R technology. An advisory board composed of agronomy and environment specialists as well as end users will complete the skills of the consortium.", 354217.0, 2682110.0, "MISTRALE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_193835_942531541"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["0QR", "Westcott Business Incubation Centre", "Satellite Applications Catapult", "Incubation centre for collaboration & business opps with space sector.", "ERDF", 500000.0, 1000000.0, "erdf_england_2"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["0QX", "MIRICO LTD", 471181.0, "Making the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system (08.02.03.03)", "fts_2017_2427", 2017], ["0QX", "THE ELECTROSPINNING COMPANY LTD*TECL", 72606.0, "Leadership in nanotechnologies, advanced materials, laser technology, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing and processing (08.02.02.01)", "fts_2017_3101", 2017], ["0QX", "RESEARCH DATA ALLIANCE FOUNDATION", 147192.0, "Strengthening European research infrastructure, including e-infrastructure (09.04.01.02)", "fts_2017_11999", 2017], ["0QR", "DEIMOS SPACE UK LIMITED", 87791.0, "Leadership in space (02.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_16694", 2017], ["0QG", "GMV INNOVATING SOLUTIONS LTD", 49721.0, "Leadership in space (02.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_17533", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "OX11"}
