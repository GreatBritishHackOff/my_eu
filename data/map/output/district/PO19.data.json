In 56% of these operations, the components, in particular the cup, are not aligned correctly; this misalignment alters the biomechanics of the system, such that excessive wear of the cup occurs. The subsequent reduction in implant lifespan will affect ~450,000 European citizens, an average of 30,000 per year. In financial terms, the annual cost to European healthcare institutes is in the region of \u20ac426m euros, in addition to the increased likelihood of re-revision and associated aftercare costs.\nThere are two types of navigation system currently on the market: (1) Image based which uses CT data to generate 3D preoperative images, and (2) Image-free systems which rely on kinematic data or point-clouds acquired intra-operatively to generate a 3D reconstruction that can be explored during the operation on a computer screen. Both systems have demonstrated improved accuracy over manual surgery. However, current systems entail a large initial cost (~\u20ac250K) with high maintenance costs; in addition, most systems take an extra 15 minutes to setup, using valuable theatre time.\nThe D2Eye project will develop a simple to use, low cost, fully mobile guidance system with reduced set up time. The guidance system will allow the surgeon to position the cup accurately allowing for optimum range of movement and as a result will prevent premature failure of the implant normally associated with misalignment. This will be done using a series of electronic orientation units built in to the surgical instruments which will give their position in free space. The information from the units will be projected in front of the surgeon\u2019s eye in real time, allowing them to identify the correct cup implantation position; such a system will enable implant lifetimes to be extended beyond the current average 15 year lifespan, significantly reducing the burden on the healthcare system.", 5981.0, 1081222.0, "D2EYE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.auroramedical.co.uk", null, "fp7_185473_963080409"], ["1TH", "Global initiative on gene-environment interaction on diabetes/obesity risk", "Euradia", "The overall goal of InterConnect is to establish a global network that will facilitate the co-ordination of population research on the interaction between genetic and environmental factors in the aetiology of obesity and diabetes.

To over come this Finsbury help develop the MoM BHR resurfacing hip with a survival rate of 93% over a conventional THR. However, studies have reported high concentrations of Co &amp; Cr in the serum and/or urine of patients with MoM resurfacing implants.

An orthopedic consultant may recommend a procedure called hip resurfacing, rather than a (THR) for more active patients whose bones are of good quality, allowing greater preservation of natural bone in and around the joint and providing greater durability. This involves replacing the damaged or diseased surface of the ball and socket joint in the hip with highly polished metallic capping, known as metal on metal (MoM) hip resurfacing.  However, reports of high blood and serum levels of cobalt and chromium in patients with MoM devices have raised important concerns about their long-term effects.\n\nEU-funded scientists set out to develop an improved hip prosthesis using high-performance ceramics with high compressive strength, wear resistance and chemical inertness. The project 'Enhanced durability resurfacing endoprosthesis' http://www.endure-fp7.com/ ((ENDURE)) set the ambitious goal of a prosthetic lifetime in excess of thirty years.\n\nIn order to arrive at the ceramic-on-polymer resurfacing hip prosthesis, researchers focused on alumina matrix composite bioceramics and carbon fibre-reinforced poly\u2013ether\u2013ether\u2013ketone. They developed new cost-effective polymer-processing methods and employed extensive theoretical and experimental testing to arrive at the final designs. The system and its implantation were successfully tested and demonstrated by specialised surgeons working on cadavers.\n\nPreliminary publication of results on the project website has led to a flurry of inquiries and expressed interest, providing the impetus for expediting the clinical trials process.

The project will also address the complex role of the diversity of scientific languages in Europe. Different mother tongues are a barrier to the international flow of communication while also being fundamental to expressing complex scientific ideas which are often embedded in a certain cultural back-ground.

This unacceptable situation has the potential to increase Deltex\u2019s revenues 5 fold by 2020 through the development of TruVue. Of the adverse events 51% are directly due to inadequate haemodynamic management. Hemodynamic instability and low blood pressure are frequent, with consequences such as myocardial infarctions, stroke and kidney injury. Complications have serious clinical and financial consequences; unplanned intensive care admissions; longer stay; increased readmissions; increased 30 day mortality; and shorter patient lifespan after discharge. Healthcare faces increasingly complex cases as the population ages and uses ever more complex equipment. Protecting patients from haemodynamic errors through improved monitoring should save thousands of lives, improve outcomes and reduce costs. Diagnostic haemodynamic equipment needs to display the interaction of flow and pressure if it is to be truly effective. Current monitors are failing to meet this need.
