The approach this project proposes for improving the current practices revolves around the use of messaging and cultural sharing technologies to create awareness using technologies and approaches that offer the best form of accessibility and penetration by citizens and authorities.\nPOP-ALERT will propose a pilot project (designing criteria for selection of the area and population to be involved in the pilot, developing scenarios and objectives) in order to test the generic methodologies and to assess their effectiveness in raising an improved level of preparedness of the community.", 60547.0, 861302.0, "POP-ALERT", null, null, null, "http://www.pop-alert.eu/", "http://www.training4resilience.co.uk", null, "fp7_185507_952177803"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SP8"}
