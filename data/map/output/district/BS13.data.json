The teachers at the Primary Phase were aware that their knowledge of the Spanish language was inadequate and lacked the confidence to teach it effectively. Consequently, a language specialist was hired to teach Spanish to students in KS2 but this amounted to no more than half an hour a week and frequently less. The staffs' concerns grew and there were several meetings during 2015 to try and formulate an action plan to improve the teaching and learning of Spanish. The staff decided that at least one teacher from all Phases of the Primary Phase, with students' age ranging from 3 - 11, would undertake  professional development to ensure that the teaching and learning of Spanish was effective and continuous throughout the school and curriculum to guarantee students progress.After much debate and research it was decided that an Erasmus+ funded project would best meet the needs of the Merchants' Academy's students and teachers' professional development.Staff's enthusiasm to study in Spain was universal and a selection process was undertaken to choose the staff that best met the needs of the school. A teacher from Early Years was chosen, 2 teachers from KS1 and 1 from KS2. All these teachers are relatively new to the profession with no one having more than 5 years experience. Two more experienced teachers, who teach in all the Phases, were chosen to ensure continuity across the school even in the event of unforeseen long term absence of one or more  of the other participants.The language schools are in Malaga and the courses are Primary specific. There are strong cultural elements to the courses and they teach Spanish through tried and tested successful methodologies which the participants will adopt in their own practice and disseminate to colleagues in the Academy.An action plan has been put in place to assure the efficacy of the teaching and learning and there will be continuous reflection and reviews of practice to ensure that the students make good progress.Assessment and evaluation of the project is continuous and an integral feature, essential if standards in teaching and learning are to improve.The impact of the project will be disseminated beyond the Academy and its stakeholders and it is hoped that teachers will continue to develop their professional practice to ensure the children 'will achieve more than they ever thought possible' - the school motto.", "http://www.merchantsacademy.org", "Merchants' Academy", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023844_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BS13"}
