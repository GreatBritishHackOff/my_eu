These stoppages are predominantly caused by weld quality issues, which in turn arise from poor maintenance of consumable \u2018tips\u2019 on RSW guns.\n\nSmartDress will develop a fully automated adaptive control system that will optimise, monitor and maintain tip quality in these applications.  This will minimise line stoppages and give provide our consortium of tier 2/3 SME automotive suppliers with an IP protectable, \u2018high-tech\u2019 product, enabling us to protect and expand our market share \u2013 which is shrinking due to competition from low-labour rate competitor countries.\n\nAnother key feature of the SmartDress system will be that it will allow cost-competitive manufacture of aluminium (not currently commercially viable), which will enable lower cost aluminium vehicle manufacture.  This could have very large potential impact on CO2 emissions (due to vehicle light-weighting).", 165468.0, 1230518.0, "SmartDress", "Keeping electrodes in tip-top shape", "The average European family car contains up to 5\u00a0000 spot welds. New spot welding electrode monitoring and repair technology will have tremendous impact on the competitive position of the EU's automotive manufacturing sector.", "Resistance spot welding (RSW) is extensively employed in high-volume automotive production. As manufacturers have increasingly turned to light-weight aluminium, RSW has become cost prohibitive for mass production. Aluminium reacts quite aggressively with the consumable copper electrode tips on RSW guns. Poor maintenance leads to inferior weld quality and subsequent frequent work stoppages, imposing increased maintenance costs and lost revenue. For the numerous small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the field, these issues further impinge on market competitiveness in the face of increasing competition from low-labour\u2013cost countries.\n\nEU-funded scientists developed an automated adaptive control system to monitor, optimise and maintain electrode tip quality with the project 'Adaptive tip dress control for automated resistance spot welding' (http://www.smartdress-project.eu/ (SMARTDRESS)). It senses tip wear, initiates tip repair (via tip dressing) and automatically optimises the tip dressing schedule. The SMARTDRESS technology will not only improve weld quality and minimise line stoppages, it will enable cost-competitive spot welding of lightweight aluminium.\n\nThe SMARTDRESS system uses an optical sensor to monitor the condition of the RSW electrode tips. The control system determines if maintenance is required, sparing unnecessary scheduled maintenance that expends time, money and electrode material. Tip dressing is a process of removing uneven material from the tip face to repair any damage. The tip is thus returned to its original geometry but material is lost. SMARTDRESS also exploits a special abrasive dressing that lightly cleans the electrodes without cutting away valuable copper.\n\nPatents have been filed for both the optical sensor and the control technology. Electrode maintenance issues remain the main reason for work stoppages in automotive body manufacturing. The SMARTDRESS abrasive dressing technology for electrode tip monitoring and repair offers currently unavailable capabilities. These advances promise important enhancements in weld quality and overall productivity that will significantly improve the competitive position of the numerous SMEs in the automotive manufacturing sector.", null, "http://www.fssystems.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/140998.jpg", "fp7_101398_961170382"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NN14"}
