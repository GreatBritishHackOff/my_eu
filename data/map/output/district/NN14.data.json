These stoppages are predominantly caused by weld quality issues, which in turn arise from poor maintenance of consumable \u2018tips\u2019 on RSW guns.\n\nSmartDress will develop a fully automated adaptive control system that will optimise, monitor and maintain tip quality in these applications.  This will minimise line stoppages and give provide our consortium of tier 2/3 SME automotive suppliers with an IP protectable, \u2018high-tech\u2019 product, enabling us to protect and expand our market share \u2013 which is shrinking due to competition from low-labour rate competitor countries.\n\nAnother key feature of the SmartDress system will be that it will allow cost-competitive manufacture of aluminium (not currently commercially viable), which will enable lower cost aluminium vehicle manufacture.  This could have very large potential impact on CO2 emissions (due to vehicle light-weighting).", 165468.0, 1230518.0, "SmartDress", "Keeping electrodes in tip-top shape", "The average European family car contains up to 5\u00a0000 spot welds. New spot welding electrode monitoring and repair technology will have tremendous impact on the competitive position of the EU's automotive manufacturing sector.", "Resistance spot welding (RSW) is extensively employed in high-volume automotive production. As manufacturers have increasingly turned to light-weight aluminium, RSW has become cost prohibitive for mass production. Aluminium reacts quite aggressively with the consumable copper electrode tips on RSW guns. Poor maintenance leads to inferior weld quality and subsequent frequent work stoppages, imposing increased maintenance costs and lost revenue. For the numerous small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the field, these issues further impinge on market competitiveness in the face of increasing competition from low-labour\u2013cost countries.\n\nEU-funded scientists developed an automated adaptive control system to monitor, optimise and maintain electrode tip quality with the project 'Adaptive tip dress control for automated resistance spot welding' (http://www.smartdress-project.eu/ (SMARTDRESS)). It senses tip wear, initiates tip repair (via tip dressing) and automatically optimises the tip dressing schedule. The SMARTDRESS technology will not only improve weld quality and minimise line stoppages, it will enable cost-competitive spot welding of lightweight aluminium.\n\nThe SMARTDRESS system uses an optical sensor to monitor the condition of the RSW electrode tips. The control system determines if maintenance is required, sparing unnecessary scheduled maintenance that expends time, money and electrode material. Tip dressing is a process of removing uneven material from the tip face to repair any damage. The tip is thus returned to its original geometry but material is lost. SMARTDRESS also exploits a special abrasive dressing that lightly cleans the electrodes without cutting away valuable copper.\n\nPatents have been filed for both the optical sensor and the control technology. Electrode maintenance issues remain the main reason for work stoppages in automotive body manufacturing. The SMARTDRESS abrasive dressing technology for electrode tip monitoring and repair offers currently unavailable capabilities. These advances promise important enhancements in weld quality and overall productivity that will significantly improve the competitive position of the numerous SMEs in the automotive manufacturing sector.", null, "http://www.fssystems.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/140998.jpg", "fp7_101398_961170382"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1NB", "Professional Development of Staff within a European Dimension.", "Broughton Primary School", 17981.0, "Our project 'Professional Development of Staff within a European  Dimension', is a key part of our school improvement plan as we work towards becoming an 'outstanding' school. \r\nOur objectives are:\r\nTo Improve the teaching of French through developing the knowledge, confidence and expertese of staff who have responsibility for teaching French\r\nTo integrate the use of ICT in to the classroom to enhance the learning of all pupils with diverse needs so that they are prepared for a future with a European dimension\r\nTo develop our new staff responsible for Early Years pupils so that ne methods and teaching styles are part of outstanding provision in the Early Years.\r\nTo provide for the wellbeing of pupils so that their individual needs can be met and to have access to their educational entitlement.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve our objectives we have selected attendance at structured training courses in France, Spain and Italy, where 11 learners (staf members) will take part in this project, which will include the lead members of the school community. Participants will also include Teaching Assistants and less experienced members of staff. By including participants from across the school community, we will be able to disseminate widely within the school and have a positive impact on the whole school ethos.\r\n\r\nActivities will include pre-meetings to understand and prepare with course materials, pre-course liaison with other participants, administration support to book flights and plan journeys,  planning work and cover for classes where adults will be absent, attending the course and completing the work within the course, feedback to colleagues in school and to the wider community. Pupils will be more informed about Europe, through a positive and enthusiastic narrative provided by staff members. Their learning experiences will be enhanced and methods for new learning included in forward planning.\r\n\r\nWe envisage that access to high quality learning for our school community will result in a more positive and outward looking approach to new ideas and methodologies in education. This will have a positive impact on our pupils, giving a wider European dimension to their education.\r\n\r\nLonger term, we hope that this European view will help our school to understand its place in Europe and prepare our pupils for a positive outlook to European culture. \r\n\r\nWe also envisage that through our dissemination activities, the wider community and networks of schools we work with will benefit as they learn about our experience and the key results of our participation in this projects.", "http://www,broughtonprimaryschool.co.uk", "Broughton Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035545_coordinator"], ["1LA", "Professional development to enhance teaching and learning", "Loddington CE Primary School", 17375.0, "As a school we have never taken part in this project before or one similar. We are a small school and often don't have the time, opportunities or capacity to observe good practice from one another. By taking part in this project we will aim to improve the teaching and learning throughout the school, improve pupil outcomes in a variety of areas (academic and non) and make the necessary changes across the school to enhance the curriculum.\r\n\r\nWe have identified specific needs that will be addressed by this project:\r\n\r\n- To develop staff expertise and competencies to ensure all staff members are confident in securing learning for all children across the school. This needs to be a priority because we want our children to succeed and for them to be able to do this all staff must be confident in the content and approaches that they are using. \r\n- To improve teaching and learning using a wider range of teaching strategies. This will improve and extend staff skills and enable all to use a variety of strategies rather than focusing on ones they were most comfortable with previously. \r\n- Enhance the provision in the EYFS enabling all children to flourish and become independent and confident learners for life. As a result of this children will become more independent and therefore not only in the EYFS but further up the school children will become independent, life long learners. \r\n- Develop staff ability and awareness of the growing range of needs of all children in our school community. As we have many children in our school with very specific needs  this will ensure that staff are confident with helping them achieve their full potential. . \r\n- Develop and enhance the provision by creating more innovative approaches to teaching and learning . As the modern world is changing we need to ensure we keep up to date with relevant changes at home and abroad and what works best for all children to support their learning needs. This also needs to be through engaging and enriching activities. \r\n- Learn from observation of other practice in Europe. This will enable us to enhance all areas of the curriculum and build on staff awareness, skills, knowledge and confidence.\r\n\r\nTo help us meet our needs we envisage that 10 members of staff will be given the opportunity to attend courses in Italy, Finland, Sweden, Iceland and Spain. The staff are key members of our school and are motivate to learn from this experience in order to enhance and develop our school curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe learning outcomes are:\r\n\r\nDevelop staff expertise and competencies \r\nEnhance the provision in the EYFS \r\nDevelop staff ability and awareness of the growing range of needs of all children \r\nDevelop and enhance the provision by creating more innovative approaches to teaching and learning\r\nEnhanced cultural awareness\r\nEnhanced European dimension in our school\r\n\r\nThe impact and long term benefit of the project will therefore be on staff, pupils and the wider community as we will provide a curriculum that supports and meets the needs of all children preparing them for the future", null, "Loddington CE Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036224_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NN14"}
