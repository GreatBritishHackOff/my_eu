The project addresses important barriers which include developers' lack of awareness and expertise, time and cost requirements of incorporating accessibility and missing validated approaches and infrastructures.The project's approach goes beyond the notion of Universal Design by addressing specific user needs through adaptive personalized interfaces. An ontology-based context management infrastructure will collect user and context information in real-time during use. Sharing the collected information across several personal applications will increase efficiency and validity. The user interface will self-adapt to the evolving individual user model, in order to fit the user's special needs and preferences. The MyUI adaptation engine will rely on empirically based design patterns for specified user and context characteristics.Providing support for developers is a key goal of the project. Accessibility guidelines, re-usable interface components and a virtual environment for illustration, training and monitoring will support the mainstreaming of accessibility in ICT products. An interface adaptation engine and simulation tools will help developers test, assess and refine their designs.MyUI technologies will be implemented in three selected 'use cases' to demonstrate their benefit and feasibility in industrial development contexts: interactive TV device, interactive digital physiotherapy service, and interactive socialisation service.End-users and developers will be involved in all stages of the project. Empirical research will determine the design of user models, design patterns, and adaptation mechanisms. Iterative development and research cycles will ensure that the MyUI artefacts will increase accessibility and that they can be adopted efficiently by the industry.

Not long ago you could live without access to ICT quite well. However today access to ICT is required for most education, employment, and commerce, and is increasingly required for travel, health, safety, daily living and participation in most of our society. Yet we currently only reach 3 to 15% of these - in developed countries. We cannot socially, economically or politically afford to have this cumulatively large percentage of our society offline going forward. Yet there is no way to reach them with our current model.<br/>Proposed is phase II of an effort to create a paradigm shift in eInclusion. Part I was the FP7 project Cloud4all for creating instant, ubiquitous auto-personalization of interfaces and materials based on user needs and preferences. Part II, Prosperity4all, focuses on developing the infrastructure to allow a new ecosystem to grow; one that is based on self-rewarding collaboration, that can reduce redundant development, lower costs, increase market reach and penetration internationally, and create the robust cross-platform spectrum of mainstream and assistive technology based access solutions required. This will be done through a process based on true value propositions for all stakeholders and resulting in a system that can profitably serve markets as small as one, at a personally and societally affordable cost.  This infrastructure will use cloud, crowd, game and smart technologies, to bring new players with both low and high technical skills into the development and delivery ecosystem, introduce accessibility as a ubiquitous service, and combine auto-configured access features built into mainstream products with assistive technologies and services to create the rich milieu of options needed to bring this diverse population of populations into our digital future.", 71760.0, 10104851.0, "Prosperity4All", null, null, null, null, "http://www.clevercherry.com", null, "fp7_188922_992319992"], ["2AN", "Transforming SMEs into successful experience stagers", "Clevercherry.com Ltd", "The goals of the StageIt project are to develop knowledge about how SMEs can take advantage of experience staging as a means to improve their competitiveness and put this knowledge into practice in three SMEs. The point of departure is the recognition that technological innovation alone does not necessarily insure market acceptance. Instead, competitive environments require innovation that goes beyond technology to provide less tangible, but potentially more valuable, experiential benefits. The StageIt project is based on the notion of the \u201cexperience economy\u201d, which is the fourth stage in the progression of economic value, preceded by extracting fungible commodities, manufacturing tangible goods and delivering intangible services. Each stage in this progression represents a superior value proposition, with higher potential for competitive advantage. StageIt\u2019s industry-academia collaboration includes two universities and three SMEs that will benefit from transformation to experience staging. The academic participants contribute their knowledge, research findings and expertise and the industry participants contribute their practical experience prior to, during and following the transformation. The collaboration will make it possible to approach the transformation of SMEs into experience stagers from both a pragmatic and a theoretical point of view. Knowledge will be transferred within the consortium by staff secondments and workshops. Knowledge will be transferred to the broader academic and industrial communities through presentations in academic and industry conferences, academic publications and industry reports. The academic partners will raise the quality of their research on experiential design based on the data and insight gained. The industry partners will improve their RTD capability based on the knowledge gained from collaboration with the academic partners, and each other, and enhance their competitive advantage based on the transformations realized.", 119165.0, 612972.0, "STAGEIT", "SMEs and experience staging", "An EU team has helped European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) utilise the concept of experience staging.

Coatings Ltd", "The need of using high performance lightweight materials is pushing the aerospace industry to incorporate aluminium alloys in many parts of the aircraft. But all aircraft components, and especially those of landing gears, need to be able to withstand friction and corrosive environments while continuing to operate at optimum levels. \nNowadays most landing gear parts made of aluminium alloys are protected against corrosion by surface anodising and multilayer painting. The treatment is usually carried out on Cr(VI) based compounds. To date, there is not any Cr-free accepted protecting treatment for Al 7000 series alloys that fulfils the aeronautics requirements, so, it is necessary to develop an environmentally and Cr-free acceptable alternative process.\nThe main objective of ECOLAND project is to face the research of a suitable REACH compliant anaphoretic electrocoating treatment (including both the optimal pretreatment method and anaphoretic electrocoating application conditions) that can replace the currently used anodising \\ painting treatment for protection of Al 7000 series alloys in aeronautic applications. This anaphoretic electrocoating will allow a reduction of emissions, saving of coat and improvement of corrosion protection.\nThe following improvements will be aimed from the ECOLAND Cr-free project:\n\u2022 The lifetime of the anaphoretic electrocoating system shall be 25 % longer than the lifetime of traditional.\n\u2022 It is expected a minimum of around 30% cost and 45% energy consumption reduction in manufacturing compared to currently available systems.\n\u2022 Thanks to the new coating systems more complex geometry parts could be coated and so landing gears might be designed lighter than currently ones. \n\u2022 The production time to be shortened in a 55%.\n\u2022 A decrease of the risk of mechanical failure due to the reduction of the alloy exposure time to acids.\n\u2022 VOCs emissions will be reduced in a 50%.", 40797.0, 320310.0, "ECOLAND", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_213591_911735205"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1TP", "Black Country Technical Assistance Project", "Walsall Council", "The project will build upon the success of the established Black Country Technical Assistance Team, playing a critical role in ensuring that new, quality ERDF projects and applications are designed in accordance with ESIF and national funding requirements.
