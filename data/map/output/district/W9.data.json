Project partners include early education institutions in Bulgaria, France, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Croatia, Poland and Sweden. The project partnerships will be extended to institutions in Finland, Ireland and Denmark, where particularly youth welfare facilities, special-needs schools and institutions in elderly care will be considered. \r\n\r\nThe mobility project is divided into three schemes. \r\n\r\nThe first scheme - the Europaklasse class scheme - includes participants who have decided to focus on the development of intercultural competence during their initial professional education as an officially recognised nursery school teacher. As part of this education, the participants complete their placement abroad for three months at day care centres, nursery schools and at institutions for people with special educational needs. Possible requirements for participating in the project are e.g. intermediate-level educational qualification including one year at a vocational school or general qualification for university entrance including a 6-week social work placement.  The  profile of this scheme is geared particularly towards promoting intercultural competence and culturally sensitive work in plural and global societies and political conditions/contexts. The stay abroad allows the participants to learn about the conception of diversity  in their European partner country  and the resulting institutional challenges.\r\nDuring a period of preparation the participants of the first scheme approach their partner country from a variety of angles, take a specific language course and address the specific project topic on a theoretically well-founded level.\r\nDuring the stay abroad the participants are actively involved in the educational work of the partner institution. This includes e.g. working in teams, participating in public relations activities and implementing the project topic. In addition, the participants give 2 demonstration lessons, which are evaluated by the institute\u2019s teachers.  \r\nThe participants evaluate their experiences and insights after the placement abroad during an externally supervised 3-day workshop. The learning outcomes are incorporated in various documentations and publications.  \r\n    \r\nDuring the second scheme of the mobility project \u201cLearning Mobility of Individuals\u201d, the nursery school teachers in training are offered the opportunity to engage in a two-week work placement in a European country at the end of their vocational training. In this way they should be enabled to expand their already sound expertise in a culturally foreign environment and reflect on it.  These intercultural stimuli are aimed at enriching their future professional practice.\r\n\r\nThe third scheme \u201cLearning Mobility of Education Staff\u201d focuses on the professional discourse between the teachers of the institute and educational specialists in the partner countries . This scheme is implemented through job-shadowing, specific work placements as well as talks and presentations and develops the cultural diversity competence of the project\u2019s participants .\r\nThe project sponsor is responsible for continuous quality assurance and fostering cooperation between the institute and its European partners.\r\n\r\nThe project has a substantial multiplier effect at the Institut f\u00fcr Soziale Berufe due to its integration in continued education curricula, at a local level (involvement in cultural events) and at a regional level due to networking. \r\nThe sustainable, long-term benefit of the project is that the participants develop a professional identity as ambassadors for Europe and adopt a culturally sensitive and inclusive attitude in their professional self-conception, which essentially motivates and shapes their work as educational specialists.", "http://www.marypatersonnurseryschool.schoolswire.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003878_1"], ["3HH", "Metropolis 2018: Street Symbiosis - Urban learning in Europe", "The Otherwise Club", 41923.0, "METROPOLIS 2017 - Transformers of cities - Urban Learning in Europe\" is active exploration and urban learning between parks and street canyons: Participants can experience the City of Wiesbaden actively and inter-culturally and answer the questions: How does the city change, how does the city change me and how do I change the city?\r\nThe urban environment offers a wide variety of possibilities for exploration and activities to choose from and provides options for personality development. \r\nSoft skills, such as capacity for teamwork, decision-making and problem-solving ability, communication and empathy will be experienced by the participants and can be exercised in the learning-space \u201eCity\u201c. \r\nThe learners are motivated to act actively, interactively and communicatively.

The project wants to lay a foundation for a new kind of cooperation. The aim is to harmonize apparently indissoluble contradictions: collectivization & individual strengths, standardization & flexibility, regionalism & global perspective.\r\nThe objectives of the training are:\r\nA) To help equip a new generation of youth workers with the skills and self-confidence to accompany innovative and sustainable intercultural projects\r\nB) To develop innovative, creative and holistic projects with those present\r\nC) Investigate subject-oriented, creativity-promoting and efficient educational work and provide the basis for the pursuit and appropriation of these principles\r\n\r\nThere are different meanings in the titles: the aspect of the reinvention indicates the retrospective consideration and further development of youth work. Transnational describes not only the international field of work, but also the goal of planning work beyond the national boundaries, thereby enabling truly transnational experiences. \"Youth(net)work\", describes the work field of youth work as well as the important aspect of the network in which to work. The social networks of people mand organisations are the institutions which offers the true protection net against social degeneration in fear and prejudice, and in which the true strength of cooperable beings lies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the knowledge transfer, the project aims at the cooperation capacity of the partners. A strong network is to emerge that is capable of increasing the effect that each individual partner can affect. In which the partners as colleagues meet, to learn about themselves and their structures and to formulate common goals and strategies. The impact of the partners' projects can be increased by the prospects and co-operation potentials of the transnational network, depending on which project the partners want to accept. Social work is not only effective when it works with the affected parties themselves. If a project can become so great that structural levels can be reached or changed, or political leaders and levels become aware of the facts, or a project gains so much press and exposure that a public dialogue in society is beeing started - then the project can possibly do something about the cause and not the symptom of a problem.\r\n\r\nPilotprojects are to be investigated - as well as beeing formed and initiatted out of the training. The participants should leave the training with a reliable skillset and support system to become the \"pilots\" of new projects.\r\nThe results of this training are documented and, more importantly, distributed by the partners and taken up for the following educational projects.\r\nIn summary, Pilots has the task of making subject-oriented, creativity-promoting and efficient education work internationally coordinated and coordinated.", "http://theotherwiseclub.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-3-DE04-KA105-016068_6"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2BT", "OPEN LEARNING LIMITED", 373.0, "Other management expenditure (29.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_63668", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "W9"}
