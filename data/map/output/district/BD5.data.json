The work will, in a single coordinated project, address all aspects of this topic and will be conducted by 26 partners representing the European automotive industry (OEMs (EUCAR), suppliers (CLEPA), ESPs and universities (EARPA)) including members of ERTRAC and EGVIA. The objective is to achieve efficient, compact, low weight, robust and cost effective hybrid powertrains for both passenger cars and commercial vehicles (buses, medium and heavy duty trucks) with increased functionality, improved performance, comfort, safety and emissions below Euro 6 or VI, all proven under real driving conditions. The five demonstrator vehicles, for this purpose developed to TRL 7,  that use the hybrid powertrains will among other give a direct cost versus performance comparison at two system voltage levels in the light duty vehicles, and include the modular and standardized framework components in the heavy duty vehicles. Achieving these innovations affordably will strengthen technical leadership in powertrains, enable a leading position in hybrid technology and increases the competitiveness of European OEMs. The vehicles will be ready for market introduction between 2020 and 2022 and (price) competitive to the best in-class (full hybrid) vehicles on the market in 2013. More importantly, the technology devised will impact on the reduction of CO2 emissions and the improvement of air quality. The project proposes to reach a 20% powertrain efficiency improvement and a 20% powertrain weight and volume reduction, with a \u226410% cost premium on the base model for the demonstrator. To meet air quality targets the project will prove, via independently supervised testing, real driving emissions at least below Euro 6 or VI limits and by simulation show the potential of the passenger car technologies to reach Super Low Emission Vehicle standards.", 297825.0, 23252429.0, "ECOCHAMPS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_194871_931191562"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9ET", "Beruflicher Kompetenzerwerb im Ausland - so st\u00e4rken wir die europ\u00e4ische Einigung", "The Southfield Grange Trust", 80770.0, "The project integrates the mobility of learners and educators in the area of vocational training. It includes:\r\nschool for state-recognized educators, school for state-recognized caregivers of disabled people, Vocational school for social work (recognized social assistant)\r\nvocational school for Nutrition and Care Management (State Certified Assistant Nutrition and supply) \r\n\r\nI. Project background and project goals:\r\n1. Internship during the vocational training: All of the internships form an integral component of the vocational training courses and aim at transfer and implementation of theoretical classroom room knowledge (in)to vocational practice. The focus lies on the acquisition of vocational knowledge and skills / competences to allow for independent work in a professional setting. This coincides with the acquisition of personal competence, i.e. social competence and professional autonomy and independence. The concepts correspond with the DQR, the German adaptation of the EQF.\r\n2. In order to be able to act interculturally in the future, intercultural competences are required. We see it as our goal and obligation to teach the competences necessary for successful intercultural communication. In their respective professional environments, intercultural exchanges play an increasingly significant role for our graduates and teachers. The professional environments are characterized by people from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, with different religions and languages. Migration within Europe, the growing together within Europe, globalization and internationalization have led to constant changes within vocations education as well as the emergence of new professions. We consider direct interaction with people from different cultures in their homeland environment to be the most enriching and promising opportunity to acquire intercultural communicative competence.\r\n3. At the same time, our students should be prepared for a life in a democratic Europe. Due to the opportunity to move freely in Europa and the recognition of the professions in other EU countries, our graduates can also work in other countries. This also applies to the educational staff.\r\nII. Project implementation, number and participant profile:\r\nIn the two project years, 38 apprentices / students (4 and 8 weeks) and 6 teachers (1 and 2 weeks respectively) participate in the project. The internships themselves are an integral part of the training offered by us\r\nStudents for state-recognized educators, school for state-recognized caregivers of disabled people work in children's day-care centers, support schools, nursing homes in Istanbul, Dublin or Paris and receive an insight into early education, special education and care.\r\nThe students of the vocational school for nutrition and care management acquire knowledge in Vienna in a cafe / system gastronomy operation.\r\nThe largest group, vocational school for social work (recognized social assistant), a total of 12 interns working in the English city of Bradford. They work in educational institutions and facilities for disabled people or schools. We assume that the so-called Brexit has not yet been implemented or has no effect on our projects.\r\nIII. Expectations:\r\nWe expect an acquisition or an increase in intercultural competence in the context of professional globalization and ever closer ties within the EU. We also expect knowledge of the tasks and structures of one's own profession in other countries, knowledge about EU conditions of mobility and travel and in other countries. In addition, the development of character, resilience and self-responsibility is also of importance.", "http://www.southfieldgrange.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003628_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BD5"}
