One of the principal and already achieved project results is a roadmap to strengthen the sector in Europe.\n\nOn the basis of an analysis of determining factors, the consortium identified six fields of action which appear to be particularly important for the success of SRCs. These include the implementation of pilot and demonstration projects in particularly suitable regions, the improvement of knowledge exchange between players, the setting up of an interest group at EU level as well as regular information and demonstration events. Activities have already commenced in the framework of ROKWOOD and the concrete approach was defined in a \u201cJoint Action Plan\u201d. A summary of this plan can be found on the http://www.rokwood.eu/public-library/joint-action-plan.html (project website).\n\nOn the basis of an analysis of the political, economic and social conditions for SRCs, various hurdles were identified which occurred in all the participating countries and therefore need to be overcome at European level. These include the fundamentally rather low level of awareness of SRCs and the low level of expertise amongst potential players, an often lacking or incomplete SRC infrastructure as well as limited political and financial support.\n\nThe ROKWOOD project partners are convinced that SRCs \u2013 once the barriers identified have been overcome - will represent an economically attractive alternative to other types of land use.

The partners are experts on Energy (FSS, SANSEBASTIAN, TECNALIA and ACCIONA), ICT (BRISTOL, UNIBRISTOL and ARUP) and Mobility (FLORENCE, SPES and ATAF).\n\n\n\nTo get the proposed objectives STEEP project will create a process model based on systems thinking for district energy master planning, which will be applied to 3 city districts to better understand the systems impacting upon energy use and interventions which can be taken to meet the ambitious energy and carbon targets. These models will be enriched and validated through open innovation methodologies applied with the stakeholders. The learning obtained from the process model for district energy master planning, then, will be applied at the definition of specific action plan (time line, the costs and pay-back periods) at city level.

Founded in 2008, we are committed to supporting local communities to share, learn skills and co-create thriving and progressive opportunities for learning. We run a dynamic social and education centre - Hamilton House - which has played a leading role in transforming one of Bristol's most disadvantaged communities.\r\n\r\nOur adult learning programme has benefited thousands of learners over the last 8 years. New partnerships, entrepreneurial projects and social businesses have spawned and have been supported from conception through our work. \r\n\r\nWe want to build on our educational work to develop \u2018Coexist Facilitates\u2019, which will increase our capacity to bring life changing education to the local community. It will offer much needed skills and confidence to local people, all contributing to a healthier and more vibrant community and resilient economy.\r\n\r\nTo enable us to realise this vision we want:\r\n\u2022 to develop our educational strategy to move beyond being an educational platform which primarily hosts learning events, to directly delivering more learning events ourselves\r\n\u2022 to develop the competence and skills in a collective of trainers who will provide workshops and courses, and who can share experience and good practice \r\n\u2022 to strengthen our cadre of trainers, enabling them to develop the orientation, awareness and abilities as facilitators of positive change, and ensure a far wider audience is supported and impacted by our work \r\n\u2022 to deepen our knowledge and experience of educational methodologies which better serve learners from disadvantaged and vulnerable groups whilst sharing best practice internationally around community cohesion and inclusivity\r\n\u2022 to broaden the outreach of \u2018Coexist Facilitates', a collective of trainers who can \u2018cascade\u2019 the learning and empower new learners by imparting training to others.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we will send 16 staff on structured trainings and three staff on job shadowing assignments. The participants are training staff and/or members of the Coexist Facilitates working group. They include some volunteer staff and others who would benefit from increased employment opportunities. These activities will move us along our strategic pathway towards realising the objectives of Coexists Facilitates.\r\n\r\nThe project will enables us to build on the relationship we have with Col\u00b7lectiu Eco-Actiu, with whom we worked on a previous Erasmus Plus project in 2015-16.

It continues the implementation of the long-term international strategy within vocational education and training of the county of Akershus. This strategy aims at fully integrating international mobility as a means to support the achievement of the main objectives of the county's educational strategies. It could be summarized by improving recruitment within vocational education and training, providing equal opportunities between vocational and general pathways, improving the general quality of vocational training by offering challenging and innovative learning opportunities\r\n\r\nThe project includes the organization of mobility for apprentices and trainers. \r\n\r\nA limited group of trainers (6) will be placed abroad for a duration of 4-5 days. The aim is to improve the awareness of the training enterprise about the benefits of international mobility and hopefully trigger \u201cinternationalization at home\u201d by using the international experience for training VET learning in Norway. The aim is also to benefit from the trainer\u2019s professional expertise to define better the specific learning outcomes of some specific placements for apprentices.\r\n\r\nWe apply for support to the placement of 77 apprentices from Oslo and Akershus. The figure was calculated for matching our development plan, which is a progressive increase of the number of placements for apprentices from 50 apprentices in 2016 to 60 in 2018. The figure is designed to allow us to have an activity, which would have a significant and visible impact on the VET at large (we have over 4000 apprentices in our counties). The apprentices will be recruited within the 40 different trades in which we have training opportunities abroad.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the apprentices will perform placements of 13 weeks, which would include language course and training in company. A few apprentices will perform only 6 to 10 weeks placements. The duration of 10 weeks is introduced for trainees that do not need language courses, it woud mostly concerns placement in English speaking countries. The 6 weeks placement was introduced in our last applications to enable us to include new publics: apprentices following YSK curriculum (vocational studies with university and college admission certification), apprentices with weaker social skills or economic background, and apprentices with short time before their exams. \r\n\r\nWe will cooperate with institutions in 9 European countries for organizing the placement: Austria, England, France, Greece, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. This allows us to offer training opportunities in a wide range of professions, our aim being to act upon vocational training at large and support individual projects initiated by apprentices themselves. The dissemination of the mobility flows between the participating countries takes into consideration the experience of the last years, the training offer in each country and the expected profile (and thus needs) of the applicants.\r\n\r\nWe expect the participants to achieve a large degree of independence, develop cultural awareness, develop their ability to work in a foreign environment and last but not least, strengthen their motivation and professional skills. We expect that the reflection born from this experience will provide better trained skilled workers that will feel equipped to cope with an increasingly more integrated and globalized society.\r\n\r\nWe plan to continue the gradual implementation of  ECVET principles for improving the quality of the placements. In that regards, this project includes several of our partner in a project Erasmus+ KA2 called \u201cMATCHSI.\u201d This project focuses on strengthening the procedures for matching between apprentices and training establishments in order to increase the benefits of the mobility. In an ECVET perspective, we ought to use the results of MATCHSI  to secure a better definition of the learning outcomes.

Of great benefit also is the experience gained in the context of CEDRE.S first presented for Leonardo 2013. This allowed us to develop programmes specifically for a post-student public, coming out higher education, not a priority group in our previous programmes. It has also inspired the title given to this 2014 project, which seems to fit our target group.\r\nWhilst CEDRE.S is clearly structured in terms of phases and apprenticeship units, its overriding purpose is to encompass and improve the professional capacities of participants of level V to I, who have left either secondary education, higher education or full-time training of any sort within the past year. It would offer them an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d programme of qualification, embracing different job skills, technical linguistic capacities and intercultural exposure, all designed to meet the individual\u2019s specific needs at the time.\r\nOne of the principal advantages of the teaching programme resides in the cross-fertilisation between these 3 aspects which make up the whole experience. To help the students attain this goal, we have devised two mobility \u201croad-maps\u201d: the first lasting 6 weeks, particularly geared to young people in integration from level V to II, the second of 13 weeks targeted at participants of a higher level, either older or with longer professional experience. Whilst the periods of mobility can vary, the teaching plan contains the same stages and objectives:\r\n1. Pre-departure: collective socioprofessional guidance sessions accompanied by individual assessments. Intercultural and language preparation.\r\n2. Abroad (outside France): practical internship in a company meeting the profile or personal project of each participant, with constant monitoring to measure linguistic and professional progress, certified by Europass and level tests.\r\n3. On return to France: session to assess what has been learnt from this experience, followed by accompaniment during 3 to 6 months to allow the participants to:\r\n- Develop their capacity to summarise and explain in their own words the key skills acquired in relation to the specific professional context they have chosen.\r\n- Learn to identify what experience and training is most relevant to maintaining a competitive professional profile on the job market, this in a logic of \u201cLong Life Learning\u201d.\r\n- Acquire a continuous ability to judge their own progress, their technical, linguistic and intercultural skills, hence enabling them to position themselves to advantage vis-\u00e0-vis European or international recruiters.\r\n- Identify concrete employment opportunities: a major indicator of the impact of our project is integration in the job market within 6 months.\r\nWe have built a partnership network with 8 experienced intermediary organisations in different countries to ensure optimum welcome and logistics for participants. Clear specifications are drawn up with appropriate norms against which performance is measured, supervised by the IERF and a Piloting committee. Choice of the partners reflects level of demand by country; English and Spanish-speaking destinations tend to dominate language-based requests, but other countries are selected as a function of specific sectors.\r\nTo encourage initiative, evaluate results and publish them, we collaborate with centres located throughout the Ile de France region, which in turn embraces 250 organisations, whose vocation it is to assist this public in obtaining employment. \r\n\r\nThe Erasmus+ Mobility Charter acquired in 2015 as well as the active partnership of many public authorities should help to enlarge our partnership networks to other teaching organisations or local authorities.
