One of the principal and already achieved project results is a roadmap to strengthen the sector in Europe.\n\nOn the basis of an analysis of determining factors, the consortium identified six fields of action which appear to be particularly important for the success of SRCs. These include the implementation of pilot and demonstration projects in particularly suitable regions, the improvement of knowledge exchange between players, the setting up of an interest group at EU level as well as regular information and demonstration events. Activities have already commenced in the framework of ROKWOOD and the concrete approach was defined in a \u201cJoint Action Plan\u201d. A summary of this plan can be found on the http://www.rokwood.eu/public-library/joint-action-plan.html (project website).\n\nOn the basis of an analysis of the political, economic and social conditions for SRCs, various hurdles were identified which occurred in all the participating countries and therefore need to be overcome at European level. These include the fundamentally rather low level of awareness of SRCs and the low level of expertise amongst potential players, an often lacking or incomplete SRC infrastructure as well as limited political and financial support.\n\nThe ROKWOOD project partners are convinced that SRCs \u2013 once the barriers identified have been overcome - will represent an economically attractive alternative to other types of land use.

The partners are experts on Energy (FSS, SANSEBASTIAN, TECNALIA and ACCIONA), ICT (BRISTOL, UNIBRISTOL and ARUP) and Mobility (FLORENCE, SPES and ATAF).\n\n\n\nTo get the proposed objectives STEEP project will create a process model based on systems thinking for district energy master planning, which will be applied to 3 city districts to better understand the systems impacting upon energy use and interventions which can be taken to meet the ambitious energy and carbon targets. These models will be enriched and validated through open innovation methodologies applied with the stakeholders. The learning obtained from the process model for district energy master planning, then, will be applied at the definition of specific action plan (time line, the costs and pay-back periods) at city level.

It is a vocational business school providing training courses in the service sector within the Acad\u00e9mie de Paris. Its pupils prepare a vocational Baccalaureate either in \u201ctrade\u201d, \u201csales\u201d, or \u201creception and customer relationships\u201d. Pupils are expected to become shop-assistants, marketing people, or receptionists. The school is composed of 16 forms, and a total number of 390 pupils; 54% are boys, 46% are girls.\r\n\r\nThe pupils all come from secondary schools; some of them were already in a vocational class previously. Most of them had to go to a vocational school because they failed in their previous school career; so, they did not really choose this course. The educational staff faces high percentages of absentees all through the school year. Due to their absences, some pupils drop out, and not many pupils carry on higher education.\r\n\r\nFor more than ten years, the Head of school and the teachers have implemented some quality course which includes training periods in other European countries.\r\n\r\nThis present project plans to help 32 pupils, who will be selected among our four European forms, benefit from Mobility in Europe, in Bristol, Cork and Seville.\r\n\r\nMobility will enable our pupils to do a three-week training period which is part of the degree they prepare. They will train as shop-assistants or receptionists in companies or organizations ( shops, hotels, offices\u2026) The main tasks they will have to carry out will be those they study at school: welcoming customers, selling goods in a shop or online/on the phone, merchandising, managing stocks, using a till, speaking English or Spanish.\r\n\r\nThis project suits perfectly the European, national and academic orientations, and it can easily be achieved because the school has turned itself towards Europe for more than ten years. Also, it has stable, solid, fully skilled, experienced educational and administrative resources.\r\n\r\nThe participants are teenagers who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. They are not open onto culture enough, especially onto the European culture. Thanks to this mobility and to their work experience abroad, they will get broader and better professional skills and knowledge, enhance their cultural awareness, and improve their language skills and fluency.\r\n\r\nThus their social integration will be made easier. They will be able to apply to very specific jobs in companies dealing with foreign countries. They will feel more self-confident and may carry on higher education in relation with international business. Some may even go and work abroad.\r\n\r\nMobility will reinforce one of the school\u2019s assets which are its European forms. It will enhance the school\u2019s attractiveness and its international dimension. It will make it easier for our pupils to find work placements afterwards: tourism, sales and trade are privileged fields of our economy and French companies, branches of English and Spanish companies settled in France appreciate this double curriculum our pupils get both in foreign languages and professional learning.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the school is aware that professional and social mobility is at stake for the participants. That is why the choice of the local partner organization and of the companies in which the pupils will do their training periods will be made carefully and with great strictness. The teaching staff has got the right tools of checking and rating so as to give this mobility the best possible framework and to optimize it.\r\n\r\nEurope will thus mean something to our pupils.

Of great benefit also is the experience gained in the context of CEDRE.S first presented for Leonardo 2013. This allowed us to develop programmes specifically for a post-student public, coming out higher education, not a priority group in our previous programmes. It has also inspired the title given to this 2014 project, which seems to fit our target group.\r\nWhilst CEDRE.S is clearly structured in terms of phases and apprenticeship units, its overriding purpose is to encompass and improve the professional capacities of  participants of level V to I, who have left either secondary education, higher education or full-time training of any sort within the past year. It would offer them an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d programme of qualification, embracing different job skills, technical linguistic capacities and intercultural exposure, all designed to meet the individual\u2019s specific needs at the time.\r\nOne of the principal advantages of the teaching programme resides in the cross-fertilisation between these 3 aspects which make up the whole experience. To help the students attain this goal, we have devised two mobility \u201croad-maps\u201d: the first lasting 6 weeks, particularly geared to young people in integration from level V to II, the second of 12 weeks targeted at participants of a higher level, either older or with longer professional experience. Whilst the periods of mobility can vary, the teaching plan contains the same stages and objectives:\r\n1. Pre-departure: collective socioprofessional guidance sessions accompanied by individual assessments. Intercultural and language preparation.\r\n2. Abroad (outside France): practical internship in a company meeting the profile or personal project of each participant, with constant monitoring to measure linguistic and professional progress, certified by Europass and level tests.\r\n3. On return to France: session to assess what has been learnt from this experience, followed by accompaniment during 3 to 6 months to allow the participants to:\r\n- Develop their capacity to summarise and explain in their own words the key skills acquired in relation to the specific professional context they have chosen.\r\n- Learn to identify what experience and training is most relevant to maintaining a competitive professional profile on the job market, this in a logic of \u201cLong Life Learning\u201d.\r\n- Acquire a continuous ability to judge their own progress, their technical, linguistic and intercultural skills, hence enabling them to position themselves to advantage vis-\u00e0-vis European or international recruiters.\r\n- Identify concrete employment opportunities: a major indicator of the impact of our project is integration in the job market within 6 months.\r\nWe have built a partnership network with 8 experienced intermediary organizations in 8 different countries to ensure optimum welcome and logistics for participants. Clear specifications are drawn up with appropriate norms against which performance is measured, supervised by the IERF and a Piloting committee. Choice of the partners reflects level of demand by country; English and Spanish-speaking destinations tend to dominate language-based requests, but other countries are selected as a function of specific sectors.\r\nTo encourage initiative, evaluate results and publish them, we collaborate with centres located throughout the Ile de France region, which in turn embraces 150 organisations, whose vocation it is to assist this public in obtaining employment.

Thus, they would enable us to provide international output to publics, which does not have access to international mobility yet.  Furthermore, we believe that it would increase the recruitment of apprentices for work placement abroad. Finally, we will benefit from the trainer\u2019s professional expertise to define better the specific learning outcomes of some specific placements for apprentices. We will give priority for trainers in the fields of technical and industrial producation, electro and health and social trades.\r\n\r\nWe apply for support to the placement of 98 apprentices from Oslo and Akershus. The figure was calculated for matching our development plan, which includes a progressive increase of the number of placements for apprentices from 50 apprentices in 2016 to 70 in 2020. The 98 mobilities are thought to be used in 4 flows: 15 at the autumn 2018, 35 in Spring 2019, 35 at the autumn 2019 and the remaining 13 at the Spring 2019. The figure is designed to allow us to have an activity, which would have a significant and visible impact on the VET at large (we have over 4000 apprentices in our counties). The apprentices will be recruited within the 40 different trades in which we have training opportunities abroad.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the apprentices will perform long term placements of 13 weeks, which would include language course and training in company. A few apprentices will perform only 6 to 10 weeks placements. The duration of 10 weeks is introduced for trainees that do not need language courses, it would mostly applys to placements in English speaking countries. The 6 weeks placements will enable us to include new publics, such as apprentices following YSK curriculum (vocational studies with university and college admission certification) and apprentices with weaker social or economic background. It also aims to increase the number of mobility from participants following a vocational training in the private sector, especially in industrial, electrical and mechanical trades. Indeed, we noticed a significant reduction of the number of applicants from this sector in the last two years. There are several explanations for this phenomenon, but we think that proposing short-term mobility would make work placement abroad more accessible. \r\nWe will cooperate with institutions in 9 European countries for organizing the placement: Austria, England, France, Greece, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. This allows us to offer training opportunities in a wide range of professions, our aim being to act upon vocational training at large and support individual projects initiated by apprentices themselves. The dissemination of the mobility flows between the participating countries takes into consideration the experience of the last years, the training offer in each country and the expected profile (and thus needs) of the applicants.\r\n\r\nWe expect the participants to achieve a large degree of independence, develop cultural awareness, develop their ability to work in a foreign environment and last but not least, strengthen their motivation and professional skills. We expect that the reflection born from this experience will provide better trained skilled workers that will feel equipped to cope with an increasingly more integrated and globalized society.\r\n\r\nWe plan to continue the gradual implementation of ECVET principles for improving the quality of the placements. We will continue to focus on strengthening the procedures for matching between apprentices and training establishments in order to increase the benefits of the mobility and secure better learning outcomes.", "http://www.euplanet.net", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NO01-KA116-038591_4"], ["6QS", "Carri\u00e8res Europ\u00e9ennes pour les Dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s R\u00e9cents de l'Enseignement Secondaire et Sup\u00e9rieur", "EUROPEAN PLACEMENT NETWORK Limited", 288792.0, "The IERF, founded in 1995, an organisation providing training, career guidance and mobility accompaniment, proposes for consideration the renewal of the CEDRES.S project \u2013 \u201cEuropean Careers for Recent Graduates of Secondary and Higher Education\u201d, approved through simplified procedure since 2014.\r\nThis project aims at offering each year to 100 participants from the Ile de France region, mobility path that will enable them to professionalise themselves and enhance their employability. Based, since 2009, on certified methodologies born under the Leonardo da Vinci program, and then on the implementation of Erasmus+, our project CEDRES.S offered to more than 300 VET learners (young people aged 18-25 on their integration path, unemployed people changing career, young graduated) the opportunity to carry out a qualifying path in a European company. \r\nResults are convincing and on line with European studies: 3 to 6 months upon return, 65 % of the participants will be back to work and among them, 15% abroad. 15% will integrate a new training and 5% will decide to experience another mobility to enhance their qualification.  \r\nWhilst CEDRE.S is clearly structured in terms of phases and apprenticeship units, its overriding purpose is to encompass and improve the professional capacities of participants of level V to I, who have left either secondary education, higher education or full-time training of any sort within the past year. It would offer them an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d programme of qualification, embracing different job skills, technical linguistic capacities and intercultural exposure, all designed to meet the individual\u2019s specific needs at the time.\r\nOne of the principal advantages of the teaching programme resides in the cross-fertilisation between these 3 aspects which make up the whole experience. To help the students attain this goal, we have devised two mobility \u201croad-maps\u201d: group departure supervised by intermediary host organisations, particularly geared to young people in integration from level V to II, and individual departures with direct contractualisation of host companies - targeted at participants of a higher level, either older or with longer professional experience. Whilst the periods of mobility can vary, the teaching plan contains the same stages and objectives:\r\n1. Pre-departure: collective socioprofessional guidance sessions accompanied by individual assessments. Intercultural and language preparation.\r\n2. Abroad (outside France): practical internship in a company meeting the profile or personal project of each participant, with constant monitoring to measure linguistic and professional progress, certified by Europass and level tests.\r\n3. On return to France: session to assess what has been learnt from this experience, followed by accompaniment during 3 to 6 months to allow the participants to:\r\n- Develop their capacity to summarise and explain in their own words the key skills acquired in relation to the specific professional context they have chosen.\r\n- Learn to identify what experience and training is most relevant to maintaining a competitive professional profile on the job market, this in a logic of \u201cLong Life Learning\u201d.\r\n- Acquire a continuous ability to judge their own progress, their technical, linguistic and intercultural skills, hence enabling them to position themselves to advantage vis-\u00e0-vis European or international recruiters.\r\n- Identify concrete employment opportunities: a major indicator of the impact of our project is integration in the job market within 6 months.\r\nWe have built a partnership network with experienced intermediary organisations and companies in 18 different countries to ensure optimum welcome and logistics for participants. Clear specifications are drawn up with appropriate norms against which performance is measured, supervised by the IERF and a Piloting committee. Choice of the partners reflects level of demand by country; English and Spanish-speaking destinations tend to dominate language-based requests, but other countries are selected as a function of specific sectors.\r\nTo encourage initiative, evaluate results and publish them, we collaborate with centres located throughout the Ile de France region, which in turn embraces 250 organisations, whose vocation it is to assist this public in obtaining employment. \r\nThe Erasmus+ Mobility Charter acquired in 2015 as well as the active partnership of many public authorities should help to enlarge our partnership networks to other teaching organisations or local authorities. It should also contribute to confirm the qualifying and professionalising dimension of mobility paths.", "http://www.euplanet.net", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA116-046411_9"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["5SP", "ProConnect Hertfordshire", "Creative England", "This programme will provide meaningful specialist support to SMEs working in or in the supply chain to the film and TV production industry as well as new market entrants to ensure they are well placed to start their own business.
