With continued European growth in demand for water, finite reservoirs of readily-treatable water, rising energy costs and increased environmental legislation, EU industry is experiencing significant competitive threats with regard to cost-efficient supply and treatment of water.\n\nMicrobial Fuel Cells (MFCs) utilise electrochemically-active microbes to convert the inherent energy of organic chemical bonds to electrical energy. MFCs encompass unique features that offer advantages for the treatment of wastewater, including: efficient electricity generation; minimal sludge formation; operation at low temperature; and modular cell design, enabling operation at small scale and customisation to specific end-user requirements.\n\nA core group of SMEs have identified a unique opportunity to advance MFC technology for industrial wastewater treatment, thereby generating sustainable and competitive business growth. Key innovations include MFC integration with photocatalytic advanced oxidation and a membraneless MFC air cathode design; and a scalable cost-efficient MFC and architecture design incorporating innovative process monitoring & control strategies. System features and benefits include:\n\n- Capital cost equivalence with existing aerobic treatment solutions\n- Significant operational cost savings, realised through:\n- Recovery of organic content as electrical energy & achieving system sustainability (self-powering);\n- Enhanced treatment efficiency enabling water reuse for on-site non-potable applications;\n- Significant cost reductions for sludge disposal and treated wastewater discharge to sewer\n- Flexible design and operation customised to specific end-user (sector) requirements and enabling treatment of wastewaters of varying composition and containing hazardous micropollutants\n\nThe project will result in a pilot-scale MFC system demonstrated for a target industrial wastewater.

The target group is SMEs and specifically those from the 50 \u2013 150 employee level. Within this target group, those organisations with high growth potential will be prioritised. The primary development focus will be on operation models which reflect the High Mix Low Volume (HMLV) manufacturing environment which companies must migrate towards in order to survive and compete. The project will address competitiveness issues relating to European SMEs, the lack of take up of productivity methodologies such as Lean and Six Sigma and the changing nature of the business environment in which SMEs operate. A comprehensive response will be generated which will deliver and demonstrate solutions for SMEs in relation to strategic planning, cultural and structural issues preventing adoption of best practices, modified lean and six sigma tools tailored for SME businesses, virtual manufacturing and collaboration methods, value chain enhancement methods, process modelling and simulation tools, implementation methodologies within SME organisations, design for environment support tools and workflow process development tools for SMEs. In addition, a special task will pilot and test how lean, six sigma and environmental philosophies can be integrated into school curricula in order to influence the mindset of future employees towards best practice business philosophies.

The model has identified four areas of capability that are required by a business in order for it to be successful. These include strategic, operational, managerial and adaptive capabilities, of which the adaptive capability is the most important for ensuring long-term sustainability.\n\nTransforming an SME into an adaptive enterprise is the job of the FutureSME architecture. This comprises a web portal, business diagnostics, resources to help with implementation, and a structured programme leading to accreditation. The business diagnostics have already been implemented for some end-user partners, while a self-assessment version is under development.\n\nThe support environment contains a number of productivity methodologies such as Lean materials, a life-cycle tool set and 6 Sigma (business management strategy) for SMEs. A modified architecture for schools has also been piloted by the FutureSME initiative that will encourage youngsters to develop a best practice business philosophy.\n\nTools, techniques and the delivery platform developed in FutureSME will enable organisations to boost their ability to adapt. The manufacturing model will be rigorously tested in SMEs and other companies across a number of manufacturing sectors within several countries.\n\nResults from FutureSME will be disseminated across the EU helping small- and medium-sized enterprises across Europe develop a sustainable business model.

It is indispensible for local companies depending on export to encourage their trainees\u2019 language skills. The results of the mobility activities over the last years have shown that the participants not only improved their language skills but furthermore enriched their intercultural and methodological competences, not to speak of their positive personal development and tolerance. The \"European thought\" can be considered as a long-term benefit. The involved companies and the Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen Lahr are committed to an improvement of these competencies. The mobility project is going to take place from July until beginning of October 2016.  Thirteen of 20 trainees of the class in the \"Duales Berufskolleg\" are going to do their job placements in the UK, France,  Poland, Spain, Austria and the Czech Republic. The trainees of the Duales Berufskolleg are required to complete a job placement for several weeks or months during their training. The training companies completely support this measure since they profit from the knowledge and the skills that the trainees acquire in the partner companies abroad. An important part of the mobility measure is the realization of a project which usually deals with current European topics. It is supposed to improve first and foremost the trainees\u2019 linguistic and social skills. Work on the topic \u201cEffects of the demographic changes on the social security in European countries\" poses the question, which results are to be expected.
