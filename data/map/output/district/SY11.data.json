The Flemish Government wants to reverse this trend by focusing on the development of a new system of Dual Learning in Flanders. The development of this new system implies working on the quality of both classical teaching and workplace learning. SYNTRA Flanders has been appointed as the neutral director of the workplace component.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by successful transnational projects from the past, SYNTRA Flanders and its partners in the Flemish field of Dual Learning are convinced that internationalization is a very important asset for the quality development of the system.\r\n\r\nWe intend to learn from success stories (but also from the mistakes) from other EU Member States. What is innovative in Flanders might be old news abroad, and transnational projects will allow us to model and implement innovative processes, methods and products in the Flemish field. There is a need for transnational co-operation and knowledge sharing between the consortium and our international partners, both at the level of the actors within the education component, as in the workplace component. We also hope to transfer Flemish good practices to our foreign partners.\r\n\r\nThe consortium plans to send approximately 200 apprentices from the Dual Learning system to foreign companies, with support of 14 partner organizations in the Netherlands, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe participants will perform 4 types of tasks in the abovementioned countries: first, there is obviously the learning of specific professional and technical skills and generic work skills at the placement company. Furthermore, the participants will also follow a socio-cultural program elaborated by our foreign partners, and will have the opportunity to develop foreign language skills - except the participants who will flock to the Netherlands. Finally, we expect the participants to record an ambassador role within their classroom, school or training center, where they will help to carry out and promote the importance of the international dimension and international mobility within their own organization and region.\r\n\r\nThrough this approach, we want to improve the attractiveness of Dual Learning and give Dual Learners the opportunity to strengthen their professional technical and personal skills by an international experience - and thus also to increase their employment opportunities.", "http://www.wnsc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-BE02-KA102-034698_6"], ["4QB", "European Placement Programme", "North Shropshire College", 586750.0, "European Placement Programme (EPP) is a mobility project enabling a range of North Shropshire College  Apprentices, full time and part time VET students to undertake two week work placements with one of our host partners in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe project follows on from previous Leonardo VET and KA1 Erasmus+ mobility projects, and builds on previous Leonardo Strategic Partnership Projects.   The host partners are from Germany, France, Spain, Finland, Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden  and Italy.  These were selected so that best match of training opportunities for our participants could be delivered.   All of the partners already work with us, either through VET mobility projects or previous partnership projects or have been identified through personal contacts.  \r\n\r\nThe  College delivers VET mobility projects because of the vocational and personal benefits to be gained by participating students, the staff and organisational benefits from working with European partners, as well as the wider benefits of engendering a sense of European Citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe EPP project will send 290 participants from the vocational areas of Agriculture, Motor Vehicle, Engineering, Hospitality & Catering, Hairdressing, Travel & Tourism , Animal Care, Child Care, Construction, Electrical, Plumbing, Health and Social Care, Business, Sport, Countryside and Gamekeeping to undertake specifically identified elements of their vocational training with our host partners.   Prior to travel, participants will have gone through a selection process which contributes to their learning and personal development and have received linguistic and cultural preparation, to maximize opportunities and benefits.  Approximately 50% of the participants will come from disadvantaged backgrounds.   In addition to the vocational training, the participants will undertake a programme of cultural activities.\r\n\r\nIn delivering the project participants will be identified through a transparent recruitment process which will also form part of their personal development.   Support will be given to disadvantaged participants throughout the process where required to ensure equality of opportunity.    Learning agreements, behavior contracts and information documentation will be produced and provided to participants to ensure maximum benefit can be derived whilst taking part.    Service Level Agreements detailing all practical, financial and support arrangements will be put in place between the College and each of the hosting partners.   Each flow of participants will be accompanied by two members of staff who can provide both pastoral support and directly assess learning undertaken during the mobility allowing it to be incorporated into the qualifications being studied.    A well established process of monitoring, evaluation and dissemination will be operated throughout the delivery of this project.  \r\n\r\nAssessment by accompanying people  alongside host partner staff will allow achievements of participants  to be directly recognized in their vocational qualification.   Experience has shown that in addition to developing vocational skills, taking part in a mobility project significantly develops core personal skills, thus enhancing participants performance in further training and future employment.   It also develops a greater cultural awareness and  engenders a sense of European citizenship.   These benefits do not just impact on the participating individuals but filter through the whole student body as a result of dissemination.  Through the dissemination of the results of mobilities, awareness can be raised of the benefits of taking part in the project amongst a wider audience including employers, partners and other organisations with which the College has involvement.", "http://www.wnsc.ac.uk", "North Shropshire College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-035657_coordinator"], ["4QB", "MONTEARAGON GO ABROAD", "North Shropshire College", 24600.0, "MONTEARAGON GO ABROAD\r\nCPIFP Montearag\u00f3n aims with the present Project to give continuity and sustainability to the three previous projects within KA102, which aimed to improve its policy in upgrading, innovation and internationalization of Erasmus+ program. \r\nCPIFP Montearag\u00f3n is a small vocational school located in Huesca, where the students have a varied offer of studies: Basic vocational level: Forestry and weldering. Vocational Level 3: Agriculture, gardening and florestry, forestry, Community and health service; Weldering and mechanical manufacture. High education Level 5B: Forestry, animal care and Early childhood care and education.\r\nAfter analizing the school\u00b4s location context , we have established the following objectives:\r\n- Taking part in projects of mobility for both students and teachers.\r\n-Promoting the involvement in these programs of students who gave up school, through the partial mobilities, directed to students of level 3 grade from basic professional training and pupils of FPB.\r\n- Participating in international cooperative projects.\r\n-Carrying out different Erasmus mobilities and other European programs granted, boosting the participation both of students and teachers.\r\n-Helping and promoting the application of different methodologies which apply innovation (learning and service, work by challenge).\r\nThe activities proposed in this Project are:\r\nStudents\u00b4mobilities to learn professional skills in European companies , which will be of two different types; 4 short time mobilities, with a total of 19 days in a company , whose students are studying vocational level 3, and who come from basic vocational training or who did not finish their compulsory secondary education studies; however, they stand out because of their work in practical activities and competences, and 3 long time mobilities, where  the students will finish their studies in companies; for this type of mobilities, the selected students\u00b4profile will be students who stand out because of their good behavior and their qualifications and professional competences.\r\nThere are also 2 mobilities to train teachers in companies or primary or secondary schools, which allow them to acquire different  skills in methodologies or professional skills to apply them later in their teacher development.\r\nFor this project\u00b4s development and management, a mobility commission is set up for the first time in CPIFP Montearag\u00f3n, which will contribute to the broadcasting and  achievement of the results.\r\nTo give sustainability to previous projects and try to guarantee our objectives\u00b4continuity , two of our host partners have cooperated with us in previous citations, IISS \"Parentucelli/Arcel\u00e1\"  and North Shropshire College, and for the first time \"Edudelta\" is included, a Dutch vocational school which  enables us to improve our quality in our mobilities\u00b4offer.\r\nWith the activities described in the project and with the help of the selected host partners, we aim to strengthen the European development project; this project enables to improve and enhance our studets\u00b4training, reinforcing no t only their academic, professional and linguistic skills, but also their inter and intrapersonal skills. This will give them a sense of belonging to the European society.\r\nThe students will have their mobility recognised thanks to their  Europass certificates, known throughout Europe. These certificates will allow them to stand out in a very demanding labour market.\r\nWe expect more involvement in these European programs, both from students and teachers; apart from this, we also expect that students from basic professional training and vocational level 3 continue their studies so that we can improve their professional skills .\r\nFurthermore, this Project whishes to continue improving the school\u00b4s international image within our community and our host partner countries, all this is shown by Erasmus projects, which have existed for 30 years. \r\nOur host partners will benefit from the cultural and professional exchange our students will keep with their students.", "http://www.wnsc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-036164_1"], ["4QB", "2015-1-FI01-KA109-009223", "North Shropshire College", 179988.0, "The main strategy for 2016 \u2013 2020 of Vocational Education Center Sedu has paid a special focus on an international vision: Sedu \u2013 pioneer in competence for us and the world. Vision remarks further with the statement: Sedu supports internationalization and works daringly in global networks; according to this mission, we develop international operations.  Sedu wishes to works as a pioneer of internationalization with collaboration between its regional and international partners.  International mobility numbers are used as measure for the development work and an indicator for the success of the strategy.\r\n\r\nSedu has invested in advancement of international mobility and aims for the controlled growth of both student and staff mobility. Mobilities are financed by Erasmus + programme, education centre\u2019s own funds and with the project funds from Finnish Board of Education. \r\n\r\nThe quality of the mobility periods of the students and staff that funded by the Mobility Charter have been the significant part of our school\u2019s international operations. Alongside the mobilities the home internationalization is the second key priority of the international operations. Vocational Education Center Sedu also accepts big amounts of students from our foreign educational partners, which also supports our home internationalization.\r\n\r\nAccording to the mobility statistics of the year 2016 the long term exchange periods of the students has been significantly grown since the previous year, and steady growth is expected in the future.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we seek to ensure the equal opportunity participation in mobility periods for students from all sectors and all ages. Boys have been less interested in the past for participating in exchange periods and so in the future we will give more attention to this fact in the recruitment process. We will also give more attention to the fields that have been participating less in exchanges in the past and additionally the VALMA \u2013 preparatory training students are guaranteed to participate in the mobilities equally with the assistance of supporting staff for the whole period.\r\n\r\nAdult education and apprenticeship-training students\u2019 interest towards international activities is increasing and Sedu is dedicated to increase the demand further. In the light of the vocational education reform, foreign exchange periods can be seen as one of the natural possibilities for personalization and implementation of the personal education pathway. The individual needs of the student is addressed by the wide variety of international partner networks, that helps us ensure for high quality foreign exchange periods.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, our education centre is active in Education Export and development of the staff\u2019s international skills. Sedu supports staff on their international work placement periods in partner institutions and companies to learn good practices and improve their cross-cultural skills. Besides the initiating immigrant training causes challenges for the staff\u2019s existing skills, the foreign exchange periods can increase staff skills in this point as well.", "http://www.wnsc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA116-034411_16"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SY11"}
