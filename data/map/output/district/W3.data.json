Fault is defined as any deterioration of the functional profile of informational system, the volumetric profile, and  the security profile<br/>- Support for a reconfiguration as an efficient system<br/>The primary objective of GEMOM is to research, develop and deploy a prototype of a messaging platform that is evolutionary, self-organising, self healing, scalable and secure. GEMOM will be resilient and be able to utilise redundant modules (hot-swap or switchover) instantly without information loss. These resilience features will allow specialist, independent system actors, viz. watch-dogs, security and situation monitors, routers, and other optimisers, to remove or replace compromised nodes from the broader network instantly without compromising higher level functionality.<br/>GEMOM considers the Publish-Subscribe variant of Message Oriented Middleware to be the predominant one and will focus on issues surrounding that kind of messaging. For completeness GEMOM would provide a synchronous Request and Reply overlay as well. <br/>The advances that GEMOM proposes to make to the area of messaging revolve around the notion of a 'fault'. In addition to the intuitive understanding of what a fault might be, whereby any actor stops being operable, connection is lost etc, GEMOM extends the notion of fault to include compromised security or inadequate bandwidth availability in the first iteration and compromised abstract notion of 'resource' in its final iteration.", 454234.0, 3906660.0, "GEMOM", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_85407_999682292"], ["9PR", "Collaborative, Complex and Critical Decision-Support in Evolving Crises", "Q-Sphere Limited", "TRIDEC focuses on new technologies for real-time intelligent information management in collaborative, complex critical decision processes in earth management. Key challenge is the construction of a communication infrastructure of interoperable services through which intelligent management of dynamically increasing volumes and dimensionality of information and data is efficiently supported; where groups of decision makers collaborate and respond quickly in a decision-support environment. The research and development objectives include the design and implementation of a robust and scalable service infrastructure supporting the integration and utilisation of existing resources with accelerated generation of large volume of data. These include sensor systems, geo-information repositories, simulation- and data-fusion-tools. A knowledge-based service framework is deployed for context information and intelligent information management with flexible orchestration of system resources. An adaptive framework for collaborative decision making is enabled with new functions for the support of complex business processes. TRIDEC will be demonstrated within two scenarios. Both involve intelligent management of large volumes of data for critical decision-support. One concerns a large group of experts working collaboratively in crisis centres and government agencies using sensor networks. Their goal is to make critical decisions and save lives, infrastructural and industrial facilities in evolving tsunami crises. The other concerns a large group of consulting engineers and financial analysts from energy companies working collaboratively in sub-surface drilling operations. Their common objective is to monitor drilling operations in real-time using sensor networks, optimising drilling processes and critically detecting unusual trends of drilling systems functions.

The holistic Platform will provide travellers, businesses, planners and other mobility stakeholders with the tools to play their part in creating a new mobility culture promoting timely and informed climate-friendly travel choice and policies. The Platform will enable travellers to understand the climate change impacts of their choices, and take effective actions to reduce them, and enable policy decision makers to include carbon constraints into their actions.   The Platform will include a range of CATCH tools, including a virtual environmental travel assistant, and be driven by the CATCH mobility knowledge engine.  The main project activities to achieve this aim are: - Strong user understanding and user-based design; - review of the results in previous research, and engagement with existing EU funded projects WISETRIP and i-Travel projects, and the CIVITAS initiative; - realization of a database of GHG and transportation performance, which interfaces with appropriate emissions-related systems; - identification and assessment of climate-friendly travel scenarios; - development, testing and validation of the mobility knowledge engine;  - defined exploitation path and wide dissemination of results through a dedicated internet web site,  publications, conferences and workshops. CATCH will involve 40 cities and global carbon constraint professionals from mobility and related fields.  Each city and professional has different experiences and brings new understanding.
