Fault is defined as any deterioration of the functional profile of informational system, the volumetric profile, and  the security profile<br/>- Support for a reconfiguration as an efficient system<br/>The primary objective of GEMOM is to research, develop and deploy a prototype of a messaging platform that is evolutionary, self-organising, self healing, scalable and secure. GEMOM will be resilient and be able to utilise redundant modules (hot-swap or switchover) instantly without information loss. These resilience features will allow specialist, independent system actors, viz. watch-dogs, security and situation monitors, routers, and other optimisers, to remove or replace compromised nodes from the broader network instantly without compromising higher level functionality.<br/>GEMOM considers the Publish-Subscribe variant of Message Oriented Middleware to be the predominant one and will focus on issues surrounding that kind of messaging. For completeness GEMOM would provide a synchronous Request and Reply overlay as well. <br/>The advances that GEMOM proposes to make to the area of messaging revolve around the notion of a 'fault'.

In recent years, the EU has demonstrated strong commitment to sustainable development and its successful incorporation into many of the union policies. Climate change prevention policy and energy policy of the EU are proof of the importance of sustainable development. As regards young people, the idea of \u200b\u200bsustainability implies that economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection must go together and complement each other. The ongoing global economic and financial crisis has shown that sustainable development is crucial to Europe's future. Restoring confidence in the financial system and the stability of the economy is a top priority for reversing the recession and paving the way for sustainable development where employment, social inclusion, investment in skills and technologies are fostered to boost economic growth, achieve long-term prosperity and environmental protection - all the goals of sustainable development in the long run. Current crises represent an opportunity for Bulgaria to move towards an environmentally efficient economy characterized by low carbon emissions and resource efficiency based on sustainable production in all sectors and a more sustainable lifestyle. This will improve the well-being of all citizens while reducing energy consumption and natural resources and minimizing negative impacts on health and the environment, in particular regarding ecosystems and climate change. Based on these identified needs, we define as a priority the role of young people in realizing the above-mentioned goals and opportunities. Taking into account the fact that many young people have great difficulty in integrating professionally because they do not have the social competences required in the work environment, the Sustainable European Future project directs partner organizations to a very serious and worrying problem among young people - social exclusion. In order to limit these risks, we are focusing on developing the \"soft\" skills required by employers.\r\nThe project has three main objectives that are directly related to the three pillars of sustainable development - economic, social and environmental:\r\n1. Economic development - The project aims to increase the competitiveness of young people, including those with fewer opportunities on the European labor market.\r\n2. Social development - The project aims to stimulate intercultural dialogue. It is aimed at building common values \u200b\u200brelated to respect for human rights, respect for other cultures, religions, customs and lifestyles through learning amongst equal partners.\r\n3. Environmental development - The project aims to increase the commitment of young people to the problems related to the conservation of natural resources.\r\nDuring the Sustainable European Future project, 53 young people aged 18-25 will work together to implement the principles of sustainable development, with 28 young people from Bulgaria and 25 from the UK.\r\nThe project will include project management activities, implementation of youth exchanges and dissemination and reporting of project results. The methodology used is based on organizational, management, non-formal learning methods and accounting and analytical methods.\r\nThe main results of the project are related to the defined objectives and are expressed in:\r\n1. Expanding youth employment by increasing the competitiveness of project participants, based on the development of soft skills and the enhancement of key competences in English.\r\n2. Mediating intercultural dialogue through the integration of young people of different nationalities during the exchange and building friendships and solidarity among them.\r\n3. Increasing the commitment of young people to the principles of sustainable development.\r\nThe impact of the project will promote young people's professional development, cultural diversity and mediate tolerance and intercultural exchange, which in turn will help address the social exclusion problems of specific youth groups. The Sustainable European Future project will increase young people's commitment to sustainable development. They will be able to successfully integrate into society and take an active role in the labor market. Collaboration between project partners allows the exchange of good practices.

The development of communication skills, incl. skills for non-verbal communication, digital communication skills and language competences, are an effective tool for the integration of youth, including those with fewer opportunities into the labor market; for the realization of intercultural dialogue and for building the Active European citizenship. This project proposal focuses on the communication as a skill which could be developed. Communication covers all the aspects of young people`s lives and is the basis for successful business negotiations; effective social relationships; the ability to defend ideas and positions; the confidence to express ourselves as we are. Often young people do not realize how powerful tool for integration into the labor market  and into the common European society the communication is. In this regard, the project proposal aims to develop the communication skills of the participants so that they can successfully reduce the level of the youth unemployment and form themselves as active European citizens who clearly express their positions.

The methods for communication;\r\n4. The objectives of the Erasmus + Program;\r\n5. The culture of the other participants.\r\nAlong with the acquired knowledge, the participants in the project will also develop the following skills:\r\n1. Ability to communicate in English;\r\n2.

The results achieved by the implementation of the project are related to personal development, because raising awareness for the problems and cultural specificity of their peers from other nationalities will make them more tolerant and build solidarity among them. They will be able to express themselves and communicate between each other which will contribute for their effective integration into the European society.\r\nThe participants in the project will have the opportunity to develop themselves as active European citizens through the international spirit created by the communication among young people.

The training, the case studies and teamwork will be used to improve intercultural dialogue among young people.

During the activities, non-formal learning methods will be used, with the main focus being on teamwork. We will also use different game methods, case studies, outdoor activities, brainstorming, group work, and job evaluation meetings.\r\nWith the youth exchange we are going to make, we want to raise solidarity and empathy among young people by focusing on inter-religious dialogue. In this way, a single European society will be built, young people will be tolerant among themselves, adaptable in a multicultural environment, and will limit xenophobia and racism among people of different religions. In a single European society, and given the current international conflicts, large groups of young people are at risk of social exclusion as a result of cultural, ethnic or religious differences. With the project we aim to help peace in Europe, because young people are the key to achieving this.
