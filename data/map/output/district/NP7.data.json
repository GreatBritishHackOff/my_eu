It also includes certifications for the skills acquired during the learning pathway both for teachers and for students. The project is about exchanging the best practices to implement better Green Life Styles in fact it aims  to create a network of good practices to deal with those environmental issues  that are threatening our own local areas (air, water and soil pollution, garbage disposal, etc), but also with unhealthy behavior (eating junk food,  sedentariness, use of chemical cleaning products, etc.).As a first step in the development of the project, the students should acquire knowledge and be inspired by green good practices, already  successfully implemented in each partner country. In the second year of the project activities, they should plan how \"to  import\", to replicate, that \u201cgreen\u201d idea/solution in their own local area (\u201cgreen\u201d products, technologies, sustainable alternatives etc.). In the end, 6-11year old students should be able to plan a \u201cgreen\u201d advertising campaign and 12-15 year old students should be able to draw up a simple \u201cgreen\u201d Business Plan to be submitted to the local organizations and institutions to support  and \"to sell\" the chosen green idea.The project and  the study visits as well will be focused on experiential, environmental, and entrepreneurial learning expanding  the students\u2019 sense of global citizenship and environmental responsibility and fostering entrepreneurial, technological education.The objectives of the project  are in step with  the common political priorities and transversal priorities established  by the E.C. in the field of education and training (ET 2020) whose essential purpose is supporting the improvement of education systems, mutual learning, exchange of good practices and  professional development  of teachers as well.All the  educational activities  expected in our project  as:- Providing training for teachers; - Considering and appreciating  the best practices of our  partners' countries in the field of sustainable lifestyles,- finding  a way to ensure the exchange of information on best practices in this field (using English, modern technologies);visiting our partners' countries with  surveys and on-site workshops; -  mentoring young students to produce business ideas in order to \"export\" and / or \"to import\" the healthy /eco-friendly lifestyle which is efficacious and innovative in our partner's country;- steering the  students, future citizens of Europe, towards thinking and planning  a Green Economy that can be on the basis of future production and consumption systems based on the sustainable use of resources and reduction of negative impacts on the environment, are widely in line not only  with  the Strategic Objectives set by the E.U. for 2020 but also  with the strategic priorities redefined in COM (2015) 408 final del 26/08/2015 for European cooperation in education and training:  -  Strengthening the development of transversal skills and key competences, in line with the Reference     Framework on Key Competences for lifelong learning, in particular digital, entrepreneurship and      linguistic competences;- Promoting  awareness and education in the environmental field developing skills reflecting growing    sectors, such as the green economy;-Acquiring  and mainstreaming innovative and active pedagogies such as inter-disciplinary teaching and   collaborative methods, to enhance the development of relevant and high-level skills and competences; - Supporting continuing professional development of teachers  especially to deal with work based    learning, digital competences and innovative pedagogies, including through EU tools such as eTwinning; -  Supporting the mobility of students, teachers and the development of strategic partnerships and joint     courses by increasing internationalisation of education.Dissemination is a very important phase in  the project  focused on two main aspects of it:- knowledge and dissemination processes, habits or products belonging to the sphere of Green lifestyles;- education of the students from primary school to the culture of entrepreneurship and business. The outcomes of this transnational  cooperation will be widely disseminated among all the relevant stakeholders through events, fairs, exhibitions and all the  path and activities  will be published on  T.E.S. and Junior Achievement  sites  that collect all the good practices related to teaching entrepreneurial skills and shared with E-twinning community.", "http://www.gilwernprimaryschool.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT02-KA219-024333_2"]]}}, "7AD": {"cordis": {"data": [[1370044800000, 1483142400000, "Multilaser Additive Layer Manufacturing of Tiles", "Materials Solutions Lbg", "Laser Additive Layer Manufacturing of tiles in various nickel superalloys has been demonstrated at TRL4.

This will be achieved by the use of multiple lasers to address a larger build envelope and will otherwise be in line with the capability requirements stated in the topic call.\n\nThe Participants will first agree the requirements for the machine with the Topic Manager. From this a functional specification will be developed, embodying the essential design concepts to be realised. A test rig will be constructed and operated in order to explore methods for controlling the overlap areas between laser fields. An alpha system will be designed, constructed and tested in accordance with the functional specification and incorporating the learning from the test rig. A subsequent prototype machine, being a development of the alpha machine, will be designed built & tested prior to installation in a representative production environment.
