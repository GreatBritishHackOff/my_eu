In collaboration with the Topic Manager, one alloy will be selected for development. A representative application for the selected alloy will be defined and appropriate specifications determined for geometrical accuracy, surface finish and materials properties.\n\nThe first phase of experimental work will develop a Additive Layer Manufacturing process, optimised for the properties determined above.

Considerable investment has been made in developing materials data for the processes of record employed on the current generation of equipment, however this equipment is for general purpose prototyping and is not capable of high volume, low cost production of flight parts.\n\nThe objective of this project is to develop a second generation machine suitable for low cost manufacture while maintaining process equivalence to the current processes of record. This will be achieved by the use of multiple lasers to address a larger build envelope and will otherwise be in line with the capability requirements stated in the topic call.\n\nThe Participants will first agree the requirements for the machine with the Topic Manager. From this a functional specification will be developed, embodying the essential design concepts to be realised. A test rig will be constructed and operated in order to explore methods for controlling the overlap areas between laser fields. An alpha system will be designed, constructed and tested in accordance with the functional specification and incorporating the learning from the test rig.

A fundamental objective of lean burn is to combust fuel and air at cooler temperatures, resulting in lower oxides of nitrogen emissions. The most effective cooling designs are difficult to form conventionally and existing manufacturing methods require compromises that reduce performance or lifetime.\n\nLaser additive layer manufacturing of tiles is capable of forming the required complex geometries in nickel superalloys. However, the equipment used is for general purpose prototyping of low volumes of rig parts and is not capable of high-volume, low-cost production for flight parts.\n\nWith EU funding of the project 'Multilaser additive layer manufacturing of tiles' (MALT), scientists are aspiring to produce a multilaser machine prototype that enables low-cost unit manufacture. The system will be scalable both in speed and the build envelope size for higher volumes and part size, without change in the laser melt characteristics. In addition, it should demonstrate equivalence to state-of-the-art additive manufacturing methods, while being cost competitive and flexible in its design.\n\nScientists aim to produce and operate a test rig to explore methods of controlling the overlap areas between the multiple laser fields. So far, they have developed a requirement document for the machine under development, outlining the performance requirements. These relate to the build envelope, dimensional accuracy, material properties, reliability and maintainability, and cost of ownership.\n\nBased on this document, project partners have developed another document describing the validation testing that will be performed on the machine.\n\nScientists succeeded in designing a new process chamber incorporating four lasers and scanning systems. In addition, they used detailed computational fluid modelling to analyse the gas flow within the chamber. Software was developed to control the four lasers simultaneously, while various aspects of the system function were also tested. Simple test parts were manufactured and some preliminary material data was obtained.\n\nMALT objectives are in line with the Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe (ACARE), which has set ambitious targets for reducing harmful emissions.

At this time the process is faster than any other technique of comparable quality, however the parts are not produced at sufficient rate to make them economically viable for any but very high value specific applications. It has been identified that airframe production requires a large number of brackets of many different designs (>1200 in an Airbus A380). These are currently machined from aluminium and titanium billet, plate or forgings with extremely high wastage of material, which in the case of titanium alloys is expensive and contains scarce elements such as vanadium.\n\nThe development and knowledge created and protected in this project will allow the SME collaborators to exploit the advantage gained through the development of vastly superior additive manufacturing (AM) production systems.\n\nThe key outputs to the project will be:\n\n1.\tAn innovative new high power electron beam gun that has been designed for the EBM process and that enables high productivity processing.\n2.\tKnowledge surrounding the use of the high power electron beam gun, including the process control, and modelled and validated understanding of beam-powder bed interaction.", null, 1237436.0, "FastEBM", "High-power melting for fast processing", "The best production methods for aerospace parts with complex geometries have typically been slow and expensive. Advanced technology developed with EU support enables cost-effective mass production of such parts, slashing the selling price in half.", "Additive manufacturing (AM), in which a part is built up layer by layer from a computer-aided design file, has several advantages compared to standard shaping techniques. It produces a part close to final form and minimises post-processing energy consumption, time and material waste. It is particularly valuable in producing complex geometries with high precision.\n\nElectron beam melting (EBM) AM quickly produces parts in a powder bed in a vacuum box by melting sequential layers of powder with an electron beam. Its slow speed combined with the capital cost of equipment make it an expensive route for mass production of titanium alloy-based aerospace components. The EU-funded project FASTEBM accelerated the process with a novel high-power electron beam gun and associated process control technology.\n\nKey to project success was modelling and simulation. The team advanced a model of the EMB process that is successful in 2D simulations to accommodate 3D. They employed finite element modelling of the electron gun to increase beam power, the key to increasing processing speed.\n\nThe prototype was tested in industrial process trials by one project partner, who now has a registered trademark for the EBM technology. Simulations helped scientists identify a process window in which higher processing speeds are possible while ensuring acceptably low porosity and swelling for a successful build.\n\nResearchers also developed a process cost model. Its implementation demonstrated a potential decrease in selling price of titanium aerospace components by approximately 54\u00a0% compared to conventional processing methods thanks to savings in production costs. This would obviously have tremendous impact on the competitive position of EU aerospace components manufacturers, many of whom are small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nFASTEBM has delivered a prototype, very fast, high-precision EBM apparatus with control software and process models for large-scale production of titanium airframe parts.
