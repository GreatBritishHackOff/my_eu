Using a multi disciplinary approach, the exchanged staff will work on three main research areas.\nThe first one is focused on trade and investment flows and aims at identifying critical issues, gaps, and potentials in Europe-China relationships. Major effects of Europe-China agreements on foreign direct investments (FDI) and trade flows are examined. Problems encountered and opportunities to be seized at firm level will also be analyzed. The economic perspective is supported and enriched by the engineering and legal perspectives. Engineering knowledge is fundamental to defining concretely the sectors, products and processes which have high deployment potential. Engineering research activity is focused on two main research areas, both related with energy efficiency and carbon dioxide reduction: mobility and the transportation sector and low carbon buildings. The legal knowledge is relevant to understanding obstacles due to the regulatory environment, as well as to identifying appropriate solutions to enhance collaboration. Main investigation areas will be: offshore oil and gas and renewable energy; anti-dumping; environmental and social standards and corporate social responsibility.\nPOREEN aims at increasing the availability of interdisciplinary studies, with a comprehensive overview of Europe-China relations.

The long-range forecasts for investments and energy market are determined by highly interconnected environmental, geological and technological research despite scientific differences in modelling the scenarios and interpreting the data. The medium-range forecasts for investments and energy market largely depend on geopolitical considerations and internal pressure by public opinion and stakeholders. States, firms and other actors play their game within the current legal framework at the international, regional and national level. Accordingly, the proper policy design for the sustainable energy needs to be complemented by research on the legal, regulatory and geopolitical side.\nHowever, the characteristics of social sciences which drive their approach to such issues are determined by their fragmentation into sectoral domains and national traditions. It is commonly agreed that there are great benefits in overcoming the disciplinary divisions combining  scientific, social and economic considerations in order to assess the policy impact of sustainable energy.\nThe evaluation of the policies for sustainable energy investments requires to connect several national approaches on such topics, not only in Europe, where the fragmentation of social sciences into national traditions is a matter of fact.
