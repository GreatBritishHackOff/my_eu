Using a multi disciplinary approach, the exchanged staff will work on three main research areas.\nThe first one is focused on trade and investment flows and aims at identifying critical issues, gaps, and potentials in Europe-China relationships. Major effects of Europe-China agreements on foreign direct investments (FDI) and trade flows are examined. Problems encountered and opportunities to be seized at firm level will also be analyzed. The economic perspective is supported and enriched by the engineering and legal perspectives. Engineering knowledge is fundamental to defining concretely the sectors, products and processes which have high deployment potential. Engineering research activity is focused on two main research areas, both related with energy efficiency and carbon dioxide reduction: mobility and the transportation sector and low carbon buildings. The legal knowledge is relevant to understanding obstacles due to the regulatory environment, as well as to identifying appropriate solutions to enhance collaboration. Main investigation areas will be: offshore oil and gas and renewable energy; anti-dumping; environmental and social standards and corporate social responsibility.\nPOREEN aims at increasing the availability of interdisciplinary studies, with a comprehensive overview of Europe-China relations. Developing integrated knowledge is fundamental to provide useful and reliable information to support EU and local policymakers, as well as companies working in/with China. POREEN should lay the ground for further related studies on this topic and establish  integrated and interdisciplinary research links between European and Chinese centres of excellence.", 132497.0, 573596.0, "POREEN", null, null, null, null, "http://www.glawcal.org.uk", null, "fp7_105032_950078723"], ["1JS", "Evaluating Policies for Sustainable Energy Investments: towards an integrated approach on national and international stage", "Glawcal Limited", "Fundamental trends in the European Union and the world at large provide an increasingly important policy agenda for financing sustainable energy in terms of energy efficiency, innovation in energy exploitation and development of renewable resources. The long-range forecasts for investments and energy market are determined by highly interconnected environmental, geological and technological research despite scientific differences in modelling the scenarios and interpreting the data. The medium-range forecasts for investments and energy market largely depend on geopolitical considerations and internal pressure by public opinion and stakeholders. States, firms and other actors play their game within the current legal framework at the international, regional and national level. Accordingly, the proper policy design for the sustainable energy needs to be complemented by research on the legal, regulatory and geopolitical side.\nHowever, the characteristics of social sciences which drive their approach to such issues are determined by their fragmentation into sectoral domains and national traditions. It is commonly agreed that there are great benefits in overcoming the disciplinary divisions combining  scientific, social and economic considerations in order to assess the policy impact of sustainable energy.\nThe evaluation of the policies for sustainable energy investments requires to connect several national approaches on such topics, not only in Europe, where the fragmentation of social sciences into national traditions is a matter of fact. In turn, the global nature of the questions addressed by the project needs to be implemented through an IRSES programme in order to strengthen the research partnerships between European research organisations and research organisations from crucial world regions as far as European interests for energy matters are concerned.", 71246.0, 477538.0, "EPSEI", null, null, null, null, "http://www.glawcal.org.uk", null, "fp7_99662_950078723"], ["1JS", "Liberalism in Between Europe and China", "Glawcal Limited", "Reflecting on the issues of EU-China relationships, aims at developing a new understanding of liberalism in its economic, political and social dimensions.\nIt involves a comparative analysis of the cultural differences in its interpretation and of the political discrepancies in its enforcement, in particular with respect to economic, social and environmental rights in China and Europe in Modern times. It is a multidisciplinary project based on a comparative study of European and Chinese political philosophy and political economy, legal practice and philosophy of right.\n\nThe project stands at the confluence of two major issues for the European Union, in terms of internal policies as well as external actions: 1/ the position and role of the European Union in the World and 2/ the present and future of Human Rights.\nThe first issue, on liberal civil society and the various types of market-enhanced economies, brings concerns such as the World Trade Organization put forth recently when rebuking China\u2019s application to be reckoned as a \u201cmarket economy\u201d. It relates to the new partnerships that the European Union is building with China in the globalized World and in the aftermath of the sovereign debt crisis. Our project is comparative as it focuses both on relationships between the European Union and China in particular, and accommodates viewpoints from China\u2019s neighbors\nThe second issue, involving the present enforcement and future potential implementation and/or revision of Human Rights concepts, is addressed by focusing principally on the political, legal and economic aspects of the concept of Liberalism, regarded as made of several traditions, from social liberalism to liberal theories of economics. The project thus aims at disclosing cultural and political differences in terms of interpretation and of enforcement of \u201cLiberalism\u201d in China.\nLIBEAC is geared towards finding useful criterion for EU decision-making and thus als means Liberalism for Action.", null, 469611.0, "LIBEAC", null, null, null, null, "http://www.glawcal.org.uk", null, "fp7_106636_950078723"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2LL", "HAVERING COLLEGE OF FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION", 137541.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2016_20400", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "RM11"}
