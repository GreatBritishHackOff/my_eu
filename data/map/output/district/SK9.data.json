The project has three major goals, 1- to realize more effective collaboration models and a methodology for development of smart cities, 2- to connect with industry, and have them develop technology to the benefit of smart cities and 3- to showcase to society ambitious pilot projects. Main idea for this project is that after successful implementations in topics such as district heating, energy grids, local energy generation, energy efficiency for housing, now it is time for the next big step:  integrated flexible open infrastructures.\n\nThe approach  taken is the set-up of stakeholder teams in the demonstrator cities, to accelerate the realization of energy-efficient city development. This effort is supported by technology teams including industrial parties. Workshops aiming at decreasing the gap between innovation and implementation will be organized and knowledge-disclosing material will be developed by specialized working groups in retrofitting, smart grids, and heating and cooling. This approach holds for both technology and process improvement.\n\nThe demonstrators in Amsterdam and Grenoble include retrofitting 105000 m2 of housing to levels down to 53 kWh/m2, showing average savings of the order of 80%. Furthermore they include fully-functional smart grid development, electricity storage demonstrators, free cooling schemes and district heating efficiency improvements.\n\nThe City-zen project recognizes the key position of citizens, so ample attention is paid to dissemination and education of this group. Serious gaming is included as part of the work, as well as a roadshow bringing the results of the project right at the doorsteps of decision makers in other cities.\n\nExtensive monitoring of all buildings and installations is included.\n\nAll demonstrators together have an estimated impact of 59000 tonne/year  CO2 reduction. Amsterdam and Grenoble CO2 reduction goals for 2050 are 80% reduction.\n\n'", null, 35163760.0, "CITY-ZEN", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_197824_999626614"], ["7HZ", "District Information Modeling and Management for Energy Reduction", "Clicks and Links Ltd", "ICT is recognized as being a key player against climate change: pervasive sensors and actuators can efficiently control the whole energy chain (Smart Thermal/Electricity Grid). On the other side, advances on 3D modeling, visualization and interaction technologies enable user profiling and real-time feedback to promote energy efficient behaviors.

However, the use of engineered T cells is a challenging and complex field with further development and more proof-of-principle trials needed. This proposal builds upon previous EU funded pre-clinical projects and comprises a multidisciplinary and translational research group with wide-ranging relevant expertise. Building on encouraging clinical results targeting NY-ESO-1 in melanoma and the availability of clinical grade vector, the consortium proposes to rapidly initiate two landmark studies in this field: the first to examine the activity of engineered T cells in oesophago-gastric cancer as an example of a hard to treat common epithelial cancer;  the second to undertake a randomised phase II study to determine whether an optimised cell production system developed by the partners improves the current clinical response rates in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with NY-ESO-1 targeted T-cells. Success in these trials will enable the consortia and others to carryout larger trials and potentially approval of this type of therapy as a treatment for multiple cancer types. The inclusion of a major industrial partner focused on cell therapy technology and two SMEs focus on the delivery of cell therapy will facilitate future development of this area following these trials; indeed the project also includes plans to further automate and streamline cell processing to facilitate this development.

IMPACT addresses this skills\u2019 shortage by establishing an intersectoral and multidisciplinary SCIMS training network. IMPACT also brings cohesion to the fragmented SCIMS research and development activities within the EU.

Indeed, many users consider improved selectivity to be the key to taking SCIMS technology to a whole new level. Instead of private and public sectors working independently, we need a fresh, intersectoral approach.
