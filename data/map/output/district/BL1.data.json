This will require significant investment in new pipelines to bring the resource onshore. 10,000km of pipelines form part of the oil & gas infrastructure in the North Sea. Combined with the huge growth in the installation of offshore wind farms & telecommunication networks, many thousands of kilometres of newly installed subsea cables & pipelines (CPs) will be required. It is critical that such underwater infrastructure is properly managed over its lifetime to ensure proper laying, inspection, quality maintenance, quick repair and comprehensive decommissioning.\n\nExisting state-of-the-art cannot currently provide a complete lifecycle solution. The SonaTag project will develop a novel low-cost position, location & identification passive underwater tag and a custom designed sonar system designed to \u2018see\u2019 the tags. SonaTag will offer CP laying contractors a means to greatly reduce the cost of CP laying operations, thereby ensuring its initial adoption in the market. Downstream stakeholders such as IMR (Inspection Maintenance and Repair) crews and governments will have the means to locate and uniquely identify these vital assets.\n\nThe system will provide a robust environmentally sound solution for longterm lifecycle tagging by achieving the following objectives: specialised sonar with transmit power adequate for deployment (220 dB) at transmit end to achieve operational accuracy of \\/- 0.1m @ 10m to 1000m range; the ability to detect range & position of tag in 5secs @ 1000m and 2 secs @ 10m from sonar transceiver; inert tag device with detectability in high noise environments i.e. seabed.\n\nUsing this solution the project expects to comprehensively address the problem of unmanaged critical underwater infrastructure & address the high operation costs of laying CPs.

If a fire fighter succumbs to heat exhaustion he requires rescuing and this then exposes other fire fighters and the public to increased risk. In order to reduce the risk of heat stress, the firefighters are limited to the time they can be at the fire which increases the number of fire fighters needed to fight a fire and this reduces efficiency and introduces complication into the communications between the crews fighting the fire. The StayCool project will develop and prototype a novel system for cooling the body that is light weight, has low energy consumption and so can be worn for prolonged periods of time. Wearing the StayCool system will reduce the wearers core temperature and allow fire fighters to stay at the fire for greater periods of time and so improve the efficiency of fighting the fire, extinguishing the fire quicker and so reduce risk of loss of life and damage to property. The StayCool partnership is ideally placed to develop and exploit this technology having expertise in protective clothing design and manufacture, physiological and human factors testing, mathematical and thermodynamic modeling, access to rapid prototyping and manufacture facilities and the ability to design for manufacture to ensure the StayCool system can be fully exploited.

Several composites of fibre have thus been produced, stabilised and functionalised using different combinations of cross linkers and functionalising molecules. These are currently being evaluated using in vitro and in vivo tests.\n\nIn addition, cell isolation and culture protocols for tendon stem cells and tenocytes (also called tendon cells) were optimised to maintain their phenotype in culture. Studies are under way to assess whether the novel collagen-resilin composites can maintain tendon-derived cell phenotype and differentiate other stem cells towards tenogenic lineage.\n\nResearchers will further optimise processes to develop prototypes of collagen\u2013resilin composite constructs with and without tendon derived cells that are suitable for clinical application. Successful outcomes will provide effective therapeutic options for patients suffering from tendon injuries.\n\nStudy outcomes have yielded novel insights into the role of the biophysical characteristics of the 3D collagen-resilin composite on the cellular behaviour, scientific publications in high impact factor journals and several podium presentations and invited talks in international conferences and meetings.
