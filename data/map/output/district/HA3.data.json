The school stands out in specific areas of biotechnology, zoology, environment and horticulture, refrigeration and heat and applied arts and art education. The Wijnpers chooses for quality education that starts with the abilities and talents of the students. The purpose is to reduce school dropouts as much as possible, to make our student graduate with success, and to offer them opportunities within their future careers. \r\n\r\n\r\nBased on their recent policy choices, the Wijnpers wants to profile themselves as an international, multicultural and open-minded institution. With those objectives in mind, we want to extend the internal workings of the school. Our strategic aim is that students need to encounter at least two international experiences and create a way to succeed in using foreign languages in a functional way.\r\n\r\nIt is an ambitious goal since the Wijnpers\u2019 population has a lot of socially vulnerable students and students with learning disabilities. Therefore, the school will start with a CLIL-course (Content and Language Integrated Learning), and will continue the ongoing tradition of multi-day study tours to European cultural capitals and project weeks abroad.\r\n\r\nThis project proposition focuses on specific goals all in line with the major objectives of the school\u2019s vision : a training of the CLIL-team. The extra training fits into a staged plan that can be connected to the vertical structure of the CLIL-training in the school. It includes two intensive trainings in both target languages divided over two school years, according to the needs of the teachers involved in the project. \r\n\r\nThe content of the course includes, in accordance with the CLIL-principles, didactical ideas as well as the subject of the language itself. The short but intensive training abroad is in-house completed with the necessary lecture, networking, seminars and department meetings. They are part of the developmental plan of the school and get the same quality check and monitoring as the other projects of the school. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the project with this training has to cause a multiplying effect, both in terms of teaching abilities as in the internationalization of the school. The specific training of the CLIL-team, concerning the teaching methodology and the active language skills will result in strong professional results of all the teachers involved, an essential condition for the success of the CLIL-trajectory and the school\u2019s general stand on the (foreign) language policy. \r\nFor the school and their foreign partners this project will function as a learning curve and a growing partnership in which knowledge, contacts and experience will be exchanged.

The despatching organization hopes to trigger a boost of motivation for the students, together with incremental competences for students and teachers alike; companies in both countries may get an insight into the working processes of their foreign colleagues; the German companies benefit from this new, cultural facet in their training program. Supporting young people entering the labour market has to include the imparting of intercultural competence. Being able to communicate serenely with international partners, is now no longer a unique selling point, but has already become a basic requirement for survival in the modern labour market in the relevant line of business.\r\nEvery student of the media and IT professions being trained at Martin-Segitz-Schule can apply for the project. Majority, motivation, language- and social skills are the main criteria for selection. The latter will be carried out in consultation with class teachers and trainers.\r\nIn the preparatory workshop, or even before, the chosen ones will submit CVs, application letters. These guarantee adequate allocation of internships and the student-centered design of the language-course. In addition, we will coach participants for the project in cross-cultural, linguistic and organizational terms. Students can ask all questions in person or communicate by phone or instant-messaging with the project manager; they can swap ideas on the weblog or via e-mail. The accompanying staff of the BIII and coordinators of the ADC College will be available on site at all times. The former are going to visit the students during the language course and every one of them at their internship position in order to be convinced of the quality of student activities or to intervene directly if necessary.\r\nIn April/May 2018, the three-week project will be carried out in Harrow, Greater London for the fourth time.\r\nThe day before their homebound departure, the interns evaluate the ADC College in terms of accommodation, language courses and internships.

We also want to spread the concept of dual vocational training in European countries.\r\nWith our student flow, thirty clerical trainees in industries such as bank, office, retail, wholesale, automobile and industy will get the opportunity to live and work in London for three weeks. First of all the participants are going to take part in a one-week language course and after that they are going to complete an internship of two weeks at selected London companies. Furthermore, the participants are going to be accommodated with London host families for their whole stay abroad. With our teacher flows in this project application we will also give our teachers the opportunity to gain experience abroad for the first time. Three teachers of our BSZ will do an internship of four days at selected companies in Barcellona Pozzo di Giotto (Sicily) and seven teachers of our department of economics will be sent to the German vocational school FEDA in Barcelona to prepare joint material for exam preparation and to develop a concept for improving the media use in vocational schools (with regard to Industry 4.0).\r\nAbove all we expect that our projects will contribute to the further internationalisation of the BSZ. New partnerships are to be cultivated and further developed. For this reason, we hope that the vocational training at the BSZ will better live up to the claim to the international orientation of vocational education and training through these projects and that further international projects will be implemented in the future.

Furthermore, participants of this project increase their mobility, flexibility and self-confidence. Improving foreign language skills in everyday life and in their working environment and further development of intercultural awareness are very essential issues within this project.\r\n\r\nParticipants:\r\nThe participants study vocational preparation courses or study towards a work-based qualification to gain job-specific skills. In general, they are in vocational education training so that participants would use their knowledge and skills in their placements of the receiving institutions, organisations or enterprises. The new working environment arouses interest and enhances their professional skills.

In those, a mentor will evaluate the student\u2019s progress in the program, verify the quality of the placement and discuss areas of improvement with the participant.\r\nAs a result of the internships, the students should develop various competences on a linguistic, professional, social, personal and intercultural level. In the process, they should use their ideas and skills, examine and reconsider them and as a result develop and improve them. Consequently, they should also strengthen their own personality and thus become mature members of the European society and also confident employees. \r\nBut the development in the process of the project should not be limited to a small number of people. By publishing the experiences, we anticipate a development for both the school community, for the companies involved as well as for the entire region of Wertheim, Baden-Wuerttemberg. The project should prove to be a vivid example for the ideas and hopes of the European unification. In consequence, we hope to help strengthening the authority of the European Union and its institutions.

For the benefit of the future of Europe and continued peaceful coexistence across borders, it is of the uttermost importance that young people today gain multicultural and international competence to live and work peacefully in our globalized world.

The School is aiming to improve the status of vocational education and started two new courses of tuition giving a double set of qualifications; the students obtain a Vocational Certificate and at the same time become qualified for higher education by combining theoretical studies and apprenticeships.  In these new courses, the school will contribute to the possibilities for international school- and labor experience. The school management believes that this will raise the international dimensioon of vocational education and make it more attractive to be a student at Lier USS.  Simultaneously, the school has strengthened its cooperation with local businesses and industries in order to educate good workers with formal skills. In the autumn of 2013 we therefore embarked on a major information campaign directed systematically at the local public, commercial and industrial sectors, at Buskerud county department of education, and at the lower secondary schools from which we recruit our students. In addition, we are using public - and social media and our website actively to spread information about the meaning of our courses with international  labor experiences and the future opportunities it provides.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of the project is to raise the international dimension of vocational education and make it more attractive to young people. When they have finished their education, they will become attractive to the employees. Lier USS strives to maintain a good reputation, both in the community and, more generally, by working systematically to achieve positive results. Given that we live in a multicultural society and a globalized labor market, we believe it is important for students to get more knowledge and understanding of the fact that they are part of a larger community. We are therefore planning for  labor placement aand school for our students in Great Britain. A stay abroad with practical labor experience, school and experience from family and community life, will give our students new perspectives on other cultures and contribute to their personal development.\r\nThe Project Group consists of eight people: Assistant Principal, one Head of Department, four teachers and two students.. All the staff have higher education and years of practical work experience. All members of the Project Group have good interpersonal skills and ability to work systematically and consciously to secure a high quality outcome for students. 35 students will participate in the program. To ensure student involvement and influence a prefect from each class participate in the Project Group with effect from the autumn 2016.\r\n\r\nLier USS has produced a preliminary plan including the project's main milestones.  \r\n\r\nThe evaluation of the project is important knowledge to take back to the students and parents to prepare them for what to expect. In order to be selected for international labor placement, and to have an influence on the appropriate type of work they can get, the students have to write and submit an application with CV.  In addition, they will be called for an interview. Our partners abroad will also require a copy of the CVs from the students in order to customize the stay in the best possible way.\r\n\r\nOur school has developed a strategy of communication for \"Vocational Education with International  Work Experience\".  We expect that the project will be of great importance both for students and for Lier USS. Students will feel appreciated; they will experience success and be proud of what they have experienced. It will give them a personal growth and be important for their general education.\r\n\r\nThe school is planning to introduce international labor experience for other programs of education and we would like to see that people will consider vocational education with new eyes, and become more attractive to young people.

However, the Restaurant Management and Food Programme has during a longer period been stigmatized principally because of political decisions which have resulted in a receding student base.

The participants are senior students of Care, Sales and Representation, \r\nHealth and well being Sciences as well as Physical Education and Sports. They deliberately opt for an internship abroad. The internship is a regular and mandatory part of the training. Each BSO student trainee has already had one or more internships in their own country / region, so they are already experienced. 50% of the BSO students have a socially disadvantaged background. They don\u2019t have / get the opportunities and resources to get an international experience at home.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\nThe students do their internship in various institutions in X. This way, students can experience that \u2018care\u2019 in another country / culture does not immediately receive the same interpretation as they are used to from their previous work experience in their own country. They learn to look critically at the way in which services are provided in their own environment and compare it to this foreign experience.  In their spare time the pupils learn how to deal with other cultures and they discover new surroundings.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nStudents gain new knowledge and skills through work in a context that is not available in Belgium. The pupils learn to deal with different lifestyles, values and standards and the ability to work and learn in an unfamiliar environment with unknown habits is strongly developed. This allows them to develop their personal skills. In their spare time, they learn to deal with different values and cultures. Through this, they informally learn to become more independent, self-confident and discover their limits.\r\n\r\nDissemination\r\nStudents and teachers share their experiences with fellow students and new trainees by giving presentations on their experiences abroad.

The project aims also are: to increase the competitiveness of our school students in the labor market, as well as to improve their professional competence and combine it with the use of English as the necessary condition to ensure the prospective job placement. The goal of the project is the strengthening of professional and language skills, abilities and the experience of pupils studying Business academy and Information technologies. Further, also important goal of the project is to contribute to the personal development of participants.\r\nThere are 40 participating students from OA Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e \u2013 out of which 20 go to Great Britain and 20 go to Ireland. The students studying field of Business academy and Information technologies have for an internship abroad following assumptions: they communicate in English at quite good level, use office software (MS Office), understand various enterprise information systems, manage to control network, create web sites and web design and are able to manage the functions of e-shop; control business economy as a complex (marketing, management, logistics, human resources, financial management, statistics) and accounting (double-entry accounting, software applications focused on accounting).\r\nThe students studying the field of Business academy and Information technologies will complete a three-week long internship in British and Irish companies, organizations and institutions. The content of the internships will - drawn up on the basis of CV and covering letter \u2013 be adapted to the individual abilites and needs so as to have the greatest benefit for each participant. Already in pre-contract undertake the receiving organizations to find an adequate job for each participant. The receiving organizations also provide host family accommodation with half board, local transportation, and is also involved in monitoring internships. Sending organization OA Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e assumes responsibility for language, cultural and professional training of participants of the internship, for all the obligatory contractual documentation, for all administrative and project accounts and for ensuring flight transportation to every site placement, including travel insurance. After the communication with recipient organizations OA Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e further ensures the appropriate job placement for each participant of the internships. All partner organizations, moreover, agreed to implement certification and validation of results through ECVET and Europass Mobility.\r\nThe result and a long-term impact of this project is to increase skills for finding good permanent jobs after completion of  studies, as well as to replenish the knowledge and skills needed for further study of all participants.

The students will be taught how to handle a great diversity in origin, culture and religion and how to provide care accordingly.\r\nThis project is being organized by the school in order to achieve the following goals:\r\nAt student level\r\n1. To stimulate the students to acquire professional knowledge abroad, specifically related to their future profession.\r\n2. To offer the students the opportunity to gain practical experience in organizations similar to those in the Belgian program. On one hand they can learn the differences in vision and policy between the two countries, but on the other hand they are also immediately able to work in a Belgian work environment.\r\n3. To offer the students a broad and objective view at their future profession and to help them develop a more critical perspective on habits, vision and policy in healthcare through a holistic approach.\r\n4. To give the student a chance to refine and master all earlier acquired skills from previous internships.\r\n5. To give young adolescents an extra boost towards adulthood, maturity, independence, active citizenship and an open view on the world.\r\nAt the level of teachers and internship supervisors\r\n1.

Out of this group we will select 16 students who have the right motivation for a two-week foreign internship adventure in a company in London, under the guidance of the responsible tutors, and an English teacher, and in cooperation with an external partner, namely ADC College, who has the know-how, the network and the experience, which we do not have to organise this kind of project.\r\nDepending on the department followed in our school, the students will be set to work into the following sectors: Administration / Child Care / Health & Social Care / IT & Accountancy.\r\nMost of our students live in the outskirts of Bruges, and have a rural background. Part of them also come from families with a low standard of living, low income. Due to their home situation, their often rather mediocre school results, by the fact that, as technical and vocational students, they often feel inferior to their brothers, sisters, friends from a general school, they have low self-esteem, low motivation to study and a lack of confidence. Often they make no or a wrong study choice after their last secondary school year, and they end up on the labour market with fewer opportunities. Our students are generally not very internationally mobile, and have not been in contact with multiculturalism. When it comes to their skills in English, they think too much that they are not competent, they are afraid to use the English they have learned in school.\r\nThe departments involved in the project are technical and vocational, we dare to say that they don\u2019t get the respect they deserve, both with parents and young people. We are looking for ways to popularise those departments.\r\nAt school we are working on internationalisation through KA2 projects, we are convinced that there are opportunities and the will to bring a breath of fresh air in our internship story.\r\n\r\nWe think that an internship abroad can provide a solution to the concerns mentioned above. It will improve the skills in English among our students, and introduce them to a multicultural (working) environment. It will also provide our students a broader perspective on the European labour market. It will give them new work experiences and professional learning gains. They will study more and be more aware of their choices, they will also be more motivated and able to make better study choices. They will also have more job opportunities.\r\nOur students will also acquire social skills that we cannot always realise at our school or at local internship companies: self-confidence, self-esteem, stress resistance, willingness to cooperate (on an international level), openness to other cultures and unknown work environments, less fear of the unknown ...\r\nThe internship is also an essential part for the result of the integrated test of the students, and thus their final report of their last secondary schoolyear.\r\nThe internship project will also provide new professional and other skills to the teachers involved in the project, we think that it will result in an implementation and teaching of the subjects much more closer and related to the daily reality, so that \u2018being a student\u2019 in these fields of study will be more attractive. We also hope that the project will have a positive impact on the charisma of these subjects for parents and new students.\r\nThe internship will take place in companies / institutions in London, students stay with host families. The monitoring and evaluation is done on a regular basis by their own teachers, by a coach from the company itself, and by a personal coach from ADC College assigned to each student.\r\nThe internship means  a new form of internationalisation for our school, and we hope that this could be a first step that will be repeated in the future, to involve other colleagues into internationalisation so that the succession is assured, and to encourage more teachers to react positively to the large Erasmus + professionalisation courses.", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-BE02-KA102-034561_1"], ["5AD", "Animatie en Hospitality stage", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 49134.0, "The \u2018Animation and Hospitality Internship\u2019 programme, organised by the Department of Tourism and Recreation and Hospitality of Hotelschool Go!TA3 Hasselt, focuses on the realisation of a foreign internship for students of the Se-n-Se year (post secondary school) Tourism and Recreation and  final-year students Hospitality.  To prepare this internship as well as possible, we organise a number of domestic and foreign study tours, workshops and guest lectures and multilingual practice exercises. Both courses are finalised by a foreign work placement in which the students\u2019 acquired knowledge, skills and attitudes are to be applied.   \r\n\r\nThe internships for students of Tourism and Recreation are organised in collaboration with the international PALLADIUM HOTEL GROUP because of the well-developed contacts with the local management of this hotel chain and take place exclusively on the island of Ibiza.

Atheneum (general and vet-school) Merksem in an environment that has the typical characteristics of a contemporary European metropolitan context. In the first place we see an increasing number of children, growing up in what can be called not the ideal circumstances. Besides the augmentation of diversity raises a number of new challenges. \r\nThese changes compel society and schools to search for solutions in a proactive way. Let us keep in mind that there are also positive trends: students are becoming more outspoken and work easily with ICT as \u2018digital natives\u2019. Atheneum Merksem wants to use this modified context as an opportunity. After much thought a new vision, the MaX-method, originated in our school. A vision supported by all the stakeholders. In the name of the method is a humorous reference to our school mascot Max, but the name especially refers to something that is good: our school is 'the max'. Max symbolises:\r\n\r\nProviding contemporary effective education with a maximal competence increasing learning effect. In this way we would like to enlarge the general education levels of youngsters and raise their chances on the labour market. \r\nCreating equal chances for everybody. This with the necessary attention and care for every individual student should enhance social inclusion. Social inequality and diversity cannot be an obstruction for development opportunities of our youngsters.  \r\nUsing internationalisation as a lever to develop an open mind and encourage intercultural interests and relationships.\r\nImprove language development through frequent use of foreign languages. \r\nStimulate the implementation of ICT.\r\nOffer a better preparation for future choice of study and profession.\r\nIncreasing the self-reliance of the learners.\r\nContributing to the professionalisation of teachers.\r\n\r\nThese are the values that determine the concept of our school: at the end of secondary school deliver \u201cautonomous learners\u201d. Learners who can take charge of their own learning process in higher education and in their future working life take control and take matters into their own hands. We strongly believe in leverage of education. We don\u2019t want to resign ourselves to mechanisms that perpetuate or even boost social inequality. With our educational project we take the assignment to create the possibility for our students to climb the social ladder very seriously.\r\nIn this aspiration after stronger education, an international dimension cannot be omitted. The long-term goals of the European Union, as they were recorded in the Europe 2020 strategy, match perfectly with the previously mentioned values from our school project. The Erasmus+ programme can give a concrete completion to these goals. \r\nGO! Atheneum Merksem intentionally chooses to start with a small-scale project in KA 1 \u2013 individual learning mobility and to do this in cooperation with an experienced partner organisation (ADC College). Ten students from the sixth form of the study fields STS (Social Technical Sciences) and FWS (Family and Welfare Sciences) will be selected to participate in a foreign work placement in organisations that work in the sectors health and childcare during a period of ten days. The target group consists out of about 40 students, of which the majority accords with the risk group. As a theme for this project we have chosen \u201c Working with and for people in an international context\u201d. This theme fits perfectly in the vision of the cluster subject pedagogy/ nutrition/ care/ domestic economy, where the emphasis lies on the study of and the association with people as complete human beings. Observation activities and practical lessons on location (\u2018workplacelearning\u2019) are being warmly recommended by the schools inspectorate as a basis of an introduction to the different occupational fields of the social sector. At the same time a project of individual learning mobility gives a perfect completion to the removal of the compulsory work placements in STS and FWS and the introduction of EMPEes (Extra Muros for Practice related Education). \r\nNotwithstanding the fact that we have chosen to keep this project on a small-scale basis, we are opting for a durable and sustainable embedment of the project in the school. A team of educational specialists has been appointed to carry out this project. 'Team International' consists of a coordinator, two work placement coaches, a language coach and two ICT coaches. They will, during two consecutive years be responsible for the preparation, implementation and dissemination of the complete project. Not only the necessary guidance and coaching of the selected learners is being provided, but also considerable attention is being payed to the communication with all the stakeholders to enlarge the involvement of a \u201chome front\u201d which is as broad based as possible.

These studies are offered at vocational, technical and general level. \r\n\r\nNext to ICT-integration in subjects, powerful learning environments, activating working methods and school assignments focusing on developing competences, we highly value work placements. We want our pupils to gain as much realistic work experience as possible. In this respect, we also think international experience is very important. Therefore we would like to offer our pupils in their final year the opportunity to do their work placement abroad. During the last few years we had an exchange programme with Sweden (Vasteras) where some ten of our pupils could have their work training. \r\n\r\nDuring the next two schoolyears we would like to offer 20 of our final year pupils the opportunity to do a work placement in London. This work placement will take place in June during 3 weeks. The international work placement is the cherry on the cake of the educational career of these pupils. The work placement will consist of two parts. During the first week pupils will follow a course in business English at the ADC College and they will explore London. After that they will do a work placement of two weeks in a sector related to their studies. The ADC College is our intermediary. The College will provide for host families, will search for suitable business partners and it offers our pupils the English course. \r\n\r\nThe pupils participating in our project are pupils of the technical study Accountancy- Informatics, Trade, Information Technology, Tourism or Physical education and Sports. Since our school is located in the centre city Turnhout and not all of our pupils have the same capital strength, we would especially like to offer young people of less well-off families the opportunity to gain international experience. When it would come to a selection of pupils, motivation will be our priority but two spots are reserved for underpriviliged youngsters. \r\n\r\nWith this project we would like to accomplish various aims. First, we will give pupils the opportunity to further develop as individuals (gain more language capacities, develop social skills, extend networks, gain international experience, explore new cultures, etc.). Secondly, via this international project we would like to strengthen the quality care in our school. As third we would like to make the school work in an even more innovative way by implementing the knowledge gained in this project and in London. Last we would like to strengthen our image of an undertaking and up-to-date school and spread the European thought of openness and mutual bonding. \r\n\r\nWe will prepare our pupils thoroughly to this three-weekly internship. Starting at the beginning of the schoolyear where we will introduce our project to interested pupils and their parents. A selection of pupils will be made (if necessary) on basis of their motivational letter and application talk. Then a number of teachers will start working with the pupils in the project: we will organise a kick-off at the Hoge Rielen where we will explain the outset of the whole project, where pupils and teacher/coaches will get to know each other and where we will make a start in preparing the EuroPass documents. \r\n\r\nThroughout the schoolyear the project will be focused upon and will be put in the spotlight. Schoolboard, teachers, pupils, parents and other people interested in the project will be kept up-to-date of all steps throughout the project. This we will do by using the schoolplatform Smartschool, a monthly newsletter, the regional press and social media. During their stay in London pupils will brief their coaches and keep the homefront up-to-date via a blog they maintain every day. After the internship they (pupils and teachers/coaches) give feedback via the above mentioned media. In September of the following schoolyear, they will present the project to fellow (newly final year) pupils to get their enthusiasm for the project going. \r\n\r\nLast but not least we want to evaluate the project thoroughly. On the one hand we assess the participating pupils and coaches, on the other hand we evaluate the project itself so that we can adjust if necessary in the future. \r\nPupils will be evaluated using certain criteria which are mentioned in their work placement report. Included are of course the competences pupils should (further) develop throughout their internship. We will evaluate the pupils both on process as well as on product. The global project will be assessed by a number of parameters; whether or not the predetermined aims have been achieved, the process of the preparatory phase, the well-being of the pupils, the functioning of the intermediary of ADC College etc. \r\n\r\nWe are very much looking forward to the start-up of our project in September 2017!", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-BE02-KA102-034622_1"], ["5AD", "London, here we come!", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 28780.0, "\"London, here we come!\" is a unique opportunity for our students to gain professional experience in London. 2 weeks they will be living with their English host family and speaking English at home and at work.

The accent lies on practical work where students, together with their colleagues, learn how to give and provied the care takers the best care they need. In this education the students learn both how a child develops and the process of getting older.

They learn about first aid, healthy food and they learn their way into social legislation, health right and specific legislation for the care department. During several internships the students get to know their future worksituation and they get in touch with the work as a caretaker in a kindergarden, aslo as a caremother, aslo as a childcarer in a nursery school and with the elderly people in a care- and living center. Nevertheless we notice that a lot of our students come form an underprivileged environment. They do not have a lot of confidence and have a narrow future vision. We, as a school, would love to see that changed. The most effective way to do so is to place our students in a whole other world and confront them with the reality.

The students will expand their horizon and they will realize that their is so much more in life. Obviously the job aimed competences will be offered to the students during their internship and for them this will increase their working method, legislation, organization and their contact with the caretaker to compare between the two different countries.

We think that the timing of the project  increases participants' motivation to benefit as much as they can from it, because their personal investment is significant.\r\n\r\nProject goals:\r\n>sharpen language skills\r\n>put theory into practice\r\n>boost participants' self confidence, independence and tolerance towards different cultures and life styles\r\n>understand different business practices\r\n>try out job mobility in the EU thus motivating participants to consider applying for a job abroad in the future\r\n>increase participants' job and career chances through the acquisition of the Europass mobility document\r\n\r\nNumber of participants: 20 + 1 group leader\r\n\r\nOur candidate participants:\r\n-will be completing their final school year at the time of the project\r\n-have language skills corresponding to language level B1+/B2 or higher\r\n-are reliable and show professional behaviour\r\n-are mature and socially capable of handling the challenges of the project\r\n-have solid grades\r\n-appreciate the special opportunity afforded by this project and are highly motivated to earn the right to participate\r\n\r\nMain activities:\r\nAccommodation with host families will be organised, allowing participants to get to know the British way of life. \r\nParticipants will work in the field Business Administration at an assigned local company from Monday to Friday for two weeks with six to eight-hour work days, they will be mentored by ADC college (on day 3) and monitored by the group leader throughout the duration of the project. Sightseeing and cultural activities at the weekend will be organised by the group leader.\r\nAt the end of the project, participants submit a formal evaluation of their work experience, are themselves evaluated by their workplace mentors and receive a certificate of attainment. \r\nOnce at home, participants' Europass Mobility documents will be submitted, signed by the two project partners and finally awarded to all participants in a small ceremony.\r\n\r\nProject execution:\r\nBHAK Linz-Auhof will work in cooperation with ADC college in London-Harrow, which will be our partner for this work experience project. They have 20 years of experience in organising language weeks and work placements for many EU countries.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nDuring this two-week work placement project, we expect our students to improve their language skills, gain self-confidence and experience first-hand the EU job market. This experience is bound to help them excel at their school leaving exam and will ultimately increase their chances to be successful in the job market.\r\nWe expect our school, BHAK Linz-Auhof to be even more attractive to potential new students, to confirm our position and reputation as an internationally oriented institution and garner increased attention of local and regional companies interested in our graduates.", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA102-034893_1"], ["5AD", "Job-related Internship in London", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 24008.0, "The Handelsakademie and Handelsschule Feldkirch (Higher Level Secondary Commercial College) is located in the four country corner Switzerland, Germany, the Principality of Liechtenstein and Austria. Due to this fact as well as the demands of a globalised society and economy more and more effort is needed in commercial education to prepare our students for their future careers.\r\nOur project aims at different goals at various levels. As the first \u2018Handelsakademie\u2019 with an entrepreneurship certificate on an advanced level (\u00d6NORM) we put special emphasis on internships abroad as part of our school profile. Our ultimate aim is to support the education of independent, reflective and open-minded graduates. Therefore we would like to provide the opportunity to do part of the mandatory internship abroad. Offering internships abroad creates a competitive edge over other schools. Our students can gain additional competences and skills and hence improve their career opportunities. Certificates and other documentary proof of additional qualifications (such as the Europass mobility, certificates from the ADC College as well as references in the certificate for their diploma and A-level equivalent qualification) provide competitive advantages for future applications. \r\nBy supporting occupational mobility across borders, by increasing their self-confidence as well as the confidence in their abilities, by overcoming language barriers and finally by further developing their  practice-oriented knowledge and job-related skills students will be well-prepared for future studies, working life and life in general.\r\nFor summer 2017 ten students of the third and fourth form of the Handelsakademie have applied for the Erasmus+ programme, because they wish to do part of their mandatory internship abroad. They meet the following requirements: minimum age of 17 and at least B1 level of English. For summer 2018 we have 17 potential applicants.\r\nThe main purpose of the two week stay in London is a job-related internship. The students will be placed in host families.

Like many other schools across Europe, the HAK/HAS Amstetten has realized the fact that both the present and future job market presents the workforce with a diversi\ufb01ed qualification pro\ufb01le and forces successful employees to develop multiple competences both on a professional and personal level.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result, the school set the goal to offer its students work placements all over Europe to make sure they have ample opportunity to acquire professional and language skills necessary to compete in Europe\u2019s future job market. Unfortunately, many of our students do not have suf\ufb01cient \ufb01nancial resources to organize work placements in foreign countries themselves. Therefore, subsidies like the ones provided by the Erasmus project provide our students with the chance to not only gain experience in working abroad but also to further develop their skills.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this project is the development of professional competences in the areas of business administration and information technology among its participants and other students of the HAK/HAS Amstetten. Furthermore, it is important to make sure the participants increase their social and language skills while also improving their intercultural competence, helping each participant to improve their chances on Europe \u2019s job market. Reinforcing transnational cooperation among the partner institutions and organizations is also in the center of attention of this project.\r\n\r\nAs the main focus is on guaranteeing the professional development of the participants, choosing the right students was an important aspect of the initial stage of the project. Choosing students with sufficient professional and language skills to guarantee he performance necessary at an international company was regarded as an important aspect of the recruiting process. Without suf\ufb01cient skills to begin with, further development of the skills at the work placement cannot be guaranteed. Nevertheless, another goal was not to exclude any student from the chance to apply for a spot on the project \u2018. Finally, 15 students were chosen to participate in the actual work placements in both London and Madrid.\r\n\r\nThese 19 students attend a seminar in the HAK/HAS Amstetten, which is designed to prepare them for both the new living and working environments in London and Madrid. The partner organizations are highly involved in planning and organizing the seminar as well as other necessary tasks. Learning agreements between the participants and the partner companies guarantee a strong focus on developing professional skills in the areas of business administration and information technology throughout the project. As soon as the participants arrive in either London or Madrid, every student will have both double monitoring and also a personal tutor throughout the work placement period. At the end of the program a \ufb01nal report will be produced and a feedback session will guarantee sustainable development among all involved students and organizations.\r\n\r\nThe HAK/HAS Amstetten wants to make sure that this project has a sustainable impact on all participants, institutions and partner organizations as well as target groups of the project. The exchange of good-practice in European level among all participants and he promotion of the results within the school, close partner organizations and the media will make sure the project has a lasting impact on both the participants and all the involved institutions.

In the current project, we are bringing the experience that we have gained to our secondary school. The Czech Republic represents a small economy that cannot exist isolated from its neighbours. At present, not only doing business with international partners, but also participation in labour markets outside the Czech Republic is considered nothing unusual. Given the historical and geographic context, such participation most frequently takes place in the common European area. Indeed, this requires not only knowledge and skills and language competencies, but increasingly often also quick adaptability to foreign environment, openness in communication in the new environment, tolerance to other cultures, and willingness to cooperate within a diverse team. It is exactly this type of experience that the interns will gain. This will not only significantly increase their employability, but also help them in their professional and personal growth. The project consists of 3 mobilities; it is meant for 12 students of secondary school and 2 students of tertiary vocational school. The three-week London mobility is intended for 6 students of secondary school natural sciences study programmes (Lyceum of Natural Sciences, Veterinary Sciences and Ecology and Environment). The other two mobilities will take place in Portugal; the first one will last 4 weeks and is meant for 2 students of tertiary vocational school (the study program Food Technology and Biotechnology), the other one will last 3 weeks and is intended for 6 students of secondary school food processing technologies study programmes. The criteria for the selection of participants will be based on their study results, as well as their curricular and extra-curricular activities and overall behaviour, since they are supposed to represent their school and the Czech Republic abroad. Also, their social background will be taken in consideration.\r\nThe project is planned for 16 months. Already during its preparation, the students were made familiar with the form and criteria of selection, the content of the individual mobilities and the goals of the project. Prior to the commencement of each mobility, cultural and language preparation (in the extent of 12 lessons) will take place, as well as testing of language skills and introduction of the contents of ULOs. Upon conclusion of the internship, the ULO setting will be evaluated. The ULOs will be prepared for each intern and their contents will first be consulted with the hosting organization.\r\nAn accompanying person will take part in each mobility. The accompanying person will spend one week in London, where we have already been using a reliable intermediary organization. In the case of Portugal, the accompanying person will also spend one week with the students of tertiary vocational school, who are already adult, whereas the total of two accompanying persons will stay with the students of secondary school, each one for the period of one week.\r\nThe new experience with the application of the ECVET system and the ULO setting will prove a significant boon to the school, since we intend to gradually implement the system in the evaluation of vocational training in the local companies for all students. Preparation of the ULOs will prove valuable experience for our teachers and we will put their newly acquired competencies to use in the process of the subsequent application in local companies. We have already been discussing the utilization of the ULOs in the local setting not only with the organizations where our students do their vocational training, but also with representatives of businesses, who know the exact needs of their field and the individual qualifications as specified by the National System of Qualifications; therefore, they are best suited to evaluate the ULOs from the viewpoint of the real-life needs.\r\nAll this newly acquired experience will be reflected in the reaccreditation of the tertiary vocational school educational programmes, updating the secondary school educational programmes, and of course in the overall enrichment and improvement of instruction. The foreign partners will get to know the qualities of our students and the Czech vocational education and training as a whole.

However, employers require graduates who are prepared in both professional and personal terms to handle tasks and problems in the workplace. The subject Professional experience provides a link between the world of education and work. However, we have noticed that work experience is often only formal and does not bring expected results. Previously we implemented a project of foreign professional experience through mobility, entitled \u201cPraxis abroad improves the school quality\". The impact of the project among all of the parties involved, convinced us that it is indeed the correct way to increase the quality of professional practice and hence also of the professional formation and competencies of the students in order to prepare the graduates for both national and international labor market, and at the same time to increase the prestige of the school. We have therefore decided to continue the implementation of such projects with the new title \"My Mobility - Experience, Expertise, Quality.\"\r\nThe involvement of such students in international projects and their personal experience with working abroad can break stereotypes and broaden the horizons in the area of job diversity within their expertise and rid them of their fears and worries of mobility.\r\n\r\nThe practice will be held in 2 two-weekterms - September 2017 and September 2018 for students of the 4th year in London, Havirov, and Katowice. \u00a0 Students with special educational needs may also apply for the foreign experience of mobility, thereby improving their \u00a0chance to succeed in the labor market and gain an advantage over other candidates.The main objectives of the planned project are to improve vocational education with an emphasis on the compulsory subject of professional experience and other economic subjects in our school, to prepare students for the labor market, to ensure their readiness for lifelong education and thereby improve the indicator of unemployment of our school graduates.\u00a0\r\n\r\nStudents participating in foreign mobility aim to improve their hard and soft skills which are needed in the modern work environment, particularly: improving the ability to work independently, problem solving, enhancing presentation skills, developing verbal and language skills, and improving self-knowledge and self-reflection.The aim of the teaching staff is to gain direct experience with the foreign labor market and with the current requirements of graduates, to expand conceptual and organizational competencies and to improve the management skills of the project team.\r\n\r\nOther objectives of the project are to design and verify the ECVET methodology in the process of preparation, implementation, and evaluation of mobility, to ensure certification through the Europass system, to improve the organization of teaching and learning and integrate new knowledge into the \u0160kVP \u201cgraduate profile\u201d, to implementthe skills and practices acquired by teachersinto the following subjects: professional experience, accounting, business economics, administration and correspondence, English language, and the labor market.\r\n\r\nWe consider the implementation of professional practice in enterprises and organizations in London, Havirov, and Katowice to be the goals concerning students and teachers. Students will have the opportunity to communicate in the real businness environment in person and in written form with business partners and with employees of the company, they will also archive accounting documents, process payrolls, check and register the contracts, carry out business activities and small projects in the area of marketing, update databases, and more. The students will acquire completely new skills and knowledge within the field of modern office equipment and software use.\r\n\u00a0\r\nProject management will carry out project tasks according to the established plan. Based on feedback from participants, the management will constantly improve those areas in which a need of improvement will be identified. As a result of the project, a foreign professional experience will be implemented for 29 students who will receive the Europass Mobility and Certificates of intermediary organizations, modified school educational program and the introduction of new forms and methods in the learning process.

Pupils who have chosen marketing field in which they would specialize will have a chance to transfer the good practices, which they will experience in the country where advertising companies have been operating for ages, onto the domestic Polish marketplace where the novice promotional-campaign firms have just begun to develop and operate on a large scale.  \r\n   Despite the fact that our school is situated in Warsaw, a great number of students come from the poverty-stricken families, and so the apprenticeship will be the only opportunity for them to find themselves in the international environment in order to have contact with other cultures and with people from different backgrounds, having different concepts, visions and attitudes.  \r\n  The primary goal of our project is the improvement of professional, linguistic, social and interpersonal skills of our students who would undergo the internship in a British company by developing the cooperation with the professionals representing other cultures, languages and work ethics. In the contemporary world in order to become competitive on the market, a candidate, apart from being a professional in his trade, must have knowledge of a foreign language in the professional manner and become used to the cosmopolitan work environment.

Its approximately 200 students, some of whom are currently employed and some in need of work, are of various ages. The fact that they have decided to attend this type of vocational school clearly indicates that they understand the necessity to improve both their formal qualifications and their practical knowledge. They realize that limited qualifications in the present financial circumstances and with increasing competition can be an obstacle in their effort to secure a work position and only further training regardless of their age can provide an advantage.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the project\r\nFor the reasons mentioned above, the proposed mobility project under the title \u2018Entrepreneurship in a Digital Era\u2019 aims at acquainting the students with educational systems and work environments that reflect the latest technological developments both in industry and services using digital and automation systems. Close contact of the trainees with enterprises that use contemporary systems and facilities will provide an opportunity for their familiarization with today\u2019s professional demands. We correlate entrepreneurship in a digital era to an increase of employability and the financial growth of the individual.\r\n\r\nProfile of participants\r\nMore specifically, the trainees who are interested in participating in this mobility project belong to a wide range of ages from 17 to 55 years old. Only a small percentage of them have a full-time job or a job related to their studies. Most of them are unemployed or under-employed in jobs completely irrelevant to their chosen field of study. The majority are people with a low income. The fact that they have chosen to attend an evening school suggests their need to work for a living along with attending school. In general, their working experience is limited and their assertiveness to seek professions with a high level of social acceptance or economic gain is quite low. They wish to attend specialized courses in their selected field of study and approach innovative practices in order to improve their skills, which can be catalytic in starting or upgrading a profession.\r\n\r\nNumber of participants \u2013 description of activities \u2013 methodology\r\nWe intend to involve 48 students in the proposed mobility project. The number of participants will be obtained from four different fields of study. They will be escorted by 8 teachers each with the respective specialty. The project will be realized in four different flows, in three separate countries. These countries have been selected in relation to their expertise in the field of study of the trainees. The teachers who will participate, after considering their own experience, the current literature and extensive internet research, have concluded that the students should be placed as follows for practical training, technical visits and cultural activities:\r\n1st flow: 12 students from the field of Economics Administration will visit Spain, a country well-known for its tourist facilities. The participants will undertake a training placement in selected enterprises that offer high quality tourist services.\r\n2nd flow: 12 students from the field of Applied Arts will visit the centre of design and visual communication, United Kingdom. The participants will undertake a training placement in the advertising agencies\u2019 creative departments.\r\n3rd flow: 12 students from the field of Information Technology will visit Germany, the leader among European countries in businesses management systems. The participants will undertake a training placement in developing firms that implement advantageously the benefits of new technologies and digital transformations.\r\n4th flow: 12 students from the field of Electronic, Electrical and Automation Technician will visit Germany, a pioneer in digital technology and networks.

Hordaland is a region in growth, having reached half a million inhabitants it is now one of the fastest growing counties in Norway. \r\n\r\nRelevant skills and competences are becoming increasingly important, and the labour market and businesses call for more well-performing educational and training systems. In order to meet these needs, and ensure the competitiveness of the region, Hordaland will continually have to acquire new knowledge and methods. Hordaland should contribute in making its inhabitants become global citizens, with awareness and knowledge of Europe and the world. Global competences and intercultural understanding can contribute to further development of civil society.\r\n\r\nInternational cooperation is an integral part of HCC\u2019s strategy for regional development (International Strategy 2013-2016). As the challenges the region is faced with are not only valid for Hordaland, HCC sees international cooperation as a tool in finding possible solutions to challenges that are either common for many, or that are transregional/ transnational.\r\n\r\nHCC aims at using Erasmus+ VET Mobility 2017-19 as a strategic tool in developing the region. The programme will be an important contribution in meeting both the challenge of restructuring, as well as creating closer cooperation between education and training and the labour market. Further, the programme will be important in improving language and intercultural competences.\r\n\r\nHCC continuously aims at increasing participation among our partners. In this application, we have maintained approximately the same number of VET pupils as previous years, but have had an increase in participation among our Apprenticeship Training Offices/Establishments.  \r\n\r\nBy including participation in the Erasmus+ programme as a tool in the Competence Development Plan 2016-20 (CDP), we aim to strengthen professional skills and intercultural competences among VET teachers. Including job shadowing abroad into the CDP, contributes to the quality of the projects as well as long-term competence development. We also make an effort to include staff mobility to the mobilities for apprentices. Allowing mentors to take part in work placements together with their apprentice will not only improve the quality of training, but also increase the impact of the mobility. \r\n\r\nThis project emphasise developing cross-sectoral group mobilities. Sustainable development demands international cooperation across different sectors, governmental levels, and disciplines. Close links between businesses and education is of great importance in developing competences and networks, promoting innovation, adapting to the green shift, and securing that education reflects the needs in the market. Mobilising the inter-municipality councils of Hordaland has been a priority in this application, as they are central players when it comes to facilitating cooperation between municipalities, commerce and education. One example of a project involving these councils is the project exchanging best practice with the wool industry in Shetlands, coordinated by Region Nordhordland. The project involves several key local stakeholders within the wool industry, VET, and municipalities of the region.\r\n\r\nThe mobility projects in this application involve systematic work to ensure the quality of preparation and implementation. Quality management and preparation are important for the desired effects and impact of the projects, such as attitudes, shared responsibility, reflection, enhanced cultural awareness as well as more active and positive participation in a multicultural Norwegian and international society and work force. \r\n\r\nHCC is applying for 64 mobility projects, which count 192 pupils and 24 apprentices from 15 different upper secondary schools and 7 training offices, and 58 accompanying persons. HCC is also applying for 28 mobility projects, which count 201 staff from various businesses, municipalities, VET schools and other regional developers. The disciplines represented in this application includes health care/social work, restaurant/hotel, industrial technology, design/crafts, electricity/electronics, and Ict. In addition, the mobility projects will cover themes such as textile industry, welfare technology, innovation, renewable energy, adaptation of curricula/teaching methods and development of new workshops, and cooperation between VET and businesses.\r\n\r\nAs a school owner, HCC is responsible for the safety and wellbeing of the pupils participating in the mobility projects. The majority of the pupils are under the age of 18, and it is important that they be accompanied while traveling to and from their host countries. The accompanying persons will assist the pupils while traveling and make sure the pupils settle in at both their place of accommodation and the work place.", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NO01-KA116-034004_2"], ["5AD", "Mensen onderweg", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 143667.0, "DvM htb, secondary vocational school in Aalst - Beyond borders\r\nThis 2 years project is part of the educational project of our school DvM htb \"Across borders\".

We aim with the project to strengthen their independence and sense of self-confidence.   \r\nThe pupils of Sense ELV do an internship in renowned spas in Madeira. They perform tasks of beauticians in spas and learn to work within multidisciplinary teams.

They perform all tasks that one needs to perform in a hairdressing salon: reception, welcoming customers, realize hairstyles, stock management. Sales are an important part in hair salons, and this skill is also expected of our students. The salons are selected based on the competences (language and techniques)of the students.\r\nIn addition to the internship Sense ELV is working during 1 day together with the pupils of DRQP.  During this cooperation days we will make time to present ourselves and our country and how our school system works.

The participants will be chosen on the basis of determined criteria. Their practical training, provided by our school\u2019s partners, will be carried out in restaurants and hotels, accommodation facilities, travel agencies. The aims of the project are: to improve the student`s professional abilities with the great emphasis on international cuisine as well as on non-traditional food processing and service (fish and seafood, regional and season ingredients); to familiarize the students with new forms of work organization in a different working environment and to motivate them to the further education. The aim is also to extend participants\u00b4 skills significant for orientation on the labour market. The participants will be led and motivated to an active approach, flexibility, cooperation and they will cooperate with regular workforce in a foreign country. They will not only extend their practical and theoretical knowledge and innovative ways at meals preparing processes but also become familiar with the unique technological and organizational methods. The cooks and pastry cooks will gain detailed knowledge about modern trends in European gastronomy, the waiters/waitresses will face and try new trends at guest service and communication with customers. The students of the Travel and Tourism services field will receive the practical experience in tourism services organization in the world-famous cities and popular tourist places. \r\nThe working stay will motivate all participants to study foreign languages.
