The main objective of professional teacher training is aimed at providing foreign language teachers with a greater range of modern methods for their classroom work. In an increasingly international and multicultural Europe, the project - in addition to exploring new methodology - aims at extending the teachers' knowledge of cultures, since teaching a foreign language involves teaching  a target country's culture as well. The aims and objectives of professional teacher training are short-term, middle-term and long-term ones.\r\n\r\nShort-term objectives:\r\n- providing foreign language teachers with a greater range of the latest methods, techniques and tools that they can employ in the classroom,\r\n- exploring techniques and activities to inspire students and raise their motivation,\r\n- exchanging teaching experience with colleagues from other European countries,\r\n- establishing new partnerships in the wider European area,\r\n\r\nMiddle-term objectives:\r\n- employing new methods in the classroom when working with students of mixed abilities and different levels of motivation,\r\n- starting the implementation of the projects in the virtual environment eTwining,\r\n- planning with the partners and other collaborating teachers the implementation of the project that will be solving common problems.\r\n\r\nLong-term objectives:\r\n- internationalisation with longer mobilities within the program Gimnazija.\r\n\r\nThere are four foreign language teachers who will participate in the mobility project: a Spanish teacher, a German teacher and two English teachers (as English is our first foreign language with the largest number of learners). Although all of the participants have some international experience, they require permanent professional development to meet the demands of new generations in a fast changing world. In their everday practice they are faced with numerous challenges, such as teaching in mixed ability classes, dealing with different levels of motivation and a variety of the studets' needs. Having the opportunity to participate in mobility programmes and exchange teaching experience on an international level, the participants will develop professionally and personally, gaining new knowledge, tools and ideas for improved classroom work, as well as personal motivation and enthusiasm for teaching and motivating their students more effectively.\r\n\r\nBefore going on international mobility, the teachers will participate in preparations which will include their expectations, obligations and the objectives of the project. Preparations will also help them with practical and logistic matters. After finishing their mobility programmes, the participants will make presentations for other colleagues and transfer the gained  knowledge, improvements and novelties in teaching methodology to them, they will test  the novelties by employing them in their classroom practice, they will carry out the students' evaluation of the lessons and add their own evaluation of  their classroom experience in writing. In the whole process, new documents and forms will be made and published on the school website, being thus available to other linguists. The participants will be expected to share their new experiences as examples of good practice within their study groups.\r\nThe most important effects that are expected are, firstly, raising motivation of the teachers to cope with the numerous challenges of the time, brought by new generations of students, and secondly, transferring the gained knowledge about teaching methodology and target cultures to other colleagues. We also expect wider effects in terms of raising motivation of our students for language learning, establishing international partnerships and collaboration with colleagues from other European countries, either in virtual or real environments.", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2014-1-SI01-KA101-000111_1"], ["5AD", "Verbesserung der F\u00e4higkeiten zur p\u00e4dagogischen IKT-Nutzung im fremdsprachlichen Unterricht, F\u00f6rderung des CLIL und Internationalisierung", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 12510.0, "This two-year school education staff project aims at extending and improving our seven subject teachers' methodological knowledge by taking part in an in-service training course in England in order to develop their skills regarding pedagogical and didactic use of ICT during the lessons.

The training units are a one week course inhouse-training honing speaking skills in standard business situations at ADC and a two weeks job placement at London-based companies in the field of business & administration (service industry), which will be arranged by ADC according to previous assessment of the participants. Standard business situations will touch on specific matters such as customer advisory service, welcoming visitors or presenting one\u2019s company fluently. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the students will be trained to reduce their inhibitions to talk in a foreign language. They will be placed into a position where they have to reflect their way of talking and the effect of non-verbal communication on their counterparts.

The expected effects on informal learning on the part of the students will be assessed by answering an explorative questionnaire and participating in a group discussion at the end of the mobility stay. Skills and competencies aquired during the placement will furthermore be assessed and validated according to a modified ECVET-grid reflecting basic job requirements in business administration. The results will be committed to paper with the help of portfolios describing a range of graded competencies.\r\n\r\nThe focus of our project is London.

Several of the students who choose vocational educations are students who have problems related to learning and/or motivation. This situation challenges us to teach them in a way they can relate to and give them a sense of achievement. We also acknowledge the need for improved knowledge of international issues in the multicultural society our students are living in. The vocational students will both at school and in their working life be a part of a society which includes many different cultures and languages.  This variety is mirrored in the nurseries and schools as well as patients and in the health service institutions where our students will work in the future. Multicultural societies and work places demand higher levels of competence from our students, and  an international work experience will give our students the opportunities to develop a competence to face these challenges which have become an integral part of our society. The activities and method used to reach our goals is a work experience exchange. We have chosen ADC College in London as our partner for this project because they have an extensive professional network in London and can guarantee our students work experience of a high quality during the 3 weeks they are doing their work experience. Our students will have their work placement in institutions relevant for their vocational education. The responsible partner for arranging work placements and communicating with the different institutions during our stay will be ADC College, while our school will prepare the students for the exchange and follow them up while they are working. The curriculum for the vocational educations states that students should aim to gain internationally subject specific knowledge. While doing this work exchange in London we will achieve this, and by this also fulfil a part of the curriculum. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objectives we have chosen for our project are the following:\r\n\r\nA multicultural work experience with other standards and regulations than our domestic ones. Improve our language skills and prepare our students for a multicultural labour market back home in Norway. To learn how their future occupation is practised in another country and to observe how cultural similarities and differences influence how the work is practised. The students gain experience from a global labour market. This can broaden their experience and facilitate the possibility for studying or applying for jobs in the EEC in the future. To challenge themselves and develop personal traits and occupational competence as well as developing good skills in their vocational practise. Facilitate the possibilities for the students with special needs to improve their motivation, get to know themselves better and improve their self-image.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important objectives is to create motivation and interest for the different subjects involved in this project. A vocational exchange project like this will indicate that the school is seriously concentrating on this education. The number of students applying for these vocational programs is declining, and there is a major gap between the demand for workers and the number of students graduating. The lack of health care workers in Norway is a major problem for the society, by generating interest and showing that this vocational education is given high priority will we hopefully motivate more students to choose and complete this line of education. The work exchange shows the students the possibilities they have when it comes to doing part of their occupational training abroad, which can motivate some of the students who are tired of studying. Vocational students may have more motivational problems than other students and have a higher probability of dropout. We sincerely believe that generating motivation and interest for the subjects are vital to avoid this trend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results we would like to achieve by doing this international projects are:\r\n\r\nOur students should improve their use of subject-related English in their line of work. Improve their knowledge of the British health care system. Reflect upon the differences between the Norwegian and the British welfare system. Gain insight in how a large health care institution is developed and run in a major city like London. Improve their ability to get around in a major city. To relate to people from other cultures both professionally and socially. Gain interdisciplinary experience by doing practical work in the institutions, for example through the topics of food, hygiene, communication, social and cultural aspects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long term advantages for our students, our staff and school as an organisation are: The school gains competence in vocational international exchanges.

The project will be implemented over a period of 24 months: two rounds of the 12 months each. The mobility project will involve a total of 72 students:  two groups in each round of the project: an electro-electronics group of 18 people will take professional training in Leipzig and an informatics group of 18 people will take professional training in London. In addition, 2 guardians- teachers for each group will look after students at the place of practice.\r\n\r\nThe major aim of the project is to enhance the attractiveness and raise the educational offer of the school as well as to facilitate mobility of young people, to raise their professional skills, language skills and their personal development. Foreign apprenticeships not only give the opportunity for beneficiaries to deepen their knowledge of specialized German and English language but also to learn about the realities of the German and British labor market, as well as to get to know the cultural heritage of Germany and the UK. Due to the fact that the practice will be held outside the country, students will also learn vocabulary and the realities of everyday life in these countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn recruitment process will be included third- grade students at ZSE in Kielce from following profiles: informatics technician, electrical technician and electronics technician. Majority of ZSE students live in the country, in the areas of high unemployment, some of them come from low income families. They have low awareness about the requirements  of labor market  what results in ignoring the need of education and finally contributes to long-term unemployment. In the third year of study, students are required to undergo a 4 -week professional practice in the field of: electricity, electronics and IT in factories and companies. Every year ZSE sends students to apprenticeships in local companies, however, having in mind expansion and modernization of  the content of our school programmes ZSE wants to organize  apprenticeships in Germany and the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll beneficiaries who will be sent abroad will undergo professional language course as well as pedagogical and cultural training. During the apprenticeships they will have practice according to previously agreed between ZSE and foreign partners schedule. The students will be monitored by representatives of partner's institution and by  guardians -teachers of language and vocational practice from their own school. There is also planned a monitoring visit of ZSE school director in the abroad places of practice. \r\n\r\nThe apprenticeships will be recognized in Poland as a compulsory professional practice for technical high school students on the basis of daily raports in Diary of Practice. Students will gain professional experience confirmed by  by the Europass Mobility and Certificates of Participation in the project. Participation in the project will motivate students to learn more because they will have to meet the requirements of the Rules of Procedure of Recruitment.  Work experience abroad will increase their competitiveness on the labor market in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, ZSE teachers of vocational subjects of IT, electronics and electricity, English and German language by participating along with their students in the project will  gain additional knowledge and skills to put these solutions into school practice in subsequent years. An indicator of the results of the project will be the results of the final practice exam, and reports of the beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing each round of the project ZSE will implement the dissemination activities to promote mobility of students of the school, such as: exhibition, presentation of the results to the Council of Education, the local media and the Educational Fair in Kielce. By introducing a foreign school apprenticeship ZSE would like to differentiate our offer training, presenting itself as a modern school open to the world.

The School is aiming to improve the status of vocational education and is starting two new courses of tuition giving a double set of qualifications.  The students obtain a Vocational Certificate and at the same time become qualified for higher education by combining theoretical studies and apprenticeships.  The school management believes that this will improve the status of vocational education and make it more attractive to be a student at Lier USS.  Simultaneously, the school has strengthened its cooperation with local businesses and industries in order to educate good workers with formal skills. In the autumn of 2013 we therefore embarked on a major information campaign directed systematically at the local public, commercial and industrial sectors, at Buskerud county department of education, and at the lower secondary schools from which we recruit our students. In addition, we have used public - and social media and our website actively to spread information about the meaning of dual competence and the future opportunities it provides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main objective of the project is to improve the status of vocational education and make it more attractive to young people. Lier USS strives to maintain a good reputation, both in the community and, more generally, by working  systematically to achieve positive results. Given that we live in a multicultural society and a globalized labour market, we believe it is important for students to get more knowledge and understanding of the fact that they are part of a larger community. ADC College is our partner in London. Together we are planning for work placement for our students. A stay in London with practical work experience and experience from family and community life will give them new perspectives on other cultures and contribute to their personal development.\r\n\r\nThe Project Group consists of six people; Assistant Principal, Head of Department, and four teachers. All have higher education and years of practical work experience. The teachers selected for the project have high professional competence in their subjects, and have achieved good results with students they have taught. All six members of the Project Group have good interpersonal skills and ability to work systematically and consciously to secure a high quality outcome for students. A total of 30 students will participate in the program every year, and we apply for support for a two year period.  To ensure student involvement and influence a prefect from each class participate in the Project Group with effect from the autumn 2014.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLier USS has produced a preliminary plan including the project's main milestones. Representatives from the Project Group will during the first year, which is a preparatory year,  go to London to become better acquainted with ADC, and further develope the relationship with them. Through this pilot project we will obtain in-depth knowledge of both relevant internships, suitable families and the guidance our students will get during their stay abroad. This is important knowledge to take back to the students and parents to prepare them for what to expect. In order to be selected for work placement in London, and to have an influence on the appropriate type of work they can get, the students have to write and submit an application with CV.  In addition, they will be called for an interview. ADC will also require a copy of the CVs from the students in order to customize the stay in the best possible way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA strategy of communication will be developed for \"Double Competency with International Work Experience\". The information will be made available before, during and after the project and will enhance the positive reputation of our school. We expect that the project will be of great importance both for students and for Lier USS. Students will feel appreciated, they will experience success and be proud of what they have experienced . It will give them a personal growth and be important for their general education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe School is planning to introduce dual course tuition for other programs of education.

The school is planning to involve 15 participants - students of the 4th grade of billingual branch of study (Slovak - English ) and 2 qualified and well experienced teachers of the English language and special economic subjects taught in English language.  As a partner organisation, we have chosen the ADC College on the basis of its long - time experience in mobility of youth. This agency will provide complex services for our students including accomodation, placing in workstations in companies in Londnon a well as mentoring during whole duration of the intership. Group leaders - teachers will have the opportunity to control their students actively, to communicate with their leaders on work places and to provide needed help. After the completing intership we expect really positive impacts on several aspects:\r\n- our students will improve their proficiency and especially they will learn to use theri acquired knowledge effectively in real entrepreneurial environment\r\n- our school can remain in active cooperation with international institutions in Europe and improve its own profile\r\n- both our school and students will acquire useful information and review of actual requirements of European labour market", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2014-1-SK01-KA102-000261_1"], ["5AD", "Improve your chance at European job market", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 26978.0, "The project \"Improve your chance at European job market\" is created in partnership of Obchodna akademia in \u017dilina with ADC College in London and is focused mainly on obtaining practical working skills of our students abroad and using their English language skills in practice.

Many students grew up in rural areas and in a rather uneducated environment. They are still very young- mainly underage. Therefore, they have barley any experience with mobility projects. All students are already in their second year of their initial training programme, which means that they already have some good knowledge of the particular everyday-working-life. Due to the fact that most of the students just hold a successful certificate of secondary education (CSE) they have limited (native and foreign) language skills, which need to be improved. Additionally, most of our students haven\u2019t had any experience with migrants so far. Their experiences refer to asylum seekers and gastarbeiter and they are rather based on prejudices. However, it is getting even more important in their kind of jobs, to get insights into working structures of other countries and to develop intercultural and personal skills through the exposure to strange cultures. \r\n\r\nAs a result, basic project targets must be:\r\n\r\n- Application of the English language in daily life and to reduce fears of contacts with foreign languages and cultures\r\n\r\n- To gain professional skills by learning about new educational focuses in the partner country and through exploring the differences and similarities in the education.  \r\n\r\n- Establishment of personal skills, like self-confidence and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of participants is limited to 20 students per flow, since most of them are underage, which leads to a higher need of care and support. Additionally, financial costs are playing a big part, because many of our student\u2019s families live in limited monetary boundaries, who can barely accomplish any additional cost.  \r\n\r\nTo develop a feeling for the language and to learn how to act self-respondent in an urban area, it is absolutely necessary to have a one-week language course before the placement takes place. The placement in the different professional areas lasts two weeks and gives first insights in the working-structures of the host country. The dealing with the different culture of the host country will be supported by the accompanying teachers in the afternoons of the first week and at the weekends, additional to their lives in the host families and at work of social facilities. \r\n\r\nThe organisation of the mobility, like insurance, transportation to the airport, flight booking and flight, transportation in greater London will be done by the sending organisation. They will also help to organise special needs like visa applications.  The partner organisation is responsible for the organisation of the host families, the placement companies and the first information for the participants. During the whole mobility, the participants will be accompanied by both organisations. Placement visits  as well as personal and intercultural care and support will be done by the accompanying persons. Regular meetings at the partner organisation will be done to monitor, evaluate and ensure the learning progresses. \r\n\r\nThere are many expected effects:\r\n\r\nA strong personal effect on the participant\u2019s self-confidence can be expected. The certainty to have been able to orientate in a metropolis supports the self-confidence as well as the experience to handle a new and strange situation. In the future, the willingness will be enforced to face and go through new and uncertain, anxiety-ridden situations. \r\n\r\nEffects on the language can be already expected during the first week of the stay, when the participants realize, that they are always able to find ways to express themselves \u2013 the main thing is that they dare to use the language. Language skills in vocabulary, through frequent speaking, as well as active and passive understanding will be improved, because the contact to migrants and British dialects require concentrated listening. \r\n\r\nIn London-Harrow, in their families and working facilities, the participants will have contact to British people with different cultural background, which can be from Rumania, Jamaica or India. In that way they will be forced to deal with different cultures on a personal and culinary level and as well as the differences in values and conventions. This leads to a questioning of own prejudices and to a curiosity of foreign cultures.\r\n\r\nTo compare the professional facilities, the concepts and the working structure of the host country to the working situation at home and the questioning of familiar habits, lead to the ability to recognize connections and  dependencies in values of different cultural backgrounds.

To attain this need, I am going to give presentations to the staff of my school about new ways of teaching that I will learn about from talking to and exchanging ideas with the teachers I am going to meet in the programme in ADC college. After the presentations, I will organise all teachers involved in the project to open the doors of their classrooms to other teachers, headship and people from the Ministry of Education (e.g. inspector)in order to spread new teaching methods all over our country and be role models of effective teaching-learning practices, practices that promote the joy of learning, practices that create a warm learning classroom climate. \r\n\r\n2.

Students shall get a deepened insight into the different standards of bookkeeping, accounting, documentation and general management of business. Particularly important is the combination of commercial subjects with the English language as well as a deepened insight by working in an English working environment with its daily routines.\r\n\r\nFurthermore participants get to know the requirements of a foreign labour market, compare them with the German labour market and become aware of cultural differences. At the same time they strengthen their flexibility and their self-consciousness.    \r\n\r\nThe participants are apprentices within the dual system and work mostly in the fields of media, industry, trade and office. These apprenticeships are increasingly internationally orientated. There will be two flows of students, each with15 participants, mainly in the second year of their apprenticeship. \r\n\r\nParticipants will take part in a one-week language course where they are also informed about specifics of their host country. After that they will be on a two-week work experience in pre-selected companies. \r\n\r\nDuring the first week participants will take part in lessons. During the following two weeks there will be a short briefing and job shadowing before participants will be increasingly integrated into the work flow. \r\n\r\nAfter the project participants will have upgraded as well as widened their professional competences. They are familiar with an English speaking environment in professional as well as everyday situations. A higher degree of internationalisation and a higher percentage of workforce with a migration background, due to the Commonwealth, has improved their crosscultural competence. Motivated by their personal experience they critically analyze the differences between the German and the English way of life in professional and everyday contexts. Their independence as well as their flexibility have grown and they are motivated to reflect their own need for further qualifications.\r\nParticipating in the project will raise their chances on the labour market considerably.", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-001714_1"], ["5AD", "Live and Learn in London (Lernende) and Malta (Bildungspersonal)", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 15984.0, "Mobilit\u00e4t der Lernenden: \r\nThe project \"Live and Learn in London\" is targeted at students enrolled in initial vocational training (IVT).

During the project the participants will be sent to London in early spring 2016 to take part in a three-week mobility programme. The programme consists of a combined language and content course at the ADC College during the first week followed by a two-week work placement with local companies and organisations in the Greater London area. \r\nThe project aims at improving the students' foreign language skills and developing their professional skills by exposing them to a wide range of communicative situations in everyday life and business. During their work placement the students will be given the opportunity to gain first-hand experience of company life and culture in Britain and compare this with the conditions at home in Germany. This will help to enhance the students' intercultural competence and foster their cross-cultural communication skills which may also contribute to an increased willingness to accept mobility in their future professional and private lives.

In recent years the relationship between Great Britain and the EU has been subjected to constant tensions, which could peak in a considered referendum deciding on Great Britain\u2019s further membership in the EU. The mentioned better understanding is supposed to accomplish an increased appreciation of this political link for all parties involved in the project. Our group consists of twelve students, aged between 18 and 22, all of whom acquire a profession in business administration and whose English knowledge corresponds to level B1/ B2 and of two members of the vocational training personnel. Through the cooperation with the ADC college, our partner for this project, it is guaranteed that the learners get a traineeship fitting to their training occupation, a high quality language course taught by a native speaker and an ideal on-site mentoring .\r\n\r\nStudents: During the first phase (the first week) of their stay in London the students visit a language course and they also continue working on the project together with the vocational training personnel. Especially the communicative abilities, which are extremely important not only for the subsequent traineeships but also for their training occupation, are trained because of the teamwork together with the other project participants. The German-British Chamber of Industry & Commerce and an international company are visited in the context of the project, this gives the group an insight into the entrepreneurial cross-linking between EU trading partners. After this the students have a two-week traineeship in the business administration sector during which they gain work experience. Among other things they research how the company is linked with economic operators in other EU countries. They test their theoretical  knowledge which they gained during the project preparation and the first phase of the stay abroad for its practical in-company implementation. They analyse to which extend the companies profit from these economic relations. During their stay abroad the students apply their business administration knowledge which they acquired in class and in their training occupation. Due to the constant application they deepen and aggrandize this knowledge. Because of the language course and the traineeship in the company the professional and the language expertise are fostered realistically. Moreover working in London does not only serve the personality development but is also broadens the young people\u2019s horizons because the students are integrated in the life and work in another country. Due to this experience they will develop more acceptance and tolerance towards the other culture. Also the getting to know of other operation methods is an important method to develop an understanding for the other culture. \r\n\r\nVocational training personnel: The vocational training personnel, who teaches English, complies with two tasks on-site during the first phase: firstly they accompany the students and guide as well as support them  with the project work, secondly they compile the conception of the teaching unit \u201cWorking and living in today\u2019s London\u201d which is supposed to be a eight to ten lesson unit for all school types represented in our school.

In this stage of the project not only participant choice and preparation will be carried out but the partners will also sign the project contract setting their obligations within the project.\r\nThe two-week stay will take place in the spring of 2016 in carefully chosen shops and companies in London. The students will be placed according to their language knowledge either in retail or in administration. The accompanying person will monitor the participants during the stay and help them to solve all possible problems. \r\nThe content of the stays is focused on gaining and improving vocational skills and knowledge that the students learn during their studies, these are for example: processing documents \u2013 filling, creating, checking, and processing post, administrative work with computer; working with goods, communication with customers. Improving the language competence of the participants in real life situations and in business matters is also a very important part of the project and will motivate the students to further studies. The stays will help the students to verify and widen the knowledge concerning socio-cultural situation they got during their school studies and in preparatory courses. This can help the students with their Maturita exam, with their own mobility and with their future job.\r\nAfter finishing the stays the school will organise a school conference for its students and public. The participants will present their experience gained during the stays. Other outcomes are also essays, a mini \u2013 dictionary, newspaper and web page articles. This conference and other project dissemination will lead to motivating students other of the school to further language studies, their own mobilities and taking part in similar projects.\r\nThe greatest benefit of the project is testing the participant\u00b4s ability to succeed in completing administrative tasks and retail issues in English with English speaking co-workers and customers. This will contribute the most to their personal and professional growth and will increase their chances to succeed in their future job. This is of great importance especially for the Business Academy students because their main possible employers are German, Dutch and American companies with branches in \u010cesk\u00e1 L\u00edpa and the ability to communicate in English and to work with English written documents is essential.\r\nADC College and Business Academy will also create Europass mobility for all the participants and they will also obtain a special certificate issued by the ADC College. Both partners will sign Memorandum of Understanding and Quality commitment and with the participant also Learning agreements, they will also cooperate in creating Units of Learning.

The content of the project is participation of two groups (10 students and one accompanying teacher) on internship in companies focused on information technologies in London. The reason for creating this project is the effort of our school to constantly develop the quality of preparation of our students, to use the newest technological devices, which appear everyday in this branch and to verify the quality of education in a foreign competition, to support the success rate of our students on the labour market both in our country and abroad. The goals that we have set, will support the acquisition of practical technical and language skills of students and also will develop the soft skills of students through mobilities, which will be implemented in companies abroad.\r\n\r\nThe participants of mobilities will be always the students of the third year of study programme Information Technologies. These are the students who prepare themselves to achieve the level 4 EQF. The students will be chosen according to their vocational and language competences and according to their study results. The choice will be demanding because only one sixth of students could take part due to capacity reasons. The group will be always formed by 10 students and one accompanying teacher, because the students will be only 17-18 years old. The content of internship will be development of professional knowledge and skills of students in modern web technologies, especially in the field of responsive design of web applications, in specific conditions of appropriately chosen companies, which have technical opportunities of hardware and software. The students will familiarize with technical and user documentation of web pages, especially with the English version. Besides the acquisition of professional competences and skills in the field of web technologies we will also evaluate the level of soft skills of students, their ability to use specific skills, such as communication and presentation skills, teamwork, conflict resolution, self-confidence, tolerance, recognition of moral and ethical values, creativity, flexibility and initiative and workability.For the field of soft skills we will, already for the first internship of students, create a pilot unit of educational outputs according to the principles of ECVET. The experienced company workers together with mentors of our project partner will evaluate the level of soft skills development of the mobility participants. The experience and results obtained in the first year of the project will be used for shaping the content of student mobilities in the second year, when we plan to set the unit of educational result ECVET for the professional part of the project.   \r\n\r\nWhereas the field of informational technologies is undergoing rapid and continuous development and also the demands of employers for the work experience of graduates are continously increasing, the school uses all the possibilities to increase the professional level of education, so that its graduates succeed in the labour market in European extent or in their following studies at university. That is the reason, why the project verifies the knowledge which has been gained during the studies on different devices and in other environment, especially in the practice with the modern methods and professional technologies that are used in other countries. The students experience their skill of adaptability, gain other knowledge and motivation for their further professional growth. At the same time the foreign internship of students is for the labour market an evidence of their independence and their language skills. Language competences gained within the mobilities will persuade students not only of the necessity of practical usage of foreign language in everyday communication, recognition of realities of the country and acquisition of the necessary confidence, but also about the fact that English is also the professional language in the field of information technologies. The expected impact of the project will be principally in acquisition of specific knowledge, skills and competencies leading to improvement of the competitiveness of students in the local, national and European labour market. It will also improve communication skills, increase interest in technology and language learning, then increase independence and improve the presentation skills. Getting the Europass will be further motivation for acquisition of other practical experience. SP\u0160 Prosek will get other experience how to increase the level of education in each study programme, including the improvement of material conditions.

Special focus will be devoted to security and what obligations the students have as representatives for their country and school.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this application:\r\nWe want to recruit more students into subjects that in recent years has struggled with the number of pupils in school and not least in the profession later. We see internationalization as a motivating factor in an otherwise demanding school day. The goal is to challenge students on the professional level and personal sides of themselves. To travel together, experience together, try themselves in a new situation, be challenged on language and academic activities,  will hopefully give students an experience they can use in a vocational career later in life aswell as in school. More impressions and more knowledge provides greater opportunity for reflection.\r\nThe students normally get to know the Norwegian health care and educationsystem through internships locally in Norway. Maybe the picture becomes a bit oversimplified when there is nothing to compare with. We hope to give the student an insight into another country's health and educationsystem and employment. The cultural differences will be topics the students will be working with before, during and through the evaluationprocess afterwards.\r\nStudents will during the period stay with host families and this is a different and challenging situation in itself. How we behave in someone else's home, what they eat, what rules they have and why and how to communicate. This will put students to the test, and put their own lives in Norway in perspective.\r\nStudents will be placed in schools, kindergartens and health institutions (possibly Restaurant / hotel).

This project should not only be a chance for personal development, but it should also contribute to the students\u00b4 motivation for further education. We want to show to our students that the economy in the 21st century requires professionals who are able to enter the contemporary dynamic labour market and work there. Having an awareness of international cooperation and  entrepreneurial spirit are necessary nowadays in our global economy. The companies in this branch are based on the principle of globalization and our graduates have to face a lot of different tasks in practice, which go beyond the frame of ordinary education. If the Czech economy wants to compete with other countries within Europe, we must focus on innovation and specialization. \r\nAnother objective of this project is to increase the students\u2018 interest in studies. We believe that they will be motivated by further professional engangement and language education. This motivation can be followed by the students\u00b4 interest in their own enterprise. We believe that they will stay in an economic branch after finishing their studies at our school, or they will even try to start their own company and they will have the chance to develop their skills in their professional life. This is very important for the Czech Republic, because small and medium enterprises are an essential part of the entrepreneurial sector.  Their growth and development will help increase the economic productivity and employment in the society.  They will be able to contribute to create a healthy entrepreneurial environment, as well as decrease uneployment.      \r\nThe project includes 15 students, who are educated in the field of study called Economy and Enterprise.All of the students are aware of the fact that experiences gained abroad will be very important for their professional life and help to facilitate finding a job in the future.  All of the students work very hard to improve their language and communication skills. Studying abroad will only help to strengthen their language skills.  In addition, the students will have the opportunity to learn about the culture of a foreign country  and realise what the Czech Republic and the UK have in common as well as what is different. The sudents will  learn to be tolerant and respect cultural diversities, and they will also consider themselves European citizens.\r\nOur school is focused on economics. Most of the activities involved in the project are in the field of business administration. Students will work in the companies with tasks that involve dealing with post,  answering the telephone and passing on calls, , typing and setting up documents such as letters and reports, keeping computer records up to date, filing, using office equipment, and managing appointments. Other skills used include organization, time management skills, communication skills, the ability to work well as part of a team, and improvement of professional language, increase of self esteem and self empowerment,to respond to new stimuli quickly and behave actively and inventively in different situations.\r\nThe realisation of the project will  produce the following outcomes at our school. Students will have the opportunity to begin long-term relationships with foreign partners and learn how to demonstrate international cooperation in the field of education and entrepreneurship which is necessary in today\u2019s global economy. We believe that the work placement will not only bring innovation and improvement in education programmes, but also in methods in education with respect to students\u00b4 needs and skills required by the labour market and our competitive, global economy. The project will be a great challenge for us and how we can improve the process of recognition of competences necessary to  perform a certain job and how to verify, if the competences and learning outcomes were reached. We are ready to integrate new methods and good practices into daily activities in education and vocational training. The experience gained through the project will build a more modern, dynamic and professional environment inside our school.\r\n After the end of the work experience we intend to organize a presentation, which will summarize and assess the progress of the work experience. Participants will inform us which experience and skills the they have gained and if goals of the work experience have been achieved. The involvement in the project will increase motivation for further education of the participants and especially of other students at our school.

The aim is increased mobility among teachers and among students and apprentices. Increased internationalization will contribute to develop the school and provide better learning outcomes and better implementation. The school may be more attractive to students, and it strengthens the school's reputation. Increased opportunities for international mobility will strengthen the vocational repute. Several of the program areas that are incorporated by this application are struggling with recruitment and international mobility will improve this.\r\n2-3 students/ apprentices from each of the three disciplines will each year have the opportunity to participate in this deployment, the selection of these will occur throughout the school year and be based on motivation and strength in subjects, interest and personal suitability. In addition, it will be desirable that 1-2 responsible persons from school / training body is allowed to visit the students/apprentices once during deployment time.\r\nStudents / trainees will be deployed in companies / institutions within its field in the recipient country. For students, this will be a natural part of the subject In-depth study project, and follow the learning objectives relevant to the field. They are also evaluated in the deployment period through cooperation between school teachers and administrators in deploying enterprise. For apprentices will deployment time be included as part of the apprenticeship, and they will also have to deal with their learning objectives, and keep a log of the deployment in the same way as on the regular apprenticeship.\r\nWe hope and believe that this will strengthen the  participants both in their area and their language and culture competencies. In addition, it will strengthen participants' autonomy and personal development. This will partly be measured through students / apprentices' academic achievements.\r\nThe project will also strengthen the affected vocational subjects status, and thus contribute to increased recruitment. In addition, we believe that such a project strengthens the institutions reputation and also strenghten the cooperation between school and training offices in the region (and thus firms).", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2015-1-NO01-KA102-013142_3"], ["5AD", "Work Experience UK", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 28324.0, "Orkdal Upper Secondary school apply for economical support to the project \u00abWork Experience UK\u00bb on the basis of the plans and strategies on international work for our school.

The School is aiming to improve the status of vocational education and has started two new courses of tuition giving a double set of qualifications; the students obtain a Vocational Certificate and at the same time become qualified for higher education by combining theoretical studies and apprenticeships.  In these new courses, and within Electricity, the school will contribute to the possibilities for international school- and labor experience. The school management believes that this will improve the status of vocational education and make it more attractive to be a student at Lier USS.  Simultaneously, the school has strengthened its cooperation with local businesses and industries in order to educate good workers with formal skills. In the autumn of 2013 we therefore embarked on a major information campaign directed systematically at the local public, commercial and industrial sectors,\r\n at Buskerud county department of education, and at the lower secondary schools from which we recruit our students. In addition, we are using public - and social media and our website actively to spread information about the meaning of our courses with international school- and labor experiences and the future opportunities it provides.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of the project is to improve the status of vocational education and make it more attractive to young people. When they have finished their education, they will become attractive to the employees. Lier USS strives to maintain a good reputation, both in the community and, more generally, by working systematically to achieve positive results. Given that we live in a multicultural society and a globalized labor market, we believe it is important for students to get more knowledge and understanding of the fact that they are part of a larger community. We are therefore planning for school- and labor placement for our students in Belgium, Slovaki and Great Britain. A stay abroad with school- and practical labor experience and experience from family and community life, will give our students new perspectives on other cultures and contribute to their personal development.\r\nThe Project Group consists of nine people: Assistant Principal, two Heads of Department, and six teachers. All have higher education and years of practical work experience. All nine members of the Project Group have good interpersonal skills and ability to work systematically and consciously to secure a high quality outcome for students. 60 students will participate in the program. To ensure student involvement and influence a prefect from each class participate in the Project Group with effect from the autumn 2015.\r\n\r\nLier USS has produced a preliminary plan including the project's main milestones. Representatives from the Project Group wil during the first year, which is a year, go abroad to become better acquainted with our partners, and further develop the relationship with them. Through this pilot Project, we will obtain in-depth knowledge of both relevant internships, suitable families and the guidance our students will get during their stay abroad. This is important knowledge to take back to the students and parents to prepare them for what to expect. In order to be selected for international school- and labor placement, and to have an influence on the appropriate type of work they can get, the students have to write and submit an application with CV.  In addition, they will be called for an interview. Our partners abroad will also require a copy of the CVs from the students in order to customize the stay in the best possible way.\r\n\r\nOur school will develop a strategy of communication for \"Vocational Education with International School- and Work Experience\".  We expect that the project will be of great importance both for students and for Lier USS. Students will feel appreciated; they will experience success and be proud of what they have experienced. It will give them a personal growth and be important for their general education.\r\n\r\nThe school is planning to introduce international school- and labor experience for other programs of education and we would like to see that people will consider vocational training with new eyes, and become more attractive to young people.

This development creates opportunities as well as challenges. The growing need for more relevant and competent professional expertise, changes in demographics, and increased globalisation all require new and innovative professional competences and relevant vocational education and training. International cooperation is an integral part of the Hordaland County Council\u2019s (HCC) strategy for regional development. The strategy aims to create a sustainable, attractive and competitive region, and give young people international competence, experience and shared responsibility. As these challenges are not only valid for Hordaland, the HCC see international cooperation as a tool to finding possible solutions to such challenges. The HCC is therefore using participation in different European mobility programmes, such as Erasmus+ VET mobility, as a strategic tool in developing the region. The programme will be an important contribution in meeting the needs for more relevant professional expertise and pedagogical knowledge, international experience, as well as improved foreign language competences and enhanced intercultural awareness.\r\nAs part of the HCC\u2019s strategic plans for internationalisation, international cooperation is to be an integrated part of education and training, as it adds value and quality to the training of professionals. International competences offer VET learners the opportunity to develop their abilities to actively participate in an increasing multicultural society and global world. To achieve these goals, it is an important task of the HCC to mobilise VET schools and training agencies to participate in European mobility programmes. As a regional developer, the HCC also encourage staff in public offices, enterprises and other relevant organisations to improve and strengthen their professional skills within their field of expertise, as well as developing intercultural competence and knowledge. \r\nThe target groups for this mobility project are VET learners, VET staff and other staff in institutions where training is offered. A large portion of the staff mobility projects consists of interdisciplinary groups where at least one of the participants is representing a VET organisation. The participants are key persons and play an important role in the implementation and dissemination of the projects. \r\n\r\nThe HCC is applying for: 204 VET learner mobilities, 129 staff mobilities and 64 accompanying persons.\r\n\r\nThe disciplines represented in this application includes: health care/social work, restaurant/hotel, technology, service, design and agriculture. In addition, the mobility projects will cover themes such as health promoting work in schools, welfare technology, civil entrepreneurship, broader understanding of practices and systems in VET, as well as cooperation between VET and enterprises. \r\nThe objectives of this mobility project are to strengthen the region through the acquisition of professional knowledge and expertise, develop new skills and competences, to develop prosperous local communities, improve learning outcomes for VET learners, increase recruitment and the number of VET learners finishing with a trade certificate. In addition to professional competences, it is expected that the project will increase foreign language and intercultural competences, as well as motivate participants to take part in and develop other international projects in the future. This mobility project will have both short and long term effects. It will make it possible to implement and disseminate new and innovative tools and methods to a wide variety of relevant stakeholders. It will also strengthen the quality of education and training, and the region will be able to offer activities and programmes that better respond to the needs of both the individual and the region. This will further increase the status and the attractiveness of VET.\r\nThe HCC writes the mobility application on behalf of its sending organisations, and is the coordinator for the project. The HCC has extensive experience in project cooperation and management through different EU projects (LLP, Interreg) and is well qualified to carry out this mobility project.

Both parties involved will act responsibly, informing the participants on the programme, preparing and assisting them in any situation. Thus, ADC College will find the right workplace for them, according to their CVs and needs, will offer data about the placement and about the institution which will organize the internship, will present the working programme to them, will offer individual and group sessions. Our high school will send information regarding the pedagogical training the students did in Romania prior to their leaving, will follow the working programme, will take part in the activities and meetings established. The students will actively participate during the classes, will observe the teaching and evaluation process, methods, tools, strategies, the didactic material used, they will project, deliver and evaluate lessons. What is more, they will observe the way of interaction between teachers and preschoolers. This exchange of experience and of good practices regarding teaching, learning and evaluating preschoolers will enrich participants both personally and professionally, helping them to become more and more competitive, motivated, tolerant and more open to new challenges and opportunities. This internship offers participants better employment possibilities and the chance to link their own qualifications to the labour market. It offers the possibility of further projects in collaboration with the same institution or with other vocational institutions. The experience gained will be used directly by the trainees and it will also be disseminated in various ways to their colleagues, teachers, pupils, from their town, country and from other countries.

Whithin the project three sixteen - student groups along with two teachers will go abroad to take part in the work experience. Students from the logistics school will go to London where they will work in the companies whereas students from tourism school will spend two weeks working in hotels and travel agencies both in London and Rimini. Most of the students commute to school from nearby villages. Only 30% of them live in Cieszyn. They come from families with low incomes and therefore low living standards. 24% of the students come from famielies where one parent does not have a job. Students coming to SOIZ usually received  average grades in Junior High School. Low motivation to learn, low self-esteem, lack of self-confidence, low level of English language competence, lack of possibilities of gaining experience in working in multicultural teams, weak mobility are their main weaknesses. Students from tourism school study only the theory but they have no opportunities of experiencing other countries, their cultures and real language.Through the European educating standards in SOIZ we want to enable students to get to know European job market. Taking part in the project is supposed to create the chances of gaining work experience, additional job qualifications and experiencing new cultures and learning languages. Another significant aspect is development of personal competence such as increasing students' self-esteem, ability to cope with sterss, international team cooperation, increasing their motivation to learn and become more open to their mobilities. Getting job qualifications, language and personal competences approved by Europass Mobility Certificates are aimed to increase thei chances of being employed and entering the job market in Poland and Europe.The project gives the opportunity for development of students' job skills as well as personal development of teachers involved in the project. It will enable the students to get to know European job market, develop English language skills and increase their mobility. It is also a big opportunity for the school to teach in European standards.The students taking part in the project will be chosen by a selection committee. After that, they will attend a special profession, language and culture-oriented programme, which will prepare them to take advantage of the training so that their working skills could improve significantly.

Teachers commited to the project will develope new materials and methods for the teaching and learning in the CLIL methodology and the use of programs and updated resources.During the course 2017/2018 the teacher participating in the project will teach their subject in English. The expected impact of this action provides a quantitative improvement in the results of basic skills in the English language of each group of students and in all the levels at school.The qualitative improvement of students and teachers will reflect in the English language skills. These impacts will be assessed through monitoring systems and external tests that already exist in our organization.We hope this project promotes other goals, such as improving student's motivation for academic success and reduce the student's dropout in the future.

Responding to the growing number of special needs students through the methodological innovation and learning best practices from Europe. Our school is very attentive to the training of teachers in inclusion and we believe that the exercise of comparison with European colleagues can increase the skills of the school on this important and sensitive issue.This needs analysis resulted in the preparation of FLASH, which thus aims to achieve the following general objectives:- Promote quality improvements, innovation excellence and internationalization, particularly through enhanced transnational cooperation with our European partners to enable us to understand methodologies and approaches, overcoming the difficulties encountered by comparison on the field ;- Improve the ability of teachers participating in the mobility project and part of the working group \"Erasmus +\" to determine changes in terms of modernization and internationalization of our school;- Improve the understanding of the practices, policies and systems of higher school education (age 14-19) in the partner countries;and to achieve the following specific objectives:- improve the language skills and the intercultural awareness of a specific target group of teachers interested in learning more about European cooperation;- Improve the understanding of the interconnections between formal and non-formal education, vocational training and the labor market: all partner schools are in fact mixed institutes general + VET providing considerable attention to training for entry into the labor market, to self-employment and to a good alternance between school and work;-Improve the ability to address the needs of the least advantaged, with specific reference to the acquisition of skills in the area of inclusive best practices.The project involves 9 units of teaching staff in 18 mobilities, including 9 job shadowing and 9 training courses.

Therefore it is crucial that these companies have employees being able to act in an intercultural appropriate way and at the same having the much needed special skills and knowledge of their profession. On these grounds the aim of the Jakob-Friedrich-Sch\u00f6llkopf-School is to prepare the students in the best way for the challenges they have to face in their future working life. By working in competitive markets it is necessary that students do not only enlarge their expertise, their social and personal skills but also to develop the ability to act as active European citizens.In order to reach those goals the Jakob-Friedrich-Sch\u00f6llkopf-School would like to give 30 students (15 participants in each year) in the following two years the chance to take part in the proposed project.The aim of the project is to give selected students in their second year of training the possibility to work, learn and live for three weeks in one of the largest metropolis in Europe, more precisely, in London. All our students are based in Greater London and will do their placement in selected companies in the area of trade, office work, management and retail. The participants will stay in host families provided by the partner organization. During the first week out of the three the participants receive language lessons and an introductory course including organizational or cultural aspects e.g. how to behave in a foreign environment, in daily life as well as in business situations. This is provided by the ADC College London. Additionally, in the following two weeks the trainees gain practical experience in selected British companies in London. In terms of quality management it is crucial for a successful work experience in a foreign country to tackle the needs of the participants in the run up and to prepare them in preparatory meetings for their stay abroad. Therefore the participants are supported in several ways, e.g.  including the awareness and improvement of their cultural, language, social, personal and task-related competences. During their stay in London the participants will be monitored, accompanied and supported by a member of staff of the ADC College and teachers of the Jakob-Friedrich-Sch\u00f6llkopf-School. After being back home the participants present their experience, impressions and their newly acquired skills and competences at school and at other selected events to other students, teachers and their companies as well as to other stakeholders and representatives involved in education and the local press.

Many students grew up in rural areas and in a rather uneducated environment. They are still very young- mainly underage. Therefore, they have barley any experience with mobility projects. All students are already in their second year of their initial training programme, which means that they already have some good knowledge of the particular everyday-working-life. Due to the fact that most of the students just hold a successful certificate of secondary education (CSE) they have limited (native and foreign) language skills, which need to be improved. Additionally, most of our students haven\u2019t had any experience with migrants so far. Their experiences refer to asylum seekers and gastarbeiter and they are rather based on prejudices. However, it is getting even more important in their kind of jobs, to get insights into working structures of other countries and to develop intercultural and personal skills through the exposure to strange cultures. As a result, basic project targets must be:- Application of the English language in daily life and to reduce fears of contacts with foreign languages and cultures- To gain professional skills by learning about new educational focuses in the partner country and through exploring the differences and similarities in the education.  - Establishment of personal skills, like self-confidence and so on.The number of participants is limited to 20 students per flow, since most of them are underage, which leads to a higher need of care and support. Additionally, financial costs are playing a big part, because many of our student\u2019s families live in limited monetary boundaries, who can barely accomplish any additional cost.  To develop a feeling for the language and to learn how to act self-respondent in an urban area, it is absolutely necessary to have a one-week language course before the placement takes place. The placement in the different professional areas lasts two weeks and gives first insights in the working-structures of the host country. The dealing with the different culture of the host country will be supported by the accompanying teachers in the afternoons of the first week and at the weekends, additional to their lives in the host families and at work of social facilities. The organisation of the mobility, like insurance, transportation to the airport, flight booking and flight, transportation in greater London will be done by the sending organisation. They will also help to organise special needs like visa applications.  The partner organisation is responsible for the organisation of the host families, the placement companies and the first information for the participants. During the whole mobility, the participants will be accompanied by both organisations. Placement visits  as well as personal and intercultural care and support will be done by the accompanying persons. Regular meetings at the partner organisation will be done to monitor, evaluate and ensure the learning progresses. There are many expected effects:A strong personal effect on the participant\u2019s self-confidence can be expected. The certainty to have been able to orientate in a metropolis supports the self-confidence as well as the experience to handle a new and strange situation. In the future, the willingness will be enforced to face and go through new and uncertain, anxiety-ridden situations. Effects on the language can be already expected during the first week of the stay, when the participants realize, that they are always able to find ways to express themselves \u2013 the main thing is that they dare to use the language. Language skills in vocabulary, through frequent speaking, as well as active and passive understanding will be improved, because the contact to migrants and British dialects require concentrated listening. In London-Harrow, in their families and working facilities, the participants will have contact to British people with different cultural background, which can be from Rumania, Jamaica or India. In that way they will be forced to deal with different cultures on a personal and culinary level and as well as the differences in values and conventions. This leads to a questioning of own prejudices and to a curiosity of foreign cultures.To compare the professional facilities, the concepts and the working structure of the host country to the working situation at home and the questioning of familiar habits, lead to the ability to recognize connections and  dependencies in values of different cultural backgrounds.

At Berufskolleg Meschede these students either attend a two-year, full-time commercial course or they come to college once or twice a week for the theoretical part of their training as an industrial management assistant or management assistant in wholesale and foreign trade.The promotion of European mobility and the exchange of job-relevant language skills are objectives of the mobility organisation. With this project Berufskolleg Meschede prepares its students for an increasingly international working environment. It also promotes the personal development of the young people and strengthens their European values such as acceptance and integration.The aim of the project is to give the participants confidence in their abilities, to promote mobility across national borders, break down language barriers and to get professional practical knowledge. Regarding an increasingly integrated Europe and a growing number of international companies in the region, the trainees will be well-qualified for the challenges of the national and international labor markets. Showing mobility within Europa also makes students more interesting as future employees and is appreciated by training companies.The training companies benefit from the work placements, too. On the one hand they get interculturally and linguistically competent staff. On the other hand they score in the competition for young professionals by offering the option of a stay abroad as part of their training.For Berufskolleg Meschede the above-mentioned programs are another step to raise the school's profile and a further step on its way to become \u201cEuropaschule\u201d, a school with a strong European profile. As the number of possible students will decrease due to the demographic development in the countryside, the cooperation of all participating parties also provides an opportunity for Berufskolleg Meschede to remain attractive for future students.", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002741_1"], ["5AD", "Trainees' Exchange 2014 - BBS Ammerland/ZST Pleszew/England", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 50752.0, "The rural district Pleszew (PL) and the administrative district Ammerland have a close local and political partnership since 2000. This partnership was extended to the academic level in 2001. The basis for the partnership between BBS Ammerland and Zesp\u00f3\u0142 Sk\u00f3\u0142 Technicznych in Pleszew was and still is the German interest which had evolved from their shared history and Poland\u2019s ad-mission to the EU in May 2004. Although the EU status of Poland has moved into the background the historical incidents and therefore the political education of our participants are still of considerable relevance.Moreover, vocational aspects especially of young workers have to be taken into consideration. On the one hand, the participants are 36 students, who are absolving their first vocational training. They qualify in training courses such as electronic technicians, metalworkers, industrial mechanics, wholesale clerks, office and catering assistants. However, it is also possible to include other vocational fields. On the other hand, participants are 19 teachers and training supervisors. A stay abroad can significantly improve the chances of young people in the job market. However, it is important to prepare them adequately for diverse situations with respect to professional and intercultural aspects. Therefore, young trainees are sent to have firsthand experiences with both professional dialogue and personal meetings which enables them to interact with potential international partners in a fair, compe-tent and efficient way. This goal can be reached by offering them 3-week internships in different European businesses. Each group sent abroad consists of eight respectively ten participants. The chosen participants have an interest to be employed in Europe in the future.Furthermore, it is important to our school to support the personal development of young people. To get in contact with a foreign culture, including coping with others in a foreign language will improve their self-esteem and possibly help them to decrease or give up existing prejudices. Included in this internship program there is also a special cultural framework program to help reach this goal.The project begins anew with each fresh group, since the trainees only take part in the program once. That means we aim to reach the same objectives in every project, but we gain new trainees each time. This way we continuously reach a wider circle of trainees, whom we can offer the opportunity of an internship in a foreign country, i. e. Poland or England. This is especially important because the trainees are predominantly working in small- or medium-sized businesses and therefore rarely gain experiences in bigger or foreign companies. Thus, the overall objective of the placements is the qualitative improvement of the apprenticeship through a development of intercultural professionalism, linguistic, and social competence and sensitization of the necessity to educate oneself further in this area.We expect that our objectives (technological, intercultural, social, linguistic, and political) will be reached to a large extent. For us this means among other things that the trainees will be able to reflect their diverse experiences after their stay abroad and to include them in their current or future apprenticeship. Additionally, we expect that they will profit in future employment and hiring situa-tions from their stay abroad and that all this will have a permanent effect.The importance of learning languages, e. g. English as lingua franca, becomes more obvious when one stays abroad. The language barrier is a special obstacle which must be coped with. This is especially true for languages which are not taught in school.The political structures of our host country are, apart from the existing democratic structures, still influenced by obedience and hierarchy. Our participants can observe these differences when they attend the lessons in school and take part in events at school or elsewhere. They may learn that, compared to Poland, political and social structures have a different character in Germany which allows our young people more freedom than teenagers in Poland.All in all, the experiences abroad will leave a sustainable impression on the young people who take part in the program, something which will probably influence them in various situations in the future and they will be properly prepared and qualified for any international tasks in their future occupational careers.", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002746_2"], ["5AD", "Implementierung einer \"Europa-Klasse\" mit Auslandspraktika im Rahmen der beruflichen Erstausbildung", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 50473.0, "Professional traineeships are an integral element within the initial vocational training at the \"Berufsbildende Schule Wirtschaft Idar-Oberstein\" (vocational school of economics at Idar-Oberstein). Mandatorily embedded in several educational programmes and school types, they complement the theoretical subject teaching with indispensable practical experience.  Foreign traineeships are now increasingly to be offered, so that, with the broadened learning content, an in-practise approach to economic activity on European and global level can be experienced.  In May 2015 the Berufsbildende Schule Wirtschaft obtained its European School certification. At the time both, students and teaching staff had already been active in international projects within the framework of Lifelong Learning programmes.    There were some student exchanges and foreign traineeships in the past, but only a minority benefited from these. By means of Erasmus+ it is now intended to establish a \"European Class\" scheme, which, within the initial vocational training (upper vocational school, dual training), permanently integrates an additional traineeship of at least two weeks abroad into the school profile and the curriculum.   Initially, students of both school types will, two times over two years, make use of four proven hosting organisations, which form the basis for more target countries to follow. Thus, altogether 48 students and eight attendants/subject teachers will, over two years, carry out eight foreign activities with traineeships in four countries (CZ, NOR, TY, GB). Upon evaluation and optimisation this project will serve as a sustainable and permanent \"European School Opportunity\" for future student generations.As a rule, the students are between 17 and 20 years of age, more likely structurally disadvantaged, highly motivated and open minded for the broadening of their cross-cultural, professional, social and economic competencies. In the commercial field the trainees gain insight into processes, as they are common practise in administration, accounting, and the general course of business, with an emphasis on file keeping and office management. The training period is also being recognised as part of a six-month traineeship, which is, at a Fachhochschule (technical college) are an additional requirement for graduation.

They have to integrate children (and parents) from various origins with totally different social and cultural backgrounds, who are not able to speak the German language, thus giving them the opportunity of a better life. Therefore our nursery school teachers need internationally approved strategies, which they are going to acquire through their work placement in London. The knowledge gained here shall be transferred to effectively meet the challenges our German childcare institutions are facing. By adjusting our vocational education to the needs of the European labour market our vocational college wants to lay the cornerstone for a further internationalisation of our school.Besides gaining knowledge about the successful integration of immigrant children our students' multilingualism shall be promoted.

This will allow them to integrate and adjust to the new culture, which will train both their social and individual competencies.The students and participating teachers will communicate the results of the project in a number of ways, for example through a daily blog, which will be written abroad and shared on Facebook, Twitter, through articles published in the regional daily newspaper, as well as through the annual school report and personal contacts to the companies training our students, representatives of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce or other teachers.In the long term we, as teachers at a vocational school in the metropolitan region of Nuremberg, would like to give many students the opportunity to gain vocational experience abroad.  This application is another step in this direction.  The experiences provided by a stay abroad cannot be had in a classroom. Abroad, contacts are made and friendships develop which last a lifetime and can be useful for building an international network.  This strengthens not only our students but also the teachers, who are encouraged by motivated students to carry out projects abroad.  Sending our graduates as well-trained professionals with an international orientation to the job market is an important competitive advantage, enhances our image and will benefit our region and its resident companies.", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002942_1"], ["5AD", "Exchanging of European internshipsExchanging of European internships and intercultural exchanges and experiences for business students as a project (preparation - planning - realisation and evaluation) Improving of life-long skills", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 61666.0, "Concerning this exchange programme Exchanging of European internshipsExchanging of European internships and intercultural exchanges and experiences for business students as a project (preparation - planning - realisation and evaluation) Improving of life-long skills we want to give our students which decided for the subjects foreign language and business communication the possibility to do a three-weeks placement in different London business companies and to gain work experience as well as language skills and to get to know another culture more closely so that they are sensibilized for cultural understanding and mutual learning.Nowadays it is an utmost concern to sensitize our students in tolerance, respect for the different, human rights and the awareness of a united Europe.

The aim will be an integral and extensive broadening of their horizon. As a result, the internship should have a clearly positive impulse for their professional career improving their chances on the employment market, on a national and European level. Furthermore, the experiences gained should help them further develop their personality in order to become responsible and self-confident members of the European society, in which they should take an active part. The project also aims at promoting tolerance and the European understanding by creating networks and establishing new links on a professional as well as on a private level.The 15 participants of the project are trainees as Industrial Clerks. They will have the opportunity to do a two- to three-week internship with a company situated in the Greater London Area. The ADC College in London will be in charge of the organizational matters, taking care of welcoming the participants and of finding them an appropriate company for an internship.

The ADC College will also hold mentoring sessions which every participant will receive as part of the program. In those, a mentor will evaluate the student\u2019s progress on the program, verify the quality of the placement and discuss areas of improvement with the participant.As a result of the internships, the students should develop various competences on a linguistic, professional, social, personal and intercultural level. In the process, they should use their ideas and skills, examine and reconsider them and as a result develop and improve them. Consequently, they should also strengthen their own personality and thus become mature members of the European society and also confident employees.

Especially companies in the Metropolitan region of Nuremberg attach great importance to education under international considerations, because in today\u2019s globalised world they are used to increasingly establishing and maintaining business relationships outside their home markets. Since there are often Anglo-Saxon rules by which they communicate on an international level, we consider it as compulsory to provide our trainees with a training program in the UK in order to prepare them for the demands of the international economic environment. Unfortunately, it is no longer a matter of course to obtain a work contract with the respective training company after completing traineeship. Consequently, trainees must more than ever be willing to respond flexibly to changing and international labour market structures. Through this project, students can enrich their CVs  appropriately to be prepared for the European labour market.All trainees of the LES in dual vocational training of the following sectors can apply for participation: office administration, retail, wholesale and foreign trade, real estate, industry, IT, personnel services, administrative professions. The LES selects the applications received according to the following criteria: age of majority , language skills B1 of the CEFR, motivation throughout the project duration (possibly in consultation with form masters), willingness to adapt to different circumstances. At an early stage of preparation the participants create their individual CVs and motivation letters. On this basis, the ADC College can choose work placements according to the participants' individual sectors and skills (e.g. real estate trainees were placed at English real estate agencies and personnel services merchants in the personnel departments of large hotels). Accordingly, we expect similar good placements of future participants.The implementation of the three -week project in Harrow / Greater London is planned for March 2017.For this purpose, participants will be prepared by the project leaders of the Ludwig -Erhard -Schule in five three -hour evening seminars and additionally by means of an online communication platform outside of the regular vocational school time and accompanied to Harrow. In case of questions, the participants can get in touch \u2013 either by digital means or personally - with their project leaders at any stage of the project.The collaboration between the project management of the LES and the responsible coordinator at ADC College is given throughout the entire project by e- mail, by phone or in person, on the spot and very successfully.

The work placement gives people the chance to use their skills in completely different settings than they are used to at home and thus they experience how work is done in foreign companies. Furthermore, the projects serve to broaden their language skills in everyday situations as well as in a business context and apart from that, they increase their intercultural competence. As a result, the projects help the students to mature on a personal level and to become more open-minded regarding foreign cultures. All in all, the students develop a better understanding of the diversity in Europe and therefore they can identify with the idea of Europe. A ,Europass Mobility\u2018 as well as a work placement certificate will be given to the participants. It is anticipated that these documents will help the students when applying for suitable jobs on an international level. Thus, the projects are of great importance to the ,Berufskolleg Wirtschaft und Verwaltung\u2018. As a certified ,Europaschule\u2018 it is constantly striving to strengthen its international-oriented profile. The network of international partner organisations is to be expanded to give students various opportunities to take part in international mobility projects. The whole region of Siegen-Wittgenstein as a location for international business and a high export share, profits from the apprentices\u2018 international orientation as skilled and open-minded employees are much-needed in an internationally operating company.

The aim of the project is (in cooperation with the Carl-Severing-Berufskolleg f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Verwaltung der Stadt Bielefeld (CSB)) to acquire international key competences and know-how in full-time (EBK) and vocational (CSB) training.Aims of the ProjectIt is the project\u2019s aim to allow students to gain practical experience in a foreign company and to develop professional as well as intercultural and language skills.This newly acquired knowledge increases students\u2019 employability in international companies, improves mobility and enables them to think and act in an entrepreneurial and European manner. Participants are supposed to actively shape and organise their working, living and learning environment and strengthen their European identity.The documents EUROPASS Mobility and EUROPASS CV support and improve efficiency, quality and recognition of the work placement abroad as part of a vocational training. Number of participants and target group- Students attending a full-time course leading to two qualifications: Advanced technical college certificate/university entrance qualification (A-levels) + vocational qualification according to federal state law (course of study for assistants, e.g. business assistants)- Students attending a two-year full-time course (commercial college) with a focus on Europe leading to the advanced technical college certificate; moreover students must have acquired general professional skills.The total number of participants within the 24-months project period is 20 students (10 students attending the course of study for assistants; 10 participants from the commercial college).Internships will last for two up to six weeks in one of 29 EU countries. They will be supervised and coordinated by the two vocational colleges in EBK and CSB.Description of activities and procedures of project realisation Interested young people take part in a reliable process that helps them with all requirements and difficulties from the first contact to the reflection of the work placement and provides them with language and intercultural preparation. In addition, individual tasks and assignments will be created for each student.After that students gain practical experience in European companies and acquire knowledge and skills relevant to the labour market.After they have returned home, participants reflect the work placement by writing a report and creating a PowerPoint presentation. The project is also evaluated and published by the partners (sending and receiving institutions/colleges/companies). Description of intended results, effects and expected long-term benefitsBy gaining international competences, experience abroad and mobility, the participant improves his chances on the national and international job market as these requirements are increasingly becoming an important part of job profiles. Time spent abroad together with occupational experience is an excellent opportunity for acquiring international and business skills as well as soft skills. Participants act in international terms and strengthen their European identity. Companies are provided with trainees respectively applicants with openness to mobility, a wide range of soft skills and business competence who can act appropriately at European level. Through the project \"Ready, steady, go for Europe!\" companies also open up to staff from the entire European job market, since the close cooperation between the  participating institutions results in an exchange, transfer and evaluation of knowledge, procedures and techniques. For all participating institutions synergetic effects are generated.The outcome in form of participants\u2018 reports, photo documentations, PowerPoint presentations and oral performances are edited as far as possible for printing and/or documentation on CD  and then made available for network users or on the internet.  The participating vocational colleges show a great interest in publishing the trainees\u2019 experiences in the local or regional press.

Upon successful completion of the training course, the professional designation \u201cState Approved Multi-Lingual Correspondence Clerk\u201d is awarded.The \u201cADC College\u201d is an institution which has been accredited by the British Council and has a Work Placement Portfolio at its disposal comprising 200 enterprises in London. It is active in the field of further training and has been playing an active role in European projects on a regular basis since 2008.In two flows, a total of 30 IFS pupils are to be provided with the opportunity to live and work in London for three weeks.The 1st week serves as a preparatory period, during which trainees receive on-site briefing concerning their traineeship. From the very beginning, trainees are able to adjust to the social environment, culture and language of their new surroundings thanks to the fact that they stay in accommodation provided by host families.In the 2nd and 3rd  week, trainees are allocated work placements in various sectors, depending on their vocational profile (e.g. tourism, commerce, trade or media).Trainee profilePupils usually commence their two-year training course at the IFS immediately after obtaining the \u201cMittlere Reife\u201d (approx.

We, as a school, are conscious of this problem and aim to do our utmost to compensate this deficit by supplementing the course with additional training opportunities.Goals, activities, dissemination and effectWIELD is intended to cater to the needs of our pupils as well as to the demands made on them in order to improve their career prospects in the European labour market, facilitate intercultural dialogue and introduce them to entrepreneurial thought processes. In addition, trainees are to receive optimum support in the development of their personalities thanks to the immersive effect of WIELD.From the very beginning and with the assistance of their teachers, trainees are encouraged to take as much initiative as possible when assuming responsibility for preparing themselves for their stay abroad.

Like many other schools across Europe, the HAK/HAS Amstetten has realized the fact that both the present and future job market presents the workforce with a diversified qualification profile and forces successful employees to develop multiple competences both on a professional and personal level.As a result, the school set the goal to offer its students work placements all over Europe to make sure they have ample opportunity to acquire professional and language skills necessary to compete in Europe\u00b4s future job market. Unfortunately, many of our students do not have sufficient financial resources to organize work placements in foreign countries themselves. Therefore, subsidies like the ones provided by the Erasmus project provide our students with the chance to not only gain experience in working abroad but also to further develop their skills. The main goal of this project is the development of professional competences in the areas of business administration and information technology among its participants and other students of the HAK/HAS Amstetten.

Reinforcing transnational cooperation among the partner institutions and organizations is also in the center of attention of this project.As the main focus is on guaranteeing the professional development of the participants, choosing the right students was an important aspect of the initial stage of the project. Choosing students with sufficient professional and language skills to guarantee the performance necessary at an international company was regarded as an important aspect of the recruiting process. Without sufficient skills to begin with, further development of the skills at the work placement cannot be guaranteed. Nevertheless, another goal was not to exclude any student from the chance to apply for a spot on the project. Finally, 19 students were chosen to participate in the actual work placements in both London and Madrid.These 19 students attend a seminar in the HAK/HAS Amstetten, which is designed to prepare them for both the new living and working environments in London and Madrid.

This will have a huge impact on them because they have to survive in a country foreign to them in a foreign language. In many areas, they will find that they are much more capable than they realize. The far-reaching autonomy will be a huge boost in terms of their personal development. Their horizons will be broadened, and they will realize that more is possible in life. Naturally, the professional competences addressed and it will be for them an enrichment to compare the method within the healthcare sector between Belgium and Great Britain. There will be 15 students who get the chance to run two-week internship in London and to adapt to life in the big city within a family. On the stage, they will take care tasks in the elderly. There will also a supervisor of the school to support them where necessary. Our partner ADC College will provide a lot of support and follow up. They provide regarly consultation moments between student and internship. The project will be announced through the local press, on our open house, through Facebook and the website. The students will be making a portfolio and also get a certificate through ADC College and a validated Europass. All of this will be a huge value in the quest for a future employer.

Both themes are defined by Rogaland Fylkeskommune as focus areas. At the end of this periode, we are confident that we will have acquired valuable knowledge, experiences and concrete tools to implement in the entire organization. As part of an international labor market, we consider it essential that our students get international perspectives and experiences throughout their educational careers. In this respect, we have for several years cooperated with schools in Europe for the exchange of students in vocational training for professional practice in enterprises in the partner country. Likewise, we have as part of our commitment to the development of a new national vocational education and training for wind technicians cooperated with various European institutions developing expertise in this field. Current school needs have been directing the content of this current application. Our students need to develope language skills og perspectives on integration and tolerance. On a teacher level, we want to develop our skills in assessment for learning, we want to learn more about how succesful class leadership can reduce the number of early school leavers and we want to learn more about how to deal with refugees' strengths and weaknesses. Finally, it is also an important aim to further enhance our teachers' professional skills. On a school level, we want to deal with the same issues, but focusing on how school leadership can facilitate both employees and students in order to meet the needs satisfactorily. In order to cover our current needs through this Erasmus Application, we apply for the following learner and staff mobilities in cooperation with our six partners:1. VET learners traineeships in companies abroad. Here we apply for a total of 79 students and 16 companions for mobility to Germany and the United Kingdom.2. VET learners traineeships in vocational institutes abroad. We apply for a total of 49 students and 6 companions for mobility to various partners in Germany.3. Staff training abroad to enhance the competence for school staff on an international arena to develop higher quality education, individual expertise, capacity for innovation and international contacts that can be used in the classroom to give students better and more relevant training. This time, we have deliberately applied for shorts stays, since we find it important that as many different staff as possible can participate in international projects, especially in other to implement the findings throughout the school system. We apply for 49 staff members for mobility to Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden (Staff training abroad) and for 6 staff members to get foreign teaching experience in Germany (Teaching/training assignments abroad).We experience that international cooperation gives students unique and sought-after skills in the labour market. Through staff mobility the school will expand the perspectives and expertise in relation to learning and teaching. Students and teachers develop language skills and cultural competence.

The students attend the final year of upper secondary school at Dragonskolan, Ume\u00e5.During three weeks the students will be housed in British families while having an internship at selected salons with qualified supervisors to expand their knowledge and their attitudes towards entrepreneurship, business and innovation. The internship shall develop the students\u2019 ability to analyse and evaluate their own work and learning as well as their ability to independently choose among techniques and materials. The international perspective shall also contribute to developing the students\u2019 understanding and knowledge in order to be able to better approach the increasing cultural diversity within Sweden and our county V\u00e4sterbotten.Dissemination of the results deriving from the project will be done through flyers, reports and different social media to demonstrate that the vocational programmes Hairdressing, Stylist and Spa offer a safe and inclusive environment where we are consistent about human equality.

In these new courses, the school will contribute to the possibilities for international school- and labor experience. The school management believes that this will raise the international dimensioon of vocational education and make it more attractive to be a student at Lier USS.  Simultaneously, the school has strengthened its cooperation with local businesses and industries in order to educate good workers with formal skills. In the autumn of 2013 we therefore embarked on a major information campaign directed systematically at the local public, commercial and industrial sectors, at Buskerud county department of education, and at the lower secondary schools from which we recruit our students. In addition, we are using public - and social media and our website actively to spread information about the meaning of our courses with international  labor experiences and the future opportunities it provides.The main objective of the project is to raise the international dimension of vocational education and make it more attractive to young people. When they have finished their education, they will become attractive to the employees. Lier USS strives to maintain a good reputation, both in the community and, more generally, by working systematically to achieve positive results.

This is important knowledge to take back to the students and parents to prepare them for what to expect. In order to be selected for international labor placement, and to have an influence on the appropriate type of work they can get, the students have to write and submit an application with CV.

Since English is the main and preferred language in servicing foreign customers and business networks, we actively seek to improve and develop new and relevant learning arenas where this combination can be offered with the greatest impact.For vocational students in particular, \"learning by doing\" is paramount. An intensive workplacement period in an international environment where relevant vocational workpractice is executed, is our preferred choice. Project objectives:Nordland County has an overall plan for internationalisation for 2012-2025. The objective is to be the most international county in Norway by 2025.  To deliver accordingly, Sortland Upper Secondary School must be a regional contributor in meeting the objectives: A) The County regions must be internationally attractive.  B) Our students and apprentices will be \"global citizens\" locally, regionally and internationally.  C) Educational organizatons will be integraded into larger internationalisation initiatives. Our school must develop the region's future workforce by developing relevant  vocational-, language-, and cultural competencies.  Also, a rapidly growing international workforce living in our region, will be integraded better and more rapidly.  Consequently, participation in Erasmus + VET learner practice is important for our students.  Our specific objective is to provide two weeks of vocational learning workplacement for 20 of of students during their 2nd year of their vocational studies in upper secondary school, 10 students per year. Number and profile of participants:10 participating students per year over two years, across the vocational trades defined above. Student candidates are selected according to an assessmentprocess of their individual skills, their business- and language competency level, combined with their ability to show initiative, level of self-efficacy, dedication and ability to contribute in the workplace. Up to 30 % of our students will be selected for this workplacement project, provided that they meet the appropriate high level of performance.  Description of activities:Pre-assignment: awareness and skills training for all our students; across vocational-, language- and cultural skills. Testing and selection of students. Workplacement period: Induction upon arrival in London. Relevant vocational workplacement for two full working weeks. Private housing of students to also gain general cultural competency.

Focus has been on entrepreneurship, science, language and inclusion. The vocational programmes have not been able to partake for two reasons; one, many vocational student study english but no other foreign language. Two; they have 15 weeks workplacement over three years and if the exchange has been during the work placemnet period these students have been excluded as they require 15 weeks work placemnet to be able to graduate. All students should be given the same opportunity but our school has not been able to find the right project for thie when it comes to our vocational students. Being able to offer them workplacement abroad would be fantastic.The students are 25 upper secondary students in their second and third year, studying either Health and Social Care or Retail and administration. Work experience is compulsory on these programmes over the three years.By working with ADC college our school could have an international profile that benefits allt the students. If our vocational students could have two weeks work experience in London they would be able to broaden their horizons, feel a sense of pride when it comes to their chosen career, see that work can be in Sweden or abroad and get a better understanding for cultural differences and likeness as wel as improve their language skills. Many of the criteria in our courses have an international angle and it is difficult as a teacher to bring these to life purely by theory.To date we have struggled to find a project that truly links in with  the vocational programmes we offer. An international exchanges in partnership with ADC college and their work placement programme would mean that every student at  Akademi B\u00e5stad gymnasium has a chance to experience life abroad, improve their language skills and open up their minds to the fact that we are all one large community and work does not necessarily have to be in your country of birth. They will  learn new skills  and grow on a personal level, helping to create responsible citizen, succesfull learners and confident individuals. Furthermore it would increase their understanding of the possibilities of what a EU membership  means to them as citizens and that the we are part of a large international community where diversity is key to success.On a local level it may help to increase student motivation on our two vocational programmes as a pass on work experience and national english test would be required to be able to partake in the programme.Our students would be able to apply for this experience, providing they have passed the above mentioned criteria.As a school we focus on entrepreneurship, internationalisation and inclusion. By offering this work placement in London all students at Akademi B\u00e5stad gymnasium would be given the same opportunity when it comes to partaking in an international exchange.

Graduates of these fields of study can continue their education at colleges or apply for professions such as accountants, tourist guides, personal assistants, bank clerks, salesmen, receptionists at tourist information center or at many levels of management in banks and enterprises. Besides these two fields, students can study in educational fields such as chef-pastry chef, cook, waiter, hairdresser, beautician, painter and bricklayer. After successfully completing the final examination they may continue at postgraduate courses in Entrepreneurship in Crafts and Services, which is completed by passing the school leaving examination. After graduation, the graduates are ready to be employed in the field of study, start their own business, or continue their studies at university. For these reasons, we consider it our priority to continuously improve the training of our students, bringing new modern trends, draw inspiration for the improvement of vocational education providing students with work placement abroad to gain knowledge and skills which will be further implemented in their work experience thesis. Our aim is to provide students with the education that will integrate specialized theoretical knowledge and participation in  work placement abroad to create a compact set of knowledge, skills and competencies that a graduate needs to enter the labour market in Slovakia and in other countries of the European Union and beyond.

Currently, our school is not involved in any international project that meet these requirements. For this reason, we consider it important to establish close partnerships with institutions abroad that can provide our students knowledge and useful information essential for labour market needs and develop their skills and abilities. Participating in work placements abroad, which will be the first in school history, we want to modernize our school, open it up to new forms of cooperation not only with educational institutions but also enterprises, so we will be able to prepare our students for the requirements and needs of European and world labour market.

The translation from work processes into \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d was completed within the first 10 European Job Profiles. The outcomes of international work placements have become more transparent and valid. Aventus has become a member of the following \u201cEuropean Job Profile\u201d networks: NETINVET (International Trade and Transport & Logistics), EUrFASHION (Fashion), EURO-AST (Management Assistant), EEE (green car technology), Shaping IT (IT System administrator, Application Developer and Media shaping), AEHT (Hotel and Tourism) M&C (European Marketing Assistant) and NOKAS (European Private Security Assistant). Aventus believes that for the next few years it is of great importance to cooperate with European partners by using ECVET instruments to create more clarity about the learning outcomes of international work placements and to get to a fitting assessment system for them. In order to do this Aventus is an active member of both formal and informal networks that are based on  \u201cEuropean Job Profiles\u201d. Aventus aims at exchanging expertise, experiences and best practices as to assessment and validation of professional tasks during international work placements of students, innovations and tested recipes to complicated educational issues together with its partners within these networks.  All project partners within this project offer many ideas for realising  learning goals for the individual students derived from the European Job profile concerned.

The effect for the entire partnership is that in determining a fitting international work placement the current curriculum, the job profiles and the connection to the European labour market will be reviewed. Both Aventus and the participating students will be stimulated to invest into flexibility of the work force, so that European citizenship also gets a wider European labour perspective. In designing the \u201cProfessional Orientation\u201d international work placements the main focus will be on determining how the connection between current curriculum and foreign language learning can be made.

The dual system of training is one of the ways to establish a link between education and economics. Its specific nature consists in the fact that the dual system offers theory and practice in real work environment. A leading state in the applying of this kind of training is Germany whose experience in this field has provoked strong interest on behalf of the Bulgarian educational institutions, too, to use the German experience when introducing the dual system of training in Bulgaria.The participants in the projects are three groups. The first one consists of 8 initiative trainers. One of the main goals of the project is to increase the qualification, the professional competences of the pedagogic specialists with regard to the teaching methodology of the subjects in vocational training that will be carried out in Bulgaria. The teachers who can apply to participate in the project are those who are responsible for working out strategies for the development of the vocational training, for the adoption and implementation of a new methodology of the subjects taught in vocational training, for the preparation of tests, methods / scales of assessment, more effective training methods for acquiring certificates (relevant to VHSE where Microsoft and Cisco academies function). They will learn about the different ways of developing new theoretical and practical tests in the field of vocational education. I.e. beneficiaries may be teachers responsible for specialties of modular training, teachers responsible for methodological associations in vocational training, teachers of vocational training, instructors in the school Cisco Academy, head teachers, assistants of the principal, the principal; with a certificate of competences in English. Teachers in English can also be included as the subject \u201cForeign language in the profession\u201d is taught in the school, but also the good foreign language competence increases opportunities for the students\u2019 implementation at the labour market.All described above can be carried out  with the German educational institutions and companies in Berlin, Germany, by exchange of good practices, innovative ideas and approaches. The collaboration between different sectors to exchange knowledge and  its practical application will lead to a smoother and quick transition of students from school to practice on a particular working place.After the implementation of the mobility of the teachers and the dissemination of the results, in 2017 a selection will be made of the second group of participants in the project \u201322 students who will be sent to a mobile practice to Dresden/ London in the field of computer technologies /web design and computer nets/. The mobility will be carried out in Berlin in the period 30.10.2016 \u2013 05.11.2016 for the group of the teachers and 06.08.2017-26.08.2017, Dresden/ London, for the students and 2 accompanying teachers.

Due to the fact that we have achieved  establishing  successful relations with our English partner in London and because of good experience from our previous projects, the same organization has been chosen as our partner organization. This organization has long-lasting experience with managing similar projects and is highly competent to arrange a wide range of professional training stations (restaurants, catering services, hotel services, organizations and services in tourism) and has experience with the introduction and realisation of the system ECVET  that will be implemented for the first time in our project and will lead to improving the quality of mobilities abroad.The second run leads to Slovakia, where we have an established partnership with the partner \u2013 Hotel and Congress Centre. The object of that project is to integrate those students to the project, who are professionally skillful and efficient but  have problems with foreign language communication and for that reason have been excluded from the projects so far. Principal objective of that project is bigger motivation in their professional field of education. In the case of this partner the system ECVET will be also implemented that will be beneficial for both the sending and the receiving organization and will help to improve not only the present but also future projects.Runs of mobilities of the students of mentioned specializations will be realised in two week trainings during the period of the project. Foreign training course will enable the students to meet new forms of work organization in real background and to motivate them for further education in both professional and language form.  Foreign training courses organized by our school lead to fulfillment of our School Educational Programme, which emphasizes as big interconnection with real training in the form of continuous and suspended trainings as possible. Selected students will participate in those trainings abroad. The main aim of the project is to improve quality of professional  preparation, to boost professional skills  thanks to the introduction of the system ECVET and thanks of it also to the possible introduction of units of learning outcomes during the vocational training going in school and by social partners, as well as during the practical vocational subjects. The project aims  is also to help in orientation on labour market and to strengthen participants\u00b4positions on labour market as well.

The two foreign languages taught in the \u201cVasile Lupu\u201d Pedagogical Highschool are English and French. The first foreign language is taught within two hours a week during the four years of highschool, the second language is given, beginning with the superior cycle, which is from the 11th and 12th grades, only one hour of study. The students who choose to take the certificate which allows them to teach the foreign language (they may choose the first and/or the second foreign language, or both of them) are allocated, according to the present curriculum, only half an hour. This means that during one half an hour a week of pedagogical practice we must achieve the teaching of the foreign language didactics (French or English) as well as the accomplishment of the foreign language practice stage. Therefore, it is obvious that the foreign languages teachers, methodologists of the pedagogical practice, make huge efforts to raise the students\u2019 language level within 2 hours or even one a week, same time which is also allocated for teaching the foreign language didactics.  This project was designed as a consequence of our needs, thouroughly analysed and researched, and it aims at completing students\u2019 education in the field of acquiring linguistic knowledge, abilities and competences in order to teach foreign languages at primary level, education which cannot be achieved under best circumstances currently, at the \u201cVasile Lupu\u201d Pedagogical Highschool, only because of the allocated time of teaching within the present curriculum (half an hour a week) for the pedagogical practice and the teaching of the foreign language methodology.    The objectives of this project are the following:1. To acquire specific methods and strategies of teaching-learning the foreign languages at primary level: teaching the vocabulary items, the phonetics, the grammar, the communicative structures. 2. To develop the competence of speaking and writing in the foreign language, of socially interaction with the pupils. 3. To develop the competence of writing the didactic project in the foreign language, according to the curriculum and the study level.  4. To develop the competence of intercultural communication in professional context. The target group is made up of 32 students of the \u201cVasile Lupu\u201d Pedagogical Highschool, pedagogical profile from 10th and 11th grades, registered at pedagogical practice of a foreign language, who are going to take the foreign language certificate for teaching at primary level, at the end of 12th grade.  The certificate of foreign language teaching at primary level is taken, each year, by students who choose either French or English. Thus, the project takes into account the students\u2019 training for the two languages: a first flow of 16 students for english and a second flow of students for taking the french certificate. In order to accomplish these objectives, the students will perform the following activities:1. Acquiring the foreign language methods and strategies of teaching at primary level: teaching the phonetics, the vocabulary, the communicative structures by solving the work tasks during the training. 2. Taking actively part to workshops, having as themes methods and strategies of teaching foreign  languages at primary level.  3. Noticing and writing down in their training notebook the demands expressed by the teacher using the foreign language, the social interaction phrases in the classroom, during  watching the lessons at primary level.  4. Writing the didactic projects for different activities using the foreign language. 5. Performing a lesson sequence using the foreign language.  The students will speak and write in the foreign language under authentic learning contexts. During the first week, they will acquire foreign language teaching methods and strategies in the group workshops, they will have the opportunity to practice their knowledge by making didactic projects and solving practical tasks.  During the second week, they will have a practical stage at primary schools, where they will watch the foreign language activities, they will make up didactic projects and they will perform sequences of foreign language activities, they will interact with the pupils, the tutor and the mentor using the foreign language.

The required increase will be further achieved by using the ECVET system as a tool of defining outcomes of these placements, whose evaluation will be provided by our partner abroad on the basis of mutual trust. Defining the Learning Outcomes and evaluating whether they were specific enough will result in even closer interconnection of education and training. These Learning Outcomes will be used for further placements in Czech companies as well as abroad as they allow increasing transparency of placements and internships for schools, students and companies. 27 students of tertiary vocational will be involved in this project. 25 students will do their placement in London, in two cycles, and similarly 2 students in Greece, in two cycles. The aim of these placements is to cooperate with foreign colleagues apply and test their practical knowledge and gain and widen further abilities and competencies.  The criteria for selection of students will be firstly their specialized subjects and language study results. The students\u2019 social background and behaviour will also be taken into consideration as the student will represent the school and the Czech Republic abroad. Both destination countries of our placements are as well as the Czech Republic members of the European Union; however there exist a variety of differences in working conditions, habits or historical development. During the placement, students will understand how important it is to respect rules of the living in multicultural society, deepen their social abilities, and test their adaptability in different social and cultural environments. Last, but not least their language competencies will improve mainly in the area of specialized terminology. International internship will increase employability of these students in the Czech and foreign labour market.The project is scheduled for two years. Before each placement, students will undergo cultural and language preparation, language testing and Learning Outcomes will be prepared for them. After students\u2019 return, language testing will be repeated and outcomes will be compared with the initial ones, Learning Outcomes will be evaluated and adapted in accordance with this evaluation. During each placement one school teacher will provide a monitoring visit.

Developing competencies in the area of implementing ECVET for improving quality and evaluating outcomes of work placements is an extremely important issue for the school. Defining Learning Outcomes before the placement allows transparent and clear evaluation of the placements. ECVET allows lifting administrative burden of work placement providers, which, we presume, will be highly welcome by these companies.

Undoubtedly, the practice which one acquires in London may give our students a chance to develop the aforementioned ideas, concepts and abilities.The participants will go through the project in the new social and cultural conditions under the watchful eye of the Polish supervisors and mentors from the ADC College. The students will get to know the particulars and details of the how a business, a firm, or any other form the private establishment is functional, operational and run in the UK. The students\u2019 progress and achievements will be evaluated according to the gathered documentation in their portfolios, and so the participants will be credited with the Europass Mobility certificate. Pupils are given a chance to boost their own self-esteem and to discover new professional development paths. They may possibly take advantage of the newly-gained knowledge domestically or internationally.  Having returned to Poland, the students will take part in the dissemination of the project results at the conferences, debates and meetings. For many of them it also poses a great challenge and new experience that will allow them to believe in themselves and their own capabilities.Accomplishment of the apprenticeship will strengthen and bolster the students\u2019 chances on the local domestic market, will make it possible for teachers to improve their qualifications at the same time, and will inevitably and positively reinforce the image of the school as the establishment which takes on new challenges in order to better the quality of education and in order to have an incentive to collaborate more closely with other schools, employers and local authorities.", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PL01-KA102-023971_1"], ["5AD", "Efficient Travels\u2013 Efektywne Podr\u00f3\u017ce - tworzenie europejskich \u015bcie\u017cek kariery.", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 126842.0, "The project \u201eEfficient Travels \u2013 Creating European Paths of Career\u201d is addressed to the students and teaching staff at Zesp\u00f3\u0142 Szk\u00f3\u0142 Technicznych i Licealnych in Czechowice-Dziedzice (Poland).

This is a new problem that arises from strong social fears, stereotypes that need to be combat. We are witnessing events of violence involving migrants and refugees that can evolve into more dangerous phenomenon. We held in our international partnership skype meetings with ngo leaders and their youth workers who face the problems arising from intercultural clashes in their life and work. The problem has been evident enough even without our social survey which we have delivered online. Our survey among 200 youths online in each state showed very little social acceptance of diversity and a large social tolerance for racist behaviours. As FRA stated (based on their last annual report) \u201cBarriers persist in implementing effectively EU legislation that prohibits and penalises manifestations of racism, xenophobia and ethnic discrimination. The sixth year of the economic crisis and turbulent developments in the Middle East and North Africa are raising concerns and considerations for migration and integration policies in the EU. Meanwhile, Europeans are increasingly responsive to parties and movements with xenophobic, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim agendas. Migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and members of ethnic and religious minorities suffer manifestations of violent hatred and continuous discrimination in many areas of social life. Moreover, the increasing use of internet and social media proliferates some political rhetoric and racist hate speech.\u201d Across the EU, members of minority ethnic groups, including migrants and refugees faced discrimination in access to key areas of social life. The internet remains a critical tool for spreading hate speech. As FRA concluded Member States are encouraged to adopt and implement policies and measures aiming at combating racism and hate crime.In order to face that problem we will provide international training event for youth workers from the partner countries. We will introduce new methods efficient in learning multiculturalism. Moreover,experienced trainers from each partner organization will share their skills in the field of multiculturalism with all other participants. We will also work on a common final publication containing the combined training methods. The youth workers have to be better prepared to address European youths, to combat social fears, face problems related to xenophobia, racism and stereotypes among youth learners. The project aims to promote intercultural dialogue and strengthen knowledge and acceptance of diversity in society. We support youth workers in developing and sharing effective methods in reaching out to marginalised young people, refugees, asylum seekers and migrants, and in preventing racism and intolerance among youth;We aim to: -support professional development of youth workers, trainers to cope better with intercultural problems, racism, xenophobia, social fears of youth learners, particularly based on the recent immigration crisis and refugees in EU.-raise youth workers' awareness, responsiveness and understanding of other cultures and countries (so they can better transfer that to the youths), enhance English language capacities of non-English participants, offer them the opportunity to build networks of international contacts, develop a sense of European citizenship and identity;-increase the capacities, attractiveness and international dimension of participating organizations so that they are able to offer activities and programmes that better respond to the current needs of the youths;By combining the set of workshops delivered by experienced in this field trainers from the partner organizations which proved high efficiency in the partner organizations, we are going to provide a high quality outcome \u2013 a combined training methodology that will be published after the event and used in the project dissemination.In this way trainers from partner organizations will lead certain training sessions, share their intercultural experience. It will increase competences of our youth workers, share mutual experience, establish a international network of youth workers involved. It will also bring further benefits for the youth workers involved: raise their ability to work in international environment, enhance English skills, allow to establish professional relationships across EU, gain basic experience in providing training sessions for international learner.The learning results of the participants will be gained thanks to their participation in the training event in Poland, Zakopane on 20-25 March 2017.

We continue our mobility projects for our students while at the same we accept students and apprentices from our international partners. We aim to increase our efforts to send more teachers abroad in order to develop their international competence and stimulate international cooperation. Concerning A1, we have planned mobility activities for second year students in vocational programs. They are involved in a subject called Prosjekt til fordypning (or In-depth Project, shortened PFO), where they choose competence aims from the third year curriculum in their subjects (curriculum for apprentices, two years in a business). The subject PFO is preferably carried out through training in a business. The competence aims in the subject are personalized and students, in cooperation with their teacher and business representative, identify which aims can realistically be reached through the replacement period. Most curriculums include aims that involve international relations. When we carry out parts of the subject PFO during a stay abroad with training in a foreign business or institution, the students will not only reach the curricular aims, they will also gain much additional competence and experience. The duration of the student mobility is 2 weeks and we wish to use two accompanying persons who share the monitoring task each taking one week, for each group we send.The main activity is to carry out the subject PFO, and thus improve their professional competence, improve their language skills and experience a different work culture. They will improve their social skills and get to know themselves and their fellow students in a different setting. The cultural differences both in work life and leisure between Norway and the country they travel to will help the participants expand their understanding of their own country and people from other parts of the world. There are many subject related features of activities planned for employees who will take part in the project: - Visits in schools, organisations and businesses.- Activities to gain insight in professional education in other countries.- Expansion of our international network. - Gain insight in new working methods, materials and equipment. - Develop the professional skills of participants.- Familiarize with new trends in Europe and promote innovative thinking.- Develop linguistic skills and gain knowledge about foreign cultures. In this application, we are mainly focusing on teachers from the two vocational fields with the longest experience of student mobility, which are Health and Upbringing, and Construction. At the same time we are also exploring the possibilities of sending 2 teachers form both Sales, Service and Safety as well as Technique and Industrial Production.  Health and Upbringing are currently developing a cooperation with a Danish partner (SOSU Sj\u00e6lland) and their network, where teachers and employees from institutions within the fields of health and care will visit each other at their schools and institutions to learn from each other. The project is called Eurocom Smart and the following countries take part: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Germany, Latvia and the Netherlands. Our Construction section have a fruitful cooperation with several partners in Germany. These partners are willing to arrange courses for our teachers. We have expressed our interest in studying the German school system, the cooperation between schools and businesses, and how the schools help students in danger of quitting school. We also want to visit businesses who are advanced in the field of building low energy houses. Houses that consume little energy or actually produce energy. This is highly relevant for us, and could mean a good opportunity for developing teacher competence considering that we teach Construction Techniques and Climate, Energy and Environment during our second year. In the county of Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag, the upper secondary schools (videreg\u00e5ende) not only cooperate closely together, but also with the county administration (fylkeskommunen) and the administrative body for apprenticeships (oppl\u00e6ringskontorene).

Supporting young people entering the labour market has to include the imparting of intercultural competence. Being able to communicate serenely with international partners, is now no longer a unique selling point, but has already become a basic requirement for survival in the modern labour market in the relevant line of business.\r\nEvery student of the media and IT professions being trained at Martin-Segitz-Schule can apply for the project.

These will be very valuable for their professional future either with international guests or customers in Germany or abroad.\r\nOther aims for all groups are, of course, the improvement of the communicative competence and the acquisition of key skills, such as social and intercultural competence.\r\nThe students create an illustrated blog in the form of a travel diary about their stay, their personal and professional experiences.", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003686_1"], ["5AD", "Qualifying for Europe 2", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 40853.0, "Upper Franconia is a structurally weak region.

Since there are often Anglo-Saxon rules by which they communicate on an international level, we consider it as compulsory to provide our trainees with a training program in the UK in order to prepare them for the demands of the international economic environment. Unfortunately, it is no longer a matter of course to obtain a work contract with the respective training company after completing traineeship. Consequently, trainees must more than ever be willing to respond flexibly to changing and international labour market structures.

The LES selects the applications received according to the following criteria: age of majority , language skills B1 of the CEFR, motivation throughout the project duration (possibly in consultation with form masters), willingness to adapt to different circumstances. At an early stage of preparation the participants create their individual CVs and motivation letters. On this basis, the ADC College can choose work placements according to the participants' individual sectors and skills (e.g. real estate trainees were placed at English real estate agencies and personnel services merchants in the personnel departments of large hotels).

Furthermore, participants of this project increase their mobility, flexibility and self-confidence. Improving foreign language skills in everyday life and in their working environment and further development of intercultural awareness are very essential issues within this project.\r\n\r\nParticipants:\r\nThe participants study vocational preparation courses or study towards a work-based qualification to gain job-specific skills. In general, they are in vocational education training so that participants would use their knowledge and skills in their placements of the receiving institutions, organisations or enterprises. The new working environment arouses interest and enhances their professional skills. Thus, this work experience abroad enables them to put their skills and experience acquired into practice.\r\nApproximately 30 students and apprentices per year have been delegated to carry out their work experience abroad. Within this project \u201cMake a move\u201d, dbb has planned to send 100 participants to various countries over a period of 24 months.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nThroughout the entire project, the dbb project team advises and monitors the participants from the initial step to the follow-up phase. This includes their application, first contact to businesses abroad, travel arrangements and work experience assignments including the evaluation of activities and the learning outcomes of participants. The project team gives information on procedures for grant application and guides them in handing in all required documents. Before the student mobility, the \u201cLearning Agreement\u201d is set up to include all the learning outcomes the participant is expected to acquire during the work experience abroad. Dbb also offers intercultural preparation courses to the participants to teach cross-cultural awareness and competences. After the mobility the participants inform dbb students or apprentices about their experiences abroad. On the open day at dbb they give a presentation to interested learners and parents in the format of a PowerPoint presentation. \r\n\r\nLearning outcomes and long-term benefits:\r\nThe participants improve their level of key competences and skills, with particular regard to their relevance for the labour market both nationally and internationally. In general, they enhance their opportunities of employability and improve their career prospects. Staying and working abroad gives the participants a broader understanding of cultural diversity. Moreover, it improves foreign language competences in everyday life as well as in their working environment. In the long run, this mobility project is expected to have an impact on the way of operating towards our students and apprentices by offering for example more attractive programmes at dbb in line with their needs and expectations. Dbb is ready to integrate good practices and new methods. Furthermore, the project team expects to attract new resources for mobility opportunities.

A general improvement of the English language, knowledge of professional terms in English and a confidence in speaking the language.\r\n4.

We want to give students an interest and motivation to travel and work in other countries. Our students have little experience in travelling.\r\n\r\nWe will after the internship carry out an evaluation with the students about the positive as well as the negative aspects of the internship.

The inhabitants are predominantly first- and second generation immigrants. \r\n\r\nThe school has a clear focus on language development, internationalization, and digitalization. However, the Restaurant Management and Food Programme has during a longer period been stigmatized principally because of political decisions which have resulted in a receding student base. This situation is further applicable to all vocational programs in Sweden, which throughout a period of 5 years have lost about 25% of their number of students. \r\n\r\nThis is a trend that we wish to change, amongst other things by participating in this project. \r\nFurthermore, as of this school year we have an increase in the amount of students in our program as well as the entire school, something we are very happy about. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project is to give our students the opportunity to meet new cultures, create professional networks, and further develop their linguistic skills. We want the students to get an understanding for the many possibilities and benefits of a globalized labor market, a phenomenon which is significant specifically for the restaurant industry. In general, we moreover want to strengthen the status and the attractiveness of the Restaurant Management and Food Programme and the vocational programs.  \r\n\r\nOur ambition is to send about 6 students during a time period of 4 weeks. The students are, in many cases, of non-European decent and come from a socioeconomic background with limited income.  \r\n\r\nOur counterpart in this project is the ADC College in London, an education center that focuses on language- and vocational programs. They have a well-functioning organization apart from high qualitative internships in restaurants located around London, something we would like to have access to. \r\n\r\nWe at Tumba high school are convinced that the students we send there are going to receive a deeper knowledge of restaurant specific subjects and areas, such as: new cooking methods, team structures, logistics, cleaning routines, different kinds of raw products, organizational structures, tool use, service and an industrial and technical language. Overall the students will develop their linguistic skills, build relationships and gain an insight into the English family- and social structures. The aim is also to increase the students\u2019 independence and responsibility and with that their ability to fend for themselves in foreign environments.\r\n\r\nIn practical terms, Tumba high school will be responsible for booking the flights and having continuous contact with the ADC College.

The participants are senior students of Care, Sales and Representation, \r\nHealth and well being Sciences as well as Physical Education and Sports. They deliberately opt for an internship abroad. The internship is a regular and mandatory part of the training. Each BSO student trainee has already had one or more internships in their own country / region, so they are already experienced. 50% of the BSO students have a socially disadvantaged background. They don\u2019t have / get the opportunities and resources to get an international experience at home.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\nThe students do their internship in various institutions in X. This way, students can experience that \u2018care\u2019 in another country / culture does not immediately receive the same interpretation as they are used to from their previous work experience in their own country. They learn to look critically at the way in which services are provided in their own environment and compare it to this foreign experience.  In their spare time the pupils learn how to deal with other cultures and they discover new surroundings.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nStudents gain new knowledge and skills through work in a context that is not available in Belgium. The pupils learn to deal with different lifestyles, values and standards and the ability to work and learn in an unfamiliar environment with unknown habits is strongly developed. This allows them to develop their personal skills. In their spare time, they learn to deal with different values and cultures. Through this, they informally learn to become more independent, self-confident and discover their limits.\r\n\r\nDissemination\r\nStudents and teachers share their experiences with fellow students and new trainees by giving presentations on their experiences abroad.

Their professional skills and work experiences are greatly broadened by this other context. They get a different perspective on Europe and are more convinced of the benefits of European cooperation.\r\nFor Campus Russelberg, this exchange of knowledge and experiences will enrich our education.

Out of this group we will select 16 students who have the right motivation for a two-week foreign internship adventure in a company in London, under the guidance of the responsible tutors, and an English teacher, and in cooperation with an external partner, namely ADC College, who has the know-how, the network and the experience, which we do not have to organise this kind of project.\r\nDepending on the department followed in our school, the students will be set to work into the following sectors: Administration / Child Care / Health & Social Care / IT & Accountancy.\r\nMost of our students live in the outskirts of Bruges, and have a rural background. Part of them also come from families with a low standard of living, low income. Due to their home situation, their often rather mediocre school results, by the fact that, as technical and vocational students, they often feel inferior to their brothers, sisters, friends from a general school, they have low self-esteem, low motivation to study and a lack of confidence. Often they make no or a wrong study choice after their last secondary school year, and they end up on the labour market with fewer opportunities. Our students are generally not very internationally mobile, and have not been in contact with multiculturalism. When it comes to their skills in English, they think too much that they are not competent, they are afraid to use the English they have learned in school.\r\nThe departments involved in the project are technical and vocational, we dare to say that they don\u2019t get the respect they deserve, both with parents and young people. We are looking for ways to popularise those departments.\r\nAt school we are working on internationalisation through KA2 projects, we are convinced that there are opportunities and the will to bring a breath of fresh air in our internship story.\r\n\r\nWe think that an internship abroad can provide a solution to the concerns mentioned above. It will improve the skills in English among our students, and introduce them to a multicultural (working) environment. It will also provide our students a broader perspective on the European labour market. It will give them new work experiences and professional learning gains. They will study more and be more aware of their choices, they will also be more motivated and able to make better study choices. They will also have more job opportunities.\r\nOur students will also acquire social skills that we cannot always realise at our school or at local internship companies: self-confidence, self-esteem, stress resistance, willingness to cooperate (on an international level), openness to other cultures and unknown work environments, less fear of the unknown ...\r\nThe internship is also an essential part for the result of the integrated test of the students, and thus their final report of their last secondary schoolyear.\r\nThe internship project will also provide new professional and other skills to the teachers involved in the project, we think that it will result in an implementation and teaching of the subjects much more closer and related to the daily reality, so that \u2018being a student\u2019 in these fields of study will be more attractive. We also hope that the project will have a positive impact on the charisma of these subjects for parents and new students.\r\nThe internship will take place in companies / institutions in London, students stay with host families. The monitoring and evaluation is done on a regular basis by their own teachers, by a coach from the company itself, and by a personal coach from ADC College assigned to each student.\r\nThe internship means  a new form of internationalisation for our school, and we hope that this could be a first step that will be repeated in the future, to involve other colleagues into internationalisation so that the succession is assured, and to encourage more teachers to react positively to the large Erasmus + professionalisation courses.", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-BE02-KA102-034561_1"], ["5AD", "Animatie en Hospitality stage", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 49134.0, "The \u2018Animation and Hospitality Internship\u2019 programme, organised by the Department of Tourism and Recreation and Hospitality of Hotelschool Go!TA3 Hasselt, focuses on the realisation of a foreign internship for students of the Se-n-Se year (post secondary school) Tourism and Recreation and  final-year students Hospitality.  To prepare this internship as well as possible, we organise a number of domestic and foreign study tours, workshops and guest lectures and multilingual practice exercises. Both courses are finalised by a foreign work placement in which the students\u2019 acquired knowledge, skills and attitudes are to be applied.   \r\n\r\nThe internships for students of Tourism and Recreation are organised in collaboration with the international PALLADIUM HOTEL GROUP because of the well-developed contacts with the local management of this hotel chain and take place exclusively on the island of Ibiza.

Atheneum (general and vet-school) Merksem in an environment that has the typical characteristics of a contemporary European metropolitan context. In the first place we see an increasing number of children, growing up in what can be called not the ideal circumstances. Besides the augmentation of diversity raises a number of new challenges. \r\nThese changes compel society and schools to search for solutions in a proactive way. Let us keep in mind that there are also positive trends: students are becoming more outspoken and work easily with ICT as \u2018digital natives\u2019. Atheneum Merksem wants to use this modified context as an opportunity. After much thought a new vision, the MaX-method, originated in our school. A vision supported by all the stakeholders. In the name of the method is a humorous reference to our school mascot Max, but the name especially refers to something that is good: our school is 'the max'. Max symbolises:\r\n\r\nProviding contemporary effective education with a maximal competence increasing learning effect. In this way we would like to enlarge the general education levels of youngsters and raise their chances on the labour market. \r\nCreating equal chances for everybody. This with the necessary attention and care for every individual student should enhance social inclusion. Social inequality and diversity cannot be an obstruction for development opportunities of our youngsters.  \r\nUsing internationalisation as a lever to develop an open mind and encourage intercultural interests and relationships.\r\nImprove language development through frequent use of foreign languages. \r\nStimulate the implementation of ICT.\r\nOffer a better preparation for future choice of study and profession.\r\nIncreasing the self-reliance of the learners.\r\nContributing to the professionalisation of teachers.\r\n\r\nThese are the values that determine the concept of our school: at the end of secondary school deliver \u201cautonomous learners\u201d. Learners who can take charge of their own learning process in higher education and in their future working life take control and take matters into their own hands. We strongly believe in leverage of education. We don\u2019t want to resign ourselves to mechanisms that perpetuate or even boost social inequality. With our educational project we take the assignment to create the possibility for our students to climb the social ladder very seriously.\r\nIn this aspiration after stronger education, an international dimension cannot be omitted. The long-term goals of the European Union, as they were recorded in the Europe 2020 strategy, match perfectly with the previously mentioned values from our school project. The Erasmus+ programme can give a concrete completion to these goals. \r\nGO! Atheneum Merksem intentionally chooses to start with a small-scale project in KA 1 \u2013 individual learning mobility and to do this in cooperation with an experienced partner organisation (ADC College). Ten students from the sixth form of the study fields STS (Social Technical Sciences) and FWS (Family and Welfare Sciences) will be selected to participate in a foreign work placement in organisations that work in the sectors health and childcare during a period of ten days. The target group consists out of about 40 students, of which the majority accords with the risk group. As a theme for this project we have chosen \u201c Working with and for people in an international context\u201d. This theme fits perfectly in the vision of the cluster subject pedagogy/ nutrition/ care/ domestic economy, where the emphasis lies on the study of and the association with people as complete human beings. Observation activities and practical lessons on location (\u2018workplacelearning\u2019) are being warmly recommended by the schools inspectorate as a basis of an introduction to the different occupational fields of the social sector. At the same time a project of individual learning mobility gives a perfect completion to the removal of the compulsory work placements in STS and FWS and the introduction of EMPEes (Extra Muros for Practice related Education). \r\nNotwithstanding the fact that we have chosen to keep this project on a small-scale basis, we are opting for a durable and sustainable embedment of the project in the school. A team of educational specialists has been appointed to carry out this project. 'Team International' consists of a coordinator, two work placement coaches, a language coach and two ICT coaches. They will, during two consecutive years be responsible for the preparation, implementation and dissemination of the complete project. Not only the necessary guidance and coaching of the selected learners is being provided, but also considerable attention is being payed to the communication with all the stakeholders to enlarge the involvement of a \u201chome front\u201d which is as broad based as possible.

These studies are offered at vocational, technical and general level. \r\n\r\nNext to ICT-integration in subjects, powerful learning environments, activating working methods and school assignments focusing on developing competences, we highly value work placements. We want our pupils to gain as much realistic work experience as possible. In this respect, we also think international experience is very important. Therefore we would like to offer our pupils in their final year the opportunity to do their work placement abroad. During the last few years we had an exchange programme with Sweden (Vasteras) where some ten of our pupils could have their work training. \r\n\r\nDuring the next two schoolyears we would like to offer 20 of our final year pupils the opportunity to do a work placement in London. This work placement will take place in June during 3 weeks. The international work placement is the cherry on the cake of the educational career of these pupils. The work placement will consist of two parts. During the first week pupils will follow a course in business English at the ADC College and they will explore London. After that they will do a work placement of two weeks in a sector related to their studies. The ADC College is our intermediary. The College will provide for host families, will search for suitable business partners and it offers our pupils the English course. \r\n\r\nThe pupils participating in our project are pupils of the technical study Accountancy- Informatics, Trade, Information Technology, Tourism or Physical education and Sports. Since our school is located in the centre city Turnhout and not all of our pupils have the same capital strength, we would especially like to offer young people of less well-off families the opportunity to gain international experience. When it would come to a selection of pupils, motivation will be our priority but two spots are reserved for underpriviliged youngsters. \r\n\r\nWith this project we would like to accomplish various aims. First, we will give pupils the opportunity to further develop as individuals (gain more language capacities, develop social skills, extend networks, gain international experience, explore new cultures, etc.). Secondly, via this international project we would like to strengthen the quality care in our school. As third we would like to make the school work in an even more innovative way by implementing the knowledge gained in this project and in London. Last we would like to strengthen our image of an undertaking and up-to-date school and spread the European thought of openness and mutual bonding. \r\n\r\nWe will prepare our pupils thoroughly to this three-weekly internship. Starting at the beginning of the schoolyear where we will introduce our project to interested pupils and their parents. A selection of pupils will be made (if necessary) on basis of their motivational letter and application talk. Then a number of teachers will start working with the pupils in the project: we will organise a kick-off at the Hoge Rielen where we will explain the outset of the whole project, where pupils and teacher/coaches will get to know each other and where we will make a start in preparing the EuroPass documents. \r\n\r\nThroughout the schoolyear the project will be focused upon and will be put in the spotlight. Schoolboard, teachers, pupils, parents and other people interested in the project will be kept up-to-date of all steps throughout the project. This we will do by using the schoolplatform Smartschool, a monthly newsletter, the regional press and social media. During their stay in London pupils will brief their coaches and keep the homefront up-to-date via a blog they maintain every day. After the internship they (pupils and teachers/coaches) give feedback via the above mentioned media. In September of the following schoolyear, they will present the project to fellow (newly final year) pupils to get their enthusiasm for the project going. \r\n\r\nLast but not least we want to evaluate the project thoroughly. On the one hand we assess the participating pupils and coaches, on the other hand we evaluate the project itself so that we can adjust if necessary in the future. \r\nPupils will be evaluated using certain criteria which are mentioned in their work placement report. Included are of course the competences pupils should (further) develop throughout their internship. We will evaluate the pupils both on process as well as on product. The global project will be assessed by a number of parameters; whether or not the predetermined aims have been achieved, the process of the preparatory phase, the well-being of the pupils, the functioning of the intermediary of ADC College etc. \r\n\r\nWe are very much looking forward to the start-up of our project in September 2017!", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-BE02-KA102-034622_1"], ["5AD", "London, here we come!", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 28780.0, "\"London, here we come!\" is a unique opportunity for our students to gain professional experience in London. 2 weeks they will be living with their English host family and speaking English at home and at work.

The students who accomplish this specialization year, get their diploma secondary education. These professional educations prepare the students to work in elderly-, child- and home care. The accent lies on practical work where students, together with their colleagues, learn how to give and provied the care takers the best care they need. In this education the students learn both how a child develops and the process of getting older. Together with their colleagues the students get trained to observe, report and organize recreative activities for caretakers and preparing child food in combination with diet food. They learn about first aid, healthy food and they learn their way into social legislation, health right and specific legislation for the care department. During several internships the students get to know their future worksituation and they get in touch with the work as a caretaker in a kindergarden, aslo as a caremother, aslo as a childcarer in a nursery school and with the elderly people in a care- and living center. Nevertheless we notice that a lot of our students come form an underprivileged environment. They do not have a lot of confidence and have a narrow future vision. We, as a school, would love to see that changed. The most effective way to do so is to place our students in a whole other world and confront them with the reality. With this Erasmus+ project we would like to give our students the chance to follow an internship in the care department in a capital city such as London. This will, without any doubt, have an enormous impact on the participants because for them it is not only a foreign country but also a foreign language. On many levels they will endure and realise that they are capable of so much more than they think. The extensive independance they will have to show, it will give them a boost of self-development. The students will expand their horizon and they will realize that their is so much more in life. Obviously the job aimed competences will be offered to the students during their internship and for them this will increase their working method, legislation, organization and their contact with the caretaker to compare between the two different countries. Every 3rd grade student, from the Atheneum Diksmuide and the Atheneum Newport within the department \"caring\" can apply as a candidate to participate in this Erasmus+ project. Only 10 students get the opportunity to live and work for 2 weeks in London. During the internship the students will take on a care task in a kindergarden or an elderly home.

Both these documents are aimed at the learning plan goals with written criteria. After their participation, the students receive a validated Europass from ADC college.

Nevertheless, another goal was not to exclude any student from the chance to apply for a spot on the project \u2018. Finally, 15 students were chosen to participate in the actual work placements in both London and Madrid.\r\n\r\nThese 19 students attend a seminar in the HAK/HAS Amstetten, which is designed to prepare them for both the new living and working environments in London and Madrid. The partner organizations are highly involved in planning and organizing the seminar as well as other necessary tasks. Learning agreements between the participants and the partner companies guarantee a strong focus on developing professional skills in the areas of business administration and information technology throughout the project. As soon as the participants arrive in either London or Madrid, every student will have both double monitoring and also a personal tutor throughout the work placement period. At the end of the program a \ufb01nal report will be produced and a feedback session will guarantee sustainable development among all involved students and organizations.\r\n\r\nThe HAK/HAS Amstetten wants to make sure that this project has a sustainable impact on all participants, institutions and partner organizations as well as target groups of the project. The exchange of good-practice in European level among all participants and he promotion of the results within the school, close partner organizations and the media will make sure the project has a lasting impact on both the participants and all the involved institutions.

Preparation of the ULOs will prove valuable experience for our teachers and we will put their newly acquired competencies to use in the process of the subsequent application in local companies. We have already been discussing the utilization of the ULOs in the local setting not only with the organizations where our students do their vocational training, but also with representatives of businesses, who know the exact needs of their field and the individual qualifications as specified by the National System of Qualifications; therefore, they are best suited to evaluate the ULOs from the viewpoint of the real-life needs.\r\nAll this newly acquired experience will be reflected in the reaccreditation of the tertiary vocational school educational programmes, updating the secondary school educational programmes, and of course in the overall enrichment and improvement of instruction. The foreign partners will get to know the qualities of our students and the Czech vocational education and training as a whole.

However, employers require graduates who are prepared in both professional and personal terms to handle tasks and problems in the workplace. The subject Professional experience provides a link between the world of education and work. However, we have noticed that work experience is often only formal and does not bring expected results. Previously we implemented a project of foreign professional experience through mobility, entitled \u201cPraxis abroad improves the school quality\". The impact of the project among all of the parties involved, convinced us that it is indeed the correct way to increase the quality of professional practice and hence also of the professional formation and competencies of the students in order to prepare the graduates for both national and international labor market, and at the same time to increase the prestige of the school. We have therefore decided to continue the implementation of such projects with the new title \"My Mobility - Experience, Expertise, Quality.\"\r\nThe involvement of such students in international projects and their personal experience with working abroad can break stereotypes and broaden the horizons in the area of job diversity within their expertise and rid them of their fears and worries of mobility.\r\n\r\nThe practice will be held in 2 two-weekterms - September 2017 and September 2018 for students of the 4th year in London, Havirov, and Katowice. \u00a0 Students with special educational needs may also apply for the foreign experience of mobility, thereby improving their \u00a0chance to succeed in the labor market and gain an advantage over other candidates.The main objectives of the planned project are to improve vocational education with an emphasis on the compulsory subject of professional experience and other economic subjects in our school, to prepare students for the labor market, to ensure their readiness for lifelong education and thereby improve the indicator of unemployment of our school graduates.\u00a0\r\n\r\nStudents participating in foreign mobility aim to improve their hard and soft skills which are needed in the modern work environment, particularly: improving the ability to work independently, problem solving, enhancing presentation skills, developing verbal and language skills, and improving self-knowledge and self-reflection.The aim of the teaching staff is to gain direct experience with the foreign labor market and with the current requirements of graduates, to expand conceptual and organizational competencies and to improve the management skills of the project team.\r\n\r\nOther objectives of the project are to design and verify the ECVET methodology in the process of preparation, implementation, and evaluation of mobility, to ensure certification through the Europass system, to improve the organization of teaching and learning and integrate new knowledge into the \u0160kVP \u201cgraduate profile\u201d, to implementthe skills and practices acquired by teachersinto the following subjects: professional experience, accounting, business economics, administration and correspondence, English language, and the labor market.\r\n\r\nWe consider the implementation of professional practice in enterprises and organizations in London, Havirov, and Katowice to be the goals concerning students and teachers. Students will have the opportunity to communicate in the real businness environment in person and in written form with business partners and with employees of the company, they will also archive accounting documents, process payrolls, check and register the contracts, carry out business activities and small projects in the area of marketing, update databases, and more. The students will acquire completely new skills and knowledge within the field of modern office equipment and software use.\r\n\u00a0\r\nProject management will carry out project tasks according to the established plan.

Our pupils, who in the future are planning to work as  tax and financial advisors, accountants and entrepreneurs will be given an opportunity to get acquainted with the modern and contemporary methods of managing a business. Pupils who have chosen marketing field in which they would specialize will have a chance to transfer the good practices, which they will experience in the country where advertising companies have been operating for ages, onto the domestic Polish marketplace where the novice promotional-campaign firms have just begun to develop and operate on a large scale.  \r\n   Despite the fact that our school is situated in Warsaw, a great number of students come from the poverty-stricken families, and so the apprenticeship will be the only opportunity for them to find themselves in the international environment in order to have contact with other cultures and with people from different backgrounds, having different concepts, visions and attitudes.  \r\n  The primary goal of our project is the improvement of professional, linguistic, social and interpersonal skills of our students who would undergo the internship in a British company by developing the cooperation with the professionals representing other cultures, languages and work ethics. In the contemporary world in order to become competitive on the market, a candidate, apart from being a professional in his trade, must have knowledge of a foreign language in the professional manner and become used to the cosmopolitan work environment.

Its approximately 200 students, some of whom are currently employed and some in need of work, are of various ages. The fact that they have decided to attend this type of vocational school clearly indicates that they understand the necessity to improve both their formal qualifications and their practical knowledge. They realize that limited qualifications in the present financial circumstances and with increasing competition can be an obstacle in their effort to secure a work position and only further training regardless of their age can provide an advantage.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the project\r\nFor the reasons mentioned above, the proposed mobility project under the title \u2018Entrepreneurship in a Digital Era\u2019 aims at acquainting the students with educational systems and work environments that reflect the latest technological developments both in industry and services using digital and automation systems. Close contact of the trainees with enterprises that use contemporary systems and facilities will provide an opportunity for their familiarization with today\u2019s professional demands. We correlate entrepreneurship in a digital era to an increase of employability and the financial growth of the individual.\r\n\r\nProfile of participants\r\nMore specifically, the trainees who are interested in participating in this mobility project belong to a wide range of ages from 17 to 55 years old. Only a small percentage of them have a full-time job or a job related to their studies. Most of them are unemployed or under-employed in jobs completely irrelevant to their chosen field of study. The majority are people with a low income. The fact that they have chosen to attend an evening school suggests their need to work for a living along with attending school. In general, their working experience is limited and their assertiveness to seek professions with a high level of social acceptance or economic gain is quite low. They wish to attend specialized courses in their selected field of study and approach innovative practices in order to improve their skills, which can be catalytic in starting or upgrading a profession.\r\n\r\nNumber of participants \u2013 description of activities \u2013 methodology\r\nWe intend to involve 48 students in the proposed mobility project. The number of participants will be obtained from four different fields of study. They will be escorted by 8 teachers each with the respective specialty. The project will be realized in four different flows, in three separate countries. These countries have been selected in relation to their expertise in the field of study of the trainees. The teachers who will participate, after considering their own experience, the current literature and extensive internet research, have concluded that the students should be placed as follows for practical training, technical visits and cultural activities:\r\n1st flow: 12 students from the field of Economics Administration will visit Spain, a country well-known for its tourist facilities. The participants will undertake a training placement in selected enterprises that offer high quality tourist services.\r\n2nd flow: 12 students from the field of Applied Arts will visit the centre of design and visual communication, United Kingdom. The participants will undertake a training placement in the advertising agencies\u2019 creative departments.\r\n3rd flow: 12 students from the field of Information Technology will visit Germany, the leader among European countries in businesses management systems. The participants will undertake a training placement in developing firms that implement advantageously the benefits of new technologies and digital transformations.\r\n4th flow: 12 students from the field of Electronic, Electrical and Automation Technician will visit Germany, a pioneer in digital technology and networks. The participants will undertake a training placement in organizations that utilize digital control systems, information transmission systems and communication networks.\r\n\r\nResults - impact - longer term benefits\r\nThe proposed mobility project will provide long-term benefits concerning the improvement of the students\u2019 potential for employment; it will cultivate an entrepreneurship attitude in them and will be essential in broadening their sense of European culture.

The needs for computer services, creating websites or databases are still growing. The demand for such services is still high. (Group B).

Hordaland is a region in growth, having reached half a million inhabitants it is now one of the fastest growing counties in Norway. \r\n\r\nRelevant skills and competences are becoming increasingly important, and the labour market and businesses call for more well-performing educational and training systems. In order to meet these needs, and ensure the competitiveness of the region, Hordaland will continually have to acquire new knowledge and methods. Hordaland should contribute in making its inhabitants become global citizens, with awareness and knowledge of Europe and the world. Global competences and intercultural understanding can contribute to further development of civil society.\r\n\r\nInternational cooperation is an integral part of HCC\u2019s strategy for regional development (International Strategy 2013-2016). As the challenges the region is faced with are not only valid for Hordaland, HCC sees international cooperation as a tool in finding possible solutions to challenges that are either common for many, or that are transregional/ transnational.\r\n\r\nHCC aims at using Erasmus+ VET Mobility 2017-19 as a strategic tool in developing the region. The programme will be an important contribution in meeting both the challenge of restructuring, as well as creating closer cooperation between education and training and the labour market. Further, the programme will be important in improving language and intercultural competences.\r\n\r\nHCC continuously aims at increasing participation among our partners. In this application, we have maintained approximately the same number of VET pupils as previous years, but have had an increase in participation among our Apprenticeship Training Offices/Establishments.  \r\n\r\nBy including participation in the Erasmus+ programme as a tool in the Competence Development Plan 2016-20 (CDP), we aim to strengthen professional skills and intercultural competences among VET teachers. Including job shadowing abroad into the CDP, contributes to the quality of the projects as well as long-term competence development. We also make an effort to include staff mobility to the mobilities for apprentices. Allowing mentors to take part in work placements together with their apprentice will not only improve the quality of training, but also increase the impact of the mobility. \r\n\r\nThis project emphasise developing cross-sectoral group mobilities. Sustainable development demands international cooperation across different sectors, governmental levels, and disciplines. Close links between businesses and education is of great importance in developing competences and networks, promoting innovation, adapting to the green shift, and securing that education reflects the needs in the market. Mobilising the inter-municipality councils of Hordaland has been a priority in this application, as they are central players when it comes to facilitating cooperation between municipalities, commerce and education. One example of a project involving these councils is the project exchanging best practice with the wool industry in Shetlands, coordinated by Region Nordhordland. The project involves several key local stakeholders within the wool industry, VET, and municipalities of the region.\r\n\r\nThe mobility projects in this application involve systematic work to ensure the quality of preparation and implementation. Quality management and preparation are important for the desired effects and impact of the projects, such as attitudes, shared responsibility, reflection, enhanced cultural awareness as well as more active and positive participation in a multicultural Norwegian and international society and work force. \r\n\r\nHCC is applying for 64 mobility projects, which count 192 pupils and 24 apprentices from 15 different upper secondary schools and 7 training offices, and 58 accompanying persons.

By means of the proposed project we intend to endorse the quality increase of the initial professional education and training in our school. We also wish to provide our students with the international dimension of professional education and thus to motivate them to improve their study performance, alternatively to reduce their premature withdrawal from the educational system. \r\nThe Traineeships for our apprentices and students will be held in Austria, Italy, Great Britain and Irland and will be attended by the 1st \u2013 4th grade (15-22 years) apprentices and students of both, study and apprentice courses for Cook, Waiter/Waitress, Pastry Cook, Catering and Accommodation Services, Management in gastronomy and Travel and Tourism services. The participants will be chosen on the basis of determined criteria. Their practical training, provided by our school\u2019s partners, will be carried out in restaurants and hotels, accommodation facilities, travel agencies. The aims of the project are: to improve the student`s professional abilities with the great emphasis on international cuisine as well as on non-traditional food processing and service (fish and seafood, regional and season ingredients); to familiarize the students with new forms of work organization in a different working environment and to motivate them to the further education. The aim is also to extend participants\u00b4 skills significant for orientation on the labour market. The participants will be led and motivated to an active approach, flexibility, cooperation and they will cooperate with regular workforce in a foreign country. They will not only extend their practical and theoretical knowledge and innovative ways at meals preparing processes but also become familiar with the unique technological and organizational methods. The cooks and pastry cooks will gain detailed knowledge about modern trends in European gastronomy, the waiters/waitresses will face and try new trends at guest service and communication with customers. The students of the Travel and Tourism services field will receive the practical experience in tourism services organization in the world-famous cities and popular tourist places. \r\nThe working stay will motivate all participants to study foreign languages. Besides of English, the participants will communicate also in the native language of the host country (Italian, German).  There will be also the apprentices with specific learning deficiencies and apprentices from socially handicapped or single-parent families among the participants. Participants will go through the special language, professional, psychological and cultural training before leaving the traineeship. After finishing the traineeship they will receive a certificate together with an evaluation of their performance. \r\nThe school in cooperation with its partners will ensure the issue of the Europass-Mobility document by means of ECVET system.

Supporting young people entering the labour market has to include the imparting of intercultural competence. Being able to communicate serenely with international partners, is now no longer a unique selling point, but has already become a basic requirement for survival in the modern labour market in the relevant line of business.\r\n\r\nEvery student of the media and IT professions being trained at Martin-Segitz-Schule can apply for the project.

The latter\u2019s assessment will be carried out in consultation with class teachers and trainers alike.\r\nIn the preparatory workshop, or even before, the chosen ones will submit CVs and application letters. These guarantee adequate allocation of internships and the student-centered design of the language-course.

We hope to succeed in that aspect by awarding various certificates. The trainees will receive a letter of reference by the foreign companies, a certificate from the ADC College and the europass mobility.

Many students grew up in rural areas and in a rather uneducated environment. They are still very young- mainly underage. Therefore, they have barley any experience with mobility projects. All students are already in their second year of their initial training programme, which means that they already have some good knowledge of the particular everyday-working-life. Due to the fact that most of the students just hold a successful certificate of secondary education (CSE) they have limited (native and foreign) language skills, which need to be improved. Additionally, most of our students haven\u2019t had any experience with migrants so far. Their experiences refer to asylum seekers and gastarbeiter and they are rather based on prejudices. However, it is getting even more important in their kind of jobs, to get insights into working structures of other countries and to develop intercultural and personal skills through the exposure to strange cultures. \r\nAs a result, basic project targets must be:\r\n- Application of the English language in daily life and to reduce fears of contacts with foreign languages and cultures\r\n- To gain professional skills by learning about new educational focuses in the partner country and through exploring the differences and similarities in the education.  \r\n- Establishment of personal skills, like self-confidence and so on.\r\n\r\nThe number of participants is limited to 20 students per flow, since most of them are underage, which leads to a higher need of care and support. Additionally, financial costs are playing a big part, because many of our student\u2019s families live in limited monetary boundaries, who can barely accomplish any additional cost.  \r\nTo develop a feeling for the language and to learn how to act self-respondent in an urban area, it is absolutely necessary to have a one-week language course before the placement takes place. The placement in the different professional areas lasts two weeks and gives first insights in the working-structures of the host country. The dealing with the different culture of the host country will be supported by the accompanying teachers in the afternoons of the first week and at the weekends, additional to their lives in the host families and at work of social facilities. \r\nThe organisation of the mobility, like insurance, transportation to the airport, flight booking and flight, transportation in greater London will be done by the sending organisation. They will also help to organise special needs like visa applications.  The partner organisation is responsible for the organisation of the host families, the placement companies and the first information for the participants. During the whole mobility, the participants will be accompanied by both organisations. Placement visits  as well as personal and intercultural care and support will be done by the accompanying persons. Regular meetings at the partner organisation will be done to monitor, evaluate and ensure the learning progresses. \r\nThere are many expected effects:\r\nA strong personal effect on the participant\u2019s self-confidence can be expected. The certainty to have been able to orientate in a metropolis supports the self-confidence as well as the experience to handle a new and strange situation. In the future, the willingness will be enforced to face and go through new and uncertain, anxiety-ridden situations. \r\nEffects on the language can be already expected during the first week of the stay, when the participants realize, that they are always able to find ways to express themselves \u2013 the main thing is that they dare to use the language. Language skills in vocabulary, through frequent speaking, as well as active and passive understanding will be improved, because the contact to migrants and British dialects require concentrated listening. \r\nIn London-Harrow, in their families and working facilities, the participants will have contact to British people with different cultural background, which can be from Rumania, Jamaica or India. In that way they will be forced to deal with different cultures on a personal and culinary level and as well as the differences in values and conventions. This leads to a questioning of own prejudices and to a curiosity of foreign cultures.\r\nTo compare the professional facilities, the concepts and the working structure of the host country to the working situation at home and the questioning of familiar habits, lead to the ability to recognize connections and  dependencies in values of different cultural backgrounds.

Although the EU status of Poland has moved into the background the historical incidents and therefore the political education of our participants are still of considerable relevance.\r\nMoreover, vocational aspects especially of young workers have to be taken into consideration. On the one hand, the participants are 37 students, who are absolving their vocational apprenticeships. They qualify in training courses such as electronic technicians, metalworkers, industrial mechanics, wholesale clerks, office clerks,gardeners and medical assistants. However, it will also be possible to include other vocational fields. On the other hand, participants are 12 teachers and training supervisors. \r\nIn addition, a second long-term partnership is the basis of this exchange program.

This goal can be reached by offering them 3-week internships in different European businesses. Each group sent abroad consists of eight respectively ten participants. The chosen participants have an interest to be employed in Europe in the future.\r\nFurthermore, it is important to our school to support the personal development of young people. To get in contact with a foreign culture, including coping with others in a foreign language will improve their self-esteem and possibly help them to decrease or give up existing prejudices. Included in this internship program there is also a special cultural framework program to help reach this goal.\r\nThe project begins anew with each fresh group, since the trainees only take part in the program once. That means we aim to reach the same objectives in every project, but we gain new trainees each time. This way we continuously reach a wider circle of trainees, whom we can offer the opportunity of an internship in a foreign country, i. e. Poland or England. This is especially important because the trainees are predominantly working in small- or medium-sized businesses and therefore rarely gain experiences in bigger or foreign companies. Thus, the overall objective of the placements is the qualitative improvement of the apprenticeship through a development of intercultural professionalism, linguistic, and social competence and sensitization of the necessity to educate oneself further in this area.\r\nWe expect that our objectives (technological, intercultural, social, linguistic, and political) will be reached to a large extent. For us this means among other things that the trainees will be able to reflect their diverse experiences after their stay abroad and to include them in their current or future apprenticeship. Additionally, we expect that they will profit in future employment and hiring situa-tions from their stay abroad and that all this will have a permanent effect.\r\nThe importance of learning languages, e. g. English as lingua franca, becomes more obvious when one stays abroad. The language barrier is a special obstacle which must be coped with. This is especially true for languages which are not taught in school.\r\nThe political structures of our host country are, apart from the existing democratic structures, still influence", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004521_1"], ["5AD", "Work Experience in London and Dublin", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 65111.0, "The project \u201eWork Experience in London and Dublin\" (WELD) involves our school, Kaufm\u00e4nnisches Berufskolleg Oberberg, as applicant institution and our project partner, ADC College in London and Dublin. The sending organisation focuses on the training and job preparation of business students. We have taken part in a number of EU-funded projects, including Comenius and Erasmus+KA1 programmes, to provide work placement in Europe. We are trying to incorporate international learning as part of our long-term curricular strategy. Our project partner, the ADC College in London and Dublin has been involved in professional training for more than 20 years. They were accredited by the British Council and they specialize in offering work experience in a number of businesses which act as work placement partners in London\u2019s multicultural atmosphere as well as in Dublin. They also have a network of host families and their staff  come from a variety of European countries. So they are acquainted with cultural differences and learners\u2019 common language obstacles. Their competences and resources make them an ideal partner for our mobility-of-learners project. The project WELD is a logical continuation of our school\u2019s policy of incorporating internationalisation into our business courses in order to give them the long-needed European dimension, thus improving our school\u2019s international competences in an increasingly competitive environment among educational institutions. As for the participants, the project is aimed at broadening their horizons in an international work surrounding where intercultural skills and multilingualism are common. The project we planned completes this experience by further improving the learners\u2019 language abilities with the help of a tailor-made English course. Also, it is aimed at enhancing their professional skills in the field of business and administration. The participants are meant to develop their skills by doing our special project task, i.e. observing and recording people\u2019s social conventions in the world of business with regard to written and spoken communication on the one hand and behaviour and dress code on the other. The participants are sure to find differences to their home countries. The task involves developing questionnaires and observation sheets which the participants will use to gather information as a basis for a final evaluation. Our project participants will be trainees on the dual education system as well as full-time students on preparatory business courses with a language level of at least A2 according to the CEFR. We will prefer applicants with little international experience, whose awareness of the relevance of a foreign work experience for their careers gives them a strong motivation to take part.  The second criterion will be social factors like difficult family backgrounds and psychological features such as low self-esteem. There will be a pre-selection after consulting the form-teachers followed by an interview of the applicants conducted by our EU-coordinators. On their arrival day the participants are going to meet their host families. The first workday will see a meeting at the ADC to pass on any necessary information needed for the time in Dublin or London. The language course is scheduled for the first week. During the work placement in week two and three, the participants will be in touch with the ADC College mentors, who ensure the quality of the placements and monitor the development of the students. At the weekends the students take part in their host families\u2019 activities. During the time of their stay the students do the assigned project task. On their last work-day the participants will meet up at the ADC College, receive their certificates and fill in a feed-back sheet to allow the participating institutions to evaluate the quality of the programme. The project is meant to have an important impact on the occupational qualifications of its participants. It will also strengthen personal characteristics by exposing them to an international experience with unexpected situations. It will certainly have improved their language proficiency and intercultural competence. Everyday life in the host families will have confronted them with the need for tolerance and empathy. Taking part and bringing home a certificate will improve their chances on the job market. Our college staff hopes that our participation will have or a long-term impact on promoting our school profile to the parents and the training companies.

Especially companies in the Metropolitan region of Nuremberg attach great importance to education under international considerations, because in today\u2019s globalised world they are used to increasingly establishing and maintaining business relationships outside their home markets. Since there are often Anglo-Saxon rules by which they communicate on an international level, we consider it as compulsory to provide our trainees with a training program in the UK in order to prepare them for the demands of the international economic environment. Unfortunately, it is no longer a matter of course to obtain a work contract with the respective training company after completing traineeship. Consequently, trainees must more than ever be willing to respond flexibly to changing and international labour market structures. Through this project, students can enrich their CVs  appropriately to be prepared for the European labour market.\r\n\r\nAll trainees of the LES in dual vocational training of the following sectors can apply for participation: office administration, retail, wholesale and foreign trade, real estate, industry, IT, personnel services, administrative professions. The LES selects the applications received according to the following criteria: age of majority , language skills B1 of the CEFR, motivation throughout the project duration (possibly in consultation with form masters), willingness to adapt to different circumstances. At an early stage of preparation the participants create their individual CVs and motivation letters. On this basis, the ADC College can choose work placements according to the participants' individual sectors and skills (e.g. real estate trainees were placed at English real estate agencies and personnel services merchants in the personnel departments of large hotels). Accordingly, we expect similar good placements of future participants.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the three -week project in Harrow / Greater London is planned for March 2019, in Dublin for October 2019\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, participants will be prepared by the project leaders of the Ludwig -Erhard -Schule in five three -hour evening seminars and additionally by means of an online communication platform outside of the regular vocational school time and accompanied to Harrow. In case of questions, the participants can get in touch \u2013 either by digital means or personally - with their project leaders at any stage of the project.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration between the project management of the LES and the responsible coordinator at ADC College is given throughout the entire project by e- mail, by phone or in person, on the spot and very successfully.

During the preparation of the stay abroad the participants deal with the political and legal framework of gender equality in the countries involved in the project - Germany, Great Britain and Ireland - as far as work is concerned. Afterwards they examine the framework\u2019s implementation both in their training company at home and their English-speaking firm providing their internship. In order to reach more valid results it is essential to put the project into a broader European context. Therefore the project\u2019s first flow takes place in London, with its results serving as a basis for the second flow in Dublin.\r\nBy acquiring international work experience the participants\u2019 employability on the European job market is supposed to be secured in the long term.

In this course they also do research on the political and legal frameworks of Gender Equality in the world of work both in Germany and the respective country of their stay. Since the participants are requested to work together in teams, especially the communicative abilities, which are extremely important not only for the subsequent traineeships but also for their training occupation, are trained.\r\nDuring the first phase of their stay in London or Dublin the students attend a language course at the ADC College. After this the students have a two-week traineeship in the business administration sector during which they gain work experience in a foreign company where they can apply, deepen and enlarge their business administration knowledge which they have acquired in class and in their training occupation. Also they find out and learn about the implementation and perception of the political and legal frameworks dealing with occupational Gender Equality in the companies providing their traineeships abroad. The evaluation of the research\u2019s outcome is displayed in the school afterwards and made available to vocational training personnel interested in using the data in their lessons. \r\nBecause of the language course and the traineeship in the company both the professional and the language expertise of the participants are fostered realistically.

Experiencing this they will develop more acceptance and tolerance towards the other culture. Also the getting to know of other operational methods is an important path to develop an understanding for the other culture.\r\nIn summary the acquired knowledge and experiences will be of personal benefit for the participants and therefore multiplied by them.

The ,Berufskolleg Siegen\u2018 cooperates with partner organisations in Valencia (Spain), London (UK), Dublin (Ireland) and Kokkola (Finland). In the course of two years 60 apprentices will get the chance to do a three-week work placement (London)   or a four-week placement (Valencia, Dublin, Kokkola) respectively. Students training to become clerks in various sectors such as industry or freight forwarding as well as the commercial college students who have a particularly Europe-oriented curriculum will take part in the projects.\r\nAfter the application procedure the students are thoroughly prepared by project leaders as well as former participants. The projects start at different times during the year. The respective partner organisation abroad provides for suitable accomodation and companies for the work placement. It also serves as contact person in situ. In Valencia and London the partner organisations are experienced agencies specialised in taking care of international apprentices. The partner in Kokkola is a vocational school that is in charge of handling the organisation of accomodation and work placement. In this case the project is an exchange, i.e., Finnish students will come to Siegen for a four-week work placement as well.\r\nThe aim of the projects is to give apprentices the opportunity to experience living and working abroad. The ,Berufskolleg\u2018 would like to increase the number of students taking part in projects throughout Europe. The work placement gives people the chance to use their skills in completely different settings than they are used to at home and thus they experience how work is done in foreign companies. Furthermore, the projects serve to broaden their language skills in everyday situations as well as in a business context and apart from that, they increase their intercultural competence. As a result, the projects help the students to mature on a personal level and to become more open-minded regarding foreign cultures. All in all, the students develop a better understanding of the diversity in Europe and therefore they can identify with the idea of Europe.\r\n\r\n A ,Europass Mobility\u2018 as well as a work placement certificate will be given to the participants.

The main activity of this project is a two-week long student work placement abroad for 28 students over the project period, in the VET programmes Child and Youth Care, Health Care and Travel and Tourism. In addition, there is four teacher job shadowing mobilities planned per year, parallel to the student mobilities. Participants in the project are second year vocational students of age 17-18. During work placements, students work in hotels and travel agencies in Dublin, and stay with selected host families. In Huesca students live in students dorms, form teams with one Spanish student each, and accompany these in their work placements in nursing homes and kindergartens. The student team-model is developed to overcome language barriers between the users/children in institutions and our students, who in most cases don't have a common language. At the same time, the student team model adds value as young people get to meet, work and communicate directly every day, across cultural and language barriers. \r\n\r\nOur school involves international perspectives in all fields of studies. We excel in efforts such as International Week (IW), where we have been awarded best IW at national level several years in row.

Our partner ADC College has long experience in successfully developing and executing international mobility programmes in partnership with educational institutions from countries across Europe. This year we have a new school partner in Huesca, Spain, that has already prepared well to welcome our students and teachers. The new collaboration will over time also include mobilities from Huesca to Lofoten.  \r\n\r\nThe main objectives of this project are to motivate students to complete their vocational education and training, and to raise the attractiveness of vocational studies and hence increase the number of applicants. Expected learning outcomes are improved English skills and cross-cultural competence, as well as greater international orientation. Objectives are targeted through work placement, interaction and communication with companies, host families and others. Students' personal development and skills gained will be documented in Learning Agreements and Europass documents and increase students' employability. Accompanying teachers will monitor students' learning outcomes and personal development, as well as bringing valuable experience back to our school and boost future international efforts.

In the autumn of 2014, the School initiated two new courses of tuition giving a double set of qualifications; the students obtain a Vocational Certificate and at the same time become qualified for higher education by combining theoretical studies and apprenticeships.  The School is expanding the offers for programs, which give the possibility for international school- and working experience.

Simultaneously, the school has strengthened its cooperation with local businesses and industries.  Through co-operation, we aim to secure the availability of good, skilled workers for the economic community.  The School is making a major effort to provide information directed systematically at the local public, commercial and industrial sectors, at Buskerud county department of education, and at the lower secondary schools from which we recruit our students.

Working life requires more and more international cooperation, which we need to develop our students and staff. In order to continue developing our vocational programs, students and staff, we need to take another step and it is against internationalization. The retail and IT industry includes many international relations and English as professional language. Students will have the whole of Europe as a labor market, so it is important to study the working environment, culture and customs during there education so that they can work more easily in other countries and to gain a better understanding of cultural differences and how English is used as a technical language. VET and job shadowing abroad give our students and staff both the understanding and familiarity with an international labor market.\r\n\r\nWorkmanship\r\nThe purpose of this project is that several schools and students will be able to do a few weeks of their workplace-based learning in another country with another professional culture, professional identity and professional community, and teachers will be able to develop their professional profession through job shadowing. Participants also get to know and learn new professional skills based on an internationalization perspective in their future profession and in their present professional profession. This enables the students to achieve a deeper goal achievement and understanding described in the rules for Gy11 and approaching the diploma objectives for vocational education and training, and the teachers develop their teaching, which creates higher quality in the students' vocational education. Assessing competense based learning and the silent knowledge of a profession results in the best quality at a visual meeting and therefore we want to create the conditions for our vocational teachers to conduct tripartite conversations in place or through digital technology.\r\n\r\nEfficiency\r\nFinding partner organizations, applying and creating procedures and processes to enable VET abroad is resource-intensive. By centralizing resources in a consortium, the schools in the consortium will be able to send their students abroad to do parts of their VET and teachers for job shadowing. Each school can then develop at its own pace with a few students where they can work on internationalization and continue work on developing local routines and processes with the support of centrally developed materials and key persons. Using period placement schedule as a resource allows the flow of students to be evenly distributed over the academic year and receiving partners can maintain a good quality over time and our organization can handle the amount of students who then continuously can send smaller number of students and increase the number over time.\r\n\r\nInnovation\r\nIn the IT- and retail industry, new technologies are being developed both nationally and internationally. To give our students the opportunity to work with problem solving and explore materials and techniques in another country can provide students with innovative ideas. Partner organizations are geographically located in cities that are at the forefront of research and new innovative technical solutions within the vocational training programs to which this project is addressed. Through planned cultural activities and other individual initiatives, students will be given the opportunity to get acquainted with research and new technologies in their professional sector.

An advanced training in the foreign language English is a further benefit of this project. The students\u2019 linguistic skills create a bridge between the world of education and the business community.

The students are supported as PEOPLE, they reap profit and usefulness for their whole life. There is not just the benefit of improving their language skills in English but also the chance to intensify their talents in other spheres. \r\nBesides, in these days it is extremely advantageous to list internships in foreign countries in one\u2019s CV.

The added value of studying at our school is emphasizing the necessity of linking theory to practice through training companies in which students can practically verify their knowledge and skills in a simulated foreign business environment. Furthermore, pupils in the 3rd and 4th grade must complete compulsory vocational practice at the agreed workplaces. This is where we are opening the door to identifying our need to deepen the linking of theory to practice, so that we produce not only theoretical experts for the labour market but especially experienced and practically trained experts with active communication in the English language.

It will be attended by 26 pupils together. Through our collaboration with the ADC College in England, 12 of our pupils will be located in companies operating in the Business administration area.

The project\u00b4s realization will be supervised by the project team composed of \u2013 a project manager, project coordinator, financial manager, to ensure its quality. By completing foreign mobilities, pupils will get an overview of the functioning of the labour market in England and the Czech Republic, entrepreneurship opportunities, rights and obligations of entrepreneurs, principles of the real estate business, information about career growth opportunities and youth employment promotion, social policy and the social system in England, the functioning and operating conditions, as well as of the charitable organization financing system, a brief overview of the subsidy policy, learn about English language teaching methods, about the importance of marketing whether in personal life or in a working business environment. The greatest benefit of the project at the pupils' personal level will be the acquisition of new experience and professional skills, including the improvement of language competencies. The project will provide them with a unique life experience and will motivate them to further professional, linguistic and personal growth. They will learn how it works in a foreign company, they will get acquainted with the duty to go to work, to have a fixed working time, to work in a multi-ethnic group, to be responsible and to realize the importance of work they have to do. The realization of the project also benefits school.

Due to their home situation, their often rather mediocre school results, by the fact that, as technical and vocational students, they often feel inferior to their brothers, sisters, friends from a general school, they have low self-esteem, low motivation to study and a lack of confidence. Often they make no or a wrong study choice after their last secondary school year, and they end up on the labour market with fewer opportunities. Our students are generally not very internationally mobile, and have not been in contact with multiculturalism. When it comes to their skills in English, they think too much that they are not competent, they are afraid to use the English they have learned in school.\r\nThe departments involved in the project are technical and vocational, we dare to say that they don\u2019t get the respect they deserve, both with parents and young people. We are looking for ways to popularise those departments.\r\nAt school we are working on internationalisation through KA2 projects, this schoolyear we have our first very successful KA1 project, and we can see a lot of enthusiasm and hope to be able to repeat this next year. We are more than ever convinced that a KA1 project, like it is running now, is the perfect tool to realise goals you can't achieve in daily education and internship organised in Belgium.\r\nIt will improve the skills in English among our students, and introduce them to a multicultural (working) environment. It will also provide our students a broader perspective on the European labour market. It will give them new work experiences and professional learning gains. They will study more and be more aware of their choices, they will also be more motivated and able to make better study choices. They will also have more job opportunities.\r\nOur students will also acquire social skills that we cannot always realise at our school or at local internship companies: self-esteem, stress resistance, willingness to cooperate (on an international level), openness to other cultures and unknown work environments, less fear of the unknown ... And very important is the gain in self-confidence, we can confirm this thanks to our running KA1 project: thanks to the internship and the stay in host families for wo weeks, we saw our students get more and more confident, discover new talents and competences, as a trainee and as a person.\r\nThe internship is also an essential part for the result of the integrated test of the students, and thus their final report of their last secondary schoolyear.\r\nThe internship project will also provide new professional and other skills to the teachers involved in the project, we think that it will result in an implementation and teaching of the subjects much much closer and related to the daily reality, so that \u2018being a student\u2019 in these fields of study will be more attractive. We also hope that the project will have a positive impact on the charisma of these subjects for parents and new students.\r\nThe internship will take place in companies / institutions in London, students stay with host families.

In this name of the method is a humorous reference to our school mascot Max, but the name especially refers to something that is good: our school is \u2018the max\u2019. Max symbolises a two pillar system on which our education method is based: providing contemporary effective education with a maximal competence increasing learning effect and the enlargement of an individual care- and education policy. Through the introduction of didactical innovations, working with SMART goals, putting the focus on acquiring the European key competences and a further professionalization of the teaching staff we guarantee qualitatively high standard education with the first pillar of the \r\nMax-method including a lot of attention for ICT-implementation and language development.  \r\n\r\nThe second component of the Max-method sees to it that we create equal opportunities for everyone. The augmentation of social inclusion and a better preparation for future choice of study and profession provide that the social inequality and diversity won\u2019t obstruct the development opportunities of our youngsters. We see an internationalisation policy in our school as an enforcement of the pre-existing two pillar system. Internationalisation augments the self-reliance of the learners, improves their language development, stimulates their digital competences, creates a new cultural awareness and improves their social skills.  \r\n\r\nThe long term goals of the European Union, as they were recorded in the Europe 2020 strategy, match perfectly with the previously mentioned values from our school project. The Erasmus+ programme can give a concrete completion to these goals. For these reasons we would like to integrate the project of \u201cCore action 1- individual learning mobility\u201d in the school structure in a sustainable way. We do this by implementing two periods of \u201cMax goes international\u201d in our sixth form students\u2019 curriculum in the study fields Social Technical Sciences (STS) and Health and Welfare Sciences (HWS). These two periods are used as a preparation, an implementation and a dissemination for/of the mobility project. For further realisation of the mobility we are working together with an experienced partner organisation (ADC College in Harrow). In this application we are asking for financing for ten of our students of our sixth form in the study fields STS and HWS, who will be selected to participate in a foreign work placement in organisations that work in the sectors health and childcare In the London area during a period of ten days. The target group consists out of about fifty students, of which the majority accords to an opportunity group according the EOE-indicators (Equal Opportunity Education). The students who will not be going to London will be receiving an equivalent \u201chome project\u201d with a focus on guidance concerning choice of study and profession. These students also, will come in contact with internationalisation through their cooperation with a college in Rotterdam. The guidance by six teachers offers opportunities for their personal and professional development. The application for this mobility is an addition to the 2017 approved application of a similar project. The mobility project perfectly suits our long term ambition of GO! Atheneum Merksem to evolve to a school with an outspoken international profile. As European Parliament Ambassador School and by participating in several other European projects like e-Twinning, Euroscola and new Erasmus+ strategic partnerships, we are building a road to develop a sustainable internationalisation policy. This vision on internationalisation is shared by the whole school. \u201cTeam International\u201d is ready to go.

We often notice that these pupils receive few incentives from home to work at school. Such a situation means that these pupils leave school prematurely without a diploma and therefore have limited opportunities on the labor market. With foreign internships we want to motivate these pupils to stay at school to be able to take part in a foreign internship.\r\nIn this way we want to stop school dropout but also encourage and motivate pupils to finish their school careers and to show them that their chances on the labor market will increase significantly.\r\nIn addition, we want to introduce participants to other people, cultures, customs, visions, etc.\r\nSelf-reliance, self-respect, respect for others as a person, but also for their opinion, tolerance. These are all aspects that we want to increase with this project.\r\nNaturally, the internship plays a prominent role in itself. The participant learns to accept assignments from foreign people, often in a foreign language and to execute them. During the internship, the trainee concerned can know his / her own knowledge and can demonstrate it to strangers and learn new things.\r\nIn the month of March of the 2019-2020 school year, we want to send 30 students from the study programs Electricity, Machine Tools, CNC-controlled machines, Hair Care and Beauty care to Finland for an internship.\r\nA number of these students will do an internship in companies, another part of the group will take practical lessons at our partner school Salpaus.\r\nAt the same time, we send a group of 30 pupils from the care sector to London to do work placements in nursing and care homes, cribs and kindergarten.\r\nWe also provide an extensive cultural program for both groups.\r\nFor the implementation of the project we call on partners in both countries. In Finland it is Salpaus, a school consortium in Lahti.

They can share experiences and gain insight into the Finnish education system and take good practice examples to their school and implement their experiences and new insights in their own lessons.\r\nWe also send 2 staff members to Finland in the field of dual learning to get acquainted with the Finnish system of dual learning. We are entering this school year in the so-called testing grounds and we do not only want to collect the Flemish experiences but we also want to look at how they organize this at our colleagues in Salpaus. In this way we want to be properly prepared and prepared when the trial period ends next year.\r\nIn the school year 2020 we want to start a partnership with Pajulahti, an Olympic training center in the town of Nastola about 150 km north-west of the capital Helsinki.\r\nIn March 2020, we want to send 25 pupils from our study program Sport under the guidance of Finnish instructors to learn typical winter sports such as cross country ski, ski jumping, ice hockey, skating just to name a few. We also plan a collaboration with the circus school of Lahti.\r\nAs management we see a lot of advantages in this project, for our students on  one hand but also for our teachers and staff staff in particular.

The wine press chooses qualitative education that starts from the possibilities and talents of the pupils. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, we have ensured that program development has resulted in a strong expansion of project activities, workplace learning, internships and opportunities for connection with the labor market. \r\nThe intention is to let our students graduate successfully, limit the school drop-out as much as possible and offer them maximum opportunities in their future career. \r\n\r\nThe establishment of the seventh specialization years (vocational secondary school) and the Se-n-Se years of agro and green management and graphic design (seventh years after technical and art secondary education) fit into this framework. \r\nThe Dual Learning pilot project \"school desk in the workplace\" that started this school year in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and Syntra Flanders is an example of how we want to support young people in optimizing their future possibilities. \r\n\r\nThe Wijnpers wants to profile itself more internationally oriented, multicultural and open-minded from recent policy choices and to further develop the internal school working effect from these objectives. \r\nAs a strategic objective, we first propose that all pupils receive at least two international experiences in their study career and succeed in using functionally foreign languages. It is an ambitious goal since the school population of De Wijnpers counts a lot of socially vulnerable pupils and pupils with learning disabilities. \r\n\r\nThe school started in September 2015 with a CLIL program, language exchange and has a long tradition of multi-day study trips to European cultural capitals and project weeks abroad. Over the past 3 school years, our Se-n-Se pupils in Poland, Spain, Great Britain, France and Italy have completed successful traineeships thanks to Erasmus +, and this has had an enormous impact on the further development of our internationalization working group within our school. .\r\n\r\nThis project proposal is situated on three levels that tie in with the major objectives of the school vision:\r\n- a long internship of 13 weeks in Spain, Poland or Great Britain for students of the seventh year Se-n-Se (which is preceded by intensive training in the first semester)\r\n- a short group internship of 2 weeks in Spain or Great Britain for the pupils of Dual Learning and Se-n-Se\r\n- and finally the supervision and preparation of the internships by the teachers involved.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the internship abroad is to provide pupils with a total experience and motivate them for further education in higher education, or to prepare them better for the labor market. We want the pupil to make the choice to participate in this project, so that we can give motivated youngsters who are bursting with talent the chance to grow across borders on their way to European maturity. It is expected that the project and the immersion in a different culture, with different habits, will lead to a significant increase in motivation, practical language skills, the learning and working qualities and choice skills of the young adults. We hope that this will significantly increase their chances in the further study or work career.\r\nThe other culture and way of working means that their talents can further explore a European unity and maturity. The basis of the acquired knowledge and skills that they gain from this experience will be able to develop further as a seed, and also give them enormous added value within their own personal and social growth.\r\nThe support for the pupil in their foreign internship by the teachers must provide a multiplier effect both in terms of professional competence and the effect on internationalization within the school team. For the school and the foreign partners, this project will function as a learning network in which knowledge, contacts and experience are exchanged. In the future, after a positive evaluation and adjustment from the quality assurance cycle, this added value can be further expanded and lead to more intensive partnerships and new projects.\r\nWith this project we hope to be able to motivate others to share this international message together, and thereby to form an ever expanding network, where learning, integration, implementation of new ideas and cooperation are central, and where qualities are transcended across borders. be shared.", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2018-1-BE02-KA102-046757_4"], ["5AD", "sociale, culturele verkenning in Londen", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 26202.0, "Wico campus Salvator is a small-scale school in a rural area in the North of Limburg.

The sending and receiving organizations are competent in the field of Erasmus + project realization and all expected activities are based on a precisely defined timetable and contractual relations of all participants. Each party is provably acquainted with the activities it must provide.\r\nThe main objective of the project is to provide students of the Business Academy, IT and Pedagogy courses with a practical work experience abroad, to achieve professional and personal development of participants during foreign work placements in London and to promote the employability of pupils in the national and European labor market. Traineeships will take place in three runs and will include pre-departure planning visits that will test the quality and suitability of businesses for long-term placements; two short-term mobility visits for 15 pupils for 2 weeks, two long-distance mobility trips for three pupils for 14 weeks, and monitoring visits to check and obtain feedback for a potential corrective action.\r\nThe main objectives are followed by the partial objectives: - getting acquainted with the working practices, methods and technologies in the host country; getting familiar with examples of good practice and innovative practices in their field in the host country; increasing language skills; using the ECVET and Europass assessment system. The specific tasks for pupils in each field correspond to the Erasmus + VET objectives and are defined through using learning outcomes  based on the profiles of pupils in each field, the National Qualifications Framework and the ECVET system, and they are defined for each field and type of mobility separately.\r\nThe target group of short-term mobilities are secondary vocational education students aged seventeen and over - senior students. The target group of long-term mobilities are only adult students, therefore they are students of higher grades, including fresh graduates.  Adult students will be selected because the internal rules of the school do not allow the stay of minors without accompanying person and the length of stay requires a certain degree of autonomy. Higher-age pupils are also selected for all kinds of mobility because of their higher professional and language readiness, their degree of autonomy and their level of responsibility. Pupils fall into the 4th EQF.\r\nThe applicant expects  the participation of students in foreign internships will not only help to strengthen their professional and language skills but will also bring enrichment to all parties - new experiences, views, opinions, approaches and solutions. We expect the students to use new working practices and experience in the Czech Republic or on the European labor market. The impact of the project should be at local, regional, national and European level. At the local level we expect a great impact on project participants, \r\nco-ordinators and other school pupils and teachers, including school management. At the regional level, it is mainly about the impact on the reputation and prestige of  the school and the increased interest of the applicants for education. At the national level, the implementation of the project will mainly contribute to the development of civic competences. Long-term interference is seen by the applicant mainly at European level, in strengthening the sense of European belonging, mutual understanding of cultures, the international transfer of work practices and experience, using a comparable system of recognition of ECVET learning outcomes, reinforcing the principle of internationalization and integration and a competitive capability of project participants on the European labor market.", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2018-1-CZ01-KA102-047157_1"], ["5AD", "Obchodn\u00ed praxe v zahrani\u010d\u00ed", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 47193.0, "This two-year project called \"Business Internship Abroad\" is aimed at 24 students (12 in each of the two cycles) who attend the second, third and fourth year of Commercial Academy,  a vocational secondary school which offers Business and Tourism Programme.

The new partners are the I.E.S. Zaidin-Vergeles in Granada, Andalucia, Spain and the CIFP La Laboral in Gijon, Asturias, Spain. We are now cooperating with eleven vocational schools, two intermediary organisations and one NGO in six European countries as compared to nine schools in five European countries in the 2017call.\r\n\r\nThe I.E.S. Zaidin-Vergeles and the CIFP La Laboral will engage with us in a reciprocal cooperation. We are sending and receiving students from the IT sector. Both the EU-coordinators at I.E.S. Zaidin-Vergeles  and CIFP La Laboral are very experienced in both KA1 and KA2 projects and are therefore welcome partners. They both have a simliar profile as our school which enables them to find adequate internplaces for our students which can be evaluated using ECVET tools. This brings added value to our mobility projects.\r\n\r\nWe have also started to cooperate with I.E.S. Zaidin-Vergeles and the CIFP La Laboral in order to consolidate and later extend the numbers of mobilities in the IT sector. Our other partners in Spain, especially on Tenerife,  suffer from the economic crisis and find it increasingly difficult to offer suitable internships for our IT students. Many small companies in Spain and especially on Tenerife have closed over the recent years and therefore we are trying to broaden the foundation for our future IT mobilities with the help of new partners. Last year we started working with a school near Barcelona and we are going to continue that cooperation.\r\n\r\nAspect 2 of our agenda of internationalisation concerns the improvement of the mutual recognition of learning outcomes in Europe. We have been using ECVET Learning Agreements and ECVET assessment sheets very consistently to prepare and evaluate mobilities and we have gained positive experiences with them. The use of the ECVET toolkit also enables our partners and us to extend our student's competencies in a very target oriented fashion.\r\n\r\nLast but not least we are encouraging our staff to go on jobshadowing projects to our manifold partners (aspect 3 of our agenda). In this project we are going to send two of our educational staff on such projects. By doing so we not only hope to cultivate our contacts but also we hope for a positive effect on our staff's teaching skills. All colleagues who go abroad are therefore obliged to disseminate their experiences at especially scheduled staffmeetings.", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA116-004968_4"], ["5AD", "Medzin\u00e1rodn\u00e1 odborn\u00e1 prax", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 68928.0, "The submitted project in frame of the program Erasmus+ International Work Experience of the Secondary school of Commerce (Obchodn\u00e1 akad\u00e9mia), Kuku\u010d\u00ednova 2, Trnava, Slovakia is based on the Strategy of the European internationalisation of the school. The project consists of the vocational training of the VET learners with duration of 3 weeks taking place in the host companies in Austria and in the UK. One of the significant elements within the vocational training of the learners is the interconnection between the theoretical studies and practical activity of the students in international companies. The added value is development of soft skills, ICT and language skills. Another part of the project is the VET staff training abroad which will be taking place in Cyprus and Spain. In the work experience will take part 30 students together with the accompanying persons; 15 participants in Vienna and 15 in London.\r\nWe decided to implement the vocational training also in a German speaking country as we realised the German and Austrian companies conducting their business activity in Slovakia have serious problems to find German speaking employees. It is particularly difficult to find an employee with at least the level B1 of German language skills. We have to emphasise that German and Austrian companies are very important for the Slovak economy.\r\nAs the participants are the secondary school students and they will be in a foreign environment, they will be accompanied by two accompanying persons, teachers of our school at each of the mobilities. The accompanying persons will provide for the supervision and monitoring of the participants during the preparatory stage, the journey to the destination as well as during the whole stay. The selected teachers speak English or German fluently, they have experience with the international projects, so they will be able to deal with any difficulties operatively or to solve any possible problems. The accompanying persons will participate in the monitoring in the host companies, meetings and discussions with the responsible persons, will gain the feedback from the companies and participants, and will be responsible for preparation of the respective project documentation.\r\nThe participants will gain direct experience from a longer-term stay abroad, will get to know the diversity of the European capital cities, will have the opportunity to use the foreign language in real life situations, they will experience real work in international companies, and they will have the possibility to interact with the colleagues at their workplace. Significant is also the personal and professional growth and development of soft skills. The participants will be prepared for their working career and for managing different life situations. However, the process will not be only one-sided, the partner organisations will gain interesting experience from the Slovak students, what will contribute to the development of the European dimension. \r\nThe main aim of the VET staff training abroad - job shadowing is strengthening of the participation in mobility projects for improvement of key competences and skills of the participants and increasing the quality of the educational process at school. The need of the school is to strengthen the managerial compentences of the employees in the area of the project management, expanding and improving the entrepreneurial education, strengthening the application of soft skills in the education (synergy with vocational training in Austria and in the UK), work in the projects, use of practical activities, case studies to problem solving and decision making, development and sharing experience from the previous projects as well as emphasis on the teacher profile. Job shadowings with the duration of one week are focused on the effective and efficient project management of the EU funded projects, entrepreneurial education taught in a practical way. The participants will be actively involved before the training (self-study of materials provided in advance), during as well as after the job shadowing.\r\nBoth participants are teachers of vocational subjects using CLIL and active members of the project team.\r\n\r\nOur involvement in Erasmus+ contributes to achieving the main goal of our school  which is the sustainable and continuous quality improvement of the educational process in compliance with the mission and key values of the school. Our vision is to become a learning school enabling learning to all its stakeholders and thus to facilitate continuous improvement for itself.

The length of two weeks fully corresponds with the vocational stay in the Czech Republic. This activity will have 28 participants from the secondary vocational school and higher professional school, 22 will do their practice in the UK, 6 in Germany in the branches retailtrade, management and administration. The stays will be organised in three flows, accompanying teachers will be involved in two of them, planned for students of the secondary vocational school where the participants may be under 18. Because of this fact and security measures a group leader will accompany the students in the first week.    \r\n\r\nA2 \u2013 A new activity for our school represents Mobility of staff \u2013 job shadowing. One teacher of vocational subject will perform job shadowing in German partner school and firms in Idar-Oberstein. One teacher of vocational subject will perform job shadowing in firms in London. The result of this activity will represent transfer of experience and gaining innovation stimuli for creating of new units of learning outcomes. The plan of OA Pribram for the time span 2017-2021 is to widen the set of units of learning outcomes especially in the branch of ICT, accounting and statistics as well as to create units of learning outcomes corresponding with a new study programme. In the frame of this project 3 new units of learning outcomes will come into existence.  \r\n\r\nThis project will last 15 monts and the activities one and two fully correspond with the internationalisation strategy of our school and mobility plan, mentioned in the application for VET charter.  Activity three was not available when applying for VET mobility Charter. \r\n\r\nA3 \u2013 Reacting to the call of the European commission for supporting of longer mobilities, we decided to realise Erasmus PRO - long term mobility of VET learners.
