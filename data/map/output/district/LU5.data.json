The degradation is driven or exacerbated by human activity and has a direct impact on water and air quality, biodiversity, climate and human life-quality.  High-resolution soil property maps are one major prerequisite for the specific protection of soil functions and restoration of degraded soils as well as sustainable land use, water and environmental management. However, the currently available techniques for (digital) soil mapping still have deficiencies in terms of reliability and precision, the feasibility of investigation of large areas (e.g. catchments and landscapes) and the assessment of soil degradation threats at this scale. A further quandary is the insufficient degree of dissemination of knowledge between the scientific community, relevant authorities and prospective users and deficiencies in standardisation. The focus of the iSOIL project is on improving fast and reliable mapping of soil properties, soil functions and soil degradation threats. This requires the improvement as well as integration of geophysical and spectroscopic measurement techniques in combination with advanced soil sampling approaches, pedometrical and pedophysical approaches. An important aspect of the project is the sustainable dissemination of the technologies and concepts developed. For this purpose guidelines will be written and published. Furthermore, the results will be implemented in national and European soil databases. The present state of technologies and future perspectives will  also be transferred to authorities, providers of technologies (SMEs), and end users through workshops at regional level, international conferences and publications throughout the duration of the project.", 119253.0, 4011743.0, "ISOIL", "Digital soil maps for all of Europe", "Essential groundwork is being laid for the provision of digital soil maps for Europe, which will be of great value to those responsible for managing these important natural resources.", "Soil degradation is a growing environmental threat that affects water and air quality, biodiversity and climate change. To manage this problem, we must first understand its extent. This can only be accomplished by soil mapping, an often imprecise and costly undertaking.\n\nScientists are taking a fresh approach to this subject in the context of the 'Interactions between soil related sciences \u2013 linking geophysics, soil science and digital soil mapping' (Isoil) project. Financial support from the EU is being used to evaluate a number of new soil sampling techniques.\n\nThe Isoil team narrowed its focus to mobile, non-destructive methods in order to reduce time requirements while expanding geographical coverage. Emphasis was placed on reproducibility of results. Soil samples have been collected to help derive the relationship between sensor feedback and actual data, which is expressed as a geophysical transfer function. Finally, models are proving extremely useful for examining the connection between soil features and geophysical parameters.\n\nOther important work being performed by the Isoil scientists includes development of guidance to harmonise efforts by soil researchers spread across the globe. Standards for specific methods are also in progress. Dissemination of this information, which is accomplished through dedicated workshops, is therefore an integral component of the project.", null, "http://www.allied-associates.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2011-04/45919.jpg", "fp7_88638_998866037"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LU5"}
