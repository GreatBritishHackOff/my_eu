Original predictions over the longevity of constructed wetlands were approximately 50 -100 years (Conley et al 1991).  However, it has become disappointingly apparent that these systems are clogging and have on average a lifetime of less than 10 years (Griffin et al 2008). Currently when a wetland becomes clogged, the whole site has to be refurbished and the reeds regrown, which takes several years and has significant economic consequences for the operators.\n\nOur project ARBI aims to develop and trial an Autonomous Reed Bed Installation containing a magnetic resonance probe, can be deployed in several locations within a wetland to give measurements at different depths.  By measuring the relaxation times of MR, sufficient information can be obtained to determine the clog state of the gravel bed of a wetland. This would enable the operators to isolate those areas of the bed where the problem resides and make a partial intervention, without the need to remove and re-plant the whole reed bed. When the system is  developed, we will have potential for application in other water treatment systems based on subsurface flows like: slow rate sand filters, and river bank filtration.\n\nThe project will have major benefits for those organisations who would like to install reedbeds but  have resisted doing because of concerns over performance and maintenance costs.  These will increase the potential size of the market for reedbed installers and benefit the SMEs in the consortium who currently are operating in a constrained market which has not achieved its true potential.", 196986.0, 1203108.0, "ARBI", "Improving reed bed water treatment", "A green technology that uses reed beds to treat wastewater is receiving a major boost thanks to an EU initiative extending the system's working life.", "There are over 12\u00a0000 constructed wetlands across Europe, which are used to further treat wastewater that has already been passed through water treatment plants. The wetlands usually comprise a gravel bed planted with reeds through which the wastewater passes and is purified by biofilms of microorganisms living on the gravel's surface.\n\nOriginal predictions for the working life of constructed wetlands were 50-100 years. However, because the gravel becomes clogged, this figure has been drastically revised to an average lifetime of less than 10 years. Furthermore, refurbishing the system is both time consuming and expensive, and disrupts the water treatment process.\n\nThe EU-funded project http://www.arbi-eu.com/ (ARBI) (Autonomous reed bed installations) is developing a system containing magnetic resonance sensors, which give prior warning of clogging. The probes can provide measurements of the clog state of the gravel bed at different depths, enabling the problem to be isolated and speedily dealt with. This means that the entire reed bed does not need to be removed and replanted.\n\nARBI will be a modular system that offers a step change in constructed wetland technology, supplying an off-the-shelf solution. This can be easily tailored to customers' needs with regard to treatment volume and contaminant level by simply using multiple modules.\n\nThe system monitors clogging and helps maintain optimal conditions with minimal need for human intervention. Once it is successfully developed, it could be applied to other water treatment systems based on subsurface flows. These include slow-rate sand filters and river bank filtration.\n\nARBI will benefit those organisations that wish to install reed beds for water treatment, but were discouraged by concerns over cost and performance. It will therefore enable environmentally friendly constructed wetland treatments to be used far more widely than previously thought possible.", null, "http://www.armreedbeds.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-07/159212.jpg", "fp7_109925_989189802"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WS15"}
