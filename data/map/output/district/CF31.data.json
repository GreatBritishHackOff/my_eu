Understanding how best to configure and re-configure a global production network, set against rapidly changing product-service requirements is one such complex problem area. This project aims to provide services that support the design and provision of flexible interoperable networks of production systems that can rapidly and accurately be re-configured. The metaphor employed is \u2018to start with an new business idea in the morning and have all required data and networks understood by the afternoon\u2019\n\nTo achieve this FLEXINET takes the view that new product-service global production network modelling methods and models are needed that can model business cases and identify the critical network relations and knowledge that underlies the business operation. In addition, FLEXINET takes the fundamental view that complex manufacturing systems which involve multiple partners and multiple complex network constraints,  require a semantically rigorous formal foundation upon which to base the flexible re-configuration of global production networks.\n\nBased on the exploitation of these technologies, FLEXINET will deliver a set of configuration services for flexible network design, applicable to both OEMs and SMEs, that will enable 'what-if' comparisons of costs, risks, configuration evaluations and product-service compliance requirements for alternative production network designs. FLEXINET will achieve this aim by working with its industrial partners from the industrial pump, white goods and food sectors and exploiting the world leading expertise of its partners in business modelling, business evaluation methods, risk management, manufacturing semantics, manufacturing knowledge sharing, manufacturing eco-systems, product-service systems, SME collaboration, SOA, Interoperability and standardisation.'", 256435.0, 3995087.0, "FLEXINET", null, null, null, null, "http://www.control2k.co.uk", null, "fp7_108887_997361470"], ["3WT", "Future Internet Technologies for MANufacturing", "Sematronix Limited", "According to the 2010 EC Competitiveness Report, Manufacturing is still the driving force of Europe's economy, contributing over \u20ac 6553 billion in GDP and providing more than 30 million jobs.

Secondary aluminium recycling and ceramic processing were identified as key examples with economically recoverable waste heat.

The Smartrec system meets these challenges by development of a standard, modular solution for integration of heat recovery with thermal storage that valorises medium to high grade waste heat, adaptable to different temperatures and industries. Following end-user analysis and characterisation of exhaust streams and waste products, full life cycle costing and assessment will be carried out with candidate molten salts selected for thermal storage and heat transfer fluid, validated by corrosion testing. A custom heat pipe heat exchanger will be modelled and designed around the requirements of heat transport capacity wick structure and capable of heat exchange with a molten salt pumping loop.

A pilot Smartrec system will be constructed and deployed in a secondary aluminium recycler and/or ceramic processor valorising high grade heat for continuous energy-intensive salt-cake recycling. Smartrec will be validated by integration with existing systems with >6 months operation including a fully developed instrumentation framework.

The waste heat recovery market is projected to exceed \u20ac45,0 billion by 2018, but for this projection to materialise and for the European manufacturing and user industry to benefit from these developments, technological improvements and innovations should take place aimed at improving the energy efficiency of heat recovery equipment and reducing installed costs. The overall aim of the project is to develop and demonstrate technologies and processes for efficient and cost effective heat recovery from industrial facilities in the temperature range 70 oC to 1000 oC and the optimum integration of these technologies with the existing energy system or for over the fence export of recovered heat and generated electricity if appropriate.  To achieve this challenging aim, and ensure wide application of the technologies and approaches developed, the project brings together a very strong consortium comprising of RTD providers, technology providers and more importantly large and SME users who will provide demonstration sites for the technologies. The project will focus on two-phase innovative heat transfer technologies (heat pipes-HP) for the recovery of heat from medium and low temperature sources and the use of this heat for; a) within the same facility or export over the fence; b) for generation of electrical power; or a combination of (a) and (b) depending on the needs. For power generation the project will develop and demonstrate at industrial sites the Trilateral Flush System (TFC) for low temperature waste heat sources, 70 oC to 200 oC and the Supercritical Carbon Dioxide System (sCO2) for temperatures above 200 oC.

In parallel, the manufacturing processes of the future are changing and need to be highly flexible and dynamic in order to satisfy customer demands for, e.g. large series production, mass customization, or changing orders.\nTo keep pace with the needs of the manufacturing industry of the future, in Manufacturing 4.0 companies need to flexibly react to these demands and be able to offer production capacities in a rapid way. Thus companies looking for manufacturing capacity need to be supported by the means to find these capacities, configure them, and integrate them into their own manufacturing processes.\nTo achieve this, one obvious approach is to port successful concepts from the field of Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS) and Cloud computing to manufacturing to mirror agile collaboration through flexible and scalable manufacturing processes: \n\u2022 Leasing and releasing manufacturing assets in an on-demand, utility-like fashion.\n\u2022 Rapid elasticity through scaling leased assets up and down if necessary.\n\u2022 Pay-per-use through metered service.\nApplying these principles, Cloud manufacturing can move manufacturing processes from production-oriented to service-oriented networks by modelling single manufacturing assets as services in a similar way as SaaS or PaaS solutions. By modelling all process steps and manufacturing assets as services it is possible to realize cross-organization manufacturing orchestrations and integrate distributed resources and ultimately manufacture products more efficiently.\nWhile the theoretical foundations for Cloud manufacturing are manifest there are no proven tools and technologies exist in the market - CREMA aims to change this fact by providing Cloud-based Rapid Elastic Manufacturing based on SaaS and Cloud model.", 326640.0, 4284564.0, "CREMA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.tanet.org.uk", null, "h2020_193459_999733605"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3DF", "EUROTRAIN: Euroform : LE TRAIN DE L'EUROPE !", "Bridgend College", 9580.0, "Since 2010, Les Cordeliers School has been regularly involved in several European projects. Our school is located in the heart of Auvergne rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Region very close to Clermont-Ferrand city centre.\r\nEurope is an integral part of our school project.\r\nOur primary school is currently involved in a Comenius project.  Our secondary school has a focus on Spanish language and every year plans a school trip to Spain or England. Within the High Vocational School, the implementation of a General Mobility Corrdinator and the opening of a Euro Section focused on English has improved the opening of students toward Europe.\r\nThe main goal of our project is to give our students more skills to help them develop autonomy and self-confidence but also develop essential linguistic skills which will help them continue in further education and get a job.\r\nOur project involves around thirty students over a period of 24 months. These students are either deeply involved in the European section or simply wish to do one of their training periods working for a European company. The students are preparing one of the 3 BTEC diplomas that were available in our school (Commerce, Hosting and Reception work , Health Care and Chils Care). These students are not used to travelling, living and working in a foreign country but they are extremely motivated to make the most of this experience. Students are selected by the Eurostaff of the school ( School Headmistress, the Chief Supervisor, the Information Officer, the Euromobility,Coordinator, the English teacher  and 2 trade teachers in charge of the European Section Course.\r\nThe strength of our partnerships with Scottish companies allows us to continue working with them and we now see them as solid partners. We have had a great feedback from them and we are therefore willing to strengthen our relationships. These companies truly get involved in the training of our students. Some of them have even offered summer jobs to our students.\r\nOur partners work with the national translated assessment grids and fully understand the purposes of these exchanges.\r\nThe students work on practicable activities. The idea for them is to live a successful experience and that\u2019s why the training objectives are explained in advance and the evaluation criteria are known well before the arrival of students. Each company tutor is involved, in collaboration with the teacher in charge of the student, in the validation of skills acquired. These evaluations are made during the last week of training when the teacher comes to take back the students back to France.\r\nExtra teaching hours are implemented for these students (2 hours per week) to prepare the trip. The preparatory work is educational, cultural and linguistic. Students take part in the full organization of their European experience. The work is done on the knowledge, knowhow but also life skills. \r\nOnce they have returned from their training period abroad the students have to write a placement report. They also write an internship report which will be their support for the oral examination in order to get the certificate Europro and the European mention* (*only for students who registered to the European section from the beginning).\r\nWe have had several articles in the local daily newspaper La Montagne linked to the European trip our students.\r\nWe also share all the information about our \u201cEuropean\u201d students on our website and during our open door sessions.\r\nWe have been engaged in European projects for several years now. Former students have learnt how to put forward their \u201cmobility\u201d skills and have used these new skills to continue their studies or to improve their CVs in the case of a job search. Some of them have gone for a new training period in the same companies and others, who have really enjoyed the time abroad, have decided to go and live 6 months in a European country, working in a restaurant or a pub.\r\nFrom 2017, we start experimenting a new project with a similar Vocational school in Wales. In March 2017, we will welcome 4 Welsh students + one accompanying teacher.
