The mobilities consists of altogether 8 students divided into two periods. EGU in Copenhagen is receiving in the first round and Doncaster College in the second round.\r\n\r\nBy participating in this mobility the learners will have the opportunity to see how an enterprise in a foreign country is working and the conditions for workers etc. The learners\u00b4 understanding for the international labour market is widened as well as their vocational skills. The ability and chances for integration to the labour market is strengthened as they can show to others that they have fulfilled a vocational training abroad and by that also widened their work experience.  \r\n\r\nThe mobilities for the learners is primarily aimed to gain their employability as a whole for the target group,and for Hagagymnasiet/SCS as a school it aims towards deepening and strengthening our connection to our european network. Apart from that there is an aim for Second Chance School in Norrk\u00f6ping  locally,regionally and on a european network level to become a role model and thereby encourage other organisations to get the will and power to widen their target groups\u00b4views by showing that this vulnerable group, after extensive preparation and safe monitoring has the ability to participate in successful mobilities.\r\n\r\nThe common denominator for this target group is that they have a very bad experience of the school system and has felt great failure , often combined with fear for new situations. Educational,social and economic disadvantages together with well documented difficulties to achieve the knowledge necessary for succeeding in mainstream education,makes the picture of the target group even clearer. A lot of the learners in the target group has never had the opportunity to go abroad and has very little knowledge to other cultures, languages and what the european citizenship means. Many of our students are immigrants from non Europe- countries, and have lack of knowledge and experience of european citizenship.\r\n\r\nIt requires a vast amount of motivational preparations for the learners to dare to participate in a mobility in a foreign country. The success of a project of this nature is depending on that we,as a sending organisation ,take the learners\u00b4social situation as well as individual needs into consideration during the preparation phase. The prerequisite for the mobility to succeed is that the learners are accompanied by a safe and experienced adult who can support the learners during all phases of the project , especially the time spent abroad. \r\n\r\nThe projects\u00b4qualitative targets, on a personal level, are to strengthen the learners\u00b4self-confidence and self-esteem and to improve their social skills. Educational goals are to raise their motivation for further studies and to support the lifelong learning, to develop vocational skills as well as to improve their language skills. Socially , the aim for the learners are to make new personal contacts which can lead to interpersonal friendship. They will also get an increased understanding for different cultures as well as a wider understanding of the world around them so that they can get a deeper understanding for the european perspective of education as well as the labour market. \r\nAltogether the project is expected to contribute to the learners\u00b4ability to integration into society both in a social and labour market perspective. \r\n\r\nThe added value for these learners will become extra large , when despite weak odds they will manage to handle the stay abroad as well as their vocational training..\r\n\r\nThe plan is that the mobilities will take place in the span between March to May in each year.\r\nThe exact time is expected to be set in a later stage since we plan to coordinate the actions with our joint partners applications for mobilities to Norrk\u00f6ping.", "http://www.don.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA102-034264_1"], ["2RF", "Echanges, Savoir-faire, Culture et Apprentissage des Langues en Europe", "DONCASTER COLLEGE", 326849.0, "The Greater East Region has been committed since 2009 as part of its policy of security of life courses a proactive policy to promote European and international mobility of apprentices. Under section 8 of the Act of March the 5th, 2014 promoting vocational learning in France and the framework of strategic guidelines for the quality of learning in Grand Est, the Regional Council wants to encourage more European mobility of apprentices. Indeed, European mobility is a way to improve the vocational learning of apprentices and their skills related to social-economic issues. This regional project is for the apprentices from V and IV levels, who aren\u2019t very mobile, it will be coordinated by the Regional Council of Grand Est and associates 19 vocational training centers providing different domains of training (crafts, agriculture, catering trade, construction, services ...) from level V to level III. It aims to offer these apprentices the opportunity to experience a first work placement in Europe and acquire new professional, personal and language skills. Mobility, organized in groups, wants to be a leverage for building character of the apprentice, to strengthen its perception of the environment that surrounds him, to sharpen its ability to adapt to new constraints and at different working methods. The project will allow 556 apprentices to stop in the UK, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Hungary, Czech Republic and other European countries in order to perform an internship during 2 or 3 weeks, and to benefit a preparation before departure between June 2017 and May 2019. This project will allow the mutualisation of human, technical and financial resources regarding the management and coordination of the project and ensure that Erasmus + funds are best used for the participants and their preparation for departure. Access to new skills is a challenge for the apprentices given the privileged geographical position border of Grand Est (only French region on the borders of three member states of the European Union - Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany \u2013 and Switzerland) which offers interesting job opportunities.
