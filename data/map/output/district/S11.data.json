It will focus on the challenges posed by the engineering and the operation of technical systems in which computing  and communication systems interact  with large complex  physical  systems. Its approach will be simultaneously integrative, aiming at bringing together knowledge from different SoS  related communities and applications driven.It will bridge between the different approaches to the design, analysis and control of systems of systems that are pursued by different communities in theory and applications and relate  the methods and tools proposed for dealing with SoS  to key application domains which are important  for Europe's competiveness as well as for the well-being of its citizens.  The project will examine in depth  application-specific issues, capture cross-industry and cross-application findings and propose new avenues for SoS  analysis, design and control, towards a science of systems of systems and a European R&I agenda on SoS,  involving different scientific communities, application domain  experts, end-users and vendors.Three  Working Groups will be created:  on SoS  in Transportation and Logistics,  Physically connected SoS, and Tools for SoS  Engineering and Management. Public events will be organised in conjunction with the Working Group meetings, floor will be given to SoS-related projects to expose their outcomes. The contributions will be summarized in a concise strategic policy document 'European Research and Innovation  Agenda on Cyber-physical Systems of Systems', supported by a set of in-depth  technical papers, and presented at a symposium 'Cyber-physical Systems of Systems Meeting Societal Challenges'. The project will prepare the EU stakeholders for extracting a competitive advantage from the recent and the future developments in the area of SoS.<br/>", 81976.0, 532477.0, "CPSoS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_109698_950462358"], ["9SA", "Development of a Strategic Research and Innovation Roadmap for Future Architectures and Services for Manufacturing in Europe and Derivation of Business Opportunities", "Thhink Wireless Technologies Limited", "In the global economy, European manufacturers face increased competitive pressure and continuous innovation is required to remain competitive. ICT offer a seemingly boundless source of innovation, promising to deliver precisely the capabilities European manufacturing businesses require to remain competitive and to furthermore enable them to run their business in a sustainable way. However, the potential of ICT in manufacturing is far from being fully exploited.<br/>Towards making ICT an enabler for innovation in manufacturing, employing suitable IT architectures and services is of fundamental importance. In manufacturing, however, these are in many cases not in place because a) decision makers are not aware of the most suitable architectures and services, b) decision makers may be sceptical towards novel paradigms, c) novel paradigms may not be tailored to meet the demanding manufacturing requirements or d) promising paradigms may indeed not have been discovered for manufacturing.<br/>The Road4FAME project has been conceived to respond to this situation by developing a holistic research and innovation roadmap for architectures and services, aligned with the concrete needs and requirements of manufacturing. In the roadmapping process, promising paradigms and concepts shall be evaluated with respect to their applicability and utility as architectures and services in manufacturing. The roadmap will serve to guide the R&D of architectures and services to match precisely the requirements of European manufacturing businesses. Furthermore, the Road4FAME project will yield strategy recommendations and outline business opportunities tailored to decision makers of European manufacturing businesses enabling them to harness the potential of ICT through the right architectures and services. Lastly, the Road4FAME project will contribute to building a constituency united by the commonly faced challenges and their common quest for the right architectures and services to address these.<br/>", 68965.0, 815934.0, "Road4FAME", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_109151_958028455"], ["8FT", "Retrofit all-Electric Bus for reduced Operator Operating costs in urban Transport (REBOOT)", "Magnetic Systems Technology Limited", "The REBOOT project aims to significantly improve the competitiveness of European urban bus operators through the development of a retrofit all-electric drive system that replaces diesel engines.

As the embedded world meets the Internet world there will be an increasing number of interacting systems with strong connectivity utilised in both society and in industry. Platforms4CPS targets the transport, manufacturing, energy and health sectors. Europe is a world leader in the area of time-critical and safety-critical systems and to maintain this position there is a need to be able to design, develop and deploy highly distributed and connected digital technologies. There is a move towards increased autonomy and a need to meet demanding safety, security, power efficiency, performance, size and cost constraints. Underlying this is a need to develop a foundational background to create the \u201cscience of systems integration\u201d to manage the complexity of future CPS. Platforms for CPS deployment are also seen as being key for the future, however, these can only become successful if a supporting ecosystem of developers and users is created. Platforms4CPS thus aims to \u201ccreate the vision, strategy, technology building blocks and supporting ecosystem for future CPS applications\u201d with three key objectives to: \n- Create a vision and strategy for future European CPS by analyzing the ecosystem and market perspective and strategically updating and validating existing CPS roadmaps across multiple domains\n- Promote platform building, bringing together industry and academic experts and create a repository of CPS technology building blocks \n- Build an ecosystem by creating a constituency and through cooperating with ECSEL, ITEA, and ARTEMIS projects on the foundations of CPS engineering, and consensus-building on societal and legal issues related to the deployment of CPS\nThe overall objective directly addresses the call objectives in ICT 1-2016b to maintain and develop Europe\u2019s competitive lead in CPS by capitalizing and bringing together expertise for successful exploitation of ICT", 155777.0, 873577.0, "Platforms4CPS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_205961_958028455"], ["8FT", "Retrofit all-Electric Bus for reduced Operator Operating costs in urban Transport (REBOOT)", "Magnetic Systems Technology Limited", "MAGTEC are the UK's largest supplier of hybrid and electric drive systems, we have  a 22 year history and reputation for innovative automotive component and electric drive system design and manufacture.

A synergy between experts in ICT policies and in ICT technologies is a unique feature of PICASSO. An analysis of the industrial drivers, societal needs, and priorities for EU-US ICT collaboration will be done, and policy gaps will be highlighted. An Opportunity Report will point out new avenues for EU-US research, innovation and policy collaboration. An \u201cICT Industry Toolkit\u201d app will support companies and academia in exploiting collaboration opportunities. Policy briefs focusing on specific aspects of identified policy gaps will provide visibility for EU policies and propose ways forward. Strategic initiatives will be investigated and discussed, and a White Paper will be prepared. The outreach campaign will include 30\\ events, success stories factsheets, info sessions and webinars.
