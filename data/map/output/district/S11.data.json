Its approach will be simultaneously integrative, aiming at bringing together knowledge from different SoS  related communities and applications driven.It will bridge between the different approaches to the design, analysis and control of systems of systems that are pursued by different communities in theory and applications and relate  the methods and tools proposed for dealing with SoS  to key application domains which are important  for Europe's competiveness as well as for the well-being of its citizens.  The project will examine in depth  application-specific issues, capture cross-industry and cross-application findings and propose new avenues for SoS  analysis, design and control, towards a science of systems of systems and a European R&I agenda on SoS,  involving different scientific communities, application domain  experts, end-users and vendors.Three  Working Groups will be created:  on SoS  in Transportation and Logistics,  Physically connected SoS, and Tools for SoS  Engineering and Management. Public events will be organised in conjunction with the Working Group meetings, floor will be given to SoS-related projects to expose their outcomes. The contributions will be summarized in a concise strategic policy document 'European Research and Innovation  Agenda on Cyber-physical Systems of Systems', supported by a set of in-depth  technical papers, and presented at a symposium 'Cyber-physical Systems of Systems Meeting Societal Challenges'.

ICT offer a seemingly boundless source of innovation, promising to deliver precisely the capabilities European manufacturing businesses require to remain competitive and to furthermore enable them to run their business in a sustainable way. However, the potential of ICT in manufacturing is far from being fully exploited.<br/>Towards making ICT an enabler for innovation in manufacturing, employing suitable IT architectures and services is of fundamental importance. In manufacturing, however, these are in many cases not in place because a) decision makers are not aware of the most suitable architectures and services, b) decision makers may be sceptical towards novel paradigms, c) novel paradigms may not be tailored to meet the demanding manufacturing requirements or d) promising paradigms may indeed not have been discovered for manufacturing.<br/>The Road4FAME project has been conceived to respond to this situation by developing a holistic research and innovation roadmap for architectures and services, aligned with the concrete needs and requirements of manufacturing. In the roadmapping process, promising paradigms and concepts shall be evaluated with respect to their applicability and utility as architectures and services in manufacturing. The roadmap will serve to guide the R&D of architectures and services to match precisely the requirements of European manufacturing businesses.

Ananda Gaorii hosts regular workshops, classes, retreats and trainings in the areas of yoga and meditation, health, permaculture and a wide range of subjects related to building sustainable and harmonious communities. It can accommodate up to 60 people indoors and up to a few hundred during the warmer months when camping is possible.  Ananda Gaorii also has a commercial organic bakery which delivers bread and cakes to Copenhagen and the local area. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are 1) To provide long term residents and participants (including the EVS volunteers) with non-formal learning experiences that will strengthen their community living skills, deepen their personal growth, give them tools to improve their physical and mental health, broaden their vision and give them an opportunity to learn the values and competencies related to living sustainably and managing an active project; 2) To offer short term learning experiences to those who attend the classes, retreats, workshops and trainings offered at Ananda Gaorii or who simply visit Ananda Gaorii to see what we are doing. 3) To benefit the local community by organizing activities which help support and integrate refugees and build a more resilient community;  4) To strengthen our engagement  and cooperation with other organizations sharing similar goals. 5) To encourage volunteering. \r\n\r\nThe activities of the project include: planning and organizing the daily life of the community; learning and practicing yoga and meditation including an option to learn how to teach basic yoga classes; building, maintenance, renovation and interior design; growing food; developing systems for recycling and efficient use of resources; creating small projects for generating income or improving the daily life of the community; hosting and promoting workshops, retreats and classes; looking after the project's website and social media; guiding and coordinating short term volunteers; engaging refugees in cultural and learning activities; participating in farmer's markets and other local activities; exploring the local region; music and learning evenings; swimming at the beach. Between ten to twenty short and long term volunteers are normally present on the project so the duties and responsibilities will be shared amongst all according to individual abilities, interests and the needs of the moment. \r\n\r\nSix volunteers have been selected with skills and talents matching the activities of the project, with good prior experience in local volunteering,  and who showed a great deal of enthusiasm for the lifestyle and values of the project. \r\n\r\nThe methodology used in carrying out the project is non-formal education - a combination of full immersion in a community lifestyle; learning by doing; personal research; mentoring and some participation in classes and workshops. \r\n\r\nThe main results and impacts we envisage are happier, more confident, more aware and more capable young people playing active and useful roles in creating more harmonious and sustainable communities.  We also envisage our own organization and our partner organizations acquiring new competencies and being able to do better work through cooperation and mutual learning. Finally we envisage a more aware, resilient and harmonious local community in which refugees feel more welcome and feel they have more opportunities for establishing themselves successfully in the area. The potential long term benefits are a healthier, happier and more sustainable world.", "http://www.youthdiscoveryventures.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-3-DK01-KA105-046768_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "S11"}
