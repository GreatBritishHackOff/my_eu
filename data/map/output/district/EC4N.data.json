This leads, in an aging society, to increasing personal, social and economic burden. To date, basically only symptomatic treatment is available, which application almost always leads to the feeling of dependence and lose of self-control in (a) person(s) with PD (PwP's). A further shortcoming in PD-related treatment is the limited quality of disease state-defining parameters. Recent ICT-associated projects have mainly been focusing on the 'observation' of the user rather than giving feedback to him/her, and they bear little resemblance or application to the reality of living with PD. In addition, obtrusive measurements influenced results in particular in PwP's due to disease-caused neural network changes.The aim of the SENSE-PARK project is to develop an unobtrusive and empowering information system for use in the home environment, which provides the users with practical, engaging and motivating tools to monitor patterns in their condition. In more detail, the SENSE-PARK system will inform the users about motor and non-motor functioning in daily life activities ('being', data collection via RFID sensors and a wrist-worn data logger), leisure activities ('belonging', data collection via gaming console and adapted interface) & scientific environment ('becoming', for validation).The project will include PwP's at central positions to ensure the development of a user-friendly and effective system, and consequent dissemination. In addition, with the SENSE-PARK system, disease course-associated parameters which are provided to the user can also be provided to the doctor, to enable an intense and transparent at-the-point discussion between two specialists of the disease. The system will enable a more continuous, thorough and objective appraisal of changes during disease course with a far wider and more objective perspective, than clinical evaluation can provide.", 234533.0, 2271163.0, "SENSE-PARK", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_100801_964640460"], ["4UA", "Green Retrofitting of Existing Ships", "V.DELTA Limited", "Traditionally, the environmental performance of ships in terms of air emissions has never been among the primary concerns of the maritime industry. However, this situation is bound to change considering that the greening of the transportation sector is imminent and unavoidable. This tendency is manifested with activities ranging from regularly published statistics regarding the air pollution of general industrial activity up to the Energy Efficiency Design and Operation Index that are currently being considered at IMO.\nThe greening of shipping operations has to do with more than just the amount of NOx, SOx and CO2 gases emitted at any period of time: the fact that for every tonne of fuel burnt approximately three tonnes of CO2 are produced indicates that the environmental performance of ships is linked to their cost-effectiveness. As a result, consistent energy management onboard will become a priority for rule compliance, and robustness against unpredictable financial fluctuations.\nAcknowledging that newly build ships will comply with the environmental regulations from the outset and will be more advantageous in comparison to existing ones, REFRESH will address the aspects of retrofitting that are essential for improving the energy efficiency onboard. The central concept of REFRESH is the dynamic energy modelling, i.e. the simulation of the energy production, consumption and losses over time. This idea will be implemented in a decision support tool that will allow onboard and ashore personnel to monitor the performance of the ship and adopt appropriate practices as a function of its operational profile.\nThe objectives of REFRESH are:\n\u2022\tDevelopment of dynamic energy modelling routines;\n\u2022\tOptimisation of the energy efficiency and air emissions for retrofitting and operation;\n\u2022\tDevelopment of a monitoring and management methodology for operation; and\n\u2022\tDevelopment of a decision support tool for operation.", 245527.0, 3428767.0, "REFRESH", "Increasing energy efficiency in ships", "Shipping is the lifeblood of the modern economy, vital for European businesses to stay afloat.

Operators are urgently called to follow more environmentally friendly practices, while also maintaining profitability.\n\nScientists initiated the EU-funded project 'Green retrofitting of existing ships' (http://www.refreshproject.eu/ (REFRESH)) to make passenger ships more eco-friendly. Focusing on the existing merchant fleet, REFRESH makes energy efficiency an integral part of the ship life cycle.\n\nFor operators to have sufficient insight into a ship's energy performance, REFRESH is identifying underperforming systems and components and virtually replacing them with alternative ones. Furthermore, as emission calculations are correlated to fuel consumption, it is investigating their effect on key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\nScientists will perform on-board energy audits to assess the current status of existing ships. These will help recommend technical solutions that should improve energy consumption as well as draw up shipyard specifications to implement these changes in retrofitting projects.\n\nAlong with the energy audits, scientists will introduce dynamic energy models of energy flows to simulate numerous combinations of environmental and loading conditions. Based on these different scenarios (e.g. full load condition and nominal speed), the optimal KPIs should be identified.\n\nAnother achievement will be the development of a life cycle energy management system. This will collect data from various on-board components and compare values with the optimal or predicted fuel consumption ones, advising the crew accordingly.\n\nOperators have already provided a list of six ships to perform energy audits. Based on the data collected, scientists have identified a number of energy deficiency issues and suggested actions both operationally or retrofitting-wise. Known as energy-saving potentials, these solutions have been analysed in terms of technical and economic feasibility.\n\nNewly built ships will comply with environmental regulations from the outset and will be more advantageous compared to existing ones.

Structural biology was going to rationalize drug design. Next, combinatorial chemistry was to be the industrial panacea, only to be superseded by high-throughput screening of chemical libraries. Technologies such as molecular cell biology, in silico modelling, genetic engineering and NMR, are now also part of an ever-evolving set of tools and approach that researchers need to keep pace. This changing technological landscape is also affecting employment. Technological advances are also making some skills less marketable, while creating demands for other skills that have not traditionally been associated with drug development. Scientists that can communicate across disciplines are increasingly in demand and those with multidisciplinary skills are at a premium.

Individual aaRS are highly conserved across bacteria, enabling the discovery of broad-spectrum antibacterials. To reduce the likelihood of resistance, NABARSI will look for NCEs with inhibitory activity against multiple aaRS enzymes. InhibOx and LIOS will design NCEs by rational and fragment based drug discovery methods followed by synthetic structure optimization. To increase chemical diversity, virtual screening of large (>100 M) compound libraries available at InhibOx will be performed. Limitations of previous aaRS inhibitors will be overcome by novel approaches such as the In Omnia assay: activity of the compounds on pathogenic aaRS enzyme is measured inside a human cell, allowing rejection of compounds acting through human aaRS and identifying compounds that cross biological membranes. The expertise of Leeds in mode of action studies will be used at an early stage. Activity of the NCEs on clinical isolates of MDR strains available at ErasmusMC will be assessed.
