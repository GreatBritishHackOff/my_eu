Increasing the uptake of RES is crucial if Europe is to achieve ambitious energy and emission reduction targets. However, despite steep increases in energy prices the uptake of domestic RES is still very limited. The initial investment required means that the payback period frequently exceeds 20 years, which is a clear disincentive to homeowners. This is mainly due to the cost associated with integration of RES within domestic heating and hot water systems, and is especially relevant if a combination of RES are deployed. The efficiency of these technologies is also often limited due to the inherent mismatch between energy supply and consumption. This can be overcome by deploying a suitably sized thermal store. However, this is often difficult due to space constraints in existing homes. Furthermore, effective combination and use of multiple RES is complicated by the lack of standardised intelligent controls and the sheer number and types of systems available. These factors limit the appeal of RES and virtually prevent customers from adding capacity over time. The main objective of SmartHeat is to develop a platform technology for domestic heating and hot water that enables easy and cost effective integration and use of multiple RES. The key enabling technologies include: i) a common, intelligent control system capable of effectively utilising a combination of RES and thermal stores; ii) a modular phase change material store that enables increased thermal storage within existing buildings. We will be able to a) demonstrate up to 50% reduction in installation costs for a combination of RES; b) a 20% performance improvement for an air source heat pump and up to 25% for a solar thermal system. As a result we will be able to reduce payback by up to 50% for a wide range of RES, heating and hot water system combinations", 29070.0, 2271765.0, "SMARTHEAT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.hothousetechnologies.co.uk", null, "fp7_97982_992540085"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0EU", "Vetrina Skills Lab in Europe", "National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland", 469295.0, "The need for Tuscan turistic entrepreneurs is to maintain a high standard of services offered, with a level of quality that will satisfy demanding and well prepared customers (national and international), in order to fight the global economic crisis.\r\nThe needs of recent graduates from VET schools is to specialize, to acquire new skills on turistic sector by consequence of the potential of job opportunities offered by the sector.\r\nThese two worlds are the demand and supply to meet that need to find a mutual benefit and profit.\r\nFor these reasons, the Regional Council of Tuscany, since 2001, has been promoting the programme \"VETRINA TOSCANA\" (Network of enhancement of the typical Tuscan products that involve different economic and institutional actors) and that from three yeras ago included in the Special Programme of Regional Development (PRSE) and considered as an excellent model of communication and promotion of tourism.\r\nThe project \"Vetrina Toscana in Europa\" (VET -EU) aims to be connected to this regional programme, promoted by the Regional Council of Tuscany, in order to offer the opportunity of an internship abroad to the students of Tuscan Tourism and Catering VET schools, participating to some dedicated training courses carried out within the farmework of \"Vetrina Toscana\" Programme.\r\nThe VET-EU project is promoted by an articulated partnership of local actors (Tourism and Catering VET Schools institutional bodies, trade associations) and foreign partners.\r\nIt aims to offer students and recent graduates from VET schools in the turism industry of the provinces of Siena, Florence and Prato, a great opportunity to provide more and more qualified sector services by performing a high quality mobility experience at European level.
