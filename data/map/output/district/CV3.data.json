A powerful EU consortium is pursuing a multi-materials approach, developing the materials and joining technologies needed to meet the challenge.", "Reducing the weight of transport vehicles that run on internal combustion engines (ICEs) has become increasingly relevant in recent years as a route to reduced fuel consumption and emissions. Light weight is also a target of EV designers as it increases the somewhat limited driving range before recharging is necessary.\n\nInsight can be drawn from the years of research on ICE-powered vehicles, but key differences exist in design constraints and in crash behaviours. A powerful EU consortium launched the project 'Advanced high volume affordable lightweighting for future electric vehicles' (http://www.project-alive.eu/ (ALIVE)) to address all relevant issues.\n\nThe team is made up of 21 partners consisting of 7 car manufacturers, seven suppliers, 2 small and medium-sized enterprises, and 5 research organisations. The main target is an additional 20\u00a0% reduction in weight beyond the 30\u00a0% decrease in body-in-white (BiW) weight already achieved by other projects. BiW refers to the vehicle body or shell after it is welded but before it is painted. Additional and equally important goals are to reduce time-to-market and development costs, enhance product flexibility, extend the lifetime of major components and decrease life-cycle costs.\n\nALIVE's approach centres on innovative materials and their respective assembly processes. The combination of new testing and simulation capabilities covers production, usage and crash scenarios. With all the tools for development and testing in place, the team has now arrived at its preliminary conceptual design of the complete vehicle. During the upcoming months, the design will be turned into a full-scale demonstrator of the lightweight multi-material strategy.\n\nScientists have been generating interest through presentation of the project at a number of important industry events such as the European Council for Automotive R&D (EUCAR) conference and the Electric Vehicle Symposium. Project success will put the EU in a leadership position of an emerging market on the verge of a major breakthrough and tremendous global uptake. Aside from the socioeconomic implications for the well-being of the EU economy and its citizens, widespread use of EVs will have major impact on emissions and global climate change.

Both solutions are brushless AC electrical machines: induction machine with fabricated and copper die-cast rotor (IM) and synchronous reluctance (SynRel) machine. Through their configurations these machines not only are rare-earth magnet free, but also share common features that can be exploited during the design step, as well in the manufacturing process. These common features lead to a complex synergy between the two technologies, which justify the development of different topologies of electric machines in just one project.\nThe design of the ReFreeDrive motors will take as a premise the reduction of use of materials, as more than half of the final price is formed by raw materials cost. Also, a minimization of manufacturing costs will be ensured by an early involvement of manufacturers, from the design stage. ReFreeDrive motor topologies have good room for cost reduction by off-setting permanent magnet use. However, it is not feasible to change the commodity prices for copper and steel. Therefore, one of the key avenues for cost reduction is the reduction of size through different techniques (outer rotor, higher rotational speed, compact winding\u2026).
