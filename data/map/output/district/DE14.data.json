Industrial manufacture of the selected alloy will be demonstrated, by the production of rolled rings; gravity cast and centrifugally cast samples; sheets, welding wire, and welded samples.\n\n\u2022\tTIMET UK Ltd., [TIMET] will be the Principal Participant, and will lead the Management of the project.\n\u2022\tSwansea University will lead the review of literature and prior industrial work. A candidate alloy (Ti\\) will be selected based on this review, and on commercial and industrial factors.\n\u2022\tTIMET will supply Ti\\ billets to Forgital Italy S.p.A. which will manufacture, heat treat, and sample rolled rings.\n\u2022\tTIMET will supply Ti\\ casting stock to Deritend International, which will manufacture stepped section cast samples by both gravity and centrifugal casting, aiming to overcome the prior low ductility reported in castings of highly creep resistant titanium alloys.\n\u2022\tTIMET will manufacture sheet; welding wire, and welded samples of the Ti\\ alloy. Significant process development work is required in this task.\n\u2022\tSwansea University will test the samples of the candidate to generate a database of mechanical properties for this titanium alloy in cast, wrought and welded forms and analyse the samples to rationalise the test results.\n\u2022\tThe tests will consist of tensile; creep; LCF; and fatigue crack propagation tests at both room temperature and 500 deg C. Also, tensile tests will be repeated after exposure to air at 500 deg C for extended time period, to check for deterioration in ductility.\n\u2022\tTIMET UK Ltd., will lead the reporting of the project, and the Participants will disseminate the results through industrial meetings with potential end users (principally Volvo Aero and Rolls Royce) and through publications in academic journals and conferences.", 49400.0, 631434.0, "GOTA", "Aeroengine alloys that enable reduced fuel consumption", "Aircraft engine designs are evolving to achieve higher efficiency for lower fuel consumption and emissions. A novel titanium alloy will enable higher operating temperatures to reach those goals.", "Higher service temperatures and pressures in the compressor are one of the requirements for many of these concepts.\nEU-funded scientists are seeking a titanium alloy suitable for long-term service in aeroengine intermediate compressor casings at 50 degrees Celsius higher temperature than the standard.\nTheir work is being done within the scope of the project 'Greater operating temperature alloy' (GOTA).\nThe material must not only withstand higher operating temperatures but also be compatible with industrial-scale casting, forging and welding of aerospace components.Within the first nine months, the team conducted property tests of samples, particularly as related to thermal behaviour.\nThe selected alloy, referred to as Ti+, exceeded targets for strength and creep resistance at elevated temperatures.\nTi+ was then subjected to preliminary forming tests, including sheet rolling, ring rolling, gravity and centrifugal casting, and button melting.\nSubsequent work will focus on optimising ductility of the processed alloy as well as modifying the alloy composition to further enhance baseline properties prior to forming.Preliminary results support the potential of the selected Ti+ alloy to be successfully used in intermediate compressor casings operating 50 degrees Celsius higher than the materials currently used.\nIncreasing the operating temperature and pressure of aeroengines will enable more efficient designs for decreased fuel consumption and thus lower carbon dioxide and nitric oxide emissions.\nThe resulting win-win situation will have economic benefits for the aerospace industry and environmental and health benefits for the EU and its citizens.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112641.jpg", "fp7_107161_952902975"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DE14"}
