Significant process development work is required in this task.\n\u2022\tSwansea University will test the samples of the candidate to generate a database of mechanical properties for this titanium alloy in cast, wrought and welded forms and analyse the samples to rationalise the test results.\n\u2022\tThe tests will consist of tensile; creep; LCF; and fatigue crack propagation tests at both room temperature and 500 deg C. Also, tensile tests will be repeated after exposure to air at 500 deg C for extended time period, to check for deterioration in ductility.\n\u2022\tTIMET UK Ltd., will lead the reporting of the project, and the Participants will disseminate the results through industrial meetings with potential end users (principally Volvo Aero and Rolls Royce) and through publications in academic journals and conferences.", 49400.0, 631434.0, "GOTA", "Aeroengine alloys that enable reduced fuel consumption", "Aircraft engine designs are evolving to achieve higher efficiency for lower fuel consumption and emissions.

The main task is not to learn from textbooks but only empirically through experience during multinational lessons and from lessons based on the abilities gained throughout the whole process. \r\nEach partner meeting will be divided into a few stages: experimenting with the tools, gathering data, their analysis with the use of Web 2.0 tools and presentation of these results in a number of forms including artistic expression.\r\nAll the activities are complementary to schools' curricula.\r\nStudents from partners countries will have a chance to experience the world from another perspective (being a part of an exchange program and sharing the life of their partners), break stereotypes and become more tolerant and open to differences. \r\n\r\nSOCIAL CONTEXT\r\nIn partner schools there are students with special needs and students that risk social exclusion. Some students\u2019 families have not got florid finances, so this project will give them the possibility to improve their English, increase their interests and motivation, develop international understanding and cooperation and enlarging their cultural horizons. This project can also give our students the opportunity to compare their culture, customs and knowledge with peers living in other countries of  Europe.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\n- Promote positive attitude towards school and education,\r\n- Encourage understanding about self-improvement especially within the process of self-education,\r\n- Raise awareness of critical age phenomenon,\r\n- Develop innovative strategies and methods in problem solving,\r\n- Encourage students to talk about their feelings and emotions,\r\n- Enable students to discover strategies of effective time management,\r\n- Provide students with a possibility to present their findings to European audience,\r\n- Study the educational practices of different countries,\r\n- Exchange best practices with the use of legal materials, \r\n- Develop students' and teachers' ICT skills, \r\n-Improve students' and teachers' competence of  English,\r\n-Disseminate the results to the partners' local and national communities and to the Erasmus + community,\r\n- Versify the methods used during the lessons, \r\n- Creating a database with innovative ELT materials and interactive tools to be possible to download to everyone interested\r\n- Motivate students to strive for a higher level of education.\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS:\r\nThere are 5 partner schools and we plan 4 short-term exchanges, each for 16 coming students and 16 hosts, each school will provide 2 responsible teachers to accompany them. Students will be matched according to a set of criteria, one of them being the similar age group. The coordinators from all partner schools have experience in either taking part of European projects or applying or simply working with partners on international level. Indirectly entire schools will benefit from the project as well as local communities involved in activities at meetings and during promotional activities disseminating our results. \r\nSharing the knowledge and experience will be boosted and diversified due to the combination of general schools and vocational ones, where students can learn from each other by mixing academic and practical subjects.", "http://www.paget.staffs.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PL01-KA219-038580_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DE14"}
