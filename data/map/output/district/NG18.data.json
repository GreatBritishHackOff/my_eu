A single Microdry unit will run off mains electricity be capable of drying a room in just 10% of the time taken by current technologies. We will develop an intelligent control system that will measure the reflected microwaves to determine residual moisture content and adjust the power output accordingly to maximise efficiency. The Microdry system will require no human intervention and will communicate to an end user when the drying process is finished. The magnitude and frequency of floods are likely to increase in the future as a result of climate change i.e. higher rainfall intensities and rising sea levels. Equally, the impact of flood events will increase, because in excess of 50 million European citizens now live in areas at risk of flooding with business and industry also located in such areas. Current drying operations require up to 8 weeks before remedial work can be undertaken on the building. This extends the time required before a building can revert to normal use with economic and social consequences. To remedy this situation we need to develop an emitter to direct the microwave energy to target areas without regular human intervention. This will use a feedback system to measure moisture content and actively control microwave power to the emitter. Telecommunications components will provide communication between the unit and operator and comprehensive safety features will ensure that microwave hazards are eliminated.", 32156.0, 1167188.0, "MICRODRY", null, null, null, "http://microdry.pera.com", "http://www.rainbow-int.co.uk", null, "fp7_107639_994868085"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NG18"}
