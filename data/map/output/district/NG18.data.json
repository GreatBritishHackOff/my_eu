A single Microdry unit will run off mains electricity be capable of drying a room in just 10% of the time taken by current technologies. We will develop an intelligent control system that will measure the reflected microwaves to determine residual moisture content and adjust the power output accordingly to maximise efficiency. The Microdry system will require no human intervention and will communicate to an end user when the drying process is finished. The magnitude and frequency of floods are likely to increase in the future as a result of climate change i.e. higher rainfall intensities and rising sea levels. Equally, the impact of flood events will increase, because in excess of 50 million European citizens now live in areas at risk of flooding with business and industry also located in such areas. Current drying operations require up to 8 weeks before remedial work can be undertaken on the building. This extends the time required before a building can revert to normal use with economic and social consequences. To remedy this situation we need to develop an emitter to direct the microwave energy to target areas without regular human intervention. This will use a feedback system to measure moisture content and actively control microwave power to the emitter. Telecommunications components will provide communication between the unit and operator and comprehensive safety features will ensure that microwave hazards are eliminated.", 32156.0, 1167188.0, "MICRODRY", null, null, null, "http://microdry.pera.com", "http://www.rainbow-int.co.uk", null, "fp7_107639_994868085"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5BH", "Zealand Learning Mobility 2017", "West Nottinghamshire College of Further Education, Mansfield", 208981.0, "The consortium is composed of six vocational schools from Region Zealand, which have already implemented and still is implementing mobility projects together under both Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus + KA1. In this application we're building on the experience gained by the consortium made up so far. The collaboration in the consortium have strengthened the incentive to get more students and employees took on the mobility course, and thus the project described in this application will help to strengthen:\r\n1. Our students 'and employees' international perspective and knowledge, language skills and intercultural skills through their participation in training abroad, which enables them to act in an education sector and a labor market with a still higher degree of internationalization.\r\n2. Quality assurance of training abroad through a deeper integration of ECVET\r\n3.

To ensure the maximum learning outcomes, the consortium has decided that in connection with VET learners used ECVET and Europass Mobility.\r\n\r\nWe expect to send out 314 VET learners on 2 or 3 weeks mobilities and 44 VET staff on 3-5 days mobilities.\r\n\r\nThe consortium will besides disseminating knowledge about the project through the usual channels (school websites, newsletters, local media) establish a joint web site for the Consortium where all mobilities will be documented, and how students and employees experience will be shared.", "http://www.wnc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DK01-KA102-034166_10"], ["5BH", "New Agreement  Masevaux - Thann - Cernay", "West Nottinghamshire College of Further Education, Mansfield", 8191.0, "Providing an international opening to our vocational students is obvious regarding the current economic situation. Travelling abroad for training gives them a good opportunity to increase their employability. To face this issue, three rural vocational colleges from Alsace have gathered to set up the NAMASTHAY 2 consortium.

Sharing experience and pooling human and logistics resources will provide a launch pad to new project holders within a 12 months ERASMUS+ funding program. Already involved in partnerships with the same big vocational teaching colleges in Britain and Finland, two members of the consortium have decided to join their forces and offer a wider range of vocational fields for possible futur exchange projects. These renowned institutions are closely involved with local companies for student training schemes which our students' training mobilities will be able to benefit from. The past students' exchange programs have been built upon personnal mutual trust between teachers from both institutions.\r\nExisting partnership will then strenghten through this new experience. Once introduced to the new departments from our partners' institutions, new project holders will be able to prepare their future mobility programs with the use of  the E-Twinning online platform.
