A single Microdry unit will run off mains electricity be capable of drying a room in just 10% of the time taken by current technologies. We will develop an intelligent control system that will measure the reflected microwaves to determine residual moisture content and adjust the power output accordingly to maximise efficiency. The Microdry system will require no human intervention and will communicate to an end user when the drying process is finished. The magnitude and frequency of floods are likely to increase in the future as a result of climate change i.e. higher rainfall intensities and rising sea levels. Equally, the impact of flood events will increase, because in excess of 50 million European citizens now live in areas at risk of flooding with business and industry also located in such areas. Current drying operations require up to 8 weeks before remedial work can be undertaken on the building. This extends the time required before a building can revert to normal use with economic and social consequences. To remedy this situation we need to develop an emitter to direct the microwave energy to target areas without regular human intervention. This will use a feedback system to measure moisture content and actively control microwave power to the emitter. Telecommunications components will provide communication between the unit and operator and comprehensive safety features will ensure that microwave hazards are eliminated.", 32156.0, 1167188.0, "MICRODRY", null, null, null, "http://microdry.pera.com", "http://www.rainbow-int.co.uk", null, "fp7_107639_994868085"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5BH", "Increasing international knowledge and experience of West Nottinghamshire College Students", "West Nottinghamshire College of Further Education, Mansfield", 178930.0, "Through transnational cooperation between the six institutions, this project aims to produce high quality outcomes for participants,  reinforce the internationalisation, capacity building and modernisation strategies of the Vision WNC. The main aim of this project is to  develop level 2 & 3 learners as international professionals and entrepreneurs through specialised work and training placement programmes in Denmark , Estonia, Finland and France. \r\n\r\nThis project will involve learners and staff from Engineering, Construction and Lifestyles subject areas and acts as a positive promotion of the opportunities of vocational learning by encouraging participants to develop and acquire new skills and explore international work, training and enterprise opportunities. 126 learners and staff from the Vision WNC  will visit Finland, Estonia, Denmark and France, countries which they may not have visited if not for this project.\r\n\r\nTypically, level 2 & 3 learners do not consider the opportunities to work or train abroad, especially in Northern Europe, or opportunities for self employment. This project will encourage participants to consider different progression opportunities by offering challenging and exciting, but safe work and training placement opportunities to a learner cohort which is normally reticent. \r\n\r\nThe project uses a pedagogically sound vehicle for learning, supported by the specialist work and training placement opportunities that will provide a rich source of information, skills development and real work experiences. These experiences will enable learners to explore the different approaches to enterprise, commerce and entrepreneurship in each country. This fits with overall strategy of active learning and development of employability and enterprise skills that is strongly embedded in the Vision WNC curriculum. The opportunities to work and train aboard will further broaden learners horizons and instill new attitudes based on the real work experiences. \r\n\r\nIn order to develop expertise in the specialist area and complement their knowledge with more technical and practical training, catering learners will attend training 2 weeks placement at the Danish Meat Trade College. It is believed that the acquirement of these ECVET accredited and certificated skills, not yet taught in UK, will greatly increase the participating learners\u2019 chance of finding a job and being successful at work as these can be used immediately after the end of international placement, either in an employed or self-employed role.\r\n\r\nFrom the construction, engineering and manufacturing perspective, globalization is not a choice, but a reality.
