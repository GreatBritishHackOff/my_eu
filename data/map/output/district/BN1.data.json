Also we are beginning to see interesting multimodal interactions.

Andhra Pradesh, a state in southern India, was used as a context for the analysis.\n\nTwo important results were found. One is that drought has negative effects on child nutrition, but only in communities affected by violence. The other is that political violence has major negative effects on child nutrition due to reducing the ability to cope with drought conditions.\n\nAn interesting finding was that during a ceasefire period the effects of drought had been reversed. Furthermore, the isolation that households face due to conflict has consequences on how well they can cope since access to public goods and services is restricted.\n\nAnother aspect the project examined is how economic expectation is impacted. First, individuals in conflict areas perceive bad outcomes to be much more likely than individuals in low or no conflict areas. Second, even after 40 years of violent conflict people are still sensitive to changes in the configuration of conflict patterns. This suggests that short-term recovery could be possible and negative effects on outlooks on life and hopelessness are (at least partially) reversible.\n\nImportant lessons can be learned from the findings in terms of how to cope with the impact of conflicts and uncertainties at the household level.", null, "http://www.ids.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/155482.jpg", "fp7_104207_999860384"], ["9RH", "Responses to coastal climate change: Innovative Strategies for high End Scenarios -Adaptation and Mitigation-", "The University of Sussex", "Coastal areas concentrate vulnerability to climate change due to high levels of population, economic activity and ecological values.

It mapped SME research support mechanisms focusing on public programmes or public\u2013private partnerships. These steps are meant to produce the ideal economic climate and innovation policies to advance SMEs within the European Research Area (ERA).\n\nRAPPORT developed a thorough methodology to investigate the interaction between SMEs and organisations offering access to available research. The project looked into how to strengthen SMEs' ability to articulate its innovation needs, identify the right source of expertise, integrate the acquired knowledge and exploit it commercially. The project team looked at 331 national, regional and local programmes that supported knowledge and technology transfer for SMEs. It interviewed 481 programme stakeholders, including 305 programme managers, 32 KTT enablers (agents, network brokers etc.), 37 knowledge providers (researchers) and 57 beneficiary SMEs.\n\nThe project distinguished between SMEs with high absorptive capacity and SMEs with low or medium absorptive capacity. It differentiated between the programmes and the practices that were appropriate for each group of SMEs. \n\nThe analysis of this project provided a clear insight into the challenges faced by KTT programmes. KTT programmes should be able to provide the means to HAC SMEs to enable them to engage in meaningful innovation and commercialisation activities. KTT programme should also be able to detect those LAC SMEs that have a poor track record of innovation and KTT, but possess the willingness to innovate and grow. Finally KTT programmes should be able to engage with those LAC SMEs that have no obvious interest or appetite for innovation and alter their attitudes and their behaviours in order to convert them gradually into SMEs of higher absorptive capacity.\n\nThree generic strategies were identified to cope with these challenges.  This included agent-supported programmes, firm-incentive programmes and network-based programmes. The agent-supported and the network-based programmes possess the greatest potential for behaviour change and innovation. Agent-supported programmes are more frequent with the low absorptive capacity SMEs, while the network-based programmes fit better the requirements of high absorptive capacity SMEs. Firm-incentive programmes (like the innovation voucher schemes) can provide resources for KTT and innovation but have little potential for behavioural and attitude change.\n\nA number of reports were produced to further knowledge transfer and assist SMEs.

Simpler systems can often be satisfactory described by linear models, but complex systems require non-linear models that can capture more of the characteristics of such systems, such as thresholds, feedback loops, avalanche effects, and irreversibility. Linear systems can be validated by aligning models to the past and using the model to predict the future. Non-linear systems, however, are often time-asymmetric - they can be explained with the wisdom of hindsight, but are not always predictable. For example, systems may respond sharply to minor perturbations, and the quality of this response is a measure of the system resilience. In practice, non-linear dynamics are significant both at the micro-scale of small history and at the macro-scale of deep time. The brilliant young scientist, for example, may experience a series of epiphanies that change his/her understanding and behaviour in an unpredictable and irreversible way. The scientific community as a whole may experience an innovation-cascade that has a similar effect on a much larger scale.\nCurrent models of climate change and carbon emission assume the immediate past is a reasonable guide to the future.

Although TEs can have beneficial effects, the vast majority of TE insertions are thought to be either neutral or deleterious. TEs can be harmful because they disrupt important sequences, such as regulatory elements and protein-coding sequences, attract epigenetic markers that can alter expression, and lead to duplication, deletion and rearrangement of DNA through ectopic recombination. Hosts therefore have mechanisms to repress the transposition of TEs, repression that TEs are under selection to avoid. To accomplish this, it is expected that TEs should be undergoing adaptive evolution. In this project we propose to test (i) whether TEs are undergoing adaptive evolution at the primary sequence level, (ii) whether TEs assimilate host gene fragments as a means to escape host silencing, and (iii) whether either strategy leads to an increase in TE success. We will investigate these questions in plants using examples of the two broad classes of TEs: the Sireviruses (class I LTR retrotransposon), and Mutator (class II DNA transposon). We will consider the evolution of these two families in maize and Arabidopsis thaliana, species that have very different genome sizes and numbers of TEs.

These included policies relating to renewable wind energy with biodiversity, renewable bioenergy with biodiversity, and agriculture and water. Additional combinations included hydropower with river basin policies, and building energy efficiency with waste policies. Lastly, recycling was considered against waste and water policies, and renewable energy was evaluated in terms of production efficiency and integration in the building sector.\n\nAPRAISE importantly noted the necessity of focusing not only on achieving targets as this can mask underlying unsustainability or policy inefficiencies, as some of the case studies showed. Instead, environmental policies must pay close attention to processes of policy design, implementation and evaluation if they are to support the EU's medium- and long-term sustainability goals.\n\nThe project used a variety of methods to ensure dissemination of its results and continued implementation of its methods and tools.

Thus, multinational firms (MNCs) outsourced parts of production processes to manufacturers in Asia and other low-cost locations around the globe, while retaining the most knowledge intensive assets in the home country. This is no longer the case. MNCs increasingly scout the globe for locations where the right mix of local competences allows them to tap into sophisticated parts of value chains. This is not limited to advanced economies but more and more involves firms and regions in selected developing countries that position themselves as attractive knowledge-intensive locations in their own right. INGINEUS studies the determinants of this process and analyses its implications both for the EU and its emerging partner countries in the developing world. First, it looks at the changing strategies of MNCs and the conditions under which it is favourable for them to offshore R&D and other knowledge-intensive parts of their production process.

The proper orchestration of mitotic progression is controlled by the balanced activity of mitotic kinases and counteracting phosphatases. Misregulation of these controls can be detrimental causing loss of entire chromosomes and aneuploidy. Considering that mitotic kinases are only expressed in actively dividing cells, targeting these kinases for cancer management is highly desirable. To this end, we are validating the mitotic kinase Greatwall Kinase (Greatwall) as a target for cancer therapy. Initial studies show that siRNA knockdown of Greatwall leads to rapid cell death in a number of transformed cell lines. Surprisingly, we found that untransformed RPE cells with low Greatwall protein and mRNA levels remained unaffected after Greatwall knock down. Moreover, Greatwall levels fluctuate dramatically among different cancer cell lines and are generally low in non-transformed tissues. Seminal studies using Xenopus egg extracts and drosophila larvae show that Greatwall has an important role in the cell cycle control of rapidly dividing embryonic cells and it is possible that some tumor cells have reverted back to this state of dependency on Greatwall. This makes Greatwall even more promising as an anti-cancer agent as its activity is dispensable in somatic cells but critical to the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. In light of these findings, I aim to pursue target validation studies with Greatwall, elucidate synergistic effects using known mitotic kinase inhibitors, and work closely with a team of medicinal chemists to characterize novel small-molecule Greatwall modulators.

A few adaptive learning systems consider specific inference-making interventions that are pivotal in text comprehension, but such systems are designed for high-school children or university-level students, and with textbooks as reading material. The use of more intelligent adaptive learning systems to custom-tailor such interventions in an adaptive fashion to (hearing and deaf) poor comprehenders has tremendous potential. TERENCE embodies that potential.<br/>TERENCE aims at offering innovative usability and evaluation guidelines, refining the current cognitive and pedagogical models concerning story comprehension and inference making, and delivering a showcase intelligent adaptive learning system. The system's smart games, developed and classified according to the refined models, will ask children to draw inferences about temporal events of stories, in Italian and in English. Moreover, the system will allow teachers to choose and custom-tailor the types of stories and games according to the needs of their learners.<br/>The guidelines, the models and the system will be the result of an orchestrated cross-disciplinary effort of European experts in diverse and complementary fields (art and design, computer science, engineering, linguistics, evidence-based medicine, psychology), and with the constant involvement of the end-users (deaf and hearing poor comprehenders, their educators) from schools in Brighton (UK), and in the Veneto area (Italy).", 182982.0, 2310172.0, "TERENCE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.sussex.ac.uk", null, "fp7_95743_999852721"], ["9RH", "Accelerating and Rescaling Transitions to Sustainability", "The University of Sussex", "The objective of ARTS is to benefit policy, practice and theory related to accelerating sustainability transitions and to create opportunities for innovation (including social innovation) by coupling, rescaling and accelerating sustainability initiatives in European city-regions.

In parallel, within debates about climate change adaptation there has been an emerging trend to position migration as an adaptation strategy to environmental shocks and stresses. However, migration is expensive, requiring a number of assets/capitals. This can result in some populations who experience the impacts of environmental change seeing a reduction in the very capital required to enable a move. Environmental change is therefore equally likely to make migration less possible as more probable. In the decades ahead, millions of people are thus likely to be unable to move away from locations in which they are extremely vulnerable to environmental change. To the international community, this \u2018trapped\u2019 population is likely to represent just as important a policy concern as those who do migrate.

State of the Art and beyond: The first generation of targeted therapies in chronic inflammatory disease used RA as prototype disease for clinical development. These therapies are now also used in other inflammatory disorders. Although treatments have been developed that are effective in a proportion of patients, they are aspecific, relatively toxic and do not mediate cure. Currently, it is unknown which molecular effects need to be induced and/or targeted to prevent induction or persistency of RA. However, this is within reach through a strong international consortium of world-leading European groups that cover both basic- and translational research.  Work plan: The general strategy for the project is to enable parallel studies that are focussed on critical switch moments in the biological processes that drive chronicity of inflammation. As the consortium consists of a multidisciplinary team with basic- and clinical expertise, translational research will be conducted to delineate the molecular basis of dysregulated inflammation, the RA-specific autoimmune-response and organ specific pathobiology.  The final aim is to develop novel- and specific anti-inflammatory therapies.

Further, it introduces spatial and scaled approaches, which are the most rigorous and well suited to a comprehensive conflict study, as risks, triggers and dynamics are spatially inscribed and hierarchical. The theoretical contribution of this work is an examination of how insurgency and opposition violence are spatial and political processes that are shaped by the political, economic and social geographies of states.

These are the boundary challenge (how to define people) and the limits of self-government (how to control the controllers). Another project result was identification of populist forces that impact democratisation.\n\nThe project's results are expected to enlighten policymakers, analysts and academics on the different types of populism manifesting themselves around the world.

By developing several novel methods, we will establish this new concept and demonstrate that the self-clearing of chromosomes is an essential mechanism allowing complete removal of sister chromatid cohesion, and that it is a fundamentally conserved function from yeast to vertebrates. To maintain genetic integrity, eukaryotic cells must duplicate their chromosomes and subsequently segregate them to opposite poles of the cell, prior to cell division. Cohesion is established between sister chromatids during S phase and marks sister pairs to ensure proper chromosome segregation in the next mitosis. However, the cohesion must be eventually removed to allow sister chromatids to separate and segregate to opposite poles. Although recent studies have revealed how the removal of cohesion is initiated, it is still elusive how this removal is completed.

Many also predicted that the winner/loser divide would form the basis of political divides in the emergent party systems, and that these divides would subsequently harden into lasting political cleavages.\nAlthough the winner/loser divide has been employed in a number of country studies, the literature on this topic is lacking in three respects: (i) no studies use a comprehensive theoretical approach that treats the divide as both objective and subjective in nature; (ii) there are currently no comparative, diachronic studies focusing directly on this cleavage that cover the whole of the transition period, and (iii) few studies to date have analysed the regional, aggregate-level dimension of this divide using appropriate methods.

While theory is expected to play a key role in the understanding this complex and topical issue, current investigations are typically limited to the study of evolution of a single trait. This sharply contrasts with our usual understanding that a species response to environmental change is likely to involve many traits, where many genes pleiotropically affect several characters. Interestingly, the only brief attempt to investigate the effect of pleiotropy has demonstrated that adaptation of a single trait to a gradual environmental change can be substantially impeded by selection on a second pleiotropic trait. However, Waxman and Peck have shown that in a static environment, a qualitatively new phenomenon occurs when mutations pleiotropically affect not two, but three or more traits in an effectively infinite asexual population. When this holds, the genotypic distribution has a different equilibrium form to usual (where all genetic sequences are rare): a single optimal genetic sequence become predominant. Since the genotypic distribution is a key factor to adaptation, such a qualitative change will have significant impacts on the response of a population to a changing environment. In this proposal, we plan to theoretically investigate evolutionary adaptation to environmental change when the number of pleiotropic traits is larger than two. This first implies the need to generalize the theory of Waxman and Peck, in a static environment, by extending the analysis to: (i) finite populations, (ii) haploid sexual populations and (iii) diploid sexual populations.

FRIDA examined in particular the reasons for these firms' impacts on different regions, as well as how they contribute to the development of networks and capabilities in these areas.\n\nExamining the interplay among anchor firms, regions and networks, the project concluded that the anchor role can actually be played by either small firms or large organisations. Its research also showed that the anchor role is temporary and that at the local system new actors take the lead after a period of time.\n\nIn addition, the project members looked at the role of anchors in shaping the development of local networks and influencing regional development. They also examined the resources and capabilities that anchors require to enable local development.\n\nProject results include precise recommendations for policymakers at all levels, as well as suggestions for local decision makers, public institutions and industry to enhance the role of anchor firms. FRIDA outcomes were communicated through workshops, policy-oriented events, seminars, conferences and publications.\n\nOverall, this initiative will help improve how firms stimulate start-up businesses, generate knowledge, provide financing, open up new markets and enhance training.

The architecture of the relationships among these actors may exert a significant influence in shaping technological change in certain directions rather than others, which in turn may have the potential to provide more socially optimal or desirable technological options.

One method of DNA repair, called homologous recombination (HR), involves using intact undamaged DNA sequences as a template to repair the damaged copy. HR is used extensively in meiotic cells to repair DNA breaks that are purposely created by the cell. In this context, HR is not just a repair mechanism, but also a method to drive interaction and genetic exchange between maternally and paternally inherited chromosomes, creating haploid genomes which are chimeras of the parental genetic information. Thus, the study of DNA repair and recombination informs our understanding of mechanisms that maintain genome stability, but which also generate genetic diversity, topics that are as critical to the survival of an individual cell as they are for the evolution and survival of an entire ecosystem.

Thus, drug development in ALS, including trial design, patient selection, and outcome measures must be re-engineered to break the current impasse. Nerve cell death in ALS is associated with inflammation, which contributes to cell damage, and is a logical target for therapy. Although therapeutic attempts to modify this have failed so far, the discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as key players in controlling inflammatory processes opens new possibilities since defective Treg function is important in ALS. In fact, Treg numbers and function predict rates of disease progression and survival. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS.

However, DNA can be rendered accessible by the action of energy-consuming chromatin remodelling proteins. One such protein is ATRX that harbours an N-terminal plant homeodomain (PHD) and a C-terminal helicase domain that confers ATPase activity and identifies ATRX as a member of the snf2 family member of chromatin remodellers. ATRX has been shown to localize in vivo with constitutive heterochromatin in pericentromeric regions as well as telomeres where it works in complex with DAXX for the deposition of the Histone3.3. Mutations in the ATRX gene give rise to ATR-X syndrome, a severe X-linked mental retardation syndrome often accompanied by alpha-thalassemia. Mounting evidence links ATRX mutations to cancer and to malignancies that depend on a telomerase-independent pathway of telomere maintenance called the \u2018alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway, linking ATRX to aging. Despite these advances however, there is lack of understanding of the molecular mechanism of ATRX and of its role within these pathologies. The proposed research aims to investigate the structural and functional properties of ATRX, and to define at a molecular level how it interacts with DAXX to remodel chromatin.

As a participant of this programme I gain insight into the Turkish culture and can learn about teaching-methods of  German as a foreign language through Job-shadowing.\r\n\r\nAims of the project: To strengthen the competence in teaching foreign languages, especially in \"German as a foreign language\" as well as the social competence with students and parents originally coming from Turkey.

I will hospitate lessons (Job-shadowing) or teach part of a lesson myself (this will be  planned with the headteacher of St. Georgs-Kolleg).\r\n\r\nProject implementation: regular contact by email with all participants, programme for 14 days in Istanbul, reflection and feedback with the teachers of my school in Austria.\r\n\r\nResults and long-term effects: I'm sure to strengthen my competence in teaching foreign languages, especially in \"German as a foreign language\". I'm also convinced to learn new methods which I will be able to use in my lessons.\r\nFurthermore I will get a perfect insight into Turkish culture. That's especially important as there are many students at my school, whose parents originally came from Turkey. This will help me to support them in \"sensitive\" matters.\r\nLast but not least I can show my students the various possibilities of mobility in a Europe of growing cooperation and create an open-minded atmosphere towards other cultures.\r\nGabriele Kummer-B\u00fcrkle:\r\nThe first part of the course was held in Austria, the second one in England last year.  This course focuses on Material Development for Foreign Language Education. The authenticity of the language environment encourages participants to speak on the one hand and on the other hand it is also used as fresh-up for the language skills. In addition I am not only able to provide my students with language features, but also with multi-cultural and traditional aspects. By showing slideshows, film clips and telling the pupils all kind of stories of  England and its people, the students might be  motivated to visit England. At this moment my pupils are already showing great interest in my  teaching experiences during the year in London. Especially the daily routines of pupils at their age seems to be very important for them. Background stories about a typical English schoolboy or schoolgirl are very appealing to them. Also the multi- cultural aspects in participating  in a course in England with course members from all over Europe are of additional  value  and reflect the idea of the European Union. The fact that pupils from many nations are taught together in a peaceful and friendly atmosphere is an important aspect of the European idea. For example, last year after the course visit , my students played baseball ( which is rather uncommon in Austria) while using English to communicate. A visit in England gives impulses to develop such new teaching methods which I can embed in my further teaching for many years. Another reason for visiting the course in Norwich is to get information about school exchange programmes and to get in contact with local people to organise such events for pupils of our school. During my teaching year in London as German and  French teacher a colleague organised a skiing holiday in St. Johann for 2 weeks. The contact to those English teachers still exists and offers plenty of possibilities to exchange experience, concerning pupils` exchange programmes; travelling; e-mail contacts and chatting platforms for young learners).On basis of individual contacts it is possible to create a common European cooperation. Follow-up activities at our school lead to a high transparency and offer these new methods, which are tested and rated by colleagues and the head teacher.

We require that participants have little and only documented absence, that they show interest in their chosen subject through both their schoolwork and in their extra curricular activities, and that they trough their application and possible interview, can demonstrate why they should be selected and how they will represent Kuben upper secondary in a satisfactory manner. The possibility of having a work placement period abroad will be marketed externally. This is partly with a view to recruiting, but it is equally important to highlight the efforts that Kuben upper secondary with our international program makes for vocational studies in Oslo.\r\n\r\nKuben upper secondary will over two years, submit the following students:\r\n\r\n- Level 2 hairdressing, up to six students per year at City College Brighton and Hove, Brighton, England. Work practice in the school's saloons for 4 weeks. The students live with English host families in Brighton.\r\n\r\n- Level 2 plumbing and transportation/logistics, up to eight students per year to Berufskolleg Hilden and their business partners for three weeks of work placements, and school visits. The students live in a youthhostel while in Dusseldorf.\r\n\r\n- Level 2 child care and youth workers and health workers, up to eight students per year to the Foundation Noruega Coasta Blanca's partners for four weeks of work placement. FBCBs partners are relevant health institutions. The students live in servicesed apartments.\r\n\r\nAll work placement periods will be included as part of the student's in-depth study project in Level 2. The quality of the contents of the placement is checked against the Norwegian curricula.\r\n\r\nKuben upper secondary have experienced that such projects have several positive effects, in particular for the participants and their classmates, but also for the status of the school and vocational studies in general. Participants and their classmates achieve a greater knowledge and understanding of their chosen profession and the opportunities that exist outside of Norway. It is also important that future students are shown that there are opportunities abroad for those who choose vocational studies, as there is a prevailing belief that only the Program for general studies gives the students the opportunity to do so. This is part of the strategy to show pending students that Kuben upper secondary put meens and effort in to vocational studies.\r\n\r\nIt is planned that the participants after their return will share their experiences with professional networks in Oslo, (networks that are administered through Kuben upper secondary and consists of both schools and industry), fellow apprentices through the Department of Vocational training's yearly seminars for apprentices,  and more. In addition to this the participants will share their experiences with their classmates and the other students and staff at Kuben upper secondary.", "http://www.ccb.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-NO01-KA102-000104_3"], ["4FA", "DOLOMITI 2014", "City College Brighton and Hove", 230715.0, "The project is aimed at 90 students of 4th and 5 th year belonging to a network of Vocational and Technical Secondary Schools located in the province of Belluno.

On the one hand for a teaching assignment of one of our arts teachers at our partner organisation in Palermo, Italy. In cooperation with the local staff, she wants to offer a creative workshop for children and teenagers entitled \"Imagining Ideal Living\". This workshop might hopefully initiate a strategic partnership in the long run. On the other hand we apply for a staff training mobility for one of our foreign language teachers and project co-coordinators in form of a job shadowing/observation period at our partner schools in England. The main objective here is to gain a deeper insight into the British educational system. This seems vital to us with regard to a professionalisation in giving advise and support to our interns at English partner institutions and to modulate and match our joint vocational training programme for the students' \"year of acknowledgement\". We plan to present the outcome of these experiences at our school/ on our homepage etc. and hope to motivate and encourage other staff members to benefit from a mobility abroad. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides intensifying and consolidating our contacts to already existing partner institutions for long term mobilities, one of our objectives for 2014 is to enlarge the possibilities for short term mobilities for our educators and educational therapists in order to encourage them more easily to go abroad, develop their professional skills and intercultural competences and widen their horizons. Altogether we would like to offer 7 short term mobilities for educational therapists at institutions in Austria and 7 short term mobilities for educators at institutions in Austria and Denmark. 14 long term mobilities we would like to offer to educators and educational therapists at institutions in Italy, Turkey, Austria and England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared, however, that we might not be successful in achieving our last objective as requested, because the new Erasmus+ grant support for long term mobilities for German students has been cut considerably (around 30 % compare to the former Leonardo grant support). The consequence of this is that the students in their \"year of acknowledgement\", especially those who do their work placements at communal schools in England, would need to be economically priviledged and be able to finance their mobility abroad from own resources.

In 2004 this additional vocational qualification has been developed together with the 5 partner regions in the Euregio Maas - Rhine region and has been offered to the students with great success. It consists of 4 competencies: language competence (the students choose either French or Dutch as a second language), information competence (course: Living and working in the Euregio Maas- Rhine region), intercultural competences (one focus of the language courses) and a work experience in the region, the students are learning the language of.

We will find accommodation for the students. Our partners in Belgium and the Netherlands will help us find work placements and together with the students we will choose the most suitable for them. We will also take care of the students during their work placements. Our colleagues will meet the students during their time abroad. Usually at the end of their work placements they will see them in their companies.\r\n\r\nApart from that they can be reached by email or telephone any time.

First and foremost we have seen more self-confidence as they have coped with the demands of their work experience on their own. For many of them it is the first time that they have to organize their daily routine by themselves and in foreign surroundings.

They have gained this experience for their future and this effect we can immediately notice at our school.\r\n\r\nWhen the students are coming back from their work experience and are talking about their experiences they are the best advertisements for the project.

In this framework, the QUALITY-W 2014 project, in which \u2018W\u2019 stands for \u2018Welcoming\u2019, takes into account the quality of welcoming guests as an issue to be investigated, in which to insert the learning programme that will be developed during the work experience.\r\n\r\nThe \u2018quality of welcoming\u2019 concerns the way one deals with guests and involves the ability to meet their requirements and understand their problems and cultural background. Moreover, it also concerns the guests\u2019 feelings towards the management of the environment as a system, and therefore towards the appearance of the territory and the impact that structures and economic activities have on it. \r\n\r\nMany skills involved in this field are based on personal gifts that the school, despite its educational efforts, cannot always develop and evaluate properly. Both the knowledge and the technical-operative skills need, through their application to the business reality, to be transformed into competences and to be constantly updated.\r\n\r\nThe school has been sensible to this formative issue for some time and has activated a path that, through the use of schemes such as school-work dual systems, tends to fill in these gaps. The ERASMUS+ programme, inside which the QUALITY-W  2014 project stands, offers a further opportunity by financing a mobility period of vocational educational training abroad.\r\n\r\nThe project is aimed at 90 students from a multi-regional network of three Vocational and Technical Secondary Schools\u2019 (level ISCED 3).

Most learners also had additional needs including mental health issues, learning disabilities, disadvantage, offending and drug and alcohol issues. The total number of learners who participated in the project is 192 with 64 accompanying adults. This was carried out over 16 mobility flows with an average of 12 learners and 4 accompanying adults per group.\r\n\r\nDescription of project activities\r\nTwo week work placements took place at Eco Chateau Training Hotel in the vocational areas of catering, horticulture and construction. The placement itinerary was jointly designed by course tutors from sending partner organisations and the host partner to build in opportunities for assessment where learner evidence is lacking for specific qualification units and a range of individual learning objectives specific to the participants. ECVET arrangements were developed to increase recognition of achievement. Outside of the working day, visits were organised to places relevant to their vocational areas such as to local food producers and visits to building projects. Participants also took part in cultural visits to places of interest, socialising with French people and sharing a meal in the local French community. \r\n\r\nMethodology used in carrying out the project\r\nThe project was managed within the Care Co-ops Quality and Project Management Framework. For mobility projects, this included the 10 principles of the European Quality Charter for Mobility.\r\n\r\nResults and impact envisaged\r\nThe impact of the project on the learners was that they had increased opportunities for their learning outcomes to be assessed, therefore increasing their opportunities to succeed in achieving their qualifications. Participants also demonstrated increased confidence, motivation, linguistic and employability skills through having carried out a work placement abroad. Partner organisations have shared good practice through established networks and this will contribute to a larger dialogue about creative ways to engage learners with additional needs through mobility projects. Accompanying staff developed their professional skills in sharing practice with partner organisations on supporting learners with additional needs and experience increased motivation as a result. \r\n\r\nPotential long term benefits\r\nIn the long term we expect the project to have a significant impact on the learners' attitude towards work, learning and European work to increase their future prospects.

There was an assumption that once borders are lifted, intercultural integration will happen on its own and peradventure people will see themselves as fellow Europeans rather nationals of European countries. These normative assumption of equal opportunities  has not panned out like that. The new wave of extreme nationalism and xenophobic attacks in European capitals are major cause for concerns.

In its various forms it relays information to the public, and helps communities keep up-to-date with current events from around the world. Additionally, the media serves as a link between the world's governments and its citizens, by informing the latter of the policies and practices of the former. This information helps the public participate in civil society and in the political process. Consequently the media not only has enormous potential to influence perceptions and to sway opinions, but arguably also to shape events. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes the freedom to hold opinions, and the right to express them. Although mainstream media outlets may each have their own rules and ethical standards, it is possible today for almost anyone to become a media producer using the internet. Meanwhile, as technological advances progressively facilitate the transmission of ever greater amounts of information, and to increasingly larger numbers of people, the flow, nature or quality of information cannot be controlled. Consequently it becomes every citizen's responsibility to analyse whatever information that she or he receives before acting upon it.  The training courses will bring together participants from different countries and cultural backgrounds to study the news media, and to contrast different outlets\u2019 portrayal of the same issues and events.

The project strives to present diverse (and often opposing) viewpoints on specific issues taken from the international media; participants are asked to assess each in turn, and then to contrast their conclusions with the others'. All analyses are supported by arguments and evidence.\r\n\r\nThe project's training courses are led by small teams of facilitators whose only role is to moderate discussions. The analyses themselves are always done by participants themselves, working individually or in small groups.

The methodology merely analyses the information as it appears to the public and identifies whatever biases it may contain.\r\nThe project addresses one of the fundamental challenges of modern society: protecting the freedom of expression and promoting the free flow of information on the one hand, while at the same time trying to limit the dissemination of misconceptions, biases and prejudices on the other. The most effective way to deal with the possibility of prejudices appearing in the mass media is not through governmental regulations, but for (enough of) the public to have the capacity to detect these prejudices or biases when they appear\r\n\r\nThe countries involved are U.K, Spain, Poland, Bulgaria, Italy and Norway will converge in Brighton for seven days between 11th to 17th of May 2015.", "http://www.acdr.org.uk", "AFRICAN CENTRE FOR DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH LTD", "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA105-001587_coordinator"], ["4GQ", "Motivate, inspire and dream", "AFRICAN CENTRE FOR DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH LTD", 6743.0, "The \" Motivate , Inspire and Dream\" started from partner organizations need to better motivate volunteers to draw attention on the importance of youth volunteering and thus to increase the impact on the community.

Eight of these participants fall into the category of persons disadvantaged socially, economically or geographically. Through this project we want to give them more confidence in themselves and in their power to improve the community they belong to . To achieve project objectives, we planned two meetings to prepare participants. They will analyze the degree of motivation of volunteers in their organizations  and they  will discuss project objectives and preparations will be made for intercultural evening . The participants will be ready to start  learning and the learning will be based on a series of non -formal methods such as role play, brain storming , Debating , collages , team-building activities and trust -building and formal methods such as case analysis , teamwork , presentations, etc. This project will use informal and nonformal methods, participants will have the opportunity to discover other cultures through themed evenings and continuous interaction .\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nImpact of the project will reach a peak during the campaign of communication and raising  awareness on the importance of volunteering.

The sporadic violent confrontation in Ukraine beats everyone imaginations of how civil protest can degenerate to a civil war with thousands already dead and counting. This and many more is why international Youth Training on Conflict Transformation and Negotiations through Turbulence is very crucial at this material time. Today\u2018s world is challenging for young people: the different and changing economic climate, skyrocketing youth unemployment, constant violent flash points across Europe with no clear end in sight. When there is despair, there is a natural attraction to use violence either to make a point or  to assert oneself. During this dire situations and circumstances, youth workers play an important role in supporting young people in coping with personal, economic,social and intercultural conflicts. They can facilitate constructive learning outcomes and stimulate reflective perspectives, supporting young people in recognizing conflicts as part of an important learning process. The project  seeks to train youth workers,youth leaders, and  managers of youth projects in a standardized conflict transformation and negotiation skills. This training is a departure from the usual conflict trainings rather it will use the John Paul Lederach model pioneered in 1980's which saw conflict as something that must not necessarily be resolved or managed but TRANSFORMED because conflict is natural and neutral. The project will redirect youth energy from reacting to  conflict but responding and engaging with conflict and give them skills to analyze the WHY of conflict and be able to follow the  right approaches to conflicts transformation but because you can not  transform any form of conflict without adequate knowledge of negotiation skills. The training will fuse these two important concepts and tools together. One of the aims of this training is to empower and equip young leaders and youth workers with negotiation skills. Everyone negotiates something every day. You negotiate with your family about where to spend the weekend. We have negotiated all these activities without having the skills or being conscious we were negotiating. But how does one become an effective negotiator? The project will seek to  make young people change agents and unarmed army of youth skilled in Conflict Transformation and Negotiation skills. Non-formal Experiential learning methods . Young people will be supported to be masters of their own learning. This approach will be combined with participatory methods which will allow role plays, story telling and new creative methods at responding to pressures and frustrations which will include Conflict Analyses. Lenses of Conflict, reconciliation, negotiation skills and team building. \r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\r\n-To train 32 youth workers, youth leaders and youth in specific Conflict transformation skills.  \r\n-Train youth workers and young people in Negotiation skills in times of turbulence and at all times\r\n-To train youth workers and young people on how to transform pressures associated with social and economic obstacles\r\n-To train youth workers and youth leaders the fundamental principles of creators who takes the advantages of bad situations to create new and better opportunities\r\n- To train  youth workers and youth leaders in team building and team leading skills which will enable them to leverage diversity in a multicultural workspace.\r\nThe project will take place in Brighton in U.K for a Period of ten days between 15th to 24th of March, 2015, accommodation will be Premier Inn and training facility will be Community Base across the hotel .Partner countries  have been carefully selected, which includes Poland,Romania,Hungary,  Norway,Italy ,Ukraine, Portugal and Spain and U.K. The participant will learn new skills of how to manage and transform conflict with negotiation skills during uncertainties and pressures. By deepening participants understanding on the nature and the different types of conflict understanding  and how to measure vulnerability will enhance mutual coexistence. The participants would have learnt the necessary skills to train other people on conflict transformation methods, active citizenship, intercultural dialogue, conflict analyses and negotiation skills through non-formal education methods .The partners will form part of a new network of organizations of peace-builders and youth negotiators.

The elevation of non-formal education methods largely used in international youth works has attracted various kinds of professionals and young people working in the field of youth. Over the years, there has been a lot of assumptions made about youth workers and youth leaders which are not through in practical sense based on the research and the feedback got by African Centre for Development and Research from January 2014 till August 2014. There was the assumption youth workers and youth leaders who were able to write project proposals will automatically know how to manage human and financial resources in their projects and experience has proved otherwise. Also there was the assumption that youth workers and youth leaders will be good project managers. But we have discovered from our research and interview of youth workers that a lot is expected of them without adequate and professional trainings that could help them in the areas of resource governance and project management. A lot of youth workers and youth leaders in voluntary youth sector are driven by passion and sense of determination to help and make society a better place. But zeal can not replace competence. These skills are so fundamental that not only does it help youth workers and youth leaders in the works but it is also the foundational skills for aspiring entrepreneurs.

Host families and companies are being chosen by our partner companies in England in correspondence with the wishes and needs of our students.

Therefore,  we are especially interested in pushing short term mobilities for educators by offering  low-threshold placements at bilingual institutions.\r\nMoreover, we would like to take advantage of the opportunity to apply for staff training and teaching mobilities.

The consequence of this is that the students in their \"year of acknowledgement\", especially those who do their work placements at communal schools in England, need to be economically priviledged and be able to finance their mobility abroad from own resources.  So again, students from high-income households will be privileged and equal opportunities regarding education and training fall by the wayside.\r\nA further and new difficulty for our students in their \"year of acknowledgement\" is the fact that long-term mobilities in the second year are determined to end by 31/05/2017.

This partnership was gradually enlarged and now consists of 6 schools with a focus on trade matters. These schools send interns to and host interns from their partner schools.\r\nThis cooperation was consolidated in particular by an additional Comenius-Project from 2012-2014 led by our friends from Luxembourg.

The target group consists of students from the vocational training fields of trade and commerce and the clothing industry. For the first time we would also like to include students being trained in the cosmetic sector. European mobility projects constitute an important part of our school image as a certified European School in North-Rhine Westphalia.\r\nThe internships take place in companies found with the help our partner schools (Luxembourg, Belgium, France, Finland, Slovakia) but also through European partner agencies (Great Britain, Ireland, Malta). We depend on the cooperation with these agencies due to the fact that many of our interns want to do an internship in an English-speaking country. We have called on these partner agencies several times and the companies they provide for the interns have also been visited. Some of the internships take place in companies the interns have found on their own, partly in the foreign subsidiaries of our VET-partners from industry and commerce.\r\nThe Leonardo-Team of BK Halle consists of six experienced teachers who organize the implementation of the project.

The experience of the last few years has repeatedly demonstrated that this is definitely true. The growing together of Europe and the implementation of the European idea in the minds of the young people is of utmost importance to us. This can only be reached step by step and we want to contribute to it.\r\nIt goes without saying that we also want to enhance our school\u00b4s profile and make it attractive to the students.

They will have already obtained knowledge concerning such matters of commercial correspondence as enquiry, offer, order, delay in payment and notice of defects. Further, they will have learned how to handle different types of forms in the field of foreign trade and will have acquired detailed knowledge in the subjects of business administration, national economy and infonomics.

They have had five years in English language education, a graduated vocational education in metal engineering and at least one year work experience. As English is the international language for job related communication the objective of this project is to improve the students\u2019 English language skills. The focus of this course is to improve the students\u2019 English communication skills. The project partner  Norwich Institute for Language Education (NILE) in Norwich, Great Britain offers the opportunity to our students to improve their English language skills, especially concerning the demands of a technical engineer.  This includes technical outings to local factories and staying with local families. Giving these students this extraordinary opportunity to immerse themselves in English language and culture in this way means that they will improve their language skills and gather job relevant experience in a member country of the European Union which enables them to gain knowledge and also share it using a common language. Furthermore the students not only learn more about the way of life in a foreign country but also more about the different conditions and processes at workplaces. The students learn how to cope with standard situation in daily life by communicating in a foreign language. This experience and the ability to exchange knowledge in English will improve their chance of getting a better job in their home region and also sharpens the view for the necessity of being mobile within the borders of the European Union and beyond.\r\nThe focus of this project is on the following subject specific main topics:\r\nThe development of a mechanical engineering product during the whole two weeks course including business meetings enabling the students to  take part in discussions, write and answer business letters as well as giving subject related presentations in English. \r\nDuring all of these activities skilled Tutors from NILE observe the students progress to make sure that they are well prepared to work in an English speaking work environment.  \r\nThe basis for the activity is a Memerandum of Understanding and a learning agreement between the partner organisation (NILE), the students and the Technical College of Engineering in Memmingen. To adjust and fine tune the content of the course programme according to the students demands, a permanent contact between the involved organizations is essential.  The content of this learning agreement is furthermore the basis for the evaluation process of the activity to find out wether the previous made arrangement were achieved.   \r\nBefore the actual stay abroad the students will be prepared in pre-courses aside from regular English lessons to provide them with the necessary language skills as well as to help them to organise the trip. Even at this early stage of the whole activity there is a steady correspondence per email between NILE in Norwich and our school to make sure the course links to the language demands of the students successfully at any time of the project.\r\nThe courses, the excursions and the social programme in Norwich is organised by Nile itself as well as the homestay. The language course takes two weeks and consists of ten days with five hour lessons per day. At the beginning of the course the tutors check out the special needs of the student and divide them into two groups according to their English knowledge. At all-time two German teachers are at hand if their might occur any problem, like students become ill, etc. \r\nAfter the first five days of the course an interim evaluation will be made by filling out a questionnaire to ensure the quality of the activity and to enable the tutors at Nile to take action whether special needs are demanded. \r\nTo practice the achieved language skills in real situations visits to factories like the Lotus Car Factory in Hethel or the IWM Aircraft museum in Duxford are made as well as trips to places and sights of cultural importance about which the students have to report and give presentations.\r\nAt the end of the course the students obtain a course specified certification as well as the Europass Mobility which will be signed by the two partners (NILE and the College of Technical Engineering).\r\nBeing back to their home country the students have to fill out a questionnaire to tell about the improvements and experiences they made and to critically evaluate the outcome of the activity.\r\nThe impressions of the whole trip, the experiences and improvements the students made will be told to the local media, narrated and described in the annual schoolbook and on the school\u2019s homepage.

The objectives of the project will address their issues and needs through:\r\n\r\n- Providing additional assessment and support opportunities to validate skills for learners to succeed in their qualifications\r\n- Boosting employability and mobility in the wider EU labour market through practical work experience\r\n- Raising participants' awareness and understanding of other cultures, countries and language to broaden their life perspective\r\n- Increasing self-esteem, confidence, motivation and social skills.\r\n\r\nAccompanying adults will have opportunities for continued professional development, increasing their motivation in working with groups with fewer opportunities and will develop their teaching to include transnational perspectives.The partners also aim to work together to modernise education and training in working with these groups by sharing best practice and utilizing innovative techniques in supporting learners with fewer opportunities to improve their learning performance and enhance the employability and mobility prospects. The project will also reinforce and further develop the transnational scope of the partner organisations for working at an international level. \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants: \r\nParticipants will consist of learners with fewer opportunities studying on entry level and level 1 introductory vocational qualifications at Care Co-ops, Chichester College and Sussex Coast College in the vocational areas of horticulture, catering and construction.  Most learners will also have additional needs including mental health issues, learning disabilities, disadvantage, offending and drug and alcohol issues. The total number of learners who will participate in the project is 288 with 96 accompanying adults. This will be carried out over 24 mobility flows with an average of 12 learners and 4 accompanying adults per group.\r\n \r\nDescription of project activities:\r\nTwo-week work placements will take place at Eco Chateau Training Hotel in the vocational areas of catering, horticulture and construction. The placement itinerary will be jointly designed by course tutors from sending partner organisations and the host partner to build in opportunities for assessment where learner evidence is lacking for specific qualification units and a range of individual learning objectives specific to the participants. ECVET arrangements will be developed to increase recognition of achievement. Outside of the working day, visits will be organised to places relevant to their vocational areas such as to local food producers and visits to building projects. Participants will also take part in cultural visits to places of interest, socialise with French people and share a meal in the local French community. \r\n\r\nMethodology used in carrying out the project:\r\nThe project will be managed within the Care Co-ops Quality and Project Management Framework. For mobility projects, this includes the 10 principles of the European Quality Charter for Mobility. \r\n\r\nResults and impact envisaged: \r\nThe expected impact of the project on the learners is that they will have increased opportunities for their learning outcomes to be assessed, therefore increasing their opportunities to succeed in achieving their qualifications. We also expect that participants will demonstrate increased confidence, motivation, linguistic and employability skills through having carried out a work placement abroad.

We defined as specific objectives, to discuss and develop the quality criteria for youth workers and their contribution to youth organization\u2019s needs, realities and it\u2019s impacts on own communities, to develop essential skills to work with multicultural and intercultural youth workers groups (e.g. leadership, team work, group dynamics, communication, programme design, evaluation and follow-up) assuring quality criteria in all aspects of youth workers participation and cooperation, to increase the involvement of local communities in the development in order to enhance the impact of social inclusion of youth workers with few opportunities in our communities, to increase the availability among youth workers to work in the social inclusion, within local communities involving young people in their actions and to increase the youth workers participant's motivation to introduce into social responsibility, intercultural learning, structure dialogue by creating conditions to support them to engage other youth to participate in decision making structures.We expected to have isocial transformation and the strengthening of the autonomy and the participation of partner organizations, which in some ways is very needy and without access to social goods by doing action which can bring transformation, although this same professional has been considered important the participation of civil society and of State institutions, as well as social support and creating social project for social development, contributing to the reversal of the inequality, the achievement of equitable relationships. We focus our results on actions of youth workers, which can promote and support the role of african youth workers in capacity-building activities that contribute to living together in dignity and dialogue through a network of specifically exchange experience of youth workers who strengthen the presence and promote the values of diversity in the community.In a long term perspectives, will potentially benefits in developing joint actions and chained to social development, from working with a group of african youth workers with fewer opportunities and encompass planned activities for the development of african youth workers with fewer opportunities, in order to live better in their social environment, to act on it and the transform shape, to develop greater autonomy and protagonism, effectively participating and transforming in the middle where it belongs.", "http://www.acdr.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-AT02-KA105-001134_7"], ["4GQ", "Advocacy and Facilitation Skills for in youth Work; Lead the Change", "AFRICAN CENTRE FOR DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH LTD", 15196.0, "According to the report of Council of Europe on 15th of December 1999, it was reiterated by the assembly that formal education alone cannot respond to the challenges of modern society and therefore welcomes its reinforcement by non formal educational practices and it was recommended that member states recognise non-formal education as a de facto partner in the lifelong process and make it accessible to all. The elevation of non-formal education methods largely used in international youth works has attracted various kinds of professionals and young people to work in the field of youth. Impactful youth work and sustainable youth organizations needs two key skills domiciled within the organization which are Advocacy and facilitation skills because youth activities revolves alot around training and advocacy of change for or against status-co or policies. A lot of youth workers and youth leaders in voluntary youth sector are driven by passion and sense of determination to help and make society a better place. But zeal can not replace competence. Youth organizations has conceptualized projects, but only to rely on only external professional trainers to carry out the training and facilitations. This process denies them the opportunity to develop their own skills and the motivation to effectively lead and advocate change. After a recent training project on overcoming barriers organized by African centre for Development and Research and seen that facilitations were carried out by officers of the organization. There has been overwhelming request from organizations and youth workers to African Centre for Development and research to put this project together with a view to helping organizations to develop crucial skills of facilitation and advocacy. These skills are so fundamental that not only does it help youth workers , young people and youth leaders in their works at developing internal pool of facilitators and advocates but it is also the foundational skills for aspiring entrepreneurs. Ability to effectively explain your ideas to others for comprehension which you get in facilitation and ability to knock on doors of barriers persistently without fear of rejection with passion which is a bedrock skill of advocacy. The project will give youth workers and leaders multifunctional  skills base to help young people to lead a better life in other spheres of life themselves. We believe there is no better time to address these skills problem than now when the new Erasmus+ project has been launched and taking root. Several youth workers has been brooding in the dark without these skills . If youth workers have achieved  any form of success in their projects without this fundamental skills it will not be sustainable but with this project, youth workers will achieve more and grant funding will do the needed good it was set out to achieve in the life of young people and such projects will be sustainable on the long run and the multiplied effects will speak volume\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\r\n-To train 30 youth workers, youth leaders  in facilitation skills.  \r\n-Train  30 youth workers, youth leaders and young people in effective leadership.\r\n-To train 30 youth workers, youth leaders and young volunteers in advocacy skills\r\n-To train 30 youth workers and youth leaders the fundamental principles of running a sustainable project\r\n- To train  youth workers and youth leaders in team building and team leading skills which will enable them to manage diversities in the team to the benefit of the project and advancement of their works in community through advocacy.\r\n-To train youth workers and youth leaders public speaking skills\r\n-To train youth workers and leaders in core leadership principles and task delegation using MBI principles\r\n-To train youth workers how to avoid common pitfalls in advocacy\r\n-To train youth workers and youth leaders foundational entrepreneurship principles of perseverance\r\n\r\nThe project will take place in Brighton in U.K for a Period of 8 days with partner countries which includes Poland, Norway,Italy ,Romania, Hungary,Ukraine, Portugal ,Spain , Azerbaijan and U.K. These are countries covered by the research survey of competencies of youth workers and youth leaders in Advocacy and facilitation and were preferentially selected for partnership because of their motivation.

The 28 participants will learn how to use Jukava method in youth work and how, from this method, propose and implement new projects for children and adolescents beneficiaries 3. Increase the involvement of working with children for youth workers who have no experience in this area and the fact that they will learn Jukava methods will help them gain confidence in their capacity to work well with children 4. At the end of the project, the 28 participants will learn the practical skills on how to create a non-formal education program for children and the impact that consistently then  can share with other youth workers and their beneficiaries. 5. Raising awareness of participants about the importance of learning and using innovative methods in activities with children. To achieve our project objectives, we planned two preparatory meetings in which organizations will analyze the situation regarding non-formal methods used in work with children, will discuss the project objectives and will be preparing for intercultural evening. The participants will be ready to start learning by using a number of methods of non-formal such as role play, brain storming, debating, collages, activities for team-building and trust-building and formal methods such as analyze cases, teamwork, presentations, etc. We believe this project will have a major impact not only on youth workers who will learn how to use the method Jukava but also on organizations involved who  will know how to structure and implement programs for children using innovative and creative non-formal methods. The main stregths of the project iare:  learning by experience, so that the method will be taught while it applies, participants will work with children in the local community to understand how the method should be applied live, the solid partnership and  the good colaboration with the local community, with whom we worked in other projects Erasmus, are the strengths of this project and  the guarantees that the impact will be high.", "http://www.acdr.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-3-RO01-KA105-022888_1"], ["9RH", "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "THE UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX", 60753.0, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

There is a strong need for the apprentices to be prepared for a work abroad after their apprenticeship. This is due to the fact that the companies in our region are very international and/or have customers all around the world. To meet these requirements more student exchanges with Erasmus+ are planned, too. The sponsoring companies have a high demand on well skilled workers to set up and commission their machines and products abroad, or to solve problems together with international customers. Unfortunately English is not taught as a subject in most parts of the metalworking field.  To improve the apprenticeship and to be able to increase the number of flows, three teachers should take part in a language course at NILE within the next two years. These teachers will then set up and strengthen the job related English teaching in the metalworking jobs and perform new Erasmus+ projects with their students.NILE is renowned as an organiser of language courses for ESL speakers and has been the choice for many of these courses for our regional government of Swabia.

In 2009 we started with three interns abroad - in 2014/15 we had and have more than 20 students who did and still do placements for 6 weeks or for one year at our partner organisations all over Europe. For the first half of 2016 we have already arranged 15 mobilities among which 6 are long-term stays.Besides intensifying and consolidating our contacts to already existing partner institutions for short and long term mobilities, one of our objectives for 2016 is again to enlarge the possibilities for short term mobilities for our educators and educational therapists in order to encourage them more easily to go abroad, develop their professional skills and intercultural competences, widen their horizons, and possibly motivate them to go abroad again for a longer period. Therefore,  we are especially interested in pushing short term mobilities for educators by offering  low-threshold placements at bilingual institutions. But since we still have a larger number of grants at our disposal from 2015, this strategy will have quantitatively no impact on this application. Offering the chance of successfully completing the whole \"year of acknowledgement\" abroad still remains an important objective for us, and is one of our college's special features. Since we are putting this into practice since 2009, we have by now developed well-tested administrative structures. Grant support for long-term mobilities for Italy, France, England, Turkey and Austria are spread between both groups of trainees, educators and educational therapists.Moreover, we would like to perpetuate the opportunity to apply for staff training and teaching mobilities. Our main objective here is to gain a deeper insight into our European partners' educational systems. This seems vital to us with regard to a professionalisation in giving advise and support to our students and to modulate and match our joint vocational training programme, especially  for the students' \"year of acknowledgement\".Presenting the outcome of these experiences at our school/ on our homepage etc. shall motivate and encourage other staff members to benefit from a mobility abroad. The implementation of the project with regard to the students' learning mobilities has already become institutionalized by several years of experience with the former Leonardo Mobility Programme.So outcome and impact of this project should be: Increase resp. consolidation of the number of short and long-term mobilities.We sense, however, that the difficult political situation and the latest terrorist attacks in Paris and Istanbul sadly affect the mood and willingness of our students to travel abroad.Moreover, the adverse effect of the Erasmus+ grant support reduction for long term mobilities is again distinctly noticeable, especially regarding mobilities to the UK, but also to Austria. The consequence of this is that the students in their \"year of acknowledgement\", especially those who do their work placements at communal schools in England, need to be economically priviledged and be able to finance their mobility abroad from own resources.

Giving these students this extraordinary opportunity to immerse themselves in English language and culture in this way means that they will improve their language skills and gather job relevant experience in a member country of the European Union which enables them to gain knowledge and also share it using a common language. Furthermore the students not only learn more about the way of life in a foreign country but also more about the different conditions and processes at workplaces. The students learn how to cope with standard situation in daily life by communicating in a foreign language. This experience and the ability to exchange knowledge in English will improve their chance of getting a better job in their home region and also sharpens the view for the necessity of being mobile within the borders of the European Union and beyond.The focus of this project is on the following subject specific main topics:The development of a mechanical engineering product during the whole two weeks course including business meetings enabling the students to  take part in discussions, write and answer business letters as well as giving subject related presentations in English. During all of these activities skilled Tutors from NILE observe the students progress to make sure that they are well prepared to work in an English speaking work environment.  The basis for the activity is a Memerandum of Understanding and a learning agreement between the partner organisation (NILE), the students and the Technical College of Engineering in Memmingen. To adjust and fine tune the content of the course programme according to the students demands, a permanent contact between the involved organizations is essential.  The content of this learning agreement is furthermore the basis for the evaluation process of the activity to find out wether the previous made arrangement were achieved.   Before the actual stay abroad the students will be prepared in pre-courses aside from regular English lessons to provide them with the necessary language skills as well as to help them to organise the trip. Even at this early stage of the whole activity there is a steady correspondence per email between NILE in Norwich and our school to make sure the course links to the language demands of the students successfully at any time of the project.The courses, the excursions and the social programme in Norwich is organised by Nile itself as well as the homestay. The language course takes two weeks and consists of ten days with five hour lessons per day. At the beginning of the course the tutors check out the special needs of the student and divide them into two groups according to their English knowledge. At all-time two German teachers are at hand if their might occur any problem, like students become ill, etc. After the first five days of the course an interim evaluation will be made by filling out a questionnaire to ensure the quality of the activity and to enable the tutors at Nile to take action whether special needs are demanded. To practice the achieved language skills in real situations visits to factories like the Lotus Car Factory in Hethel or the IWM Aircraft museum in Duxford are made as well as trips to places and sights of cultural importance about which the students have to report and give presentations.At the end of the course the students obtain a course specified certification as well as the Europass Mobility which will be signed by the two partners (NILE and the College of Technical Engineering).Being back to their home country the students have to fill out a questionnaire to tell about the improvements and experiences they made and to critically evaluate the outcome of the activity.The impressions of the whole trip, the experiences and improvements the students made will be told to the local media, narrated and described in the annual schoolbook and on the school\u2019s homepage. Furthermore the Language Passport of the European Union will be filled out by the students themselves during English classes.Finally the Europass Mobility will be handed out to the students at a special ceremony at school.", "http://www.nile-elt.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-003190_1"], ["6LA", "Early years education in Europe", "Pumpkin Patch Nursery", 7624.0, "NAME OF THE PROJECT: Early years education in EuropeBACKGROUND:Regular internships and practical training form an integral part of the curriculum of the College of Nursery Education. An internship in another European country is not compulsory. However, excellent students of  4th grade are highly encouraged to take the opportunity and gain experience abroad. An internship in the field of early years education in a foreign country is advantageous for the students' future career and should foster independence. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES:* Application and improvement of knowledge, skills and qualifications acquired in education and training; * Enhanced chances on the national, European and international job market* Promotion of flexibility and mobility * Development of  life skills, personality and independence* Growth of responsibility and self-determination * Coping with duties and challenges in a foreign country and a multicultural workplace * Improvement of communication and English language skills* Learning basic phrases in Swedish, Finnish and Spanish* Promotion of intercultural dialogue* Forming of friendships* Encountering new organisations, cultures, working processes and structuresNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS:Nine students will complete a two-week internship in different European countries in summer  2016, between 27 June 2016 and the end of August 2016. The destinations are Spain, England, Sweden and Finland. These countries have been chosen by the students in order to improve and apply their language skills and to learn about new pedagogic concepts and structures. Persons involved:  Headmistress Margit Gangl,  project coordinators Christiane Gassenbauer & Renate Loidl,  English teachers: Ulrike Haas und Angelika Mittendorfer,  geography teacher: Peter Atzmanstorfer,  kindergarten didactics and practical training: Ingrid Edelmann, Brigitte Merlotti, Rosa Huber, Sabine Feichtinger and Romana Stadler.ACTIVITIES:The aim of the institutionalised practical training and internships is to apply the knowledge and skills acquired in the subjects pedagogy and didactics as required by the job profile of a nursery teacher. The students will gain experience in the field of observation and the planning and conducting of learning incentives, especially the fostering of motor skills, artistic skills and language development. PROJECT MANAGEMENT MEASURES & TOOLSProject management tools include ECVET Elements (Learning Agreement, Cooperation Agreement).The Cooperation Agreement forms the basis of the cooperation between our organisation and the partner organisations. It contains the criteria for a successful cooperation and the duties of the project partners.The  Learning Agreement provides more transparency and ensures that the trainee only has to complete tasks in compliance with her education, skills and knowledge. The trainees have to document their experiences and hand in a final report. EVALUATION AND IMPACT:The trainees will acquire life skills e.g. self-confidence and self-management and will broaden their horizons, which will have an impact on the education and training provided at our school. They will be aware of the importance of language learning and will be more motivated to learn new languages. The exchange of ideas and pedagogic concepts and structures will further and improve practical training at our school.Students and parents are increasingly aware of the importance of this project concerning chances on the job market and starting a career in pedagogy. Our long-term plans regarding the dissemination and promotion of this project are information meetings for parents and students and presentations for other classes.

Providing our students with the possibility of an international experience is one of our measures to decrease the drop out rate, and increase the recruitment and elevating the status of vocational studies in Oslo. Providing the vocational students possibilities of an international experience will help in that regard. We want to show the students the opportunities in their chosen field of study/work, to give them a taste of a European community of their chosen field, and to give them a better understanding and a critical view of their training in Norway by letting them compare with methods in the host countries.Kuben wants to send the following mobilities:- Up to 6 2nd year hair dressing students and one accompanying teacher to City College Brighton & Hove (CCB). The students will spend 4 weeks at the college while living with English host families. The work placement will take place late in spring, so that their stay coincides with the time when the local students mainly do practical work in the college's two saloons. The placement will make up an important part of the practical component of their training. The Kuben students will receive 5 hours a week of English Communications with other international students, and take part in extra curricular activities the International Office arranges. The accompanying teacher stays for 4 days, both to safeguard the students, and to meet with key staff at CCB to evaluate and plan for the continued cooperation.- Up to 4 2nd year students from our health-worker program, and 4 from our childhood and youth-worker program, plus 2 accompanying teachers, one from each program, for work placement with our partners in Alicante, Spain. The work placement lasts for 4 weeks and the students will stay in a guarded apartment complex, where 4 and 4 share an apartment, and are looked after by a local contact person. The partner in Spain is the Norwegian School Costa Blanca, who let us use their local partner institutions for work placements. The health-worker students are placed at a Norwegian care centre for the elderly. The childhood and youth-workers at a Norwegian/international kindergarten. In addition to their work placement the students are given 3 hours per week Spanish lessons.The recruitment process starts while the students are still in 1st year. Returning participants hold a presentation to 1st year students about their experiences in Brighton or Alicante. At the start of the 2nd school year relevant classes will again be informed about the possibility for the work placement, and the criteria for being selected as a participant. These are: little and only documented absence, proven interest in their chosen subject through both schoolwork and extra curricular activities, and that they trough their application and interview demonstrate why they should be selected and how they will represent Kuben in a satisfactory manner. The selected participants will be called in for preparatory meetings and will receive written information and contracts. 1-2 weeks before departure, participants and their parents/guardians will attend a Departure meeting. All participants are equipped with a folder with all necessary information and documents.The possibility of having a work placement period abroad will also be marketed externally. This is partly with a view to recruiting, but it is equally important to highlight the efforts that Kuben with our international program, makes for vocational studies in Oslo.All work placement periods will be included as part of the students' in-depth study project in 2nd year. The quality of the contents of the placement period is matched against the Norwegian curricula. The supervisors at the institutions and teachers at CCB are obliged to evaluate the Kuben participants and send this evaluation to the teachers at Kuben.Kuben have experienced that such projects have several positive effects, in particular for the participants and their classmates, but also for the status of the school and vocational studies in general. Participants and their classmates through dissemination, achieve a greater knowledge and understanding of their chosen profession and the opportunities that exist outside of Norway. It is also important that future students are shown that there are opportunities abroad for those who choose vocational studies, as there is a prevailing belief that only the program for general academic studies gives students the opportunity to do so. After their return the participants will share their experiences with their classmates and the other students and staff at Kuben, with professional networks in Oslo, fellow apprentices through the Department of Vocational training's yearly seminars for apprentices, and more.", "http://www.ccb.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NO01-KA102-021943_1"], ["6NN", "Building Sustainable Communities with VET", "Brighton Third Sector Training Ltd.", 146866.0, "How did this project idea come about?The basis of the 'Building Sustainable Communities with VET' project brings together B3st\u2019s ambitions in training young VET learners of Community Development and its links to relevant employers in Andalusia, Spain. It recognises the need for participants to gain work experience that is increasingly difficult to obtain in order to develop their career. The placements in Spain will add great value by offering a supportive environment for participants to gain new industry insights, become proficient in a language other than English and appreciate another European culture. Who is this project aimed at?The project duration is one year and will accommodate 30 participants, with 10 per flow accompanied by a VET tutor from B3st. Its participants will typically be learners working towards vocational qualifications in the field of community development. We anticipate they will be between the ages of 18 and 25 and come from various backgrounds, often with limited opportunities to gain necessary work experience.  The three month mobility will be formally recognised with participants completing a City & Guilds VET qualification in \u2018Community Development\u2019 (Level 3) administered by B3st and 3Si in Seville. What are the objectives?Our main aim is to provide VET learners of Community Development with relevant work experience to develop their careers. We hope to give participants:\u2022 A practical understanding of community development at a trusted organisation that values sustainability\u2022 Enhanced employability skills that demonstrate workplace experience and adaptability \u2022 Personal and professional development with intercultural and linguistic skills\u2022 The opportunity to network and build up contacts in the relevant field\u2022 The platform to progress in their chosen career or embark upon further education in their sectorWhat activities will the participants do?The main activity involves a work placement of three months at either CEPES-A, EcoEduca, Ecologistas en Acci\u00f3n, Save the Children or Third Sector International. This will be complemented by linguistic support from qualified tutors and a programme of cultural and social activities, including organised language exchanges. The participants will be supported throughout the lifetime of the project with clearly defined stages, from mobility preparation to evaluation. Our mentoring and monitoring processes will aim to address the development and well-being of participants during their placement while informing project evaluation. What is your project methodology?The project\u2019s methodology provides a framework to support VET learners in developing skills acquired in the workplace as they work alongside experienced professionals in their chosen sector. Through our experience with past European mobility projects and our employer partnerships, we have developed and applied appropriate processes and instruments to ensure the project can be effectively managed and evaluated while providing support to participants for their personal and professional progression. What are the anticipated impacts of the project?We anticipate that the project will make a positive impact on its 30 participants by giving them the opportunity to develop professional and personal skills at a work placement in the community development field. Based on past projects, the experience should increase the participants\u2019 employment prospects while also giving them confidence to apply for work across Europe. It is expected that at least two thirds of participants (20-30) will move into suitable employment upon completion of the placement, with a further one fifth (five out of the 30) progressing into continued related training. The three month placement in Seville, together with linguistic support, should increase the participants\u2019 Spanish language proficiency by one CEFR level. The project will also impact on our partners by building their capacity to participate in further Erasmus+ programmes and European projects. The focus on sustainable communities should encourage participants and partners to consider and continue building a sustainable future for European society, reflecting Europe 2020 objectives. How do you expect project partners will benefit in the long term?Project outcomes will feed back into our own work as a VET college, our established partner relationships and employer networks, such as the Brighton Sustainable Business Network. It will benefit our development of European-centred vocational training and planned KA1 and KA2 projects in the field.

These groups of learners face barriers to learning and accessing work which their peers do not. They require an additional intervention in order to succeed and improve their future career and learning prospects. ObjectivesWe aim to work with learners with additional needs and fewer opportunities to support them with an additional intervention to build their confidence, skills and broaden their horizons. The objectives of the project will address their issues and needs through:-Providing additional assessment and support opportunities to validate skills for learners to succeed in their qualifications-Boosting employability and mobility in the wider EU labour market through practical work experience-Raising participant's awareness and understanding of other cultures, countries and language to broaden their life perspective-Increasing self-esteem, confidence and motivation and social skillsAccompanying adults will have opportunities for continued professional development, increasing their motivation in working with groups with fewer opportunities and will develop their teaching to include transnational perspectives.The partners also aim to work together to modernise education and training in working with these groups by sharing best practice and utilizing innovative techniques in supporting learners with fewer opportunities to improve their learning performance and enhance the employability and mobility prospects. The project will also reinforce and further develop the transnational scope of the partner organisations in working at an international level.Number and profile of participantsParticipants will be aged 16 - 65 with fewer opportunities studying introductory vocational qualifications in the vocational areas of horticulture, catering and construction.  Most learners will also have additional needs such as learning disabilities, mental health issues, housing issues, disengagement from society, low educational attainment, offending and drug and alcohol issues. The total number of learners who will participate in the project is 240 with 96 accompanying adults. This will be carried out over 24 mobility flows with an average of 10 learners and 4 accompanying adults per group. Description of project activitiesTwo week work placements will take place at Eco Chateau Training Hotel in the vocational areas of catering, horticulture and construction. The placement itinerary will be jointly designed by course tutors from sending partner organisations and the host partner to build in opportunities for assessment where learner evidence is lacking for specific qualification units and a range of individual learning objectives specific to the participants. ECVET arrangements will be developed to increase recognition of achievement. Outside of the working day, visits will be organised to places relevant to their vocational areas such as to local food producers and visits to building projects. Participants will also take part in cultural visits to places of interest, socialise with French people and share a meal in the local French community. Methodology used in carrying out the projectThe project will be managed within the Care Co-ops Quality and Project Management Framework. For mobility projects, this includes the 10 principles of the European Quality Charter for Mobility. Results and impact envisagedThe expected impact of the project on the learners is that they will have increased opportunities for their learning outcomes to be assessed, therefore increasing their opportunities to succeed in achieving their qualifications. We also expect that participants will demonstrate increased confidence, motivation, linguistic and employability skills through having carried out a work placement abroad. Consortium and partner organisations will share good practice through established networks and this will contribute to a larger dialogue about creative ways to engage learners with additional needs through mobility projects. Accompanying staff will develop their professional skills in sharing practice with consortium and partner organisations on supporting learners with additional needs and experience increased motivation as a result. Potential long term benefitsIn the long term we expect the project to have a significant impact on the learners' attitude towards work, learning and European work to increase their future prospects. Through further developing this model, we hope to share our learning more widely so that it can be adopted by other organisations for inclusion in future European mobility experiences.", "http://www.theplatform.org.uk", "The Platform Social Enterprise Limited", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA102-024190_coordinator"], ["4AA", "Technology Assisted Language Learning", "DELTA Language Training & Consultancy Ltd", 2173.0, "1. Background and justification of the project:The area of activity of CEPA Buitrago del Lozoya corresponds to the North Mountain range in the Autonomous Region of Madrid. In general terms, we consider that our students show three main educational needs:- Development of digital competences -Acquisition of linguistic competences (English, to be more precise)- Improvement of their employability. Tools for an active search of employment.Regarding our needs in teaching, we think it would be necessary to improve our teachers\u2019 competences in new technologies so that these can be integrated in their teaching practice. The area of activity of our school is a rural one, so that there are difficulties in communication between the different towns. That\u2019s why, within the European Development Plan, we aim at developing a Moodle platform which will enable to us meet the needs of those students who find it difficult to come to school and also, those from the city areas who haven\u2019t had a vacancy in their schools nearby due to the excessive demand there. 2. Profile and number of participants:Only one teacher from our school will attend the course, and that must be an English teacher. Besides, the teacher must meet the greater number of requirements:  - be a estate teacher, preferably a steady one in our school. - be a Head of Department (to facilitate the coordination with other English teachers and the School management team.) - experience in teaching3. Description of the course:-Applications software for language teachers-The creation and use of multimedia materials using commercial software and freeware-Digital content for reference, language practice and as a source of authentic material-The use of concordances and text analysis software for both language analysis and classroom use-Core skills for the internet including creating, and evaluating web content; networking and communication using web 2.0 tools and integrating these into the classroom-Setting up and managing a CALL or e-learning facility-The impact of the technology on methodology and the long-term and short-term implications for teachers and learners-In the second week, participants will begin work on an agreed project, including, but not limited to, the preparation of one or more lesson plans; a set of electronic learning materials; and a small website4.

Early in the twenty first century, hundreds of conflicts continues across the globe and most recently the civil unrest in the Arab world tagged \"Arab spring\". This among other things has led to the Syrian civil war and the ethno-communal clashes in Libya that has displaced millions and causing millions to flee to Europe for safety has created a major cause for concern. Yet as our fractured continental and global family struggles to find the answers to this tetrhydra  problem. A major problem and link has been consistently overlooked by agencies and government. There is a direct link between trauma, security and violence.  Politicians , activist , human rights campaigners and general public tend to think that as soon as you are able to remove a victim of violence from the location of the conflict, the  problems are solved  without adequately considering the traumatic experiences these individuals have gone through and how to treat and heal these wounds because unhealed trauma will create another cycle of violence and security threats. Everyone who has gone through one form of violence or the other needs delicate support because trauma and violence are integrally linked. Violence often leads to trauma and untreated trauma in turn can lead to violence and further security threats. Trauma affects our very physiology, including our ability to be integrated fully in a society  and ability to do whole brain thinking.  Trauma related violence can come in diverse forms. Some  traumas are triggered by explosive situations like violent conflict , while others can be in the form of verbal assault, hate speech or psychological torture. This project is designed  to train young people and youth workers on how to transform trauma from a repressed form of denial into an opportunity to help the victims to discover another reality by seeking support and treatment. This project will target victims of violence both violent conflicts, domestic and society instigated violence and refugees.  Because of the fears and concerns already expressed against refugees in certain European cities, if this kinds of trainings are not undertaken by victims of violence especially refugees, the backlash of a potential lash out that may occur in communities.

As a result of these changes of diverse cultural clashes and economic upheavals with increased competitions. These changes are also driving both systemic and topical changes in our everyday life settings. We often experience conflict as a disruption in the natural flow of our relationships and engagements either within a team or communities. When there is a sudden brake-down of relationship in a team, community or groups. People do notice that something has changed and in some cases the episodic occurrences are glaring like open confrontations or violence. Some intuitively think it is not right but what to do with this changes or unpleasant development is what is missing. People more often than not jump to conclusions as to what is wrong by carrying out superficial assessment of what the problem is based on what they can see. But how to dissect the problem  and these unfolding changes are the critical challenges to a lot of young people.  A lot of times, everyone seems to be consumed by episodes and manifestation of conflicts rather than  understanding the root causes and factors predisposing the conflicts . By responding to the episodes of a conflict people miss the right approaches to conflict transformation because episodes and manifestations are smokescreens for the root causes and underlying problems that gave rise to the conflict in the first place. Conflict is a natural, normal and neutral occurrence but how to deal with that which is normal and neutral is a major challenge. Depressed economies , unemployment among young people , diversity , multiculturalism and migration creates  dislocations and conflict but a clear understanding  of how to analyze these conflicts  is what is  lacking which makes a lot of people to either resort to blame game or wrong approaches to conflict which in turn escalates the conflict. It is possible for people to take the right approaches in dealing with conflict provided they understand the root causes of the conflict.  If you find yourself in a diverse team who are constantly in mortal disagreements and everyone pulling in different directions or a relationship that suddenly turns sour or a stable community which suddenly are up in arms against each other. A superficial assessment of the situation based on what can be seen or associated emotional feeling will confuse and derail right approaches to transforming the situation but a clear understanding of CONFLICT ANALYSIS SKILL  will help in delving to the epi-centre of the problem  which will bring about right approaches and lead to stable and harmonious working relationships. This training seeks to help people get off the superficial and cosmetics approach to understand complex situation and give them the needed tools and skills to untangle situations and help teams to unstand themselves better for better performance and communities and groups to function harmoniously in a mutually reinforcing dimensions. This training will mitigate kneel jerk responses to unpleasant pressured situations but gives the participant the required skills to cut through distractions and get to the heart of the problem because lack of clear understanding of  any conflict creates room for escalation of conflict which could make it more difficult to transform . \r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\r\n-To train 30 youth workers, youth leaders and youth in specific Conflict Analysis.  \r\n-Train youth workers and young people in Negotiation skills \r\n-To train youth workers and youth leaders the fundamental principles of creators who takes the advantages of bad situations to   \r\n   create new and better opportunities\r\n- To train  youth workers and youth leaders in team building and team leading skills which will enable them to leverage diversity in a\r\n   multicultural workspace.\r\n- Build a pool of conflict analyst\r\n- Train youth worker and youth leaders on the cycle of conflicts\r\n- Train participants in local capacities for peace-building\r\n- Train participants in strategic peace-building\r\n\r\nThe project will take place in Brighton in U.K for a Period of ten days  between 1st to 10th of July, 2017 with partners  which have been carefully selected, which includes Poland, Portugal, Italy ,Hungary, Bulgaria, Spain and U.K, These are countries going through major uncertainties and  young people are in despair of diverse forms.

A successor in this field of work is already appointed and is being trained. All other members of staff who are concerned with duties within the project at the college will continue to do their work, therefore  continuity of the project is guaranteed. It shows up as an advantage, that the number of colleagues who are involved with the European programme had continually been increased during the past years. This development will be continued:Two colleagues have taken over the job to intensify and improve our network with our partners in Lyon, France. We have already established contacts there with institutions of early childhood education and care, with a college for social pedagogy (ESSSE) and the university (ESPE). We are aiming at a mutual exchange of colleagues with the aim of intensifying our relationship (publishing work, organisation of an event with \u201cLe Furet\u201d, a professional organisation in Paris). French students already do practical terms in pedagogical institutions of the PFH. Other partners of our network in Berlin take part in these activities. Initiated by the department for education of the Berlin senate,we have lately been in contact with a group of teachers from colleges of social education in Turkey. These teachers were on an educational visit to Berlin, organized by the Turkish Ministry for Education. We had a presentation about our system of early childhood education at the college and organized visits to educational institutions of the PFH. Meanwhile, we have another request for a similar event. We aim at intensifying our existing contacts with Turkish institutions of professional qualification within the present application period. As we are regularly conducting seminars in preparation of study tours to Turkey for our students, we are well prepared for these activities and have qualified members of staff.Concerning the organizational development, we are at present involving our advisory office for students conducting practical terms. Up to now, the responsibility for students in foreign countries was with the European office, in future, the advisory office for practical terms will be responsible for the European students as well. This is part of our internationalisation strategie, to launch european aspects into regular work.With the introduction of a new curriculum there will be a stronger focus on European subjects. We plan to introduce a new seminar for students as follow-up to their European practical term.Educators as well as heads of institutions of early childcare are already active in the supervision of foreign students doing practical work there. As part of our strategy of internationalisation we will involve these colleagues in the exchange of staff with foreign professionals.While the homepage of the PFH is being revised at present, we will improve the presentation of European work with the help of a former colleague of the European team. We will install a platform to improve continuous informal communication with our European partners. We have already installed texts concerning European educational systems on the platform of our partner organization in Lyon.

About half of the scholarships of the new project have been scheduled  in September 2016, this scheduling (June \u2013 September) will be repeated each year till the end of the whole period. As in the past, the sending schools will carry out the mobility in the summer to avoid too much overlap with school lessons. On the other hand the mobility for the 4 staff is scheduled for the first two weeks of September, in each of the following years. Both the countries of destination and the foreign partners in UK, FR, DE, ES, CZ, EE have been confirmed. A new partner located in Poland has joined the project, in so doing the project has been opened to Eastern countries as already done in 2014. When the learners leave, they will have finished the 4th year; they are from technical courses with reference to both industrial profiles and to indirect services connected to industry: electronics, ICT, mechanics and mechatronics, chemistry, logistics, business administration and marketing. These are professional profiles employed in technical positions at intermediate level in companies located in Alto Vicentino . This project aims at facilitating youth employment by giving young people training and educational opportunities in order for them to improve professional and digital skills and learning about new production processes, managerial working processes, administration, commercial and marketing processes, district management ; the project aims at helping the young increase their communicative skills in European foreign languages focusing on the use of professional languages;  it also aims at increasing the essential relationship skills in different cultural and multiethnic environments, at improving self-learning self-evaluation, self-determination skills and all those soft skills that are universally recognized and needed. The mobility for the learners will last 5 weeks, during the first week the learners will go to a language course and during the remaining four weeks they will work as trainees in companies. The training period is organized according to procedures that will allow the recognition of the LO. The Certificate of competencies and the Europass Mobility Document will be awarded to the learners. When the learners leave most of them are not of age, so in order to guarantee their personal security and psychological  well-being and in order to facilitate the cultural impact, we provide for a tutor to go and stay with the learners for the first week abroad.

The four people of the staff have been teaching CLIL in technical, vocational subjects (electronics, maths and physics, law and ICT). They will spend two weeks in the UK, in the first week they will go to a language course, and the following week they will do shadowing activities either in schools or in companies whose work is pertinent to the staff. In so doing the staff will better understand how  the companies work, and at the same time they will improve their knowledge of the professional language. Each school will manage a greater number of mobility scholarships  than in the past. The beginning of VET  staff mobility for CLIL teachers, represents a real step forward towards the internationalization of the school, and a chance to compare its teaching and learning strategies with international training organizations. In 2016 all the schools of the consortium will work to increase,  of 10% each year, both the number of students and of staff who will get language certifications B1 and B2. The four schools pursue the same objectives through several different activities described in the Educational Offer of each of them (movies in foreign languages, lessons with mother tongue teachers, conferences on professional and cultural issues held  in English by experts, that have been part of the historical local partners, German and English Courses, language study holidays in the summer, school trips abroad).

The opportunity to participate in an Erasmus+ VET learner and staff mobility programme would be significantly beneficial to participants and enhance the provision offered for these academic courses.\r\n\r\nThis application specifically focusses on the FAIs Education courses for learners completing a Fetac Level 4 or 5, full time, Football, Sport and Recreation course called FAI ETB (Education and Training Board) and Hub courses.  The whole aim of the FAI ETB and Hub courses is to provide participants with a quality education in sport and recreation, football education and training, and fitness instruction so that they can progress on to employment within football and/or the sports industry.  Employment in football could take the format of gaining a professional contract as a player, or else as a coach/ coach educator or trainer.\r\nThe FAI seeks funding through Erasmus+ to support mobility for a total of 5 VET staff participants and 18 VET Learners from these courses to England and Spain.\r\n\r\nThe learner\u2019s mobility is for 18 people to travel to Brighton & Hove Albion FC in England, for a two week programme.  They will experience a professional football environment and all that is required to be successful in this area. They will observe and study the playing structure and that of the club, their philosophies, methodologies and ethos. The learners will have the opportunity to play against different clubs in the area to increase the cultural exposure gained whilst on this mobility.  In addition, the learners will participate in Albion in the Communities education programmes, where they will have the opportunity to practice their academic and coaching skills learned and implement these abroad.  \r\n\r\nThe combined programme of professional football and local coaching work experience in the community, will provide the best possible platform and experience for the learners to put into practice theory learned on their course in a different cultural environment. This will broaden their individual perspective and provide opportunities for future education or employment, as international experience would be seen as a major asset to their potential career.\r\n\r\nThe 5 VET Staff intend to travel to Spain for a 4 day mobility within a Spanish professional club. The staff aim to increase their coaching capabilities, competencies and academy awareness. They will study the youth structure of the club and how they incorporate best practices whilst dealing with academy students. This trip will facilitate the opportunity to compare and contrast the FAI education structure and courses to that of our Spanish neighbours. Finally they will experience a professional football environment, coaching, training, planning and development of players.  This will be advantageous to assist in the provision of a suitable environment for learners on Irish courses in pursuit of a professional football career.\r\nThe FAI has chosen Brighton FC in England and The Football Federation in Spain, as our mobility partners due to their commitment and dedication to all areas of football. Both countries perform exceptionally on the world stage and pave the way for coach and education development. \r\n\r\nBoth countries have thriving youth development and academy structures whereby they foster their footballers into fulfilling future aspirations whether it be further/higher education, have increased careers prospects or to perform as a professional footballer. \r\n\r\nIn order for Ireland to continue to compete on the international stage it is essential to ensure the skill development and progression for our coaches and learners is continuous and ongoing, therefore directly impacting development programmes such as Education Training Board (ETB) courses. \r\n\r\nHolistically, the individuals, the FAI and the game of football stands to inherit a wealth of knowledge through this European exposure and experience.", "http://Www.albioninthecommunity.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IE01-KA102-025593_2"], ["4FA", "Placements in Europe", "City College Brighton and Hove", 30446.0, "Kuben Upper Secondary School (Kuben) is a joint vocational and general academic school with internationalisation as one of its strategies. Providing our students and staff with the possibility of an international experience is one of our measures to decrease the drop-out rate, and increase the recruitment and elevating the status of vocational studies in Oslo. We want to show the students the opportunities in their chosen field of study/work, to give them a taste of a European community of their chosen field, and to give them a better understanding and a critical view of their training in Norway by letting them compare with methods in the host countries.\r\n\r\nKuben wants to send the following mobilities:\r\n- Up to 4 2nd year hair-dressing students and one accompanying teacher to City College Brighton & Hove (CCB) each year. The students will spend 4 weeks at the college while living with English host families. The work placement will take place late in spring, so that their stay coincides with the time when the local students mainly do practical work in the college's two saloons. The placement will make up an important part of the practical component of their training. The Kuben students will receive 5 hours a week of English Communications with other international students, and take part in extracurricular activities the International Office arranges. The accompanying teacher stays for 1 week, both to safeguard the students, and to meet with key staff at CCB to evaluate and plan for continued cooperation.\r\n- Up to 2 2nd year students from our health-worker program, and 2 from our childhood and youth-worker program, plus 2 accompanying teachers, one from each program, for work placement with our partners in Alicante, Spain. The work placement lasts for 4 weeks and the students will stay in a guarded apartment complex, where they share an apartment, and are looked after by a local contact person. The partner in Spain is the Norwegian School Costa Blanca, who let us use their local partner institutions for work placements. The health-worker students work at a Norwegian rehabilitation center. The childhood and youth-workers at a Norwegian/international kindergarten. In addition to their work placement, the students have 2 hours per week Spanish lessons.\r\nThe recruitment process starts while the students are in their 1st year. Returning participants hold a presentation to 1st year students about their experiences in Brighton or Alicante. At the start of the 2nd year, students are again informed about the possibility for the work placement, and the criteria for being selected as a participant. These are: little and only documented absence, proven interest in their chosen subject through both schoolwork and extracurricular activities, and that they trough their application and interview demonstrate why they should be selected and how they will represent Kuben in a satisfactory manner. We have preparatory meetings for the selected participants, and they receive written information and contracts. 1-2 weeks before departure, participants and their parents/guardians attends a Departure meeting. All participants are equipped with a folder with all necessary information and documents.\r\nThe possibility of having a work placement period abroad will be used for recruitment. \r\nAll work placement periods will be included as part of the students' in-depth study project in 2nd year. The quality of the contents is matched against the Norwegian curricula. The supervisors at the institutions and teachers at CCB evaluate the Kuben participants and send the evaluations to the teachers at Kuben.\r\nSuch projects have several positive effects, in particular for the participants and their classmates, but also for the status of the school and vocational studies in general. Through dissemination, participants and their classmates achieve a greater knowledge and understanding of their chosen profession and the opportunities that exist outside of Norway. It is also important that future students be shown that there are opportunities abroad for those who choose vocational studies, as there is a prevailing belief that only the program for general academic studies gives students the opportunity to do so. \r\n\r\nKuben wants to send 20 staff from all our vocational programs on mobilities for the next 2 years. These mobilities will last for one week each and will provide the staff with new skills and competences such as technology and learning strategies. Kuben will cooperate with various departments within the Oslo City Agency of Education and companies in the Oslo Vocational Networks to find suitable partners and to identify areas where we need to improve our competences.

Important parts of our education are the various practical trainings. In these practical trainings our students get to know different areas of social work and also acquire social skills. Our students take the A-level exam and acquire practical, social and economic education. The objective of the project is the possibility to support 41 students to do their internship abroad. By participating in this mobility project, the students will expand their own abilities and skills, and hopefully gain financial support. At the time of the participation in this project our students already have at least 200 hours of practical work experience in an Austrian social institution and so they already have a good level of training. This allows the students to broaden their professional and personal horizons and to strengthen their language skills for working life. They also get to know a variety of innovative concepts and methods of social work in other European countries. The activities of the internship are different, depending on the participating organisations and include the following work areas for example: working with people with special needs, working with disadvantaged people, employment with children, rehabilitation of homeless people or administrative activities in a social institution. The duration of stay abroad is between 4 weeks and 7 months. In general, all students of the third and fourth grade have the opportunity to apply for participation in this project.

In the foreground is the self-organization of the students. If necessary they are always supported by teachers. During the internship abroad professional training and personal development are central. Students will improve their professional, social, personal and communication skills and acquire new ones. They will also establish networks for their future working lives and get to know different cultures. Through the internships our students will gain new experiences and impressions which they can use in Austria. They gain self-confidence and can deal with language barriers easily.

The proportion of scholarship holders is of 62% and it is increasing. Our school includes two European sections: one in Italian, the other one in English. These 2 sections concern all the levels of our high school: from the fifth year to the final year. It also hosts a ULIS section for mentally handicapped pupils as well as pupils with autistic troubles and a few disabled pupils .\r\n\r\nThe OSE 2017/2018 programme aims at sending 14 pupils in their final year of Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel in Office Management and Administrative Work on a four-week work placement, out of the 22 compulsory weeks spent on placement.

For mobility projects, this includes the 10 principles of the European Quality Charter for Mobility. \r\n\r\nResults and impact envisaged\r\nThe expected impact of the project on the learners is that they will have increased opportunities for their learning outcomes to be assessed, therefore increasing their opportunities to succeed in achieving their qualifications. We also expect that participants will demonstrate increased confidence, motivation, linguistic and employability skills through having carried out a work placement abroad. Consortium and partner organisations will share good practice through established networks and this will contribute to a larger dialogue about creative ways to engage learners with fewer opportunities and additional needs through mobility projects.

Based on past projects, the experience should increase the participants\u2019 employment prospects while also giving them confidence to apply for work across Europe. It is expected that at least two thirds of participants will move into suitable employment upon completion of the placement, with a further one fifth progressing into continued related training. \r\n\r\nThe three month placement in Seville, together with linguistic support, should increase the participants\u2019 Spanish language proficiency by one CEFR level. The project will also impact on our partners by building their capacity to participate in further Erasmus+ programmes and European projects. The focus on sustainable communities should encourage participants and partners to consider and continue building a sustainable future for European society, reflecting Europe 2020 objectives. \r\n\r\nHow do you expect project partners will benefit in the long term?\r\n\r\nProject outcomes will feed back into our own work as a VET college, our established partner relationships and employer networks, such as the Brighton Sustainable Business Network.

Youth workers shall return from this training, with a strong awareness of existing tools in VR/AR and how these can be deployed in a youth work context at an affordable cost, so that participants may replicate or inspire themselves from the solutions we will have introduced during the training. \r\n\r\nWhilst the effectiveness of VR/AR has tools for learning has been demonstrated by academic research and in particular has shown to not only have a positive impact on learning and mental health, It\u2019s usage in the field of youth organisations and non for profits has been lackluster. Lack of access to required equipment, and costs associated with VR/AR have been initial barriers of entry for many youth organisations. Yet rapidly falling costs of associated VR/AR equipment , and the emergence of existing VR / AR tools that work in conjunction with modern smartphones (e.g. Apple ARkit, Google\u2019s ARcore, Unity and Google Cardboard) now allow youth organisations and non for profits to consider using VR/AR in their fields. This creates the perfect opportunity for youth workers to adopt VR / AR solutions for their field of work, our training aims to assist youth workers in acquiring the theoretical knowledge required to deploy these solutions.\r\n\r\nAdditional objectives of the project and how they fit EU policy are the following:\r\n\r\nNew learning opportunities for NEETS\r\n\r\nStudents who aren\u2019t interested or aren\u2019t regularly immersed in the learning process tend not to understand the subject properly, may experience delayed learning or even refuse to study at all. Finding ways to motivate students and specifically students identified as NEETS remains a crucial determinant of the quality of the learning process. Modern or innovative learning materials, including digital ones, are rarely much different than traditional textbooks. Most so-called advanced materials (such as MOOCS) don\u2019t feature appealing visuals or truly interactive features, and are often perceived by students as boring. The usage of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality offer the opportunity to try novel teaching methods on NEETS who might have disengaged from traditional teaching methods, VR / AR allow students to interact with computers in a brand new way, enabling creativity and additional interactivity.\r\n\r\nEurope 2020 Objectives for smart growth\r\n\r\nAs part of the Europe 2020 strategy, the commission aims to bring economic growth within the EU partly by inciting innovation and fostering a digital society. Our project will be one of the means to help achieve these goals. Our program will empower youth workers with the skill set and knowledge necessary for them to collaborate with youths. The usage of VR / AR  in a youth work context, is likely to enhance creativity, innovation and leadership within youths themselves, as well as introduce youths to creative and productive usages of the VR / AR which could lead them to take an interest in a variety of related career fields including STEMS or media and arts related fields.\r\n\r\nIncreasing digital competencies \r\n\r\nVR / AR in particular offer particular avenues of growth for the economy, with estimate, research by IDC suggesting that the global market for VR and AR will be worth in excess of $162 billion by 2020. The scale and size of the market offers, employment opportunities for Europeans, yet current offers for training remains inadequate and limited to a niche number of individuals. Fostering digital competencies, remains one of the cornerstones of the commission's objective for 2020 and by offering training focussed on VR and AR to youth workers, we are offering training at the forefront of technological change, equipping youth workers with knowledge they can then transmit to youngsters themselves. \r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nWe have several activities planned so far.

Thankfully, in recent years the focus on human rights education and its quality standards is increasing due to the work of human rights and development organizations, however, human rights education as a concept and practice is relatively new to the non-formal education sector.

These management courses are full-time schooling. Sometimes also graduates of dual system qualifications who don\u2019t find any employment after their graduation take part in this project. For example social insurance clerks, IT clerks, office clerks, bank clerks, retail clerks, notary clerks and clerks in public administration. Besides the students and graduates of the mentioned professions the target group also consists of the teaching staff of Friedrich-List-Schule. The different skill enhancements should be realized in this project.\r\nA central target of our project is the better employability on the labour market. This employability however is not given with the majority of the participants before this project. Especially the graduates of full-time schooling courses i.e. graduates of the commercial assistance qualifications have great difficulties in finding a job because they lack work experience, important linguistic and social competences.\r\nThe planned project is suited for the further education demands of the participants and thus enables them to find a job.\r\nOur main target, the good employability of participants on the first labour market is achieved by the acquisition of international competences, foreign language experiences, intercultural knowledge and experiences in the international world of work. Therefore the participants in general do a 26- week internship related with their job in a European destination country.\r\nThey acquire linguistic, intercultural, personal and social skills as well as competences referring to their job without those they would hardly find an adequate job. The requirement of our target group is the further education concerning languages, personality and job specific to increase the employability on the local, national and international labour market. By means of this project the participants achieve a considerable additional value related to their job and personality and after their return it\u2019s a lot easier for them to get a job on the first labour market. \r\nThe Hessian Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs officially authorized the sending organization to make it possible that also graduates from other Hessian vocational colleges which are not in a position to carry out such projects to take part in those projects. To promote the demand for further education above all the mobility of young graduates coming from the structure weak regions in East-North and Mid-Hesse is another vital target of the project since in these regions there are only few jobs available catering for the individual commercial qualifications the students have. \r\nThe students will do a 6-week commercial work placement at the end of their first year of studies in a European target country. The participants will increase their motivation and will start their second year of studies highly enthusiastically.

The project partner  Norwich Institute for Language Education (NILE) in Norwich, Great Britain offers the opportunity to our students to improve their English language skills, especially concerning the demands of a technical engineer.  This includes technical outings to local factories and staying with local families. Giving these students this extraordinary opportunity to immerse themselves in English language and culture in this way means that they will improve their language skills and gather job relevant experience in a member country of the European Union. This enables them to gain knowledge and also share it using a common language. Furthermore the students not only learn more about the way of life in a foreign country but also more about the different conditions and processes at workplaces. The students learn how to cope with standard situation in daily life by communicating in a foreign language. This experience and the ability to exchange knowledge in English will improve their chance of getting a better job in their home region and also sharpens the view for the necessity of being mobile within the borders of the European Union and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this project is on the following subject specific main topics:\r\n- development of a technical product during the whole two weeks course,\r\n- simulation of business meetings,\r\n- taking part in discussions,\r\n- writing and answering business letter,\r\n- preparing subject related presentations in English\r\n- giving presentations in front of an english-speaking audience. \r\n \r\nDuring all of these activities skilled Tutors from NILE observe the students progress to make sure that they are well prepared to work in an English speaking work environment.  \r\nThe basis for the activity is a Memerandum of Understanding and a learning agreement between the partner organisation (NILE), the students and the Technical College of Engineering in Memmingen. To adjust and fine tune the content of the course programme according to the students demands, a permanent contact between the involved organizations is essential.  The content of this learning agreement is furthermore the basis for the evaluation process of the activity to find out whether the previous made arrangement were achieved.   \r\nBefore the actual stay abroad the students will be prepared in pre-courses aside from regular English lessons to provide them with the necessary language skills as well as to help them to organise the trip.

The language course takes two weeks and consists of ten days with five hour lessons per day. At the beginning of the course the tutors check out the special needs of the student and divide them into two groups according to their English knowledge. At all-time two German teachers are at hand if their might occur any problem, like students become ill, etc. \r\nAfter the first five days of the course an interim evaluation will be made by filling out a questionnaire to ensure the quality of the activity and to enable the tutors at Nile to take action whether special needs are demanded. \r\nTo practice the achieved language skills in real situations visits to factories like the Lotus Car Factory in Hethel or the IWM Aircraft museum in Duxford (where the students have to interact with staff members and managers) are made as well as trips to places and sights of cultural importance about which the students have to report and give presentations.\r\nAt the end of the course the students obtain a course specified certification as well as the Europass Mobility which will be signed by the two partners (NILE and the College of Technical Engineering).\r\nBeing back to their home country the students have to fill out a questionnaire to tell about the improvements and experiences they made and to critically evaluate the outcome of the activity.\r\nThe impressions of the whole trip, the experiences and improvements the students made will be told to the local media, narrated and described in the annual schoolbook and on the school\u2019s homepage.

Through the internships our students will gain new experiences and impressions which they can use in Austria. They gain self-confidence and can deal with language barriers easily. All acquired skills are a personal gain for their future career. The stay abroad is recognized as an internship. The stories of the students from their internships and the smooth mobility of labor within the European Union will lead to more students planning to study abroad.", "http://wwwpumpkinpatchnursery.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-AT01-KA102-038884_9"], ["6NN", "Building Sustainable Communities with VET 3", "Brighton Third Sector Training Ltd.", 486665.0, "CONTEXT\r\n\r\n'Building Sustainable Communities with VET 3' expands on two previous KA1 mobility projects that brings together B3st\u2019s ambitions in providing relevant placements at organisations who work sustainably in communities and education in Seville, Spain and Faro, Portugal. It recognises the need for participants to gain work experience that is increasingly difficult to obtain in order to develop their career. The placements will add great value by offering a supportive environment for participants to gain new industry insights, become proficient in a language other than English and appreciate another European culture. \r\n\r\nPARTICIPANT PROFILE\r\n\r\nThe project will accommodate a total of 72 participants over two years. They will typically be learners working towards vocational qualifications in the field of community development and training and education. We anticipate they will be between the ages of 18 and 25 and come from various backgrounds, often with limited opportunities to gain relevant work experience in their chosen field.  The three month mobility will be formally recognised through Europass mobility documents and certificates from upon successful completion of their vocational course.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nOur main aim is to provide VET learners with relevant work experience in community engagement and education to enhance and develop their careers. We aim to give participants:\r\n\r\n\u2022 A practical understanding of work at a relevant organisation that engages communities using a sustainable approach\r\n\u2022 Enhanced employability skills that demonstrate workplace experience and adaptability \r\n\u2022 Personal and professional development with intercultural and linguistic skills\r\n\u2022 The opportunity to network and build up contacts in the relevant field\r\n\u2022 The platform to progress in their chosen career or embark upon further education in their sector\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe main activity involves a work placement of three months at a range of community-focused organisations in either Seville or Faro. This will be complemented by linguistic support from qualified tutors and a programme of cultural and social activities, including organised language exchanges. The participants will be supported throughout the lifetime of the project with clearly defined stages, from mobility preparation to evaluation. Our mentoring and monitoring processes will aim to address the development and well-being of participants during their placement while informing project evaluation. \r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s methodology provides a framework to support VET learners in developing skills acquired in the workplace as they work alongside experienced professionals in their chosen sector. Through our experience with past European mobility projects and our employer partnerships, we have developed and applied appropriate processes and instruments to ensure the project can be effectively managed and evaluated while providing support to participants for their personal and professional progression. \r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\n\r\nWe anticipate that the project will make a positive impact on all its 72 participants by giving them the opportunity to develop professional and personal skills at a relevant work placement. Based on past projects, the experience will increase the participant's\u2019 employment prospects while also giving them confidence to apply for work across Europe. It is expected that at least two thirds of participants will move into suitable employment upon completion of the placement, with a further one fifth progressing into continued related training. \r\n\r\nThe three month placement in Seville and Faro, together with linguistic support, should increase the participants\u2019 language proficiency by one CEFR level. The project will also impact on our partners by building their capacity to participate in further Erasmus+ programmes and European projects. The focus on sustainable communities should encourage participants and partners to consider and continue building a sustainable future for European society, reflecting Europe 2020 objectives. \r\n\r\nSUSTAINABILITY\r\n\r\nProject outcomes will feed back into our own work as a training provider, our established partner relationships and employer networks, such as the Brighton Sustainable Business Network. It will benefit our development of European-centred vocational training and planned KA1 and KA2 projects in the field. Our relationship with partners that have wider networks will facilitate dissemination activities with the intention of building sustainability into professional approaches and organisation operations; closing the gap between VET provision and the world of work; and fostering a more informed understanding of the needs of jobseekers and employers in community development.", "http://www.b3st.org.uk", "Brighton Third Sector Training Ltd.", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047440_coordinator"], ["6NN", "YOUNG EUROPLAB IV", "Brighton Third Sector Training Ltd.", 135079.0, "The INTERNATIONALIZATION AND INCORPORATION OF THE EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVE to the educational offer of the centers, is part of the \"European Development Plan\" of the Consortium.

technological skills, but also a healthy attitude and mindset towards technology in their future work and everyday life. Youth work should be able to respond to these needs accordingly by having skilled workers that are familiar with on-line tools, and who are also able to raise critical questions about technology. As the primary role of youth work is to assist young people through their transition into adulthood, we have to bring our focus on helping youth to find a balance between on-line and off-line worlds. Through our conversations with Partner Organisations, Youth Work Practitioners and Young People, and by taking into consideration the challenging context of Youth Work in Europe today we have identified an urgent need to contribute to developing digital youth work competences of youth work practitioners and young people, and also the need to put emphasis on critically analysing social media. As all Partner Organisations are using digital youth work approach in their practices and have years of experiences addressing hate speech online, we are keen to explore different digital tools and digital youth work approach and to challenge the issues such as cyber bullying, hate speech on-line, social exclusion etc. that digitisation have brought upon young people.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of 'Re-Naturing' project is to explore Digital Youth Work Approach and to bring focus on critical analysis of social media through the perspectives of youth work practitioners, young people and youth organisations. Specific objectives of 'Re-Naturing' for each of the groups are: \r\n* Youth Work practitioners: to support their development of knowledge and skills for Digital Youth Work, and to foster an attitude of critically analysing social media; also to enhance passion and competences for International Youth Work.\r\n* Young People: to provide a safe space for critical discussions about social media and technology; skills of digital literacy; and experiences of re-connecting with nature and people.\r\n* Youth Organisations: to create opportunities for up-skilling staff and volunteers with Digital Youth Work competences as a response to challenging the context of youth digitisation. \r\n\r\n'Re-Naturing' project has three Mobility Activities: \r\nA 1.

Youth Mobility Activity (October 2018 Georgia)\r\n\r\nThrough their learning process Youth Work Practitioners will come to understand how digitisation is shaping and changing 'old school' youth work context. They will know how young people communicate in digital environments and what supports they need to be able to react to hate speech, cyber bullying and other unwanted behaviour online. They will gain an ability to encourage young people to make informed decisions about on-line image and activities.Thus, will be able to asses and to understand digital literacy level of each young person that they work with in order to support him/her. Youth Work Practitioners will know how to challenge young people to think critically about social media and digital content. Practitioners will establish appropriate professional boundaries in their on-line relationships with young people, while reflecting on their personal youth worker's digital identity and will learn how to use different digital tools. As a result of these skills and knowledge gain they will feel more confident and 'up to speed' in the context of digital youth work.They will find easier to connect with young people as a result of better understand young peoples on-line relationships and on-line realities. \r\n\r\nThrough their learning experiences participants will be able to articulate personal position in terms of digitisation, and become actively involved in the process that is shaping our societies.Young People will be safer on-line, as they will know how to address the issues of cyber bullying and hate speech, how to protect their digital identity, and how to assess risks on-line. They will make an informed choices about the life they want to live on social media and the self-image they create on-line. Through intercultural learning experiences Young People will become more open to different cultures and will appreciate diversity. They will feel confident and be able to address difficult life situations as a source of learning. Young People will know how to find 'outside-the-box' solutions therefore the quality of their lives will improve. Additional sets of new skills will develop through the youth exchange, such as facilitation, public speaking, group work and English language which will improve their employ-ability. Also, ability to relate to people from various backgrounds, cultures and natural environment will reflect positively in personal relationships with people around.", "http://www.euromernet.org", null, "erasmus_2018-2-IE01-KA105-038852_4"], ["9RH", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "THE UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX", 357024.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.sussex.ac.uk", "THE UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-047012_coordinator"], ["1AL", "Aktive Ausbildung: Erfahrung England", "Erasmus Brighton Ltd", 45141.0, "As a vocational business school the Friedrich-List-Berufskolleg cooperates with regional internationally active companies. That is why internationalization is of high priority for us and for this reason there are several different activities and developments at our school to further our internationalization.\r\nIn 2018 our Erasmus+ mobility project in England for trainees will again be a central part our strategy of internationalization. Meanwhile the number of dual courses of vocational education has grown to eight. Like in recent years our students will take part in a four-week period of practical training while living in host families. This large-scale project will strengthen not only the mobility but also the international awareness of our students.\r\nIn the full-time courses of education students of our school have the opportunity to get support for periods of practical training abroad, including certification with the Europass Mobility. In the long term our school also plans to start an practical training.\r\nA further component of our school\u2019s strategy of internationalization is an exchange of retail students with France, supported by the Deutsch-Franz\u00f6sisches Sekretariat. Preparations are in progress for this programme.\r\nIn 2017 our school took part in the DAAD programme \u201cEuropa macht Schule\u201d. Students from the international remedial classes learned from visiting spanish and portugueses students more about Europe in a fascinating way. This successfull project will take part in 2018, too. \r\nMoreover, there will be field excursions for full-time and part-time students to Brussels, Prague and Strasbourg at the Friedrich-List-Berufskolleg in 2018.\r\nForeign language teaching is valued highly at our school. Especially English is promoted by lessons at different levels according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. Such a course system has been successfully implemented in the English classes for retail as well as wholesale and foreign trade students. Furthermore, trainees at our school can choose to take part in additional business English courses to have their skills certified by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry. This offer of foreign language learning certification is open to all classes.\r\nIn English lessons and politics classes European topics are being taught, especially in preparation of the students\u2019 work placements in England. In English and German lessons the students are also taught to deal with Europass CVs so that they can competitively present their skills on the European job market.\r\nAnother qualification to be gained which can increase the students\u2019 job finding opportunities nationally and internationally is the European Computer Driving Licence. The Friedrich-List-Berufskolleg is a certified ECDL test centre.\r\nBesides, at the Friedrich-List-Berufskolleg students can learn to look out for fairness in international trade as there is a students\u2019 caf\u00e9 project called \u201cFair Caf\u00e9\u201d in which they mostly sell fair trade products from developing countries to other students.\r\nTo facilitate the integration of foreign students in Germany and at our school we now offer several international remedial classes for youths without a certificate of secondary education and devoid of or with only very little German language skills. Because of the increased amount of refugees, this course of studies has become a main focus for our college.", "http://www.erasmusbrighton.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA116-004404_1"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1ND", "Utilise Plus", "West Sussex Sustainable Bus P'ships", "Chamber of Commerce in partnership with Solent LEP and beyond the initial information, brokerage and diagnostic stage, provide support for 170 additional enterprises.
