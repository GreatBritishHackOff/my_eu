Also we are beginning to see interesting multimodal interactions.

Andhra Pradesh, a state in southern India, was used as a context for the analysis.\n\nTwo important results were found. One is that drought has negative effects on child nutrition, but only in communities affected by violence. The other is that political violence has major negative effects on child nutrition due to reducing the ability to cope with drought conditions.\n\nAn interesting finding was that during a ceasefire period the effects of drought had been reversed. Furthermore, the isolation that households face due to conflict has consequences on how well they can cope since access to public goods and services is restricted.\n\nAnother aspect the project examined is how economic expectation is impacted. First, individuals in conflict areas perceive bad outcomes to be much more likely than individuals in low or no conflict areas. Second, even after 40 years of violent conflict people are still sensitive to changes in the configuration of conflict patterns. This suggests that short-term recovery could be possible and negative effects on outlooks on life and hopelessness are (at least partially) reversible.\n\nImportant lessons can be learned from the findings in terms of how to cope with the impact of conflicts and uncertainties at the household level.", null, "http://www.ids.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/155482.jpg", "fp7_104207_999860384"], ["9RH", "Responses to coastal climate change: Innovative Strategies for high End Scenarios -Adaptation and Mitigation-", "The University of Sussex", "Coastal areas concentrate vulnerability to climate change due to high levels of population, economic activity and ecological values.

It mapped SME research support mechanisms focusing on public programmes or public\u2013private partnerships. These steps are meant to produce the ideal economic climate and innovation policies to advance SMEs within the European Research Area (ERA).\n\nRAPPORT developed a thorough methodology to investigate the interaction between SMEs and organisations offering access to available research. The project looked into how to strengthen SMEs' ability to articulate its innovation needs, identify the right source of expertise, integrate the acquired knowledge and exploit it commercially. The project team looked at 331 national, regional and local programmes that supported knowledge and technology transfer for SMEs. It interviewed 481 programme stakeholders, including 305 programme managers, 32 KTT enablers (agents, network brokers etc.), 37 knowledge providers (researchers) and 57 beneficiary SMEs.\n\nThe project distinguished between SMEs with high absorptive capacity and SMEs with low or medium absorptive capacity. It differentiated between the programmes and the practices that were appropriate for each group of SMEs. \n\nThe analysis of this project provided a clear insight into the challenges faced by KTT programmes. KTT programmes should be able to provide the means to HAC SMEs to enable them to engage in meaningful innovation and commercialisation activities. KTT programme should also be able to detect those LAC SMEs that have a poor track record of innovation and KTT, but possess the willingness to innovate and grow. Finally KTT programmes should be able to engage with those LAC SMEs that have no obvious interest or appetite for innovation and alter their attitudes and their behaviours in order to convert them gradually into SMEs of higher absorptive capacity.\n\nThree generic strategies were identified to cope with these challenges.  This included agent-supported programmes, firm-incentive programmes and network-based programmes. The agent-supported and the network-based programmes possess the greatest potential for behaviour change and innovation. Agent-supported programmes are more frequent with the low absorptive capacity SMEs, while the network-based programmes fit better the requirements of high absorptive capacity SMEs. Firm-incentive programmes (like the innovation voucher schemes) can provide resources for KTT and innovation but have little potential for behavioural and attitude change.\n\nA number of reports were produced to further knowledge transfer and assist SMEs.

Simpler systems can often be satisfactory described by linear models, but complex systems require non-linear models that can capture more of the characteristics of such systems, such as thresholds, feedback loops, avalanche effects, and irreversibility. Linear systems can be validated by aligning models to the past and using the model to predict the future. Non-linear systems, however, are often time-asymmetric - they can be explained with the wisdom of hindsight, but are not always predictable. For example, systems may respond sharply to minor perturbations, and the quality of this response is a measure of the system resilience. In practice, non-linear dynamics are significant both at the micro-scale of small history and at the macro-scale of deep time. The brilliant young scientist, for example, may experience a series of epiphanies that change his/her understanding and behaviour in an unpredictable and irreversible way. The scientific community as a whole may experience an innovation-cascade that has a similar effect on a much larger scale.\nCurrent models of climate change and carbon emission assume the immediate past is a reasonable guide to the future.

Although TEs can have beneficial effects, the vast majority of TE insertions are thought to be either neutral or deleterious. TEs can be harmful because they disrupt important sequences, such as regulatory elements and protein-coding sequences, attract epigenetic markers that can alter expression, and lead to duplication, deletion and rearrangement of DNA through ectopic recombination. Hosts therefore have mechanisms to repress the transposition of TEs, repression that TEs are under selection to avoid. To accomplish this, it is expected that TEs should be undergoing adaptive evolution. In this project we propose to test (i) whether TEs are undergoing adaptive evolution at the primary sequence level, (ii) whether TEs assimilate host gene fragments as a means to escape host silencing, and (iii) whether either strategy leads to an increase in TE success. We will investigate these questions in plants using examples of the two broad classes of TEs: the Sireviruses (class I LTR retrotransposon), and Mutator (class II DNA transposon). We will consider the evolution of these two families in maize and Arabidopsis thaliana, species that have very different genome sizes and numbers of TEs.

These included policies relating to renewable wind energy with biodiversity, renewable bioenergy with biodiversity, and agriculture and water. Additional combinations included hydropower with river basin policies, and building energy efficiency with waste policies. Lastly, recycling was considered against waste and water policies, and renewable energy was evaluated in terms of production efficiency and integration in the building sector.\n\nAPRAISE importantly noted the necessity of focusing not only on achieving targets as this can mask underlying unsustainability or policy inefficiencies, as some of the case studies showed. Instead, environmental policies must pay close attention to processes of policy design, implementation and evaluation if they are to support the EU's medium- and long-term sustainability goals.\n\nThe project used a variety of methods to ensure dissemination of its results and continued implementation of its methods and tools.

Thus, multinational firms (MNCs) outsourced parts of production processes to manufacturers in Asia and other low-cost locations around the globe, while retaining the most knowledge intensive assets in the home country. This is no longer the case. MNCs increasingly scout the globe for locations where the right mix of local competences allows them to tap into sophisticated parts of value chains. This is not limited to advanced economies but more and more involves firms and regions in selected developing countries that position themselves as attractive knowledge-intensive locations in their own right. INGINEUS studies the determinants of this process and analyses its implications both for the EU and its emerging partner countries in the developing world. First, it looks at the changing strategies of MNCs and the conditions under which it is favourable for them to offshore R&D and other knowledge-intensive parts of their production process.

The proper orchestration of mitotic progression is controlled by the balanced activity of mitotic kinases and counteracting phosphatases. Misregulation of these controls can be detrimental causing loss of entire chromosomes and aneuploidy. Considering that mitotic kinases are only expressed in actively dividing cells, targeting these kinases for cancer management is highly desirable. To this end, we are validating the mitotic kinase Greatwall Kinase (Greatwall) as a target for cancer therapy. Initial studies show that siRNA knockdown of Greatwall leads to rapid cell death in a number of transformed cell lines. Surprisingly, we found that untransformed RPE cells with low Greatwall protein and mRNA levels remained unaffected after Greatwall knock down. Moreover, Greatwall levels fluctuate dramatically among different cancer cell lines and are generally low in non-transformed tissues. Seminal studies using Xenopus egg extracts and drosophila larvae show that Greatwall has an important role in the cell cycle control of rapidly dividing embryonic cells and it is possible that some tumor cells have reverted back to this state of dependency on Greatwall. This makes Greatwall even more promising as an anti-cancer agent as its activity is dispensable in somatic cells but critical to the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. In light of these findings, I aim to pursue target validation studies with Greatwall, elucidate synergistic effects using known mitotic kinase inhibitors, and work closely with a team of medicinal chemists to characterize novel small-molecule Greatwall modulators.

A few adaptive learning systems consider specific inference-making interventions that are pivotal in text comprehension, but such systems are designed for high-school children or university-level students, and with textbooks as reading material. The use of more intelligent adaptive learning systems to custom-tailor such interventions in an adaptive fashion to (hearing and deaf) poor comprehenders has tremendous potential. TERENCE embodies that potential.<br/>TERENCE aims at offering innovative usability and evaluation guidelines, refining the current cognitive and pedagogical models concerning story comprehension and inference making, and delivering a showcase intelligent adaptive learning system. The system's smart games, developed and classified according to the refined models, will ask children to draw inferences about temporal events of stories, in Italian and in English. Moreover, the system will allow teachers to choose and custom-tailor the types of stories and games according to the needs of their learners.<br/>The guidelines, the models and the system will be the result of an orchestrated cross-disciplinary effort of European experts in diverse and complementary fields (art and design, computer science, engineering, linguistics, evidence-based medicine, psychology), and with the constant involvement of the end-users (deaf and hearing poor comprehenders, their educators) from schools in Brighton (UK), and in the Veneto area (Italy).", 182982.0, 2310172.0, "TERENCE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.sussex.ac.uk", null, "fp7_95743_999852721"], ["9RH", "Accelerating and Rescaling Transitions to Sustainability", "The University of Sussex", "The objective of ARTS is to benefit policy, practice and theory related to accelerating sustainability transitions and to create opportunities for innovation (including social innovation) by coupling, rescaling and accelerating sustainability initiatives in European city-regions.

In parallel, within debates about climate change adaptation there has been an emerging trend to position migration as an adaptation strategy to environmental shocks and stresses. However, migration is expensive, requiring a number of assets/capitals. This can result in some populations who experience the impacts of environmental change seeing a reduction in the very capital required to enable a move. Environmental change is therefore equally likely to make migration less possible as more probable. In the decades ahead, millions of people are thus likely to be unable to move away from locations in which they are extremely vulnerable to environmental change. To the international community, this \u2018trapped\u2019 population is likely to represent just as important a policy concern as those who do migrate.

State of the Art and beyond: The first generation of targeted therapies in chronic inflammatory disease used RA as prototype disease for clinical development. These therapies are now also used in other inflammatory disorders. Although treatments have been developed that are effective in a proportion of patients, they are aspecific, relatively toxic and do not mediate cure. Currently, it is unknown which molecular effects need to be induced and/or targeted to prevent induction or persistency of RA. However, this is within reach through a strong international consortium of world-leading European groups that cover both basic- and translational research.  Work plan: The general strategy for the project is to enable parallel studies that are focussed on critical switch moments in the biological processes that drive chronicity of inflammation. As the consortium consists of a multidisciplinary team with basic- and clinical expertise, translational research will be conducted to delineate the molecular basis of dysregulated inflammation, the RA-specific autoimmune-response and organ specific pathobiology.  The final aim is to develop novel- and specific anti-inflammatory therapies.

Further, it introduces spatial and scaled approaches, which are the most rigorous and well suited to a comprehensive conflict study, as risks, triggers and dynamics are spatially inscribed and hierarchical. The theoretical contribution of this work is an examination of how insurgency and opposition violence are spatial and political processes that are shaped by the political, economic and social geographies of states.

These are the boundary challenge (how to define people) and the limits of self-government (how to control the controllers). Another project result was identification of populist forces that impact democratisation.\n\nThe project's results are expected to enlighten policymakers, analysts and academics on the different types of populism manifesting themselves around the world.

By developing several novel methods, we will establish this new concept and demonstrate that the self-clearing of chromosomes is an essential mechanism allowing complete removal of sister chromatid cohesion, and that it is a fundamentally conserved function from yeast to vertebrates. To maintain genetic integrity, eukaryotic cells must duplicate their chromosomes and subsequently segregate them to opposite poles of the cell, prior to cell division. Cohesion is established between sister chromatids during S phase and marks sister pairs to ensure proper chromosome segregation in the next mitosis. However, the cohesion must be eventually removed to allow sister chromatids to separate and segregate to opposite poles. Although recent studies have revealed how the removal of cohesion is initiated, it is still elusive how this removal is completed.

Many also predicted that the winner/loser divide would form the basis of political divides in the emergent party systems, and that these divides would subsequently harden into lasting political cleavages.\nAlthough the winner/loser divide has been employed in a number of country studies, the literature on this topic is lacking in three respects: (i) no studies use a comprehensive theoretical approach that treats the divide as both objective and subjective in nature; (ii) there are currently no comparative, diachronic studies focusing directly on this cleavage that cover the whole of the transition period, and (iii) few studies to date have analysed the regional, aggregate-level dimension of this divide using appropriate methods.

While theory is expected to play a key role in the understanding this complex and topical issue, current investigations are typically limited to the study of evolution of a single trait. This sharply contrasts with our usual understanding that a species response to environmental change is likely to involve many traits, where many genes pleiotropically affect several characters. Interestingly, the only brief attempt to investigate the effect of pleiotropy has demonstrated that adaptation of a single trait to a gradual environmental change can be substantially impeded by selection on a second pleiotropic trait. However, Waxman and Peck have shown that in a static environment, a qualitatively new phenomenon occurs when mutations pleiotropically affect not two, but three or more traits in an effectively infinite asexual population. When this holds, the genotypic distribution has a different equilibrium form to usual (where all genetic sequences are rare): a single optimal genetic sequence become predominant. Since the genotypic distribution is a key factor to adaptation, such a qualitative change will have significant impacts on the response of a population to a changing environment. In this proposal, we plan to theoretically investigate evolutionary adaptation to environmental change when the number of pleiotropic traits is larger than two. This first implies the need to generalize the theory of Waxman and Peck, in a static environment, by extending the analysis to: (i) finite populations, (ii) haploid sexual populations and (iii) diploid sexual populations.

FRIDA examined in particular the reasons for these firms' impacts on different regions, as well as how they contribute to the development of networks and capabilities in these areas.\n\nExamining the interplay among anchor firms, regions and networks, the project concluded that the anchor role can actually be played by either small firms or large organisations. Its research also showed that the anchor role is temporary and that at the local system new actors take the lead after a period of time.\n\nIn addition, the project members looked at the role of anchors in shaping the development of local networks and influencing regional development. They also examined the resources and capabilities that anchors require to enable local development.\n\nProject results include precise recommendations for policymakers at all levels, as well as suggestions for local decision makers, public institutions and industry to enhance the role of anchor firms. FRIDA outcomes were communicated through workshops, policy-oriented events, seminars, conferences and publications.\n\nOverall, this initiative will help improve how firms stimulate start-up businesses, generate knowledge, provide financing, open up new markets and enhance training.

The architecture of the relationships among these actors may exert a significant influence in shaping technological change in certain directions rather than others, which in turn may have the potential to provide more socially optimal or desirable technological options.

One method of DNA repair, called homologous recombination (HR), involves using intact undamaged DNA sequences as a template to repair the damaged copy. HR is used extensively in meiotic cells to repair DNA breaks that are purposely created by the cell. In this context, HR is not just a repair mechanism, but also a method to drive interaction and genetic exchange between maternally and paternally inherited chromosomes, creating haploid genomes which are chimeras of the parental genetic information. Thus, the study of DNA repair and recombination informs our understanding of mechanisms that maintain genome stability, but which also generate genetic diversity, topics that are as critical to the survival of an individual cell as they are for the evolution and survival of an entire ecosystem.

Thus, drug development in ALS, including trial design, patient selection, and outcome measures must be re-engineered to break the current impasse. Nerve cell death in ALS is associated with inflammation, which contributes to cell damage, and is a logical target for therapy. Although therapeutic attempts to modify this have failed so far, the discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as key players in controlling inflammatory processes opens new possibilities since defective Treg function is important in ALS. In fact, Treg numbers and function predict rates of disease progression and survival. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS.

However, DNA can be rendered accessible by the action of energy-consuming chromatin remodelling proteins. One such protein is ATRX that harbours an N-terminal plant homeodomain (PHD) and a C-terminal helicase domain that confers ATPase activity and identifies ATRX as a member of the snf2 family member of chromatin remodellers. ATRX has been shown to localize in vivo with constitutive heterochromatin in pericentromeric regions as well as telomeres where it works in complex with DAXX for the deposition of the Histone3.3. Mutations in the ATRX gene give rise to ATR-X syndrome, a severe X-linked mental retardation syndrome often accompanied by alpha-thalassemia. Mounting evidence links ATRX mutations to cancer and to malignancies that depend on a telomerase-independent pathway of telomere maintenance called the \u2018alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway, linking ATRX to aging. Despite these advances however, there is lack of understanding of the molecular mechanism of ATRX and of its role within these pathologies. The proposed research aims to investigate the structural and functional properties of ATRX, and to define at a molecular level how it interacts with DAXX to remodel chromatin.

Join intrepid soviet cosmonaut Comrade Yurkovoi as he descends to centre of the Earth to claim it for the glory of the motherland! Gasp as he discovers vertical oceans, lost civilisations, transdimensional travellers, clockwork gods and crystal forests! Thrill as he leaps, dives, swings, grapples and parasails through extraordinary environments in search of the way home! Wince as he tries to convince the authorities he hasn't made the whole thing up!We're looking for support to turn the pitch for this game into a playable prototype so we can secure funding for our largest, most ambitious game to date. We're already talking with publishers about taking this exciting new adventure title forwards, but what we really need to do is generate a playable environment to really capture the feel of the gameplay and the story we're going to tell. We'll be creating an animated first-person rig so you can feel what it's like to steer Yurkovoi around these fantastical worlds, a cutscene to demo the fresh and original take on adventuring that's actually all about harking back to those amazing old b/w adventure serials, a test environment so you can easily grasp the feel and tone we\u2019re aiming for, and supporting assets to make this an impossible to resist title.Little Orpheus is about grabbing you and sweeping you along in a wild, unpredictable and completely unbelievable tale that one part Far Cry to three parts Baron M\u00fcnchhausen. It\u2019s all about the childlike thrill of exploration and the rush of discovery: exploring incredible new worlds, strange and wonderful places, eerie and beautiful environments, all told by a charming liar who's just doing his best not to be sent to the gulags.

The player takes on the role of a downtrodden administrator tasked with the construction and smooth-running of a series of space station hospitals, set across a farcical space opera.Game modes:Narrative-led main campaign; scripted individual scenarios and mini-campaigns created by us and the community; randomly-generated scenarios; sandbox scenarios where the player has infinite resources and access to gameplay mutators.Narrative:The campaign will be an epic and comedic narrative where the player travels around the galaxy setting up new hospitals to cure ailing aliens. The characters and plot will frame the player\u2019s journey of managing bigger and better hospitals as they meet weird aliens and cure wacky diseases. Ultimately the player will encounter a plague that is threatening the entire galaxy - the common cold - which they must overcome with unmatched healthcare.Gameplay:In building up their hospital the player will create a wide selection of rooms for the diagnosis and treatment of the strange alien conditions. The player must also hire staff with appropriate skills to ensure the smooth-running of their hospital, including doctors, nurses, security guards and janitors. As patients continually enter the hospital their conditions will be diagnosed and then hopefully treated, at which point they\u2019ll pay their fee.Map Editor:The editor will let players create their own scenarios and mini-campaigns, which they can share via the Steam Workshop, vastly extending the longevity of the game.Visual approach:A humorous cartoon style using modern 3D graphics. Special technology will be built to create procedural injury and condition effects using minimal bespoke art content.[For more information please see Annex 1]", "http://www.brightrockgames.com", "BRIGHTROCK GAMES LIMITED", "creative_589392-CREA-1-2017-1-UK-MED-DEVVG_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1ND", "Utilise Plus", "West Sussex Sustainable Bus P'ships", "Chamber of Commerce in partnership with Solent LEP and beyond the initial information, brokerage and diagnostic stage, provide support for 170 additional enterprises.
