ELISA tests provide sensitive, accurate and quantitative diagnostic data for a large number of disease biomarkers. The technology has not changed for decades and requires central laboratory facilities. Each test measures only one biomarker and takes up to 2 hours to perform.\nNALIA Systems\u2019 technology provides multiplexed ELISA tests in which panels of 10-15 biomarkers can be tested in parallel, whilst retaining the sensitivity, accuracy and quantification benefits of standard ELISA tests. The first NALIA Arrays are now being made available for use in laboratories.\nStandard ELISA technology cannot be adapted for use at point-of-care due to the time to result and the complex liquid handling needed. In contrast, the inherent characteristics of NALIA\u2019s array technology mean that it can be incorporated into disposable cartridges and dramatically reduce the time to result.\nThis project will develop a bench-top device and disposable cartridge system for biomarker arrays for diagnosis at the point of care. Initial arrays will be for autoimmune disorders, allergy and infectious diseases, followed by oncology and other diseases.\nIn Phase 1 we intend to confirm the feasibility of achieving a result in <20min; to prepare a product development plan that will lead to a manufacturable device and series of cartridges; to complete a business plan covering all aspects of the commercial opportunity, pricing, market size, competition and route to market; and submit an application for Phase 2 funding.", 35835.0, 51194.0, "MultiDiag", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_197398_931542508"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5FN", "Science, please!", "Blessed Dominic RC Primary", 23979.0, "Science, please! is a project which involves the association of:\r\n\r\n-Blessed Dominic RC School , London, England, UK.\r\n- St Anthony\u2019s Primary School, Saltcoats, Scotland, UK.\r\n-Engelska skolan i Upplands V\u00e4sby, Stockholm, Sweden.\r\n-Ganztagsvolksschule, Wien, Austria.\r\n-Mentis sp. z o.o., Warsow, Poland.\r\n-CEIP Veinte de Enero, Ag\u00fcimes, Spain.\r\n\r\nIts goal is to pursue a redesign of the aproach towards Science teaching in our school and to provide an answer to the AICLE programme for Science. It covers five key aspects: reinforce the international cooperation boundaries, didactic approaches towards Science from early ages to the end of primary education, cater for diversity, children motivation and teacher training and promotion.\r\nBearing that in mind, our priorities are:\r\n\r\n1. Reinforce the international cooperation boundaries in education. We are determined to consolidate the work that our school is actually developing and to strenghten the communication with our school partners.\r\n2.Redesign the basis in the teaching-learning process of Science. The new considerations in the AICLE programme lead us to new bilingual approaches in Science teaching.\r\n3. Promote the intrinsic motivation among students towards the learning of Science as a subject in English. The previous aims will be reinforced by the development of emerging trends in ICT for education in our school. These new trends will be a basic tool to widen our students\u2019 horizons and their linguistic, ICT, cultural, social and citizenship competences.\r\n4. Promote a change in all the phases of education. We understand that a renewal of methodologies has to be experienced, in order to prepare our students for the learning of Science in L2 from first stages.\r\n5.Development of the bilingual skills of the students with Special Needs.\r\n\r\n\u201cScience, please!\u201d is defined as a comprehensive Project that needs the implication of great part of the school staff. So, 12 members of our organization have been selected. Their main qualifications are as follows:\r\n-Nursery, Primary, English, CLIL and SEN teachers, as well as members of the school management team. All of them with wide experience in innovation in education.\r\n-Experience in Sciecne projects.\r\n-Experience in previous Erasmus+ and Comenius projetcs, as well as, possitive attitude towards the development of the Project.\r\n\r\nWe have designed a wide range of activities that we consider the most enriching: job shadowing and teaching periods, including workshops.\r\nTaking into account the aims mentioned before, every school that is part of Science, please! will share their strengths:\r\n-Blessed Dominic RC School , London, England, UK. We want to go a step forward in our international cooperation. This partner is key for the development of job shadowing periods, that will lead the organization of teaching periods and workshops for teachers and students.\r\n-Engelska skolan i Upplands V\u00e4sby, Stockholm, Sweden is a bilingual school that effectively integrates the English language in their curriculum from early ages through different subjects, Science included. The job shadowing will be key for the redesign of our teaching plan for Science as part of a bilingual programme.\r\n- St Anthony\u2019s Primary School, Saltcoats, Scotland, UK. We want to engage every student in this new teaching-learning approach for Science. To do so, we will observe in this school how they develop a programme of emerging trends in ICT for education. This will be an extra value to our actual methodology and will help our students to widen their horizons and their linguistic, ICT, cultural, social and citizenship competences.\r\n-Mentis sp. z o.o., Warsow, Poland.
