European aquaculture production has increased substantially over the last decades. However, overall production growth in Europe over the period 1994-2001 was 6.3% APR, 5.5% less than the global trend. The overall price trend was negative (-0.5% APR) vs positive global development. This sector has experienced increasing competition from non-EU countries, especially Asia and South America has made it imperative to increase research and development. Land based fish farming is the critical success factor in intensive aquaculture since they are the start of a very complicated value chain. Further developments of land based fish farms are therefore crucial for the aquacultural sector. Water is one of the most critical input factors, and control of water temperature is the most important factor for optimal growth. The proposed project aims to develop technology that will allow the water in an aquaculture tank to be maintained at the optimum temperature to enhance fish growth by creating a modular constructed, thermally insulated, temperature controlled, low running cost system. The OptiTEMPtank system will be constructed from rotationally moulded segments with internal foaming to provide thermal insulation, which will be joined together with an innovative system to provide a seal against the water. A temperature control system will adjust incoming water temperature to maintain the optimum required to promote maximum growth through the use of innovative water heater and cooler fuelled by biogas. The biogas will be generated from the Biomass (aquaculture faeces and unused food waste) filtered out from the outlet of the tank through the use of an innovative micro-scale anaerobic digestion biogas generator.", 14715.0, 1151506.0, "OPTITEMPTANK", null, null, null, "http://www.ist-world.org/ProjectDetails.aspx?ProjectId=f3c287ef370241a9befb06b2d8103617", "http://www.selonda.co.uk", null, "fp7_94827_998165212"], ["1LL", "The development of a deammonification treatment to remove nitrogen from recirculated water used in aquaculture", "Selonda UK Limited", "The aquaculture industry has been very slow to adopt denitrification methods. Present practice is to convert the toxic metabolic waste product ammonia via nitrite to nitrate in a nitrifying bio-filter. This microbial process demands oxygen and reduces the pH, requiring expensive buffering treatment. The accumulating nitrate is generally flushed from the farm into recipient waters without pollutant removal. The DeammRecirc proposal is based on the recent experiences and success of using deammonification to convert ammonia to nitrogen gas in other waste water treatment applications. This method will in the proposed project be adapted for use in recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS) for fresh- and marine water species. By using a deammonification reactor within RAS, ammonia will be converted to nitrogen gas in one step. Deammonification bacteria enriched in granules will be adapted to RAS water qualities. The advances compared to current SoA include reduced oxygen use, reduced cost for buffering chemicals, lower carbon footprint, reduced levels of nitrate rich effluent released to the environment, reduced pumping cost and treatment need of new exchange water. The project includes 11 participants, of which four are industrial SMEPs, which will produce, develop and distribute the DeammRecirc system post project, one is a large enterprise end user, one participant is from S.

Therefore, the sector is seeking ways of becoming more environmentally friendly.", "A rapidly expanding human population is putting increasing pressure on populations of wild caught fish. Aquaculture is therefore crucial for supplying fish for human consumption and protecting fish stocks in the wild.\n\nA recirculation aquaculture system (RAS) can dramatically reduce the amount of effluent and water used in fish farming. Current practice for removing the ammonia excreted by farmed fish relies on the use of a nitrifying biofilter. This microorganism-based process needs oxygen and reduces PH, thereby requiring expensive buffering treatment.\n\nThe EU-funded DEAMMRECIRC project developed a deammonification reactor to convert ammonia into nitrogen gas in a single step. The process is for use in a RAS, and is suitable for both freshwater and marine species.\n\nResearchers also developed sea salt-adapted inoculums from European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) waste. A methodology was then developed that enables fish farms to grow their own inoculums. The inoculum was used in the pre-treatment prototype reactor developed by the consortium.\n\nThe RAS system water and sludge were mixed and partial denitrification (nitrate to nitrogen gas) took place, transforming nitrate to nitrite. The effluent was then pumped to an anammox reactor containing the inoculum sludge where nitrite and ammonium react to form nitrogen gas (the anammox process). Denitrification also takes place in this reactor.\n\nDEAMMRECIRC therefore converted nitrate in water to nitrogen gas in the air using both anammox and denitrification processes. This reduces the amount of nitrate entering recipient water bodies from RAS fish farms, at the same time providing treatment for the waste product, fish sludge.\n\nThe technology developed by the project partners will result in lower costs for buffering chemicals, lower carbon footprint and reduced levels of nitrate-rich effluent released into the environment. These improvements will help EU aquaculture to become more competitive in the global market place and help to protect the environment.", "http://www.deammrecirc.com", "http://www.selonda.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/144106.jpg", "fp7_97519_998165212"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2RD", "Eingliederung von Migranten in das Arbeitsleben innerhalb der EU", "South Cave Tractors", 29421.0, "The vocational training at the dual vocational college (Duales Berufskolleg) incorporates a job placement of several weeks or months. The trainees in the Ortenaukreis, as well as the training companies, the zweiteSchule gemeinn\u00fctzige Gesellschaft (a non-profit organization), and the Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen Lahr work closely together for the mobility project. Local companies have been sending their trainees to European subsidiaries and other cooperating companies for several years as a mobility activity. It is indispensible for local companies depending on export to encourage their trainees\u2019 language skills. The results of the mobility activities over the last years have shown that the participants not only improved their language skills but furthermore enriched their intercultural and methodological competences, not to speak of their positive personal development and tolerance. The \"European thought\" can be considered as a long-term benefit. The involved companies and the Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen Lahr are committed to an improvement of these competencies. \r\nThe mobility project is going to take place from July until beginning of October 2017.  Seventeen of 27 trainees of the class in the \"Duales Berufskolleg\" are going to do their job placements in the UK, France,  Poland, Spain, Sweden and the Czech Republic. The trainees of the Duales Berufskolleg are required to complete a job placement for several weeks or months during their training. The training companies completely support this measure since they profit from the knowledge and the skills that the trainees acquire in the partner companies abroad. An important part of the mobility measure is the realization of a project which usually deals with current European topics. It is supposed to improve first and foremost the trainees\u2019 linguistic and social skills. \r\nWork on the topic \u201cIntegration of migrants into working life within the EU\" poses the question, which results are to be expected.   The chosen topic should reveal  the labour policy of our European neighbours. Of course the project is awaited with great interest. \r\nThe results of the research made will be collected and  analyzed in teamwork.
