Actual PEM fuel cells presents Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) architecture corresponding to a proton conductive membrane hot pressed between two catalytic electrodes. However, the MEA performance is limited by the interface effect between catalytic layer and membrane.  To overcome this problem, the SMAllInOne project introduces a \u201cSMart All in One\u201d membrane concept. In this approach, a catalytic network is directly implanted in the thin film protonic membrane. This novel composite material is particularly well adapted for fuel cell technologies as there is no boundary between the membrane and the electrodes. Moreover, several functionalities will be added to this material in order to confer it smart properties such as water and crossover management, tailored porosity and 3D conformability.  The scientific and technological objectives of the project are:  \u2022  To synthesize bifunctional polymerizable and volatile precursors (alkenyl & sulfonyl) to prevent the destruction of the acidic functions during the thin film membrane realization \u2022  To create a network of percolated platinum nano-particles inside both faces of the membrane to ensure simultaneously a good catalytic efficiency and electronic conductivity  \u2022 To enhance electronic conductivity by a tailored doping of material with gold particles by the surface  \u2022 To study and propose a water and crossover management solution by adding functional hydrophilic particles to keep the membrane wet and Pt particles to getter hydrogen linkage  \u2022 To avoid the fuel depletion by controlling the porosity using a porogen approach  The consortium consists of 7 partners from 5 European countries including 2 SMEs.", 189391.0, 2100307.0, 5, 7, "SMALLINONE", null, "http://www.surface-innovations.com", null, "fp7_109412_998021749"]]}}}}
