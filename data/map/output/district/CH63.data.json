If a reservoir is kept fuller than it would otherwise be for recreation, then the water retained could be categorized as recreational usage. Recreational usage is usually non-consumptive. The report from the European Environment Agency (EEA), reveals that Europe has so far concentrated on increasing the supply of water rather than exploring ways to limit its demand. Golf courses are often targeted as using excessive amounts of water, especially in drier. Some governments have labeled golf course usage as agricultural in order to deflect environmentalist\u2019s charges of wasting water. The objective of the project is the development of a system based on wireless and artificial intelligence which provides support to irrigation Golf course processes with a water saving of 33% minimum. By including On field underground sensing: i) Underground humidity; ii)Salinity underground iii) Underground NIR measurement iv) Underground temperature, V) soil Ph. Also On-surface sensing will be included: i) Visible color sight; ii) Filtered visible colour measurement; iii) Wind speed and direction. Also the system will include a number of Ambient sensing at different zones, Ambient temperature and weather forecast based on consensus.\nAll the measurements are transmitted by means of low consumption battery powered wireless ZigBee technology with specific antenna design.\n\nAn Artificial Intelligence driven and \u2018fools-proof\u2019 software system and others, will use the sensor measurements information and others, such as 3D Golf course mapping and drainage, compacting soil degrees, weather forecast, etc\u2026, will suggest the parameters for irrigation for the different zones, and also will inform of existing or coming turf diseases conditions and possible treatments if needed.

However, an EU-developed system relies on a network of sensors and an intelligent control unit to manage water usage and reduce consumption by a third.", "Growing European populations place water resources under pressure, and solutions to date have included increasing supply rather than limiting demand. Golf courses have been targeted as high-usage and potentially extravagant, thus a water management system for golf courses would contribute to reducing Europe's overall water consumption. \n\nThe EU-funded http://www.watergolf-project.com (WATERGOLF) project aimed to develop such a system. The concept includes a wireless network, including underground soil sensors and surface atmospheric sensors, and an artificial intelligence control unit. Innovative software drives the operation. The eight-member consortium will run throughout the whole of 2013 and 2014. \n\nInitial work focused on functional requirements for the project, plus research into whether the requirements could be achieved in time. Later, progress on the wireless platform commenced, with certain suitable hardware chosen. The wireless platform was complete as of the first reporting period, and testing was underway. Work also began on a prototype underground sensor unit, with soil sensors being selected and linked to the wireless node. The project developed a spring system to identify sensor locations during golf course maintenance. The external unit, or weather station, also depends on sensors connected to the wireless network. \n\nThe team of expert turf managers began documenting their expertise as a knowledge base for decision rules, including control of irrigation, weeds and fungi. Software development initially focused on creating a system mock-up, and later on development of the expert system. \n\nThe WATERGOLF project will lead to a customisable system for supporting the water management of golf courses. Ultimately, the system will lead to water savings of at least one third, while also reducing fungal and weed problems, meaning less pesticide use.", "http://www.watergolf-project.com/", "http://www.ets-controls.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/144945.jpg", "fp7_106824_953483423"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7LF", "Bringing Languages to Life", "St John Plessington Catholic College", 68801.0, "St John Plessington Catholic College is an Outstanding Voluntary Aided Catholic 11-18 Academy.\r\n\r\nOur school is a non-selective comprehensive school in the midst of many grammar schools. We are very high achieving and firmly believe in giving all of our pupils the opportunity to overcome barriers of disadvantage and aim for the very top in terms of education and career. Languages have a vital role to play in this and are key to building our pupils\u2019 confidence and encouraging them to seek experiences and opportunities beyond their local area.\r\n\r\nOne third of our students are in receipt of Pupil Premium funding, meaning that they come from disadvantaged backgrounds. 4% of our students have English as an additional language. 16% of our students receive SEN support.\r\n\r\nWe are a very successful school with outcomes in the top 10% of the country, and we are constantly looking for ways to improve the methodology that we use and our systems. We need to continue to build on our achievements, offering an outstanding model of MFL and further developing our skills to reflect our status of National Teaching School, helping other schools to be successful as well as helping to train the next generation of outstanding teachers and leaders.\r\n\r\nOur project objectives have been established through careful needs analysis and reflection on our current provision. We have taken into account our whole school priorities and Erasmus+ priorities and we are certain that Erasmus+ is the best way for our school to proceed. The opportunity to embark on European mobility will make a vast difference to our staff and therefore our learners, community and the schools and individuals we support.\r\n\r\nCurrently MFL is a valued subject but it is not high-profile. We need to enable staff from all key departments to experience how fantastic learning a language can be and develop more links across departments to reinforce learning and raise the status and profile of our subject, demonstrating to pupils the importance of language learning and its relevance to different areas of the curriculum and increasing the European dimension across subjects.\r\n\r\nWe intend to develop a 2 year project including 15 mobilities for immersion courses to France and 15 to Spain. The mobilities will be part of a larger project involving  preparation and follow up activities in school.\r\n\r\nParticipants will come from the MFL Department and also from maths, English, RE, media, ICT, science and humanities. This we will also include the Head of year 7 to lead on transition. We will include teaching staff and teaching assistants..\r\n\r\nParticipation in these courses will lead to\r\n\r\nimprovement in language skills\r\n\r\nimproved awareness of current language use\r\n\r\nup to date awareness of culture\r\n\r\nbetter teaching methodology with innovative and effective ideas and strategies, and better resources.\r\n\r\nHaving a large number of staff members who are able to share their linguistic and cultural knowledge with students would enable us to make MFL a key part of 'SJP Experience' s and to promote language learning even further.\r\n\r\nAll staff have been given  information about the project and will have had the opportunity to sign up, detailing how they would use the experience to benefit the school and our students. Individuals will be asked to commit the project outcomes and to contribute to the professional development of their colleagues.\r\n\r\nLearning outcomes will include improvements in methodology and teaching strategies including new and innovative methods, an understanding of how languages can support literacy, and a focus on activities that can reinforce learning for pupils with SEN. \r\n\r\nLanguage teachers will develop a more up-to-date knowledge of current language use and culture and is will develop their skills to enable them to teach at a higher level.\r\n\r\nStaff from other departments will develop their confidence, linguistic and cultural knowledge and so that they are equipped to create cross curricular links and embed languages into their subject. They will also have the opportunity to observe their own subject being taught within a European context which will enable them to assimilate good practice and develop a more European dimension within their own teaching.\r\n\r\nAs a teaching school, we are committed to a broad dissemination of skills. We will use our established dissemination pathways and develop new ones to ensure that we inform others about our activities, encourage them to take part in similar and share learning outcomes to benefit others and greatly increase the impact of the project.\r\n\r\nOur SMT and board will lead on the evaluation process,  and final evaluation will be against the initial project aims and objectives and assessment of the extent to which they have been met.", null, "St John Plessington Catholic College", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046932_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CH63"}
