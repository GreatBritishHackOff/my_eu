Histology is a complex process requiring several steps for the tissue sample preparation. The most demanding and time-consuming step is the microtomy, where the tissue sample, now dehydrated and placed inside a piece of paraffin wax, is cut into slices 4-micrometre thick. This step is further complicated by the fact that the thin slices become wrinkled with the cutting and are normally put on warm water in order to smooth out (the with the aggravated problems of rehydrating the cells and increasing the risk of cross-contamination). Microtomy is a labour-intensive procedure carried out by highly-skilled clinical/scientific staff. A skilled operator can perform up to 80 samples a day, but will cost well over \u20ac100,000 p.a. The MicroLean project proposes a low-cost automation of the microtomy process by a contactless manipulation of the samples.

People who are affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other dementias often face cognitive, behavioural and psychosocial difficulties, including impairment and degeneration of memory and of perceptions of identity. In a social context, this can cause difficulties of recognizing, relating to and empathising with other people. These difficulties often pose a challenge for engaging socially, reinforcing their effects and reducing personal well-being. \n\nDesign can offer novel ways of complementing existing care approaches to empower people with dementia in everyday social situations. Utilising the concept of mindful design, we will investigate innovative design solutions to enable self-empowerment and confidence building of people living with dementia. We will specifically focus on two areas: personal difficulties with social interaction and environmental influences on social engagement. In these two contexts, we will study how personal, wearable designs can help mediate perceptions of identity and emotion management; and how environmental aspects can reduce feelings of information overload and instill feelings of self-empowerment and control.\n\nThe outcomes and benefits of the project will include: the development of new uses of design for helping people with dementia to engage socially and improve subjective well-being; the presentation of a robust methodological co-design framework for the development and evaluation of the designs in dementia care settings; the development of a holistic mindful model of designing and of a model for mindful care for social engagement for people with dementia; policy recommendations for the inclusion of design within dementia care.\n\nThis groundbreaking project will be enabled through an innovative consortium of academic and non-academic partners that combines research in product and environmental design, ICT, and dementia care.", 15527.0, 461934.0, "MinD", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_199934_918227124"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2AG", "Zahrani\u010dn\u00e1 odborn\u00e1 st\u00e1\u017e \u2013 nov\u00e9 cesty na eur\u00f3psky trh pr\u00e1ce", "Siawns Teg Limited", 68759.0, "Slovakia is already established member of the EU.

A maximum of 6 staff members will be involved in the mobility aspects of the project. The organisation is based in rural Mid Wales\r\n\r\nPathways has strong links with groups working in post-communist countries and regions & other less economically & socially advantaged areas. These groups, include small scale community organisations, schools, not-for-profit educational institutes, universities & research centres & local authorities. They are all working to create new social opportunities & to develop appropriate skills, competences & behaviours.\r\n\r\nThe international work is two-way process. Regular visits of groups from across Europe and Turkey has assisted in developing international understanding and practical support in the small rural communities on the English - Welsh Border (the \u2018Middle March\u2019) with an increasing number of local groups meeting & sharing the work. Such groups include town councils, heritage agencies, village hall charities, festival organisers, church groups & very informal self managed educational groups.\r\n\r\nIn recent years Pathways has, following request for support, been providing advice & consultancy on skill development to partners.\r\n\r\nIn working with groups that feel marginalised, the learning, between a UK region that is recognised as disadvantaged & similar contexts abroad, has a congruity and a sense for all, of shared purpose.\r\nIn the past year Pathways has expanded this work & is developing & supporting new initiatives, including international links in China & Summer Schools in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe Mobility Project\r\nPrime Objective:\r\n\u201cSending staff to deliver and learn\u201d.\r\n\r\nThis project creates training delivery opportunities for Pathways staff with partners in LT, CZ, BG, RO. \r\nFor Pathways these will allow staff, through cooperative processes, to learn and use experiential learning programmes in contexts very different from the UK.\r\n\r\nAction:\r\nEach partner will receive a short \u2018Training Delivery Programme\u2019 (TDP) relevant to their expressed needs. \r\nThe process provides opportunities for Pathways to prepare, deliver, monitor & evaluate its work. \r\n\r\nThe methodologies to be used will be creative, experiential and informal  based on learning methodologies developed & used by Pathways in UK contexts & developed appropriately for the specific contexts of the 4 partner agencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two further important aspects to the chosen 4 partner approach:\r\n1. The considerable type and quality difference between the partners - each will require its own carefully prepared training approach. There are university research centres (LT), small not-for-profit educational agencies (BG), Local authority educational institutions (RO) and small rural community development groups (CZ)\r\n\r\n2. The sequential nature of the project: delivering training that will use the learning of one in developing the next (4 separate TDPs).\r\n\r\nTogether these contrasting situations, each representing the breadth of work available to Pathways & with very specific individual requirements, provide Pathways with learning opportunities that will enhance the value of the whole project. \r\n\r\nResults and impact envisaged:\r\nThis project will have provided opportunities for Pathways to  develop competences & introduce change by the structured training delivery to partners whose background and experience is a reflection of the varied contexts with which Pathways works.\r\n\r\nThe project will have:\r\nImproved management staff skills: \r\n- communication & consultative decision making processes\r\n- Strategies for course development & marketing\r\nDeveloped Teaching Staff competences:\r\n- informal & creative teaching & evaluation capabilities\r\n- Adaptivity to differing cultural & learning contexts\r\n\r\nEnhanced the organisation:\r\n- New curricula relevant to Pathways\u2019 existing and future potential\r\n- Improved monitoring\r\n- Effective marketing using IT and web systems\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion, not only will Pathways, staff, management & organisationally have improved competence and skills & be more suited to the present expanding work and opportunities, but there will be partners whose skills and competences will have been developed.\r\n\r\nFor Pathways longer term benefits envisaged include \r\n- enhanced relationships locally and with EU partners\r\n- further development of innovative training programmes and support systems\r\n- a wider network of international partners\r\n- increased organisational capacity", "http://www.pathways-development.com", "Pathways: Inspirational Development C.I.C.", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA104-013219_coordinator"], ["2NZ", "Zahrani\u010dnou st\u00e1\u017eou k zvy\u0161ovaniu odborn\u00fdch kompetenci\u00ed", "Siawns Teg Limited", 61568.0, "Within the project submitted we plan to implement mobilities of 28 students and 4 accompanying persons during four work placements in the range of 2-4 weeks.
