Histology is a complex process requiring several steps for the tissue sample preparation. The most demanding and time-consuming step is the microtomy, where the tissue sample, now dehydrated and placed inside a piece of paraffin wax, is cut into slices 4-micrometre thick. This step is further complicated by the fact that the thin slices become wrinkled with the cutting and are normally put on warm water in order to smooth out (the with the aggravated problems of rehydrating the cells and increasing the risk of cross-contamination). Microtomy is a labour-intensive procedure carried out by highly-skilled clinical/scientific staff. A skilled operator can perform up to 80 samples a day, but will cost well over \u20ac100,000 p.a. The MicroLean project proposes a low-cost automation of the microtomy process by a contactless manipulation of the samples. The MicroLean system will be retrofittable to existing microtomes.", 192258.0, 1145058.0, "MICROLEAN", null, null, null, null, "http://www.cellpath.co.uk", null, "fp7_111597_952416617"], ["4PQ", "Designing for People with Dementia: designing for mindful self-empowerment and social engagement", "Etic Lab Llp", "This project aims to help people with dementia engage in social contexts to improve psychosocial wellbeing. People who are affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other dementias often face cognitive, behavioural and psychosocial difficulties, including impairment and degeneration of memory and of perceptions of identity. In a social context, this can cause difficulties of recognizing, relating to and empathising with other people. These difficulties often pose a challenge for engaging socially, reinforcing their effects and reducing personal well-being. \n\nDesign can offer novel ways of complementing existing care approaches to empower people with dementia in everyday social situations. Utilising the concept of mindful design, we will investigate innovative design solutions to enable self-empowerment and confidence building of people living with dementia. We will specifically focus on two areas: personal difficulties with social interaction and environmental influences on social engagement. In these two contexts, we will study how personal, wearable designs can help mediate perceptions of identity and emotion management; and how environmental aspects can reduce feelings of information overload and instill feelings of self-empowerment and control.\n\nThe outcomes and benefits of the project will include: the development of new uses of design for helping people with dementia to engage socially and improve subjective well-being; the presentation of a robust methodological co-design framework for the development and evaluation of the designs in dementia care settings; the development of a holistic mindful model of designing and of a model for mindful care for social engagement for people with dementia; policy recommendations for the inclusion of design within dementia care.\n\nThis groundbreaking project will be enabled through an innovative consortium of academic and non-academic partners that combines research in product and environmental design, ICT, and dementia care.", 15527.0, 461934.0, "MinD", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_199934_918227124"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SY16"}
