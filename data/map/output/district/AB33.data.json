In addition to raw materials, forests also provide a wide range of vital non-wood services that should be protected during wood extraction. The innovation project Forwarder2020 has the main aim of improving sustainability of wood production and delivery as well as operational forest management and planning through the development of specific modules for more efficient forwarders (wood extraction and transportation vehicles):\n\u2022 hydrostatic-mechanical power-split transmission \n\u2022 hydro-pneumatic suspension of the forwarder \n\u2022 hybrid hydraulic system for driving the crane with double recuperation of the potential energy \n\u2022 bogie axle with three instead of two driven wheels at each side to be mounted under the timber load\n\u2022 monitoring system for transparency and documentation of process data like machine data, static and dynamic load over time and position \nThe combined effect of these five innovations applied to forwarders will have the following impact:\n\u2022 lowering of the dynamic wheel load by 25% over the same forwarder without suspension at same payload and speed. \n\u2022 reduction of rut depths by 50% \n\u2022 lowering fuel consumption while driving over the existing hydrostatic transmissions by 30% \n\u2022 making long hauling distances more economic by the efficiency of the power-split transmission \n\u2022 lowering fuel consumption while loading and unloading due to the double recuperation of the potential energy of the crane mass by 30%. \n\u2022 more precise planning of the tracks and documentation of the loads carried on the specific part of the track \n\u2022 supplying to the market a unique and modular system of high-end solutions above the competitors, where the customer can make his choice of equipment and bear no higher costs for the modules not chosen.\n\u2022 bring consortium partners and thus Europe to a strong position on markets", 28298.0, 2580945.0, "Forwarder2020", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_205868_921062434"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8TY", "Immersion language course", "Alford Primary School", 12172.0, "As one of the larger schools in Aberdeenshire, we have an important role to play in leading the way in the implementation of the Government's 1+2 policy.\r\n\r\nA need has been identified within Alford Primary School for the upskilling of both teaching and support staff, with specific focus on L2 French within Early Stages, and L3 Spanish throughout  Middle and Upper Stages.  To this end, staff have been invited to indicate their interest and demonstrate their commitment to an eighteen-month program. A total of seven applicants (six trained teachers and one Pupil Support Assistant) have now been identified in line with these criteria.\r\n\r\nThe intention is that three of these applicants will undergo LFEE immersion training in French, and four in Spanish.  Full details of the following are provided within our project proposal:\r\n\r\na) how the participants will prepare for their training \r\nb) how the participants will be monitored for the duration of the program \r\nc) what will be expected from the applicants and all school staff in terms of the regular review of the program\r\nd) dissemination activities, and the breadth and impact of these\r\ne) a timetable of events for all of the above\r\n\r\nAs well as the envisaged early impact of a significant improvement in the methodology of teaching MFLs and thus of the learning experience of our pupils, a raft of opportunities designed to develop and extend the benefits of 1+2 to all stakeholders (primary and secondary school staff, pupils, parents, local community members, including those of cluster schools)  have been identified.  These include European initiatives (for example, eTwinning), and other national, regional and local activities whose aim is to further the development of language learning, cultural awareness and global citizenship, particularly amongst young people.\r\n\r\nIn terms of anticipated results, it is expected that Alford Primary school will almost certainly meet (or exceed) the requirements of the Scottish Government's 1+2 program by 2019, and definitely  by the stated deadline of 2020.", "http://www.alford-pri.aberdeenshire.sch.uk", "Alford Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035495_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "AB33"}
