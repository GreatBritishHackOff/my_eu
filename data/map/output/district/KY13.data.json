OpenNESS will therefore develop innovative and practical ways of applying them in land, water and urban management: it will identify how, where and when the concepts can most effectively be applied to solve problems. To do this, it will work with public and private decision makers and stakeholders to better understand the range of policy and management problems faced in different case study contexts (ranging across locales, sectors, scales and time). OpenNESS will consolidate, refine and develop a range of spatially-explicit methods to identify, quantify and value ecosystem services, and will develop hybrid assessment methods. It will also explore the effectiveness of financial and governance mechanisms, such as payments for ecosystem services, habitat banking, biodiversity offsetting and land and ecosystem accounting. These types of interventions have potential for sustaining ESS and NC, and for the design of new economic and social investment opportunities. Finally, OpenNESS will assess how current regulatory frameworks and other institutional factors at EU and national levels enable or constrain consideration of ESS and NC, and identify the implications for issues related to well-being, governance and competitiveness. OpenNESS will analyse the knowledge that is needed to define ESS and NC in the legal, administrative and political contexts that are relevant to the EU. The work will deliver a menu of multi-scale solutions to be used in real life situations by stakeholders, practitioners, and decision makers in public and business organizations, by providing new frameworks, data-sets, methods and tools that are fit-for-purpose and sensitive to the plurality of decision-making contexts.", 24886.0, 9234536.0, "OPENNESS", "Turning the concepts of ecosystem services and natural capital into practice", "Despite improved understanding of the links between ecosystem health, provision of ecosystem services and human well-being, the concepts of ecosystem services and natural capital are still hard to apply operationally to policy and management problems.", "Humans benefit from ecosystems in many ways, such as the provision of clean water, the decomposition of waste, and the pollination of crops by bees and other insects. These direct contributions of ecosystems to human well-being are known as ecosystem services (ES). Natural capital (NC) refers to those elements of nature that directly or indirectly produce value for people, including soil, air, water and all living things.\n\nThe http://www.openness-project.eu (OPENNESS) project translates both concepts into operational frameworks that provide tested, practical and tailored solutions for integration into land, water and urban management and decision-making. It examines how the concepts link to, and support, EU sectoral and cross-sectoral policy initiatives and scrutinizes its potential and limitations.\n\nCentral to OPENNESS is a multi-scale case study approach, designed to ground ideas and theories on real-world observations and analysis. To do this, we work with public and private decision-makers and stakeholders to better understand the range of problems faced in 26 different case study contexts.\n\nThe OPENNESS team identified 20 key EU policies that will benefit from the project's findings, such as the Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, the Water Framework Directive and the Renewable Energy Directive. In addition, OPENNESS will help mainstreaming the concepts of ES and NC into land-use practices and forest management processes.\n\nThe multi-scale solutions that will come out of OPENNESS will deliver stakeholder-targeted options for ES assessments in real-life planning and decision-making situations. A menu of such solutions will be central to Oppla, the common platform that is developed together with the OPERAs project.

However, in Europe, and around the globe, bees face many threats and are often in decline as a result. One potential driver of reduced bee health is agrochemicals. While laboratory and semi-field studies suggest that such chemicals negatively impact bee health, their importance and relevance in the real world remains unclear. PoshBee is a consortium of academics, governmental organisations, industry, and NGOs that will address the issue of agrochemicals to ensure the sustainable health of bees and their pollination services in Europe. Integrating the knowledge and experience of local beekeeping and farming organisations and academic researchers (including the EU RefLab for bee health), we will provide the first comprehensive pan-European assessment of the exposure hazard of chemicals, their mixtures, and co-occurrence with pathogens and nutritional stress for solitary, bumble, and honey bees across two major cropping systems. Integrated studies across the lab-to-field axis will determine the effect of chemicals, their mixtures, and interactions with pathogens and nutrition on bee health. We will combine the skills of commercial bumble bee and solitary bee producers, ecotoxicological industry, and academics to develop new model species and innovative protocols for testing chemicals in bees. With MUST-B, we will integrate this information to develop dynamic landscape environmental risk assessment models for bees. Using proteomics, we will produce new molecular markers for assessing bee health and enabling long-term monitoring schemes. Finally, combining across our partners and stakeholder board, we will deliver practice- and policy-relevant research outputs to local, national, European, and global stakeholders. Together, our work will support healthy bee populations, sustainable beekeeping, and sustainable pollination across Europe.", 211953.0, 8823049.0, "PoshBee", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_215953_916011062"]]}}, "outwardCode": "KY13"}
