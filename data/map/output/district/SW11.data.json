The key motivation for this project and why we believe Europe needs a project on Context Casting is because multicasting is the key enabler that will make mobile context aware services commercially attractive. Use of mobile multicast communication especially for multimedia content has always been a very attractive proposition. There will be many situations when a multicast or broadcast will be a much more affective and appropriate form of communication service but the majority are dynamic, situation specific and consequently great service opportunities are lost. C-Cast is based on two main competence areas: creation of context awareness and multicasting technologies. Context information defines groups that demand the same information or service. These services are delivered efficiently by multicasting bearers. The project will research, investigate and define ways to use the situation/environment of a user (a mobile device) to initiate group communication. This environment mediated multicast may be triggered by an event or something in the physical environment offering a situation or context orientated service. C-Cast will provide an end-to-end context-aware communication framework specifically for intelligent multicast-broadcast services. It addresses three key issueso   Development of context and group management service enablers for context representation, context assisted group management and context reasoning.o   Definition of a framework to collect sensor data, distribute context information and manage efficiently context aware multiparty and multicast transport.o   Development of mechanisms for autonomous context driven content creation, adaptation and media delivery.", null, 4864685.0, "C-CAST", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_85341_999785403"], ["4AN", "Building Innovation in the Extended Digital Chain", "Foster + Partners Limited", "The InnoChain ETN network is a shared research training environment examining how advances in digital design tools challenge building culture enabling more sustainable, more informed and more materially smart design solutions. The network aims to train a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers with a strong industry focus that can effect real changes in the way we think, design and build our physical environment. \nThe programme investigates the extended digital chain as a particular opportunity for interdisciplinary design collaboration. Challenging the traditional thinking of design as a linear process of incremental refinement, InnoChain identifies three axes of design innovation potential communication, simulation and materialisation appearing as distributed and interdisciplinary activities across the design chain. Situating feedback between design processes as a key concern for developing holistic and integrated design methods, the network will develop new interdisciplinary design methods that integrate advanced simulation and interface with material fabrication.\nWith a strong inter-sector focus, InnoChain connects \u201cresearch in practice\u201d with \u201cresearch in academia\u201d. Assembling 6 internationally recognised academic research environments leading research into computational design in architecture and engineering and 14 innovation pioneering industry partners from architecture, engineering, design software development and fabrication, the programme will establish a shared training platform for 15 early stage researchers. The network creates a structured training programme focussed on supervision of individual research projects, an inter-sector secondment programme as well as collective research events including workshop-seminars, colloquia, summer school and research courses that provide a unique opportunity for young researchers to obtain new knowledge and skills positioning them between strong innovative research practice and influential industrial impact.", null, 3358219.0, "InnoChain", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_193957_952405753"], ["3TP", "Touch and pressure sensitive material without electronic sensors for intuitive and eye-free control of a car\u2019s features while driving", "Tangi0 Ltd", "Current in-car controls have many individual components and parts included, making them very costly to assemble. If even one of the parts fails the controls won\u2019t work and car models could be recalled by the factory to have to fix the issue. The assembled components are difficult to take apart and need to go through a timely, costly process to be recycled and not be turned into e-waste. The main problem behind in-car controls are that they cause significant distractions to drivers which has been found the cause of 80% of road traffic accidents. The problem is only becoming worse with infotainment displays imbedded with multiple lights and sensors and controls being inputted through a large touch-screen device.\nTangi0 have developed a new method for operating controls in the cockpit of cars through an intuitive, tactile material with distinctive shapes that allow drivers to operate it eye-free. This reduces the safety hazards of driving distractions. Using a touch-sensitive, conductive material also means that there is a huge reduction in electronic components needed in the product making a much cheaper, environmentally friendly.\nFollowing a very promising preliminary validation of the innovative technology with Jaguar-Land Rover, Tangi0 now intend to develop and design the integrated system and fully commercialize the solution by reaching the market in 2021.

The machine will feature capabilities for additive manufacture, machining, cold-work, metrology and inspection that will provide the optimum solution for the hybrid manufacturing of large engineering parts of high integrity, with cost benefits of more than 50% compared to conventional machining processes.\nFor large scale engineering structures material needs to be deposited at a relatively high rate with exceptional properties and excellent integrity. To ensure this the machine is based on wire \\ arc additive manufacture for the additive process. A unique feature of the machine will be the capability for parallel manufacturing featuring either multiple deposition heads or concurrent addition and subtraction processes. To facilitate parallel manufacturing the machine architecture is based on robotics. To ensure that the surface finish and accuracy needed for engineering components is obtained for the subtractive step a parallel kinematic motion robot is employed. This robot is also used for application of cold work by rolling between passes. This ensures that material properties can be better than those of forged material. \nA key part of this project is the development of ICT infrastructure and toolboxes needed to programme and run the machine. The implementation of parallel manufacturing is extremely challenging from a software perspective and this will be a major activity within the project.\nTo deliver this extremely demanding and ambitious project a well-balanced expert team has been brought together.

Off-grid communities in these regions rely on mobile phones for communication and to access essential services such as money transfer, healthcare. Without viable renewable alternatives, off-grid power in developing regions is currently provided through highly unsustainable fossil fuelled methods, and internet connectivity is exceptionally limited. This creates a significant business opportunity for providing reliable, clean and affordable charging for mobile phones and internet access. BuffaloGrid has developed a unique solar power based Hub system and a patent-pending remote payment control mechanism by which mobile phones (or other devices) can be charged under the control of a central server to ensure accountability, transparency and market insights. By combining renewable power and internet connectivity, BuffaloGrid enables EU companies to deliver essential internet-based services (e.g., e-health, e-education, e-governance etc) in developing regions. BuffaloGrid supplies Hubs free to local agents, offering them opportunities to provide mobile charging and internet access to their local communities. This will stimulate local enterprise, encourage entrepreneurship and boost economic development. BuffaloGrid\u2019s unique model of providing the Hub for free, and unlocking access to power, allows demand to be met without charging high fees. Powered by solar energy, BuffaloGrid Hubs are emission-free during use and BuffaloGrid will take back Hubs for upgrade/ remanufacture/recycling at EoL (End-of-Life).
