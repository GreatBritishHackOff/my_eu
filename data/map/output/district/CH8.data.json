It will detect a range of substances, including but not limited to people, drugs, explosives (including weapons) and CBRNe. The technology will complement trained sniffer dogs.  The technology proposed is based on linear ion trap (LIT) mass spectrometry (MS). MS techniques have been increasingly deployed in security sniffing applications in the USA. MS is a non-intrusive high-resolution technique able to detect single atoms and complex molecules through their charged species (ions) or fragmentation pattern. The technique is capable of detecting a wide range of substances rapidly, with high accuracy and with a stand-off capability \u2013 critically it is able to detect trace levels below parts per million. Once the MS fingerprint of a unknown substance is measured it can be compared online with a database of known substances enabling real-time rapid identification. Sniffles will develop a LIT MS based device with a larger mass range than other comparable MS techniques. Methods for miniaturisation and modularisation will be applied to allow reduced vacuum demand and upgradeability. Miniaturisation will be made possible through improved designs based on results from modelling, novel manufacturing techniques and improvements in the MS drive electronics and vacuum system. These advances will bring benefits including reduced acquisition/operating costs, greater mobility, user friendliness and flexibility. Sniffles has the potential to significantly impact on National Security and border control and enable exploitation of International Markets. Performance will be benchmarked against a state-of-the-art conventional MS system and security sniffer dogs \u2013 within the context of a border security checkpoint. Sniffles aims to demonstrate an automated portable MS-based sniffer device, tested and evaluated for a range of security applications and markets by end-users.", 107983.0, 4019648.0, "SNIFFLES", "Detecting illegal substances gets easier", "An advanced novel device to detect illicit substances such as explosives and drugs can significantly enhance and speed up security at border controls and transport hubs.", "As crime and terrorism continue to threaten the vision of a peaceful world, advances in technology are bringing solutions to discourage and pre-empt menacing events. One positive development in this respect is the prospect of a universal gas sensor, or artificial sniffer, to detect a variety of substances from drugs to explosives. The EU-funded project 'Artificial sniffer using linear ion trap technology' (http://www.sniffles.eu/ (SNIFFLES)) is working on such a promising device.\n\nAiming to complement sniffer dogs in their work, the technology is being designed to detect people carrying harmful substances, but also weapons and drugs. SNIFFLES is exploiting linear ion trap mass spectrometry to achieve its aims, based on the device's sophisticated ability to identify single atoms and complex molecules.\n\nThe flexible user-friendly device can even detect trace levels below parts per million, boasting as well a mass range larger than other mass spectrometry solutions currently on the market. It can take a 'fingerprint' of a substance and compare it with an online database to immediately identify it.\n\nAlready, the team has outlined the procedure and design, including gas load evaluation of the required vacuum system and sensor performance metrics. It built the linear ion trap, electronic control unit and inlet device, in addition to developing the required software. This was followed by experiments to evaluate vapour ionisation, a crucial part of the process.\n\nOnce commercialised, the device could be used in a myriad of ways, such as at border checks to prevent transport of illegal substances, including biological and chemical warfare agents. This quick and affordable solution could also be used to streamline passenger traffic by quickly scanning for illegal substances, offering low alarm rates and reducing queues. Lastly, it promises to increase security by reducing human error, representing a less invasive and questionable method to detect illicit substances compared to other solutions.", "http://www.sniffles.eu/", "http://www.wagtailuk.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/149882.jpg", "fp7_102069_963060330"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CH8"}
