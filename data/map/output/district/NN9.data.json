This will allow for more independent living, a reduced need for lifting and manual handling from carers and a reduction in the number of costly disability aids within the home.\n\nThe Homehoist system will function initially as an everyday wheelchair, but will also be capable of lifting the user at certain positions within the home via the integrated hoist system rotate them through 180 degrees to the toilet, the shower, a sofa, or a bed.   This will incorporate a stabilisation system and optional floor clamps will ensure the system is can operate under more demanding load conditions. If others areas of the home need to be accessed the hoist section of Homehoist is able to be detached and used independently, this will also improve transportation of the device by breaking the system down into two lighter more compact units.\n\nAt Hi Tech Automation Limited we want to be sure that our business continues to develop.  We make mechanical and lifting systems and consider ourselves experts in the field.  With the help of AKS Medical, Technik, ARTI Electronics, HERI and IBV, we believe we have identified a novel design solution to the difficulty, comfort and costs associated with lifting a cerebral palsy patient.\n\nThe primary aim of the project is to develop an integrated wheelchair and hoist system capable of independent use by a cerebral palsy patient with upper body strength. We will build and test a demonstration prototype.  Post project we will invest in the design to develop it to production level.'", 198912.0, 963593.0, "HOMEHOIST", null, null, null, "http://www.homehoist.eu", "http://www.hitechautomation.com", null, "fp7_106815_953637362"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["6PS", "Enhancing learning through a teaching and learning outdoors - a wider European perspective.", "Stanwick Academy", 3655.0, "Stanwick Academy  is  a single form entry through primary school located in a rural setting.  The school has a large outdoor space which it has already developed as part of its curriculum.  The school is keen to promote European and wider international relationships to broaden its pupils understanding of the world, cultures and people.  The school is also keen to develop its staff by experiencing different teaching and learning methods.  These considerations underpin the school's decision to attend the Swedish Forest Learning  training.\r\n\r\nThe project's objectives of :  creative approaches,  developing and evaluating strategies used within the Swedish system,  develop partnership work with teachers and educators from within Europe, as well as other activities available under the Erasmus+ Programme, reflect on their learning journey,  working  together to develop a plan of action to implement upon their return, share within the group and uploaded to a public website so that teachers within the wider educational community can learn from their experience, evaluate and reflect on practice,cultural understanding, observer the  practice within educational establishments in Sweden and Forest learning skills are aligned with the school's  objectives.\r\n\r\nThe school's participants are two teachers, one experienced and one more recently qualified.  Both have skills  and positions within the school that make them ideal candidates for the Forest Learning training.  Both teachers are fully engaged with the project to be undertaken and have drive and ambition to see the project through to completion.\r\n\r\nThe Forest Learning training will provide a variety of activities which include: visits to establishments that deliver Forest learning, cultural visits, understanding Forest earning strategies and sharing of evaluations.\r\n\r\nThe underlying methodology of the training and school project is to encourage creative approaches to the teaching and learning of Forest learning along with a sound development of evaluation strategies.  These are closely aligned with the objectives of developing partnership work with other teachers and educators from within Europe.\r\n\r\nThe school plans that the impact of the project and training will be felt in several ways.  Firstly the school will benefit from specific Forest Learning training that it will be able to use to implement Forest Learning at the school and thus enhance further its outdoor learning provision and curriculum.  Secondly the school will use the training to establish further ongoing partnerships with teachers and educational entities in Sweden and beyond. With these partnerships the school will seek to engage the whole school community with a pan European and international view.  \r\n\r\nIn the long term the school seeks to engage with other schools in its locality and share good practices", "http://www.stanwick.northants.sch.uk/", "Stanwick Academy", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035764_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NN9"}
