This will allow for more independent living, a reduced need for lifting and manual handling from carers and a reduction in the number of costly disability aids within the home.\n\nThe Homehoist system will function initially as an everyday wheelchair, but will also be capable of lifting the user at certain positions within the home via the integrated hoist system rotate them through 180 degrees to the toilet, the shower, a sofa, or a bed.   This will incorporate a stabilisation system and optional floor clamps will ensure the system is can operate under more demanding load conditions. If others areas of the home need to be accessed the hoist section of Homehoist is able to be detached and used independently, this will also improve transportation of the device by breaking the system down into two lighter more compact units.\n\nAt Hi Tech Automation Limited we want to be sure that our business continues to develop.  We make mechanical and lifting systems and consider ourselves experts in the field.  With the help of AKS Medical, Technik, ARTI Electronics, HERI and IBV, we believe we have identified a novel design solution to the difficulty, comfort and costs associated with lifting a cerebral palsy patient.\n\nThe primary aim of the project is to develop an integrated wheelchair and hoist system capable of independent use by a cerebral palsy patient with upper body strength. We will build and test a demonstration prototype.  Post project we will invest in the design to develop it to production level.'", 198912.0, 963593.0, "HOMEHOIST", null, null, null, "http://www.homehoist.eu", "http://www.hitechautomation.com", null, "fp7_106815_953637362"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NN9"}
