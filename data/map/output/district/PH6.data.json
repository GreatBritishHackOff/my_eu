In all three pillars of sustainable development based social development strategy of Slovenia. With lifelong learning can be achieved all three objectives: personality development, social cohesion and economic progress. Responsibility of the state is to allow people to education and learning throughout life. Lifelong learning enables us to follow the increasingly rapid changes in all areas of life.\r\n\r\nVITRA is since 2000 one of the major coordinators in the national project Lifelong Learning Week (LLW), which is carried out in Slovenia for Adult Education of Slovenia (ACS). LLW coordinators (Vitra is the initiator) have the primary task of the network to establish and develop its network of so-called subcontractors to shape events in the LLW. Our network counts an average of 50 performers. These are representatives of public educational institutions (primary schools, kindergartens), Regional Park, a public park Sne\u017enik, private facilities (intergenerational center, cultural and environmental associations), farmhouses, individuals ....\r\n\r\nIn the project application MILO are among the objectives of the project highlighted the international dimension and learning at the origin ( England has pioneered LLW). The effect of the project on the 8 participants were divided into five stages. This is a personal, local, regional, national and international. Each performance will be measured results.\r\n\r\nAn important part of the project is the dissemination of the results and the various stages of evaluation.

(NET4)  Adult Education Staff.\r\nThe Firm of ARCH was established in 2001 and  in  that time has used LLP funding through Leonardo da Vinci, Grundvig, Youth and now Erasmus+  to deliver comprehensive programmes in natural and cultural heritage management. We have mobilised over 1,000 learners from a wide range of government and non-governmental organisations within Scotland to visit 13 countries within Europe to learn, through a series of structured courses, about the different ways in which culture and nature can be managed. Significant new skills and competencies in nature conservation and cultural heritage have been exchanged and transferred to ARCH and our consortium partners.\r\nARCH works in co-operation with a consortium of 16 members representing a comprehensive range of natural and cultural heritage management organisations, government bodies, national parks and colleges.\r\nNET 4  aims to provide 112 Adult Education Staff participants with a focused, ready-made opportunity to take time out from their every-day training work to learn about how knowledge, skills and competences in culture and nature management are passed to adult learners  elsewhere in Europe and give them an opportunity to consider developing new lessons, courses and training methods. \r\nNET4 will collaborate with 13 partner organisations throughout Europe from Iceland and Norway in the north to Cyprus and Bulgaria in the south. The aim of NET is to develop Adult Education opportunities for training staff through a series of structured courses, typically of 6 -7 days duration. These courses focus on the management of Europe's natural and cultural heritage.  NET is developed around the priority areas for the sector in Scotland today.  Each training course will be associated with a broad theme, which will provide a focus for activities through the week.  Emphasis will be placed on exchange of knowledge, ideas, issues and solutions between the participants and hosts. Each participant presents their work in Scotland and the challenges they face, as well as talks from the hosts, encouraging focused discussion on how both participants and hosts can benefit from each other\u2019s knowledge and experiences and how they can build this into ongoing adult education courses. \r\nAs in previous years, we will work with our partners to develop adult education staff training placements, which focus on new skills and knowledge and have the capacity for the exchange of best practice that fits with participant and sectoral needs. For example the course in Iceland will focus on the interpretive techniques for understanding and conserving the cultural landscape, including the traditional skills of turf building. In Finland and Slovakia the course theme is forest schools and environmental education.  In Western Norway the themes are large mammal management, fishery management, predator control and balancing hunting and conservation interests. In Eastern Norway the course addresses the management of montane scrub habitat. In South Slovakia the focus is traditional skills and environmental interpretation.  Itineraries for each structured course and reports from participants can be read at www.archnetwork.org\r\nOur partners all share our aim of providing high quality and innovative vocational training.  Receiving partners have been chosen because they are recognised by the UK consortium as being able to provide examples of best practice in the key areas identified as most important for our Scottish practitioners to learn. The courses that they offer have the potential to be built into adult education, both formal and informal offering the opportunity of gaining CPD and ECVET accreditation.\r\nNET participants will be drawn from the 16 member organisations in the ARCH mobility consortium which includes Scottish Natural Heritage, RSPB, National Trust for Scotland, Forestry Commission Scotland, John Muir Trust, Plantlife Scotland, Trees for Life, Historic Environment Scotland, Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park , Cairngorms National Park, Scottish Wildlife Trust, The Woodland Trust, Caithness Horizons, Earth building UK and Ireland, Scotland's Rural College and the Institute of Chartered Foresters.  All of these organisations have a remit to manage and protect Scotland\u2019s natural and cultural heritage through conservation, interpretation and education.  The ARCH consortium will positively encourage those AE Staff from the more remote areas of Scotland to participate in NET through a publicity and dissemination strategy.   Our natural and cultural heritage plays a key part in promoting a Scottish identity internationally and is a priority for developing European inter-regional co-operation. \u201d SNH European&International Influencing Strategy states \"Establishing links and alliances with international organisations and regions and countries are long term strategies where effort needs to be prioritised.

In that way, school has to do some further decision in filed internship which is very important to reach good level professional competences and skills. \r\nSchool wants to do more on international mobility and because of that it will try to host students from all partners in next school year.  We want to hosted more students because all of them will bring some peace of culture, habits, language skills and experience from his/her field of education. Due to these facts, our teacher will must be more open, speaking foreign language (English) and find some answers about level of practical knowledge among foreign students. We expect that employers will find out how good are developed professional competences between foreign students and compare them with level of competences, which is achieved by our students. Concerning this issue, we expect feedback from employers and suggestions what we should implement into practical training that our students would achieve better professional competences. We are going to add a new activity in international program - teaching - which will be provided by mentors form different local companies. We want to reach important aim - mutually collaboration between school and local companies. We recognized that this aim is very important if we want to prepare students on quick and well step on labor market.", "http://www.archnetwork.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SI01-KA116-035457_4"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PH6"}
