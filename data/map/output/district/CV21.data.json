At this time the process is faster than any other technique of comparable quality, however the parts are not produced at sufficient rate to make them economically viable for any but very high value specific applications. It has been identified that airframe production requires a large number of brackets of many different designs (>1200 in an Airbus A380). These are currently machined from aluminium and titanium billet, plate or forgings with extremely high wastage of material, which in the case of titanium alloys is expensive and contains scarce elements such as vanadium.\n\nThe development and knowledge created and protected in this project will allow the SME collaborators to exploit the advantage gained through the development of vastly superior additive manufacturing (AM) production systems.\n\nThe key outputs to the project will be:\n\n1.\tAn innovative new high power electron beam gun that has been designed for the EBM process and that enables high productivity processing.\n2.\tKnowledge surrounding the use of the high power electron beam gun, including the process control, and modelled and validated understanding of beam-powder bed interaction.", 196373.0, 1237436.0, "FastEBM", "High-power melting for fast processing", "The best production methods for aerospace parts with complex geometries have typically been slow and expensive. Advanced technology developed with EU support enables cost-effective mass production of such parts, slashing the selling price in half.", "Additive manufacturing (AM), in which a part is built up layer by layer from a computer-aided design file, has several advantages compared to standard shaping techniques. It produces a part close to final form and minimises post-processing energy consumption, time and material waste. It is particularly valuable in producing complex geometries with high precision.\n\nElectron beam melting (EBM) AM quickly produces parts in a powder bed in a vacuum box by melting sequential layers of powder with an electron beam. Its slow speed combined with the capital cost of equipment make it an expensive route for mass production of titanium alloy-based aerospace components. The EU-funded project FASTEBM accelerated the process with a novel high-power electron beam gun and associated process control technology.\n\nKey to project success was modelling and simulation. The team advanced a model of the EMB process that is successful in 2D simulations to accommodate 3D. They employed finite element modelling of the electron gun to increase beam power, the key to increasing processing speed.\n\nThe prototype was tested in industrial process trials by one project partner, who now has a registered trademark for the EBM technology. Simulations helped scientists identify a process window in which higher processing speeds are possible while ensuring acceptably low porosity and swelling for a successful build.\n\nResearchers also developed a process cost model. Its implementation demonstrated a potential decrease in selling price of titanium aerospace components by approximately 54\u00a0% compared to conventional processing methods thanks to savings in production costs. This would obviously have tremendous impact on the competitive position of EU aerospace components manufacturers, many of whom are small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nFASTEBM has delivered a prototype, very fast, high-precision EBM apparatus with control software and process models for large-scale production of titanium airframe parts. With further development, the technology will qualify for a number of parts and other AM processes, making an important contribution to the EU economy.", null, "http://www.hkrapidprototyping.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/153806.jpg", "fp7_100826_953892957"], ["1BU", "Power Optimised Ship for Environment with Electric Innovative Designs ON board", "Ge Energy Power Conversion Technology Limited", "The electric ship concept offers many benefits; among other aspects if offers flexibility of control and effectiveness of power transmission. But predominantly it enables higher energy conversion efficiency by ensuring that prime movers are effectively loaded at all times and across all operating conditions. This dominating advantage cannot be matched by mechanical transmission systems because gearboxes offer little chance of integrating a high number of prime movers in the restricted space of a ship whereas this integration is straight forward when managed electrically. Thus the electric ship concept offers reduced emissions through improved efficiency of engine operation but critically it offers significant reduced emissions during the critical phase of entry to littoral water when with speed generally reduced engines in a mechanical systems become very lightly loaded.\n\n\n\nIt is proposed to enhance the electric ship concept so it suits a wider range of vessels than currently. The principal barrier to adoption of the electric ship concept in merchant ships is the size of the equipment. However if size reductions can be achieved then adopting the electric ship concept in a wider range of merchant ships will, as described above, reduce emissions and improve the impact on global warming. Overall this impact will be significant given the current and anticipated levels of global trade and the proportion to be moved by sea transport.\n\n\n\nThis challenging ambition, to enable the adoption of the electric ship concept in a wider range of merchant ships, will demand the development of new technologies across all of marine electrical engineering:\n\n\n\n1.  High Temperature Superconductivity (HTS): This is a technology that allows smaller principal electrical components and an increase in efficiency.\n\n\n\n2.  Wireless monitoring:  This provides simpler internal control communication and enables the adoption of more advanced control regimes (as offered by the electrification of propulsion).\n\n\n\n3.  Harbour Shore Electrical Supplies: Running lightly loaded generators in harbour - as is commonly the practice among merchant ship operators - threatens the environment in a sensitive zone. The lack of any propulsion load prevents loading the generators more effectively. The answer is to supply the ship with electricity from shore connections. This does not need technological innovation but the widespread adoption of shore supplies demands standardisation among connectors and mode of electrical supply that has yet to be investigated.\n\n\n\n4.  Electrical actuation: This is a technology which aims to replace mechanically actuated auxiliaries by using direct electrical actuators and reduces size, cost, maintenance and improves efficiency\n\n\n\nThe benefits of these proposed innovations will be tested by developing designs for specific ship types: multi-purpose, cruise and container. The integration process will be composed of 6 steps:\n\n\n\n1  Ship mission\n\n\n\n2  Energy consumers\n\n\n\n3  Draft design\n\n\n\n4  Performance simulations\n\n\n\n5  Final design\n\n\n\n6  Environmental impact.\n\n\n\nTo reduce costs only the design for the multi-purpose ship will be taken through all the six steps. The remaining 2 ship types will only be taken through steps 1 to 3.\n\n\n\nFinally, the innovative HTSC technology will be demonstrated in a land demonstrator, scaled as much as possible to reduce costs, while retaining relevance of the demonstration to full scale implementation. This demonstrator will include: the propulsion system, including an HTSC propulsion motor and its power converter, a DC distribution system with innovative protection and an HTSC segment, and various auxiliary loads.", 3906957.0, 18860929.0, "POSE\u00b2IDON", null, null, null, "http://www.poseidon-ip.eu/index.php/", "http://www.converteam.com", null, "fp7_90101_999527868"], ["1QN", "New production technologies of complex 3D Micro-devices through multiprocess integration of ultra precision engineering techniques", "Gsi Group Ltd", "The proposed project aims at creating new high precision manufacturing technologies to respond cost-effectively and eco-friendly to the mass customization paradigm within the production of complex shape micro parts, embedded systems and miniaturized products at micro/meso-scale level (from 10 to 10.000 micron range). The main objective of Integ-micro is the research and development of new hybrid and reconfigurable multitasking machines and combined processes based on integration of different ultra high precision techniques for the generation of 3D complex shape microcomponents made from different kinds of materials. Multitasking micromachining can be best described as the ability to perform multiple machining operations in one workholding configuration. This guarantees greater accuracy, reduced handling and plant area, faster throughput and increased productivity. The availability of several machining technologies on a single machine allows important synergies between the different machining methods. For instance, combining machining by chip removal and laser micro machine will provide the capability to remove (by laser) the burr remaining from the previous chip removal operation. Alternatively, chip removal machining and laser LIGA technique can be combined in order to machine small components that could not be produced otherwise. The project will bring high added value thanks to the minimum time loss in setting new production lines for strategic products through short reconfiguration time and reduced ramp-up phase. The above goals will be reached exploiting methods of sustainable production, including downscaling of machine size (machine size reduced of 5 times at least), new process chain approaches for dramatically reduced processing times and eco-friendly processes like dry ultra-high speed cutting (UHSC) at micro-meso domain (eliminate the use of cutting fluid to get the target of zero waste emission).", 207649.0, 9297201.0, "INTEG-MICRO", null, null, null, "http://www.integ-micro.eu", "http://www.westwind-airbearings.com", null, "fp7_90451_997710379"], ["1TW", "Metallisation of Textiles to make Urban living for Older people more Independent  Fashionable", "A-Gas Electronic Materials Ltd.", "Urban areas are seeing an increasing population of older people and existing approaches to care for them are becoming unsustainable creating a European wide societal challenge. Assistive technology can provide them with security that will enable them to live independently e.g. wearing alarms and tracking devices around the arm or neck to alert carers to falls or their location if they wander. However such technology is often unsightly and stigmatises the user resulting in high abandonment rates.\nThe MATUROLIFE project will integrate creative artists and fashion designers into the research team to facilitate design-driven innovation. The project will build on existing technological advances in materials which have produced a highly innovative selective metallisation process that utilises nanotechnology, electrochemistry and materials science to encapsulate fibres in textiles with metal and thereby provide conductivity and electronic connectivity. In this way, better integration of electronics and sensors into fabrics and textiles will be possible. This will give the fashion designers and artists the tools to produce AT for older people that is not only functional but is more desirable and appealing as well as being lighter and more comfortable.\nBuilding on exiting best practice the consortium will include societal stakeholder groups representing end users (i.e. older people) who will be heavily involved in the design process as well as giving feedback and direction on the development of AT prototypes contributing significantly to end-user acceptance. The prototypes will demonstrate proof of concept and the industrial scalability of the selective metallisation process will be validated.
