SOLID will deliver an innovative toolbox of novel methodologies that will contribute to the competitiveness of the dairy industry and increase the effectiveness with which these benefits are delivered. SOLID facilitates the use of breeds and feeding strategies to maintain productivity, improve animal health and welfare while meeting the market requirement for high quality milk. A multidisciplinary team comprising academic and stakeholder (SME) partners from across Europe, encompassing dairy cows and goats, will identify and apply novel strategies at the farm level and throughout the supply chain. Innovative science and models, combined with a participatory approach, will tackle practical issues, and assess competitive sustainability and integration across a range of scales and geographical contexts. Proteomics combined with genotyping and calorimetry will be used to characterise and quantify dairy cow and goat breed adaptation to organic and low-input systems. Given the reliance of such systems on forage, SOLID will develop novel and sustainable feed resources and design a decision-support model to optimise the management of on-farm forage supply. Life cycle assessment tools will assess environmental sustainability of grassland-based multifunctional dairy systems.  Analysis of the supply chain from fork to farm will quantify the acceptability of new strategies and enhance collaboration. An integrated assessment tool and socio-economic modelling will assess innovations on farms and along supply chains, and will predict the impact of more widespread adoption of low-input practises. Effective knowledge dissemination and exchange activities will target key stakeholder groups ensuring exploitation of outputs at animal, farm, region, sector and European levels.", 14292.0, 6271689.0, "SOLID", "Better productivity from organic farms", "A wide-reaching research project in the EU is working with cattle and goat farmers to improve the output of organic and low input dairy farms.", "Organic and low-input dairy farming can deliver environmental benefits over conventional practices, but technical and financial constraints can limit uptake. This type of farming would benefit from new strategies to improve production and animal health whilst reducing production costs and improving overall efficiency.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Sustainable organic and low-input dairying' (http://www.solidairy.eu (SOLID)) project is a consortium of academics, supply chain members and farmers working towards making low-input dairy farming competitive in the European market. The project focuses on strategies to improve feeding, as well as identifying animal breeds adapted to these types of systems.\n\nSOLID involves farmers to help identify their needs, and studies organic and low-input supply chains to evaluate new strategies. Researchers have put forward a formal definition of low-input farming, and identified common priorities for different groups of farmers through stakeholder meetings.\n\nTeam members are also investigating favourable genetic traits across various organic and low-input farms. Flocks of dairy goats and herds of dairy cows are being monitored for yield, milk quality, and other health, welfare and performance characteristics. The aim is to measure whether breeds adapted for low-input farming show favourable genetic variation.\n\nAnother aspect of SOLID focuses on developing and using sustainable, high-quality feed resources. To facilitate more efficient feeding of forage-dominant diets, researchers are creating a decision-support tool to help farmers choose the most sustainable approach to feeding.\n\nSOLID is also studying the impact of SOLID innovative practices on the economic performance of dairy farms across Europe. Finally, the project is hosting e-learning modules and workshops to help apply these farm-level studies to the whole of Europe.\n\nEnvironmentally friendly dairy farming is a growing field that will benefit from a coordinated approach to improving productivity. SOLID is providing this coordination along with scientific research to help these farms become more economically successful whilst at the same time providing benefits to society.", null, "http://www.omsco.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/157389.jpg", "fp7_99072_983732485"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BS22"}
