This is visible in the age structure of the population and is reflected by the fact that the population aged 65 years and over is increasing in every European country. The growth in the elderly population may be explained by increased longevity, but at the same time, we also see an increase in debilitating conditions. However, it is also clear that the elderly are afflicted by challenging health conditions as a direct consequence of being elderly which impact their quality of life (QOL), e.g. living alone, depression, recovery from illness, immobility. This is what we would like to address. Living longer should be a privilege but there has been a collective failure to address social implications and QOL issues, where social care and the way it is funded are already in crisis. Our aim in this project is to couple the need for new societal approaches in addressing this changing demographic with improving the economy of green microenvironment sites, where health tourism and creating new jobs in this sector would in turn fund and provide benefits with respect to the well-being of the elderly. The ultimate outcome, through this pan-European academic and industrial project, will be: a) to derive cross-disciplinary and inter-sectorial knowledge of how to improve physical and mental well-being in the elderly, b) to characterise the environmental geology of Nemi and to correlate the identified features with improvements in health, well-being and recovery, c) to train a new generation of specialists in the sector of recreation and health for the tourism industry, d) the training of specialists in social and therapeutic horticulture (STH) as a way to improve physical and mental health, e) to create a model for health tourism, and f) to produce a business plan with an economic impact analysis.", 94210.0, 2119728.0, "CHARMED", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_207458_919847024"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1LE", "Youth Now", "Sutton Coldfield YMCA", 17103.0, "The role of the volunteer should mainly be to offer his/her special skills connected to and co-ordinated with the program and projects of Sutton ColdfieldYMCA  and the local community.

As such we see our participation in the Erasmus+ programme as an expansion of the services we offer to young people. \r\nWe have met the staff of the BBC last year to learn more about their work with young people and to exchange experiences and ideas. We learned about the limited possibilities of their students to participate in international learnings programmes due to the political/ social situation of the students. In the same time we realised the need within the local community in Sutton Coldfield to offer more projects for young people from a migration background. As there can be tendencies of separation and radicalisation.\r\nWe believe the cooperation with BBC could give all partners a unique learning experience on many levels. One target is to share good practice between the organisations.  Another target is to provide for the young participants the context for intercultural expression, creativity and innovation. \r\nPromote and develop non formal education as a method for active citizenship and civic involvement of youngsters.\r\nOffering culture related activities to let participants actively learn to set their own culture backgrounds and experiences in relation to other participants of the programme.\r\n\r\nAnother aim of this project is to build a long lasting partnership and cooperation between the partners, we hope that this will lead to life long learning that can be filtered down through the young people we work with and then into the comunities that we work in. \r\n\r\nWe think that the Erasmus + programme aims to provide young people with an intercultural learning experience and the opportunity to acquire many skills and competances which will be useful for their social and professional integration.\r\nSutton Coldfield YMCA offers a variety of cultural and leisure-time activities, advice, support and help.
