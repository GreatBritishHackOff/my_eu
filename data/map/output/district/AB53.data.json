We have been looking at how we can plan for French teaching from nursery to primary seven which will aide the transition into secondary school.  As as staff we wish to participate in the LFEE Europe Immersion course to Lyon, France.  At present, the staff have a range of expertise from our French specialist to the rest of the staff who are trying to improve their French through various courses, apps and books.  As a school we are implementing some of our French training to-date with all classes.  We are all open to new ideas for teaching French and are very keen and enthusiastic to develop our own expertise and teaching strategies.  We are looking forward to opening up channels of communication between UK schools and schools in Europe with the use of ICT such as Skype, FaceTime, e-resources, portals, e-twinning and e-mail.  The course is an ideal opportunity to make connections with a school in France.\r\n\r\nParticipating in the immersion course will allow all members of staff to boost their confidence and competency when teaching French.  Through preparation for and immersion in the language throughout the course, the staff will build upon their French conversation, listening and writing skills.  New ideas, methodologies and resources will strengthen all of our class teacher pedagogies in relation to regular planned exposure to French throughout the school.  Equally important is the development of cultural awareness and access to relevant resources to take back to New Deer School. \r\n\r\nOn returning from the immersion course, New Deer School plans to share their experiences with the local community, staff, parents and pupils, as well as the Mintlaw Cluster group of schools. As well as a positive impact on learning and teaching, a greater cultural awareness will directly transfer to the pupils.  Staff will have new and innovative ideas to try with the pupils and will be motivated to teach French embedded in other parts of the curriculum as their own language knowledge grows.  As a school, we have planned a calendar of events to further enhance and embed French in New Deer School (see section H).\r\n\r\nUsing the Aberdeenshire Modern Languages Framework will help the school to create a meaningful progression of French from nursery to primary seven.", null, "New Deer School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035629_coordinator"], ["4WB", "Expansion of French Embedment and Development of Spanish Immersion for a Globalised World", "Turriff Primary School", 14967.0, "Scotland is on a mission to make modern languages a key part of every primary pupil's daily life in school by the year 2020. Aberdeenshire is implementing this mission, and Markethill School, as one of the biggest schools in Aberdeenshire, has a significant role to play in this. Having started this year with the implementation of 1+2 and being a keen promoter of European languages and its cultural aspects, we hope to continue on this path and be leaders in modern language teaching in Scotland, fully implementing 1+2 several years in advance, for the benefit of our children in an ever more globalised and linked world. We will help to pilot and lead the way with the second foreign language, the L3, for this coming school year.\r\n\r\nChallenges in terms of competencies, confidence, methodology, and more, all have to be worked on. Spanish needs to be introduced as our second language, confidence and methodology in French needs to be developed for those new to it, and progression, evaluation, and new methods need to be gained in order to keep progressing with French year after year. This is where the LFEE immersion courses, accredited by the GTCS, will be incredibly useful and beneficial to us as a school. The Malaga, Spain course will give our modern languages ambassador the knowledge and tools to come out of class and teach Spanish to all of our older pupils as his main role. The French follow up course, set in southern France, will allow us to continue the progression of French in our school, develop our French knowledge, and come up with new and innovative ways to keep French learning alive in our school, year after year. Finally, the introductory course in Salignac, France, will help to improve methodological and pedagogical expertise in the teaching of French to primary school children and increase the teachers' knowledge of French as as language. All three courses will provide our participants with materials and ideas suitable for the teaching of French and Spanish at primary level, develop a greater cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary France and Spain, and improve our participants' competence and performance in French and Spanish as well as the  use of the internet and other ICT resources in classes to teach French and Spanish, all meanwhile getting to live and experience the French and Spanish languages and the cultural side of France and Spain.\r\n\r\nOur participants are our modern languages ambassador (for two courses), management (2), and keen members of staff (4), all of whom are keen promoters of modern languages and the European contexts in teaching, thus setting the stage perfectly for gaining the most out of these courses -- as well as then being able to give the most back upon the return to our school. The Spanish course will allow for its introduction, and the follow up French course being attended by both the ambassador and management will ensure the successful progression of French at the school. Giving the opportunity for four staff members to attend the introductory French course will also help to cement the knowledge and establishment of French at our school. All courses will increase the language confidence and cultural knowledge of the participants, and as a result, of the school community as a whole.\r\n\r\nLocal benefits to the school will include a point of contact for 1+2 language learning in French and Spanish, a shared pool of new resources and ideas for all teachers to access, opportunities for professional dialogue and discussion, opportunities for a greater European dimension in terms of citizenship and social studies for the pupils as well as European cooperation with other schools, and training/reflecting/sharing opportunities run by our participants to stage partners, the school, the wider community, and the council. There will also be links with parents and the wider community, and recognition for participants sought from the General Teaching Council of Scotland for all of our participants.\r\n\r\nWith constant evaluation and improvement, having already embarked on the path to implementing the 1+2 programme this year, these courses will help us to fully implement it, and by the 2017 school year - 3 years in advance - we will hopefully be successfully implementing the whole 1+2 language policy of the Scottish Government.", null, "Turriff Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036102_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "AB53"}
