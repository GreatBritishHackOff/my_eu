All these components will be constituents of a fuel cell unit which will first be tested in the lab and , after further miniaturisation, in a truck platform.  SAFARI is primarily focussed on trucks at HAR who run a fleet of LNG trucks, but the project will also consiser other options including buses and delivery vehicles using LNG.  Trials will be undertaken in the UK especially  to comply with approvals for codes and standards, as well as assessing the economic fleet potential.  LNG was selected as the fuel because it is increasing in importance for trucks across the EU, with lower costs and much lower emissions than diesel trucks. Also, LNG is widely available throughout the EU with long-term supplies guaranteed for the next two centuries.  The SOFC was chosen because it can operate readily on LNG, while providing low emissions, low noise and good heat/chilling available.

SUAV is primarily aiming at platforms like the CopterCity UAV platform from Survey Copter (France) but will consider other options (in particular fixed wing vehicles) too.\n\nPropane was chosen as the fuel due to its superior energy density compared to hydrogen, whichever storage technique is used. The SOFC was chosen since it can convert reformate (i.e. CO/H2-mixtures) to electricity, as compared to other types of fuel cell that require very pure hydrogen, which significantly reduces fuel processing.\n\nThe design of the mSOFC power generator will be primarily driven by the weight and volume available in the mini-UAV.

SUAV is using propane as a fuel because it contains more energy compared to hydrogen and is also available throughout Europe. Fuel cell types such as SOFCs are used since they can convert reformate gases to electricity, as opposed to other types of fuel cells that require pure hydrogen.\n\nThe materials for assembling sub-stacks have been tested to ensure they conform to the design calculations. Results have shown that the sub-stacks are capable of operating under the defined conditions. Project members have improved the sub-stack performance from 1 to 5\u00a0Watts per cell, thus proving possible up-scaling. An initial stack design has been created.\n\nModelling of the SOFC stack as well as the balance-of-plant components accompanies the development of the single components of the power generator. Based on this, 2D and 3D computational fluid dynamics models have been developed to predict temperature distributions within each microtubular cell and the complete stack.\n\nDue to the stringent requirements on volume and weight, project members have used catalytic partial oxidation as a reforming technique. Although it has lower efficiency than steam reforming, it results in a higher power output per volume and weight as it does not require water.\n\nSUAV's legacy will be a 280\u00a0W fuel cell generator with prolonged flight mission capabilities.

The project is primarily aimed at the RV platform from Autosleepers, an SME based in the UK, but other applications such as boats, ambulances and environmental testing vehicles will also be studied.

During the first two years, the project drew up the requirements for this fuel cell power generation system, including size, weight, and the mechanical, electrical and data communication interfaces between the power generator and the RV. The interfaces also support camping out in the wild where RVs are not near plug-in power for several days.\n\nProject members modelled fuel cell types such as single microtubular SOFCs, SOFC stacks and BOP in order to optimise system performance. Modelling results provided them with insight into heat transfer and the overall system. Two exhibitions showcased the RV and its fuel cell, which was also highlighted in several conference papers and journal publications.\n\nProject partners defined and developed an integrated fuel cell system. All elements were then validated. They trialled six autogas fuel samples from service stations across Europe and found that propane and other hydrocarbons vary greatly. Cells were tested on propane and yielded positive results for fuel cell performance.\n\nThe integrated fuel cell system will be further tested and optimised in the third and final year of the project.\n\nBy integrating stacks into hybrid power systems, SAPIENS will be able to provide the RV market and enthusiasts throughout Europe with innovative noise reduction and emission options.", null, "http://www.fuelcellmarkets.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/162514.jpg", "fp7_106589_996890244"], ["4PY", "New Generation Solid Oxide Fuel Cells", "Adelan Ltd", "This project combines sector-leading partners from clean energy projects to achieve allied goals.

The strategic long-term vision for the partners is to innovate and commercialise low-cost SOFCs for household energy generation, based on patented designs, integrated systems and prototypes developed in other EC, UK and TR projects. We envisage CHP systems will replace household boilers in a transition towards a hydrogen economy, and very early prototypes are already being ordered at very high cost (e.g. Eon and CFCL; http://www.cfcl.com.au/Assets/Files/20111128-JTI_and_E.ON_order.pdf).

This can result in bullying, a feeling of isolation, segregation, discrimination, a lowering of self esteem, negative attitudes to learning, low attainment in education and a lack of motivation, to name but a few. Belonging in society through increased understanding would avoid prejudices, fear and stereotypes and would lead to greater tolerance and respect towards our selected focus groups: victims of bullying, families from different cultural and religious backgrounds, refugees, those with physical and mental disabilities and children from disadvantaged families. We believe that early intervention in education can positively affect the lives of children in later life so they can become responsible adults and active, valued members of a global society. This is becoming more and more important in a changing Europe and in a changing world with its religious and territorial conflicts.\r\n\r\nOver the last few years teachers from our schools have noticed an increase in the challenges resulting from social exclusion and have linked it  to low educational attainment. By using the creative arts, our schools will show  participants and stakeholders that young people from different personal, cultural, religious and national backgrounds can live, work and study together in a positive way and can thus overcome all types of prejudices. \r\n\r\nOur project gives practical and creative opportunities to promote a better understanding and respect for those with different abilities. At the end of the project, the students will present what they have experienced and learned to parents and the community. By working together in workshops, young people in our target groups will improve their self esteem, feel valued members of our communities and will see improvements in their educational attainment. This will have long term benefits for the rest of their lives and they will become ambassadors for living an open, free and democratic life. Being part of a multicultural and inclusive society, will show our students the importance of engaging every single person in the project when it comes to acceptance, tolerance and respect.\r\n\r\nWe aim to promote a change in attitudes within our schools and communities so that people see the 'person' and consider the 'differences' as positives. We believe that early intervention is vital for long term positive outcomes. Through better understanding of the causes of social exclusion, we hope to dispel some of the fears sometimes portrayed by the media in the UK and throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nThe project will also show the benefits of working in partnerships at a European level.
