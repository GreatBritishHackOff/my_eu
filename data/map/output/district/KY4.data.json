Language learning should be embedded in the classroom and not taught as a stand alone subject. Aims of this policy include: making Scottish children more employable; appreciative of other language and cultures and developing language skills. \r\n\r\nI have an SQA Higher in French which I gained at high school and am currently attending an LFEE French teaching CPD opportunity through Fife Council. I am looking to gain accreditation from the GTCS in language teaching. This area of education is continuing to develop and the opportunities gained for pupils is likely to increase. This course will increase the depth of knowledge I have whilst providing examples of good learning and teaching practice. \r\n\r\nI currently teaching 31 P7 children, but as a primary teacher I can teach children aged 3-14, and not necessarily be kept at one age stage throughout my teaching career. The children I teach will transfer to secondary school with  a greater language vocabulary, acumen and confidence. I can provide training opportunities to other staff members and parents which will increase the audience who will benefit from this course. \r\n\r\nAt a school level, our School Quality Improvement plan included beginning to introduce Modern Foreign Language teaching into the classroom. National Guidance aims to have 1+2 embedded into classroom practice by 2020. Participation in this course will help to develop our school and help to meet these aims.  Next year, 1+2 will be an aspect of our Cluster Improvement Plan also.", null, "Foulford Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035596_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "KY4"}
