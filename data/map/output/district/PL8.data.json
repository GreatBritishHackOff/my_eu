Sharing experiences is organized at the FRMFR with the objective of creating a regional cohesion on all matters related to European mobility and thus project in terms of the valuation of these mobilities at events: General Meetings but also days of departmental or national educational groups. The impact for these teachers is to benefit from an increase in skills to better support the mobility of young people and ensure that they are more likely to benefit from this experience and offer existing and new partners coming unfailing support.
