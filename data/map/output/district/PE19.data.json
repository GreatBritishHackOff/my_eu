These stoppages are predominantly caused by weld quality issues, which in turn arise from poor maintenance of consumable \u2018tips\u2019 on RSW guns.\n\nSmartDress will develop a fully automated adaptive control system that will optimise, monitor and maintain tip quality in these applications.  This will minimise line stoppages and give provide our consortium of tier 2/3 SME automotive suppliers with an IP protectable, \u2018high-tech\u2019 product, enabling us to protect and expand our market share \u2013 which is shrinking due to competition from low-labour rate competitor countries.\n\nAnother key feature of the SmartDress system will be that it will allow cost-competitive manufacture of aluminium (not currently commercially viable), which will enable lower cost aluminium vehicle manufacture.  This could have very large potential impact on CO2 emissions (due to vehicle light-weighting).", 142118.0, 1230518.0, "SmartDress", "Keeping electrodes in tip-top shape", "The average European family car contains up to 5\u00a0000 spot welds. New spot welding electrode monitoring and repair technology will have tremendous impact on the competitive position of the EU's automotive manufacturing sector.", "Resistance spot welding (RSW) is extensively employed in high-volume automotive production. As manufacturers have increasingly turned to light-weight aluminium, RSW has become cost prohibitive for mass production. Aluminium reacts quite aggressively with the consumable copper electrode tips on RSW guns. Poor maintenance leads to inferior weld quality and subsequent frequent work stoppages, imposing increased maintenance costs and lost revenue. For the numerous small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the field, these issues further impinge on market competitiveness in the face of increasing competition from low-labour\u2013cost countries.\n\nEU-funded scientists developed an automated adaptive control system to monitor, optimise and maintain electrode tip quality with the project 'Adaptive tip dress control for automated resistance spot welding' (http://www.smartdress-project.eu/ (SMARTDRESS)). It senses tip wear, initiates tip repair (via tip dressing) and automatically optimises the tip dressing schedule. The SMARTDRESS technology will not only improve weld quality and minimise line stoppages, it will enable cost-competitive spot welding of lightweight aluminium.\n\nThe SMARTDRESS system uses an optical sensor to monitor the condition of the RSW electrode tips. The control system determines if maintenance is required, sparing unnecessary scheduled maintenance that expends time, money and electrode material. Tip dressing is a process of removing uneven material from the tip face to repair any damage. The tip is thus returned to its original geometry but material is lost. SMARTDRESS also exploits a special abrasive dressing that lightly cleans the electrodes without cutting away valuable copper.\n\nPatents have been filed for both the optical sensor and the control technology. Electrode maintenance issues remain the main reason for work stoppages in automotive body manufacturing. The SMARTDRESS abrasive dressing technology for electrode tip monitoring and repair offers currently unavailable capabilities. These advances promise important enhancements in weld quality and overall productivity that will significantly improve the competitive position of the numerous SMEs in the automotive manufacturing sector.", null, "http://www.finaids.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/140998.jpg", "fp7_101398_967662495"], ["2ES", "Full scale demonstration prototype tidal stream generator", "Bosch Rexroth Ltd", "This proposed collaborative project aims to demonstrate an innovative tidal energy converter at full scale in UK waters where there is an abundant resource and clear incentives for early commercial development; the selected site has potential for further commercial development. The main project objective is to test a certified, high performance, tidal flow technology ready for commercial deployment. The collaborative nature of this project has allowed a very strong team of partners to be assembled that has the necessary expertise to design, build, test and optimise the full scale demonstrator. The pre-production prototype to be demonstrated uses oscillating hydrofoils; this technology is currently being tested by Pulse Tidal in a scaled marine trial in the UK. Oscillating hydrofoils have been proposed previously for exploiting tidal currents. Pulse Tidal, the holder of the IPR, has an improved technical approach and a refined strategy, which exploits the benefits of oscillating foils over wind turbine style axial flow rotors. Modelling has shown that high efficiencies can be achieved from a hydrofoil oscillating at certain frequencies. Scaled model testing by Pulse Tidal has confirmed that a phased pair of hydrofoils sweeping the same cross section of flow improves power capture efficiency to a level comparable with axial flow systems. The hydrofoil approach allows power to be captured with a wide, shallow swept area. In a given depth oscillating foil systems can be up to four times more powerful than single axial flow rotors. In reality almost all sites are too shallow for multi-megawatt axial flow rotors. By offering much larger unit capacities Pulse will have a unique strategic and economic advantage over other technologies. Pulse Tidal\u2019s clear commercial focus is therefore to develop early systems specifically for tidal flows too shallow for others to compete. This will be followed by the development of larger systems for deeper water.", null, 11853170.0, "PULSE STREAM 1200", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_94495_996614279"], ["2ES", "Smart Forwarder for sustainable and efficient forest operation and management", "Bosch Rexroth Ltd", "Forest biomass is currently one of the most important source of renewable energy and accounts for almost half of the EU\u2019s total renewable energy consumption.
