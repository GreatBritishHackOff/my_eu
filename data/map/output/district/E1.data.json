With the growth of dust grains, which have their origin in the interstellar medium, planet formation starts. To study these first steps of dust growth, which are closely coupled to the dynamics in the disk, is therefore of relevance to understanding planet formation and the origin of life.\nStudying the dynamical effects of dust in PPDs is so far based on simple dust models, which fail in many aspects to explain observations and planet formation. The need to include a realistic dust model is expressed in many studies. In collaboration with researchers at Queen Mary University, I have developed a science program which together will allow us to address the key questions of the influence of the dust properties on the spatial distribution, the dust evolution and on the planet formation processes in turbulent PPDs. In the interstellar medium, single dust grains are of core-mantle composition which coagulate into aggregates in dense regions. Implemented in PPDs, these aggregates undergo evolutionary processes which are influenced by turbulence in the disks. In PPDs, ionised gas is magneto-hydrodynamic turbulent due to magneto-rotational instabilities.

The AMEDEO network focuses on the key research training challenges of providing the EU\u2019s aerospace industry with a new generation of MDO researchers capable of providing the radical innovations needed to improve the energy efficiency and reduce emissions from aircraft, at reduced timescales and costs.\n\nThe importance and timeliness of training a new generation of researchers in MDO for the aerospace industry is clearly stated in the recent EU Flightpath 2050 document which describes its strategic importance to preserving Europe\u2019s lead in an increasingly competitive international industry that makes an annual  EURO 220 billion contribution to the EU economy and provides 4.5 million jobs. Strong private sector involvement in the network, from both SMEs and global aerospace industry leaders, demonstrates the commitment of Europe's leading aerospace companies to the AMEDEO network and to its ability to form an excellent example of the type of enduring technological, scientific and industrial leadership cluster that has been called for in the Flightpath 2050 document.", 150988.0, 2877636.0, "AMEDEO", null, null, null, "http://www.amedeo-itn.eu/", "http://www.qmul.ac.uk", null, "fp7_105135_999847677"], ["7HR", "DETECTION OF SAFETY CRITICAL CRACKS AND CORROSION IN SHIPS USING NOVEL SENSORS AND SYSTEMS BASED ON ULTRASONIC LINEAR PHASED ARRAY TECHNOLOGY", "Abs Europe Ltd", "Structural failure is a major cause of the wreckage of ships, vessels and tankers and causes loss of life and pollution of the seas and coastal waters of Europe as follows: \u00a7In 2004, the total amount of oil and oil products transported by sea reached the two billion-tonne/year mark (more than 40 % of total maritime traffic).

These applications call for thermoelectric materials with high zT which requires higher Seebeck coefficient, higher electrical conductivity, and lower thermal conductivity. In this project, two strategies are used to reduce lattice thermal conductivity and then improve the zT: one is phonon-glass substitution within the unit cell by creating point defects such as interstitials and vacancies; another is the introduction of more interfaces on the nanometre scale.

Current alternatives are both unsatisfactory: either to rely on synchronisation to ensure strong consistency, or to forfeit synchronisation and consistency altogether with ad-hoc eventual consistency. The former approach does not scale beyond a single data centre and is expensive. The latter is extremely difficult to understand, and remains error-prone, even for highly-skilled programmers.<br/>SyncFree avoids both global synchronisation and the complexities of ad-hoc eventual consistency by leveraging the formal properties of CRDTs. CRDTs are designed so that unsynchronised concurrent updates do not conflict and have well-defined semantics. By combining CRDT objects from a standard library of proven datatypes (counters, sets, graphs, sequences, etc.), large-scale distributed programming is simpler and less error-prone. CRDTs are a practical and cost-effective approach.<br/>The SyncFree project will develop both theoretical and practical understanding of large-scale synchronisation-free programming based on CRDTs.

This led to the successful development of two typical aircraft parts, namely a part of fuselage and a re-engineered nose landing gear door.\n\nThe project team then conducted a life-cycle analysis that showed to what extent these parts could decrease both manufacturing costs and an aircraft's environmental footprint. In addition, the team looked into ways of integrating carbon nanotubes into composite materials not only in the aviation sector but also in the rail sector.\n\nImportantly, IMS&CPS has granted access to all its valuable research based on SQRTM and nanotechnology, potentially enabling greener manufacture of doors, flaps, spoilers, ailerons, slats and other aircraft parts.

Attention can improve our search if drawn to the vicinity of the target.

But to understand the minimum neuronal hardware necessary to solve such tasks, we here turn to an animal that is rapidly becoming a model for analysing how simple nervous systems solve complex cognitive tasks: the bumblebee.\nInterestingly, the common tests run by psychologists often seem more appropriate to a bee's world than to a human's. Commonly, subjects are asked to search a display for one or several defined targets (e.g. a small yellow square). The targets are commonly mixed with other stimuli (distractors), which differ from those the subject is asked to search for. Targets may differ from distractors in one stimulus dimension only (such as color), or they may differ in several dimensions (such as color and shape). Performance of subjects is evaluated in terms of reaction time and accuracy, and in terms of individual strategy used to optimize the speed-accuracy tradeoff.\nWe will use a novel technique, the virtual bee meadow, to ask a range of questions dealing with visual search and attention in bumblebees.

Humans can make a decision when presented with scenes for only 12 ms. Bees could distinguish between elemental targets such as colour in as little as 25 ms but were not able to handle a more complex discrimination task involving whole image analysis even when given 100 ms.  This is significant as the bees failed to detect the cryptic yellow spider, a deadly predator.\n\nBees could switch between multiple targets, such as two colours. Moreover, when posed with rewards such as high sucrose as well as saliency (prominence of colour, for example), both factors influenced search.\n\nThe ultimate test for the bees was to compare multiple search tasks while simultaneously avoiding predators using different modalities \u2013 visual and olfactory. The scientists found that bees performed both searches when one was an olfactory task and the other was visual. However, they failed to perform searches when both tasks were visual.\n\nProject research showed that bees have evolved several adaptations to perform visual tasks with flexibility and efficiency. As such, the bumble bee could be an ideal model system to study mechanisms of attention compared with vertebrates.

As real-world problems typically involve multiple uncertain variables, Bayesian analysis is extended using a technique called Bayesian networks (BNs).

On a domestic scale solar thermal systems are increasingly common and are, to the general public, the most visible renewable energy technology. Moreover, compared to biomass they have distinct user benefits when it comes to domestic heating or hot water provision as they do not need physical feedstock. However, despite significant market growth their market penetration only accounts for 0.05% of our total energy consumption. This is mainly due to the high initial investment required which is a function of equipment and installation costs. Conventional collectors rely on high value materials such as copper and aluminium, which are essential to achieve acceptable performance. However, these materials are also relatively expensive and it is unlikely that component costs will decrease in the future. Moreover, supply of these materials is limited and not large enough to cope with expected increases in demand. Alternative materials such as polymers have been investigated and can theoretically offer significant cost savings due to potential weight reductions, mass production techniques and increased freedom of functional design. However, they are generally not suitable for domestic type solar thermal installations. This is mainly due to their low heat deflection temperature and thermal conductivity. In PolySol we aim to develop a novel polymeric collector that can substitute a metallic solar thermal collector for domestic heating and hot water applications.

Ongoing genetic screening has also pinpointed other factors involved in ferritin regulation and important for iron metabolism.

The scientific interests of these groups have a common denominator in the application of molecular imprinting for the preparation of new intelligent materials and the use of these materials in synthesis, catalysis and assay devices while the scientific background of the groups is divergent ranging from bioengineering and nanobiotechnology to synthetic chemistry and polymer chemistry all the way to product oriented research and technology R&amp;D. The transfer of knowledge program has been devised taking into account the three main objectives of this partnership, that are (T1) scientific ToK; (T2) professional development; (T3) long term collaborations. The partnership has identified five key actions along which the program will develop, and these are i) secondment of researchers, ii) recruitment of new researchers, iii) partnerships events, iv) return home plan, v) interactions between principal investigators. The field of molecular imprinting has now reached an important stage where further technological advance will require closer interactions of academia and industry.

Currently the fetus is delivered very preterm before fetal death or irreversible organ damage occurs. Affected neonates suffer intracranial haemorrhage, chronic lung disease, cerebral palsy, with heart disease and diabetes as adults; mortality is high. Recent improvements in the care of premature growth restricted neonates, means that more of them survive delivery, but at great cost. Small increases in fetal growth and gestation at birth are associated with major improvements in survival and morbidity.\nImproving uterine blood flow is key and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is important to achieve this. In preclinical animal models we showed that local VEGF gene transfer to the uteroplacental circulation using adenovirus vectors increases uterine blood flow, attenuates constriction of uterine arteries and increases angiogenesis; these changes result in improved growth of severely growth restricted fetuses. This is the first clinically-applicable evidence based therapy that could improve perinatal outcome in severe early onset FGR in man.\nIn collaboration with an SME experienced in gene therapy trials, our aim is to complete an agreed toxicology programme, identify specific ethical issues in stakeholders, and to perform a Phase I/II study in women with severe early onset FGR at four EU centres of excellence, using interventional radiology to deliver an adenovirus vector containing the mature processed form of human VEGF-D into the uterine artery.

Such a project is, we feel, vital to help EU policy formation and deepen our understanding of some of the most crucial questions facing EU economic policy. The reason is simple. Currently, (almost all) intangible investments are either not measured, or treated as an intermediate input into production so they are assumed to produce no durable assets for firms or economies. Does this matter? In practice, most knowledge investments involve intangible spending. And, the Lisbon agenda aims to make the EU \u201cthe most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010 (our italics)\u201d.  Thus we are in the difficult position of having perhaps the major EU policy aspiration backed by almost no data or measures.  This project will set out a method and collect the data required. Given the issue\u2019s importance, we believe our work will make a considerable contribution. Some knowledge investment is counted as such in the key economic measures such as GDP (e.g. software).

Additional concerns exist regarding drug eluting stents as there appears to be a small but real increase in late and very late stent thrombosis, particularly after discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy.\nThe novel concept we propose is use of a biodegradable magnetised stent (BMS) to deliver a novel biological therapy offering regenerative medicine solutions to the coronary artery vessel wall. Specifically we will develop the stent technology as a platform to attract autologous progenitor cells tagged in vitro with iron nanoparticles. Once deployed, the cells will be attracted to the already implanted BMS and proliferate to form a new endothelium. We will also use over-expression of the NRP1 gene in the artery wall where it will dimerise with NRP1 receptors on the deployed cells. The NRP1 gene will be transfected by adenovirus delivered from the wall of the BMS. Over time the BMS will undergo a predictable degradation to leave a wholly biological artery through regeneration of native tissues.\nCurrently, about 12,000 European Citizens a year suffer from late in-stent thrombosis and 120,000 from restenosis.

Such pain causes avoidable suffering, resulting in longer hospital stays and higher health care costs.\n\nThus, the EU funded the http://ec.europa.eu/research/health/public-health/clinical-outcome-into-practice/projects/pain-out_en.html ('Improvement in postoperative pain outcome') (PAIN OUT) project to study the problem. This project began in January 2009, with four-year funding, and as of 2013 will continue without EU funding. The project's main objective was to develop and validate a system for measuring outcome quality in terms of post-surgical pain. This took form as a pain registry, a large database incorporating and updating clinical data and subjective patient reports mostly from participating hospitals. As of 2012, it contained 35 000 records, making it one of the world's largest. The registry has two main purposes, first being quality improvement in the form of feedback (compared against other hospitals). Its second function is to facilitate health care research.\n\nMuch of the project's work involved the technical establishment and population of the database. This included creation, validation and translation of a questionnaire supplied to hospitals, plus other modules of the registry such as the decision support system and electronic knowledge library: guidelines summarising current therapy recommendations. Major outcomes were the scientific results, covering three main areas. A health economics analysis indicated that a proportion of patients still suffer post-operative pain at the seven-day point, strongly affecting quality of life measures. A costing analysis of this data is underway. Other studies included a patient satisfaction survey. This survey revealed considerable variation in factors such as numbers of hospital visits and time committed by pain-team members causing variation in service among hospitals. Gender/age analysis revealed that some patients, especially older women, need extra attention for pain management.\n\nRapid dissemination gained the project strong support, whereby it expanded to include 60 hospitals on 5 continents. The project's results were disseminated at 70 international meetings and 9 scientific publications to date.\n\nPAIN OUT's legacy will be improved pain management for patients, and savings for health care systems.", null, "http://www.qmul.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2011-04/57188.jpg", "fp7_89477_999847677"], ["6BJ", "Community set-up and networking for the reMIXing of online MEDIA fragments", "Acuity Un Limited", "While we have already established, traditional markets for complete videos, e.g. in stock footage portals, media libraries or TV archives, where entire videos may be found and also purchased for re-use in new media production situations, these markets do not permit the easy purchase or sale of smaller fragments of AV materials.

Thus, drug development in ALS, including trial design, patient selection, and outcome measures must be re-engineered to break the current impasse. Nerve cell death in ALS is associated with inflammation, which contributes to cell damage, and is a logical target for therapy.

In fact, Treg numbers and function predict rates of disease progression and survival. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS.

Cholesterol is known to leave the circulation and accumulate in extracellular matrix through interactions between LDL and glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Tendons are GAG rich in the interfascicular matrix (IFM: a tendon structure facilitating collagen fascicle sliding and extension). One putative mechanism by which high cholesterol may impact tendon function is an accumulation of cholesterol and LDL in the IFM, impairing fascicle sliding and extension.

Organic synthesis has experienced an enormous development in the last half century, however, the efficient use of resources remains a very significant challenge. Two of the factors influencing this are (i) the extensive use of scarce precious metal catalysts and (ii) the need for high energy reactants to ensure favourable thermodynamics in synthetic processes.\n\nIn recent years, extensive efforts have been dedicated to the development of technologies for the splitting of water into its components, hydrogen and oxygen. This reaction is thermodynamically disfavoured, requiring an external energy input which can be achieved by the use of a photocatalyst (a compound capable of harvesting energy from light and use it to promote a chemical reaction). These technologies are useful for the production of hydrogen, which is a valuable energy vector and a powerful reductant. On the down side, hydrogen is a very flammable gas with wide explosion limits, which poses serious safety challenges to its storage and use.\n\nWe propose to investigate the combination of water-splitting technologies with iron-catalysed reduction of organic compounds.

Understanding the microbial mechanisms that control the methane production from wetland sediments and including this information in climate prediction models are urgently required for devising effective strategies to comply with climate change mitigation goals. To fill this major gap in our knowledge, we designed this project around three objectives: (1) Characterize the active methanogenic populations that degrade DMS to methane in anoxic wetland sediments (2) Characterize the anaerobic DMS degradation pathway and their environmental regulation in wetland sediments.

As it deforms the body and its social skin, caricature questions the concept itself of subjectivity, as well as hierarchies and balances of power.

This action supports the school\u2019s vision and strengthens and promotes sustainable development such as understanding and respecting multiculturalism and diversity. Internationality is a natural part of everyday school activities. Students' capacity for internationalization and international mobility is supported, which also promotes the rise of organization's level of know-how. Work placements abroad enable different kinds of learning environments and individual learning pathways for students. Incoming international students bring in know-how and increase the internationalization in the school. Organization\u2019s strategy for internationalization includes finding new partnerships and increasing possibilities for international mobility to meet the students\u2019 increasing interest and need for international experience. The curriculum team's task is to develop the international dimension of the curriculum and make reforms according to Ecvet, for example taking the learning points into account. \r\n\r\nThe project is coordinated by Helsinki Culinary School Perho while Helsinki Vocational College is acting as a domestic partner. The project is carried out with the International CHASE Network, which consists of 18 hospitality and catering colleges around Europe. Most of the colleges act both as a sending and a receiving partner. The Network has been operating for over 20 years and represents a wide range of different language and cultural areas. From the gastronomic point of view, the colleges represent traditional European regional gastronomy. Gaining know-how and skills from the traditional European gastronomy strengthens the participants\u2019 possibilities for employment and success in labor market.\r\n\r\nThe participants of the project are primary and upper secondary based students, who study the Vocational Qualification in Hotel, Restaurant and Catering Services. The two-year project provides 40 students with the possibility of 4 and 5 months' exchange within the CHASE network colleges. \r\n\r\nThe exchange consists of a 4 -week language and cultural training in the host college and of a work placement. During the exchange period the students learn skills needed in the internationalizing working life in addition to the professional skills. International work skills include different languages, networking and acting in a multicultural environment as well as different working cultures and customs.

On the basis of this valuable experience, the school expanded its international ventures into Western Europe in 2012 with an application to the Leonardo da Vinci Programme. The exceptional experience and the remarkable results gained by these projects are a motivating force in the pursuit to become involved with even more excellent projects. Therefore, the BSZ is taking part in the newly launched Erasmus Plus Programme and sending selected students, mainly from the areas of wholesale, office administration, industry, banking, insurance and logistics, to a three-week education and vocational training programme at the College of Central London (CCL) in London. In two flows, each with 25 participants, students will not only improve their language skills and broaden their intercultural competence, but they will also increase their knowledge primarily especially in topics such as international trade and logistics. These are topics which our students encounter through various approaches depending on his or her occupation (e.g. letter of credit). The courses are held in classrooms at the CCL, and on-location training at selected firms and institutions involved in international trade guarantee a high level of practical experience. The planned dates for the courses and training are momentarily in October 2014 (flow 1) and in October 2015 (flow2). \r\nThe students participating in the project will be chosen on part of the BSZ by the specialist advisor for international projects in accordance with the associated department managers and colleagues and the respective apprenticing companies. All participants are currently working in a two to three-year commercial apprenticeship position.\r\nA great need for such projects exists, since industry and commerce today increasingly operate on a global level and vocational training must adjust to these developments. The companies offering the apprenticeship positions have acknowledged this fact and view, as the BSZ also does, such training programmes as a valuable addition to the dual system practiced here.\r\nThe courses at the CCL have the following goals:\r\n1. Students recognize how relevant their daily efforts at work and in school are with consideration to our increasingly globalised world.\r\n2. Synergistic effects applying to all occupations appear.\r\n3. Students enhance not only language and technical skills but also their individual personality. They are able to use this experience in their companies as well as in our society in a positive way. \r\n4. As well-trained apprentices in Europe, the task of meeting the demands of globalisation can certainly be achieved.\r\nAs a result the opportunities for the participants are not only greater in their own company but also in the European job market. Employers benefit from the enhanced competence of their apprentices and employees. Schools and companies treat each other more as partners and grow aware of the opportunities made available by working together in such a complex manner. Last, but not least, political understanding is increased in order to establish a European Union that functions well and efficiently.

One of the most considerable possibilities of gaining new knowledge is learning from the experiences of the other countries. To provide the learning quality in accordance with the contemporary requirements, the school needs an extra knowledge in managing the learning process, arranging the studies, operating the new digital technology and implementing the new curricula. The staff of the vocational school needs new experiences in using the modern active learning methodologies, work-based learning, changes in evaluation of skills and competences and creating the new forms of collaboration to support the reforms in the learning conceptions. \r\n\r\nFor achieving it the school has started a project \u201cThe Best Practices from Europe\u201d. The aim of the project is to improve the learning process and enhance the arrangement of students\u2019 placements in the light of the change of the approach to learning and send the students to perform their professional placements in the companies of European countries. \r\n\r\nThe activities during the project are planned to take place on three levels: \r\n1) The mobilities of the school staff, including the vocational teachers, to European vocational schools to gain knowledge and get experiences how to improve the  process of updating the learning process and to enhance the practical arrangement of placements (including the work-based learning). \r\n2) The practice of the vocational teachers in the partner companies of our partner schools to complement their skills and competences and get aware of the modern trends in their specialty.\r\n3) The placements of the students in the partner companies of our partner schools and the schools\u2019 practicing bases to improve their vocational skills and competences\r\n\r\nThe activities of the Project are implemented during 2 years, 2015-2017.

The Course follows a successful Short Course in 2015 in Burg Stargard where 10 young facilitators from Robert Bosch College, a United World College in Freiburg, shaped the program and decided to build on that empowering experience and launch the 4th German Short Course to be held at the college, and in the city that is a sustainability leader in Germany. The Course aims to look at various dimensions of sustainability (mainly environmental, social and economical) and bring young people from Europe and its neighborhood together to debate the SDGs and take action based on them, both during the course and afterwards in their home communities. Beyond environmental sustainability, the program will consider ways of building sustainable diverse societies, which also means finding ways of dealing with migration and particularly the current refugee streams.

We aim to support the participants in forming their own projects and hope that as a result of the course, many small projects will take place across Europe. Based on past feedback, another important result is the appreciation of diversity and reduction of stereotypes that invariably occurs when young people forge, sometimes life-long, friendships with people from at least 12 different countries. This will contribute to a better understanding of different people and cultures, which is essential to the peaceful functioning of Europe.

On the basis of this valuable experience, the school expanded its international ventures into Western Europe in 2012 with an application to the Leonardo da Vinci Programme. The exceptional experience and the remarkable results gained by these projects were a motivating force in the pursuit to become involved with even more excellent projects. Therefore, the BSZ was taking part in the newly launched Erasmus Plus Programme in 2014 and 2015. Due to the great success of these two projects, the Erasmus Plus Learning Mobility has to be continued in an optimized way. As a consequence, the BSZ is sending selected students, mainly from the areas of wholesale, office administration, industry, banking, insurance and logistics, to a three-week education and vocational training programme at the College of Central London (CCL) in London. In two flows, each with 25 participants, students will not only improve their language skills and broaden their intercultural competence, but they will also increase their knowledge primarily in topics such as international trade and logistics. These are topics which our students encounter through various approaches depending on his or her occupation (e.g. letter of credit). The courses are held in classrooms at the CCL.  Furthermore on-location training at selected firms and institutions involved in international trade guarantees a high level of practical experience. The planned dates for the courses and training are in October 2016 (flow 1) and in October 2017 (flow2). The students participating in the project will be chosen on part of the BSZ by the specialist advisor for international projects in accordance with the associated department managers and colleagues and the respective apprenticing companies. All participants are currently working in a two to three-year commercial apprenticeship position.  A great need for such projects exists, since industry and commerce increasingly operate on a global level and vocational training must adjust to these developments. The training companies have acknowledged this fact and view, as the BSZ also does, such training programmes as a valuable addition to the dual system practiced in Germany.The courses at the CCL have the following goals:1. Students recognize how relevant their daily efforts at work and in school are with consideration to our increasingly globalised world.2. Synergistic effects applying to all occupations appear.3. Students enhance not only language skills but also shape up their personality. They are able to use this experience in their companies as well as in our society in a positive way. 4. As well-trained apprentices in Europe, the task of meeting the demands of globalisation can certainly be achieved.As a result the opportunities for the participants are not only greater in their own company but also in the European job market. Employers benefit from the enhanced competence of their apprentices and employees. Schools and companies treat each other more as partners and grow aware of the opportunities made available by working together in such a complex manner.

These interconnected global challenges call for far-reaching changes in how we think and act for the dignity of fellow human beings. It is not enough for education to produce individuals who can read, write and count. Education must be transformative and bring shared values to life. It must cultivate an active care for the world and for those with whom we share it. Education must also be relevant in answering the big questions of the day. Technological solutions, political regulation or financial instruments alone cannot achieve sustainable development. It requires transforming the way people think and act. Education must fully assume its central role in helping people to forge more just, peaceful, tolerant and inclusive societies. It must give people the understanding, skills and values they need to cooperate in resolving the interconnected challenges of the 21st century.  In last years the public debate and discourse as well as the policies in different countries leaded to youth work field and especially youth workers to be more aware and engaged in development and global topics (climate change, sustainable development and life style, responsible consumption, etc.). These topics are often in various contexts on the public agenda and civil society is engaged in having a say in it. However there is a large group of youth workers whom themselves although aware and concerned about these topics are lacking competencies in how to engage and reach young people in their communities on these issues.\r\n\r\nAIM & OBJECTIVES\r\nThe project aims to increase the quality of youth work by equipping youth workers with tools and advanced competencies in global education.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this aim the project sets of group of specific objectives:\r\nOb1: Provide a space to the participants for sharing best practices in the field of youth work regarding global issues\r\nOb2: Increase the knowledge level of the participants in sustainable development and global topics\r\nOb3: Increase the knowledge level of the participants in global education methodologies (theory, concepts, steps, philosophy);\r\nOb4: Increase practical facilitation skills of participants for global education;\r\nOb5: Develop participants practical skills to design and implement global education activities and workshops.\r\n\r\nThe participants will be involved in different sessions through the methodology of non-formal education such as simulations, role playing, open space discussions, brainstorming, ice-breakers and reflection groups. By using non-formal education methods the team of trainers will facilitate the development of  practical skills of the participants to design and implement global education activities and workshops..\r\n\r\nThe development of such competencies will be helpful for youth workers/ leaders to stimulate and engage youngsters from their local communities with the global challenges. As a result, the participants of the project will strengthen their capacity to become better citizens and global educators and will be able to organize local initiatives and/or activities to engage young people with global citizenship.", "http://www.eschange.org", null, "erasmus_2016-3-NO02-KA105-000840_9"], ["3HQ", "UWC Short Course \"Building a sustainable future\"", "Community and Diversity", 26706.0, "The UWC Short Course \u201cBuilding a Sustainable Future\u201d is planned against the backdrop of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which came into action in 2016 and give an impetus to rethink economic and social development across all countries - including Europe. This course is inspired by these goals and wants to support their realization by engaging European youth around them. The course follows a successful Short Course in 2016 in Freiburg where 12 young facilitators from Robert Bosch College, a United World College in Freiburg, shaped the program and decided to build on that empowering experience by launching the 4th German Short Course, continuing the work in the city that is a sustainability leader in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Course aims to look at various dimensions of sustainability (mainly environmental, social and economic) and bring young people from Europe and its neighborhood together to debate the SDGs and take action based on them, both during the course and afterwards in their home communities. Beyond environmental sustainability, the program will consider ways of building sustainable diverse societies, which also means finding ways of dealing with migration and particularly the current refugee streams. Moreover, the mission of UWC - to make education a force for peace - will be a guiding principle when thinking about how sustainable development can lead to sustainable peace. Being situated at the border between France and Germany, the project wants to contribute towards successful conflict transformation by exploring that example and bringing together countries, such as Serbia and Croatia, that experienced more recent tensions. Overall, we aim to use the SDGs to enable participants to think of the changes they want to see in their societies, and to empower them to take action in the areas they deem most relevant.\r\n\r\nThe course is taking place in July 2017, with 60 participants from 12 partner countries all over the European region. The 16-18 year old participants will be selected according to their interest in the topics and willingness to experience such a diverse group of people and challenging program. The selection aims to create a deliberate diversity, both in terms of ethnicity but also in terms of social class and to this end the project collaborates with Teach for All organizations during participant selection.\r\nDuring the course, participants get to experience and discuss issues linked to sustainability in non-formal learning settings, including interactive workshops, self-led research and advocacy projects, role plays, debates and guided reflection activities. Moreover, the program will include lectures by guest speakers and experts in their fields, as well as excursions to visit European Institutions as well as local civil society initiatives. This all aims to cater to different learning needs and has been proven to lead to good results.\r\n\r\nAs impact assessment is important for continuous development, a comprehensive evaluation system has been developed, which includes a detailed evaluation by the participants as well as by the coordinating team. This generates crucial learnings for next projects, and facilitates the knowledge and capacity transfer to future teams, on which this project is already built. To trace medium term impact, the project stays in touch with participants through social media and records projects that arise out of short courses. A future goal is to assess this long term impact in a more systematic manner.\r\n\r\nThe envisioned results include that the participants gain a better understanding of the challenges faced in the field of sustainable development in the European region and also that they feel inspired and empowered to tackle these challenges. We aim to support the participants in forming their own projects and hope that as a result of the course, many small projects will take place across Europe. Based on past feedback, another important result is the appreciation of diversity and reduction of stereotypes that invariably occurs when young people forge, sometimes life-long, friendships with people from at least 12 different countries. This will contribute to a better understanding of different people and cultures, which is essential to the flourishing of Europe.\r\n\r\nThrough interaction with the local community and coverage of the program in local as well as internationally accessible media (e.g. newspapers and blog), the Course will have a broader impact on many people who will be inspired by the project and may also decide to take action based on their encounters with the participants and/or the course through media.

In particular teachers find it hard to provide for the more able linguists within their classes and to ensure that their lessons are differentiated for all learners.\r\n\r\nOur key objective in undertaking this project increase our teachers and teaching assistants skills so that they are able to deliver the French curriculum across the school. Six staff members will participate in this project. They have been chosen by the MFL leader based on her knowledge of individual teachers; their linguistic skills, motivation to develop their skills and their middle leadership role within the school. The Senior leadership team has overseen the selection process.\r\n\r\nThe project will run over the course of one year with two mobilities of 5 days each. Our LA advisor has recommended a language certified school in Antibes, France based on the positive learning experiences of other teachers within the borough. Participants will take part fully in daily French targeted to their prior levels of attainment. Additionally, time will be taken to become familiar with the region and local customs. Participating staff will attend preparatory twilight French lessons, delivered by the borough Advisory Teacher before the first mobility. After the language course in Antibes teachers will put into place their new learning with their own classes when delivering the MFL Primary Curriculum. The school MFL leader will work alongside the LA MFL advisor to set up an e-twinning profile. She will use links established whilst on the language course find a partner school in France  with whom to work on a project beginning January 2019. \r\n\r\nThe project will have a significant impact on our French curriculum . Teachers will be inspired and motivated by their learning. This enthusiasm will be contagious and result in high pupil engagement. Teachers will discuss their experiences of learning a language with pupils which will result in a whole school ethos which actively promotes life-long learning.

At Thomas Buxton, we have been teaching Spanish to KS2 children for five years through a native-speaker tutor who visits the school once a week. Our aim is to develop Spanish so that class teachers have the confidence and basic linguistic knowledge to incorporate Spanish in everyday school life and across the curriculum.  \r\n\r\n* At the moment, we take part in a Spanish Buzz Day where every class is immersed into all things Spanish. This has helped to raise the profile of Spanish but we aim to take this further but developing the language skills of our staff feel more confident to develop their knowledge and skills in this area.  \r\n\r\n* By 2020, Thomas Buxton aims to ensure that we are in a position where every teacher is trained to deliver the Spanish curriculum with the correct pronunciation and with confidence.  KS1 and EYFS teacher and support staff need training to carry out their role in the classroom. This will help create links to other parts of the curriculum and have a direct impact on the planning and teaching of Spanish. Currently Spanish is taught in KS2 but this will be introduced to KS1 and the EYFS in September 2018.\r\n\r\n* The currently linguistic capacity of teachers is variable across the school. From a language skills and confidence audit, it is clear there is need to develop skills and knowledge in this area. There are no native speakers of Spanish and taking part in this project will greatly enhance the role of Spanish in our school community.  \r\n\r\n* The focus of our two year project is to send 8 of our staff, (7 teaching staff and 1 support staff) to complete linguistic training in Spain to develop their knowledge and understand of Spanish. We will send 8 staff members in 2018-19. We will send 8 different staff members in 2019-20 to ensure the maximum impact across all our staff.\r\n\r\n* Our current school development plan includes strengthening global links and citizenship ensuring that children respect other cultures and religions. Presently, we have been E-twinning with other schools in the UK to facilitate understanding and cooperate between different communities. In the Spring 2019 term, the school\u2019s aim is to take part in an E-twinning projects which will strengthen our schools links with schools in Spain. Taking part in the ERASMUS programme will help our school to make links with schools in Spain and give us opportunities to extend E-twinning with schools in Spain.\r\n\r\n* The impact of this will empower staff members to play an active role in the pupils\u2019 language education. The quality of teaching will improve and promote a positive international culture in the classroom.
