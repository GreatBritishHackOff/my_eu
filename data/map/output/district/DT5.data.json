This will require significant investment in new pipelines to bring the resource onshore. 10,000km of pipelines form part of the oil & gas infrastructure in the North Sea. Combined with the huge growth in the installation of offshore wind farms & telecommunication networks, many thousands of kilometres of newly installed subsea cables & pipelines (CPs) will be required. It is critical that such underwater infrastructure is properly managed over its lifetime to ensure proper laying, inspection, quality maintenance, quick repair and comprehensive decommissioning.\n\nExisting state-of-the-art cannot currently provide a complete lifecycle solution. The SonaTag project will develop a novel low-cost position, location & identification passive underwater tag and a custom designed sonar system designed to \u2018see\u2019 the tags. SonaTag will offer CP laying contractors a means to greatly reduce the cost of CP laying operations, thereby ensuring its initial adoption in the market. Downstream stakeholders such as IMR (Inspection Maintenance and Repair) crews and governments will have the means to locate and uniquely identify these vital assets.\n\nThe system will provide a robust environmentally sound solution for longterm lifecycle tagging by achieving the following objectives: specialised sonar with transmit power adequate for deployment (220 dB) at transmit end to achieve operational accuracy of \\/- 0.1m @ 10m to 1000m range; the ability to detect range & position of tag in 5secs @ 1000m and 2 secs @ 10m from sonar transceiver; inert tag device with detectability in high noise environments i.e. seabed.\n\nUsing this solution the project expects to comprehensively address the problem of unmanaged critical underwater infrastructure & address the high operation costs of laying CPs. In doing so, we will deliver \u20ac45 million in revenue with a profit of \u20ac9.3 million to the SME partners after 5 years, while creating over 100 high skill jobs.", 356070.0, 1277113.0, "SONATAG", null, null, null, null, "http://www.cesalt.co.uk", null, "fp7_110740_952404977"], ["1DX", "STREAM - Sonar Technology for Remote Environmental Monitoring", "Subsea Asset Location Technologies Limited", "Oil and gas is continuously leaking from offshore deepwater infrastructure. Up to 1 million tonnes of oil are lost from deepwater drilling leaks each year, with 601 oil and gas releases reported in the North Sea in 2015 alone, up 14.5% on the previous years. Current leak detection technologies suffer from high false positives, high cost, lack of continuous monitoring and safety risks, meaning the majority of leaks are not detected by equipment. To address this major environmental and economic problem, we have developed STREAM, a unique technology which uses subtle changes in the speed of sound to detect contaminants in seawater. We have recently completed a funded project to technically prove our concept at TRL6.\n \nSALT has a proven track record of successfully commercialising highly innovative technologies such as our award-winning SonarBell. We have also successfully led two European collaborative projects to exploit the SonarBell in different applications. Currently, we are in advanced discussions with Statoil and BP who have shown great interest in the STREAM technology. Crucially, we are in negotiations with Subsea7, a global tier 1 service provider, to include STREAM in their service offering. \n\nWe now need to validate the market opportunity and reduce commercial risk by running large scale trials and optimising our product performance. 5 years post-project, we will generate annual revenues of \u20ac31.8 million, \u20ac4.7 million in net profits, 282 jobs, representing an 8 x ROI to EC investment.
