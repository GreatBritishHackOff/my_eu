It aims to train the next generation of researchers to work in diverse teams, to cross disciplinary and sectoral boundaries and apply advanced communication and information technologies to work across many scales of time and space. Detailed project objectives are:\n1.  To provide scientific and professional development to a highly motivated group of early stage researchers (ESRs) to address a number of key interdisciplinary research issues of great importance to the future of transport industries.\n2.  To facilitate and support scientific and professional development of two experienced researchers (ERs) to enable them to become the research leaders in two challenging interdisciplinary research areas.\n3.  To disseminate the knowledge and products developed through scientific research to industry, policy makers and the wider academic community for maximum impact of the research.\n4.  To initiate a sustainable long-term research, training and educational collaboration between the partners involved.\nHere we propose the development of a training network that brings together some of the key active research groups in Europe, with a leading international reputation, in complementary areas relevant to the fields of tribochemistry and interface design. A number of leading industrial companies, comprising of SMEs and LEs, will engage in training and facilitate the Transfer of Knowledge (ToK) to and from the industrial partner through research programmes for 12 ESRs and 2 ERs.

New lubrication technologies will significantly increase engine efficiency and decrease emissions in automotive applications.", "Energy is one of the most important areas of research development in the 21st century as increasing human activities put increasing pressures on global climate and the environment. While renewable resources will form an important piece of the future energy puzzle, combustion will remain an important contributor for a long time to come, making improvements in combustion technologies an important contributor to a greener society.\n\nICEs include gasoline and diesel engines, gas turbine engines and even rocket propulsion systems. They are found in everything from cars to industrial machines to space shuttles. A large training network is focusing on development of a new generation of clean and energy-efficient engines with EU support of the http://www.enticeitn.eu/page/entice (ENTICE) (Engineering tribochemistry and interfaces with a focus on the internal combustion engine) project.\n\nTribological processes at interfaces in relative motion and the associated friction and wear are critical to efficient ICEs. These engines convert chemical energy in the bonds of fuel into mechanical work to move parts. Greener lubricants with improved performance will both eliminate harsh chemicals and additives while increasing energy efficiency, and thus reducing emissions. ENTICE is supporting 10 early-stage researchers (ESRs) and 2 experienced researchers, with 2 more ESRs currently being recruited.\n\nThe team is studying the physics associated with the tribochemistry of lubricated contacts. Development of both experimental, analytical and measurement techniques as well as models will aid understanding of processes. In parallel, scientists are investigating oil ageing (lubricant degradation) within the context of tribochemistry processes to develop better and greener lubricants. Experimental simulation of engine tribology systems will enable bench testing of improved systems for automotive engines.\n\nResearchers are taking advantage of numerous academic and industrial training courses complemented by teamwork and mentoring. The productive and enthusiastic collaboration is now leading to the first publications of results. The ENTICE training network is preparing a new generation of scientists to develop significantly more efficient ICEs for cars.

In many countries, water quality needs improvement in order to reduce health risks and resources for water production and distribution must be used more efficiently. The European Innovation Partnership on Water has established priority areas related to the challenges in water supply distribution networks, focusing on resource efficiency, Smart Water Management and decision support systems. Although the technology components for Smart Water Management are available, the route to application is still uncertain. The main hurdles are: lack of integrated and open solutions; difficulty to comply with user and integration requirements; lack of clear and validated business cases for solutions; lack of business intelligence awareness and lack of political and regulatory support.\nProject aims\n1) To integrate and demonstrate 12 innovative solutions\n2) To demonstrate 4 integrated solutions\n3) To establish and guard integration and standardisation aspects\n4) To establish business cases, deployment potential and market uptake routes\nSolution\nThis project will overcome the hurdles by developing and demonstrating in 4 important Smart Water Management themes (water quality management, leak management, energy optimization and customer interaction).  12 innovative theme oriented solutions and 4 integrated (technological, financial, ICT, organisation, management) solutions will be demonstrated at 4  well-scaled and real-life demonstration sites in France, United Kingdom, Spain and The Netherlands.

Despite the significant progress made in AM, the surface roughness of parts produced by this method continues to be an issue.\nRough surface finish on AM parts causes wear, corrosion and fatigue, micro-cracks, poor tolerances, and is aesthetically displeasing. These negative characteristics often outweigh the positive ones of unlimited complexity of shapes and weight reduction benefits.  Post-processing finishing methods exist for reducing roughness, but these can be costly and have limited effectiveness, particularly in relation to complex, high surface roughness components. As a result, the application of AM parts in industry is being constricted, particularly in the aerospace and medical industries, where the surface finish of components is highly critical.\nWe have developed PALMS (Plasma Additive Layer Manufacture Smoothing), an innovative cost-effective macro-polishing solution based on novel electrochemical plasma technology. The macro finish (10-50\u00b5m) AM parts are rapidly treated in a highly controlled manner in less than 20 minutes, leaving a uniform, smooth micro-finish (<0.1\u00b5m), resulting in considerably improved aesthetics and mechanical performance. \nOur participation in the FTI programme, will allow us to accelerate the commercialisation process for the PALMS TRL6 technology and undertake innovation from the demonstration stage through to market uptake within 32 months after project start.
