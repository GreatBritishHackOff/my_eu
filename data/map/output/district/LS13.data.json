Parents are more and more demanding nowadays and this is why we care for creating a very good school based on modern methods of work. We focus on pre-school education because we see the parents' awareness and their expectations for good quality of teaching. In order to bring changes and pedagogical innovations we want to show teachers, headmasters and local authorities involved in education new models of teaching through mobilities and visits in the other country. Our main purpose is to learn about innovative educational methods of work and school management. We hope that through mobilities we will change the way of thinking of our authorities involved in education, they will not be afraid of changes, implement new solutions into their work, teachers will improve their language competence to be used in class with children. We would like our teachers to use some basic English at work with the children. Now they are not ready to do this. Our kindergartens in the commune have already had some experience in international cooperation so we found our partners easily. We've decided to choose the English kindergarten because we think that the British model of education is very good and we would like to implement some of their ideas in our system. We would like to copy their good practice and use them in our schools. Exchange of ideas and pedagogical experience will definitely bring good results for our school which will improve quality of teaching, get European dimension. During the project we want to organise one visit to the partner kindergarten in England, our teachers will spend 5 working days in the school in Leeds. They will work according to the plan and schedule which will be arranged  and agreed by both partner schools. The main purpose of the visit in the school will be to know as well as possible the partner institution, its system of work, exchange pedagogical experience, learn from each other. The Polish teachers will take part in activities in the partner school in the morning and in the afternoon, every day so that they can know the partner institution well.", "http://www.valleyviewschool-pri.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-PL01-KA101-000379_1"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["3JT", "Leeds West CLLD", "Barca-Leeds", "West Leeds CLLD will:\n\u2022 Consult with local people\n\u2022 consult with the statutory, voluntary and business sectors to understand their needs and issues \nWe will establish an effective Local Action Group that will provide a funding and coordination function fo", "ERDF", 4404.0, 7842.0, "erdf_england_354"], ["3JT", "Leeds West CLLD", "Barca-Leeds", "The project will focus upon the Inner-West areas of Leeds within the areas of highest deprivation.
