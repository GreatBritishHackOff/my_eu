This will benefit farmers through the entrepreneurial opportunity it provides them to provide a more professional service for economic benefit.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for the SoEngage project is that family farms represent an important resource to maintain and improve the social, economic and cultural sustainability of rural areas. \r\n\r\nThe overall objective is to support farmers to engage in Social Farming by developing their knowledge, skills and competences through training to consider, plan and deliver a professional Social Farm service for the economic benefit and sustainability of the farm and the rural community.\r\n\r\nSocial Farming, also known as Care Farming or Farming for Health is an innovative multifunctional activity which offers farmers the opportunity to use their agricultural expertise and resources to promote therapy, rehabilitation, social inclusion, education and social services for entrepreneurial and economic benefit. The farm remains a working farm where people who need care support can benefit from participation in farm activities in a non-clinical environment.\r\n\r\nThe quality of a Social Farming service depends on the expertise and training of the farmers engaged in its delivery. \r\n\r\nThe partners of the SoEngage project represent 6 regions (UK, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Romania, Spain) and provide a range of training and support for farmers and have identified the gap in information and training on social farming which enables farmers to make informed decisions on whether or not this innovative entrepreneurial activity is suitable for them and the farm family.\r\n\r\nThis gap can be addressed by collaborating to harness the competent mix of expertise and materials that exist between the partners to produce training that brings resources together to create a comprehensive set of digital and online resources. \r\n\r\nThe innovative approach is that unlike existing training, which is delivered on-site and restricted by availability of trainers and financial resources, SoEngage training will make training convenient for farmers to complete by using digital and online platforms for accessible self-learning. Such online learning is not currently available in the partner countries. \r\n\r\nThe partners will share each of their expertise on design and implementation of social farm training; identify and use real life best practice case studies of social farms across the partnership to encompass the different methods, practices, procedures and structures to develop the training and professionalism of farmers delivering social farm services.\r\n\r\nThe training will be delivered to over 300 trainees who will be involved in the testing of the training materials from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe SoEngage training will be available in the 5 languages of the partners (English, German, Polish, Spanish and Romanian) and available as an OER which can be shared across the EU where Social Farming is less developed. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the development of these new technologies with easily accessible onlne and digital platforms the training can be easily shared across Europe to engage and upskill farmers in social farming. This will benefit farmers through the entrepreneurial opportunity it provides them, the people who avail of social farm services by providing more professional services and the wider rural community through the social, economic and cultural sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe partners are grateful to the European Union through Erasmus+ funding for the opportunity to engage farmers with social farming.", "http://www.ruralsuport.org.uk", "The Rural Centre", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA202-047975_1"]]}}, "9AR": {"cordis": {"data": [[1320105600000, 1367280000000, "Electronic paper message board for outdoor use \nwith carbon NanoBud display module and GPRS I/O layer", "Fsl Electronics Limited", "'The general objective of the \u201cElectronic paper message board for outdoor use with carbon NanoBud display module and GPRS I/O layer\u201d (E-SIGNAGE) project is to develop a large area, low-cost, high brightness and contrast level, robust, energy efficient (bi-stable; no backlight needed), high information content two-colour electronic outdoor message board that is able to receive data via GSM communication and uses solar energy as a power source.\n\nTwist-ball e-paper material developed by Invent Research O\u00dc (coordinator; SME, Estonia) has the principle capabilities to meet all the quality requirements set by the end-users for active front-plane layers of outdoor electronic signage and message boards (OEMBs). It is potentially highly robust and flexible, has high bi-stability, wide operating temperatures and low production costs. In addition the material is video capable that widens the usage areas of OEMBs. Carbon nanomaterials (Carbon nanotubes and NanoBuds\u2122) developed by Canatu (partner; SME, Finland) have the principle capabilities to meet all the quality requirement set by end-users for the transparent electrode front-plane layers and thin film transistor backplane layers of OEMBs.

Moreover, Canatu\u2019s Direct Dry Printing technology allows low cost, high volume production.\n\nFurther development of Invent Research\u2019s and Canatu\u2019s materials in combination with the existing OEMB components will enable the partners of the proposal to develop autonomous and good picture quality OEMB applications.
