It is potentially highly robust and flexible, has high bi-stability, wide operating temperatures and low production costs. In addition the material is video capable that widens the usage areas of OEMBs. Carbon nanomaterials (Carbon nanotubes and NanoBuds\u2122) developed by Canatu (partner; SME, Finland) have the principle capabilities to meet all the quality requirement set by end-users for the transparent electrode front-plane layers and thin film transistor backplane layers of OEMBs. Canatu\u2019s nanocarbon films are highly robust and flexible, have high carrier mobility, on-off ratios and exceptional optical properties such as high transparency, colour neutrality and excellent index matching. Moreover, Canatu\u2019s Direct Dry Printing technology allows low cost, high volume production.\n\nFurther development of Invent Research\u2019s and Canatu\u2019s materials in combination with the existing OEMB components will enable the partners of the proposal to develop autonomous and good picture quality OEMB applications. It would be necessary to develop the quality characteristics (brightness and contrast level, resolution, stability in time and in UV light) of the e-paper material (front-plane) for using in OEMBs; develop carbon nanomaterials based front-plane electrodes and backplane transistors; integrate the front-planes/backplanes with other OEMB components; and develop the necessary software.'", 22323.0, 1236592.0, "E-SIGNAGE", "Novel electronic paper technology", "EU-funded scientists' unveiled technology for outdoor electronic signage and message boards with wireless data connection and solar panels.", "Conventional outdoor electronic message boards (OEMBs) create high-quality pictures based on different technologies such as light-emitting diode display, liquid-crystal display or plasma display panel. However, such flat panel technologies are very power consuming, which hinder electrically autonomous OEMB development.  \n\nIn the EU-funded project http://esignage-project.eu/ (E-SIGNAGE) , scientists developed large-area display technology with solar panels for power autonomy and integrated software.  \n\nThe devices were based on the wireless global system for mobile communications (GSM) technology. The unique bi-stable reflective electronic display technology provide paper-like images. The electronics for the reflective display was optimised for energy efficiency and a solar cell system was used for locations without access to power networks.  \n\nProject approach was based on an electrophoretic display active layer. Based on this, each pixel consists of microscopic capsules that contain black and white particles moving in opposite directions under the electric field influence. Carbon nanomaterials and nanobuds were used in the front-layer and back-layer electronics. Scientists managed to double the transparent conductive film conductivity in the front-plane layer and quadrupled nanobud production rate. Regarding the back-plane OEMB layer, the team demonstrated enhanced semiconducting carbon nanomaterial synthesis and a working flexible thin-film transistor.  \n\nThe display controller unit software that displays text, still and moving images was tested successfully. The software also enabled low-power consumption and had an auto-update mechanism. Several demonstrators were developed and tested onsite.  \n\nProduction costs were low with inexpensive materials and use of commercially available manufacturer components. These robust devices can withstand temperature and ultraviolet light for a long service life and comes with video capability.  \n\nE-SIGNAGE has produced outdoor display technology that is expected to find application in a huge global market.", null, "http://www.fslelectronics.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/146961.jpg", "fp7_101016_964920402"], ["9DG", "REuse and REcycling of CDW materials and structures in energy efficient pREfabricated elements for building REfurbishment and construction", "Cde Global Limited", "The overall goal of the RE4-Project is to promote new technological solutions for the design and development of structural and non-structural pre-fabricated elements with high degree of recycled materials and reused structures from partial or total demolition of buildings.

The RE4-Project targets the demonstration of suitable design concepts and building elements produced from CDW in an industrial environment, considering perspective issues for the market uptake of the developed solutions.
