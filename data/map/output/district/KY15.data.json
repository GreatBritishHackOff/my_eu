Part of this concept is to initiate the development towards an innovative, resource efficient and bio-based (bio-economy) European economy. Such development should contribute to economic growth and the creation of jobs, while mitigating climate change effects and providing effective responses to address the need for carbon neutral energy. In this context, European forests and the forest-based sector play an increasingly important role in fostering smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in Europe based on the production of eco-services and eco-efficient products from wood and non-wood-based products. Up to now the forest-based sector has been mainly build around wood based products. However, also multipurpose trees and non-wood forest products and services can significantly contribute to the achievement of the set goals. The objective of the STAR TREE project is to provide better understanding, knowledge, guidance and tools to support relevant stakeholders (e.g., forest owners, resource managers, enterprises, decision makers, other public and private entities) in optimising the management of multi-purpose trees and developing innovative approaches for increasing the marketability and profitability of NWFP for a more competitive rural economy. The overall impacts of the project are in the long term to support a sustainable rural development through a stronger utilisation of business opportunities based on non-wood forest products and multipurpose trees.

In addition to researching potential markets, they are establishing partnerships between research organisations and small and medium-sized enterprises to develop innovative new products, processes and successful marketing strategies to increase their competitiveness.\n\nBy evaluating regional case studies, consulting with foresters and engaging with stakeholders to understand their needs, STAR TREE aims to streamline the research-to-market forestry value chain. Their guidelines for managing forest trees and providing wood and NWFPs in a range of European environments are informed by models, and are complemented by support material on NWFP markets, regional policies, and innovation strategies.\n\nDiversifying the traditional forestry industry to include both wood and non-wood products will aid the EU objective of basing its economy on sustainable, resource-efficient growth.

The foreign travel opportunity is aimed at developing a range of specific job related competencies whilst promoting good behaviours and allowing for the natural improvement of interpersonal skills such as communication, friendliness, optimism and confidence among our participants. All of which increase the likelihood of employment prospects for our learners.\r\n\r\nAMsportstours provide many college students who are studying Higher National certificate (HNC) and Higher National Diploma (HND) in local colleges work experience coaching activities as part of developing their own skills and satisfying criteria of their respective course qualifications. It is from this that we recognised a real need for young people to be subject to a foreign travel experience to help further enhance not only their coaching skills but just as importantly their social skills. We understand through our work in different countries the challenges that need to be presented to stimulate development and this environment simply could not be created in Scotland. An idea that was very achievable for AMsportstours to develop through our expertise in both delivering and managing custom built travel experiences combined with our provision of work placement activities for students in the local area. \r\n\r\nOur target group for the project are students across local colleges who are all completing work experience with AMsportstours and our sports coaching programmes in the local area as part of their own personal development and course requirements. In total we will provide work experience opportunities for 200 students, the students will be a mixture of males and females aged from 16 - 32 years old. We will engage each respective college where the students are studying and involve them in the selection process. This is important as we aim to create a good system in recruiting the most committed students who will clearly be influenced more by the learning outcomes of the project. \r\n\r\nThe planned activities will consist of the participants following the working day of a professional coach from our host partners, whilst taking on more and more responsibility as the placement progresses. This is done on an individual basis as some participants who are more experienced are ready for the next challenge whereas other participants who are less experienced take extra time to build their confidence before this transition and this is how we can ensure that the placement is relevant and valuable to the specific training needs of each individual. The activities include the planning, delivery and evaluation of coaching sessions and participants will work alongside their designated mentor coach from the host partner. They will begin by following the working day of their mentor coach, which will entail getting up at 7am to prepare and travel to session venue, set up, deliver and then evaluate lessons learned. The participants will also attend workshops each day provided by our host partner on various elements of coaching, such as communication, methods and session development.  Activities during days off on placement are important to ehance cultural awareness, participants are given freedom to explore the city using public transport methods. We will arrange social activities for the participants to engage with the natives through friendly sport matches in football, basketball and Rugby.\r\n\r\nWe envisage the the project will increase the employment opportunities for the participants as they gain valuable coaching experience and also develop their own personality and character. In addition to this the recognition the participants are awarded from completion of the project can support their bid to stand out from the crowd when moving towards their next steps in further education or employment. \r\n\r\nThe more established we become in delivering mobilities and exploiting the results the more opportunities that will arise. Reaching a large and particular audience with positive outcomes about our learners will naturally lead to recognition of our mobility project and its objectives at national and international levels.
