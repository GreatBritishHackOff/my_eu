Part of this concept is to initiate the development towards an innovative, resource efficient and bio-based (bio-economy) European economy. Such development should contribute to economic growth and the creation of jobs, while mitigating climate change effects and providing effective responses to address the need for carbon neutral energy. In this context, European forests and the forest-based sector play an increasingly important role in fostering smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in Europe based on the production of eco-services and eco-efficient products from wood and non-wood-based products. Up to now the forest-based sector has been mainly build around wood based products. However, also multipurpose trees and non-wood forest products and services can significantly contribute to the achievement of the set goals. The objective of the STAR TREE project is to provide better understanding, knowledge, guidance and tools to support relevant stakeholders (e.g., forest owners, resource managers, enterprises, decision makers, other public and private entities) in optimising the management of multi-purpose trees and developing innovative approaches for increasing the marketability and profitability of NWFP for a more competitive rural economy. The overall impacts of the project are in the long term to support a sustainable rural development through a stronger utilisation of business opportunities based on non-wood forest products and multipurpose trees.

Such products, along with the berries, mushrooms and aromatic medicinal and edible plants that grow on the forest floor, have the potential to create jobs and improve rural economies.\n\nAs such, the EU-funded \u2018Multipurpose trees and non-wood forest products a challenge and opportunity\u2019 (http://www.star-tree.eu/ (STAR TREE)) project aims to provide better knowledge and tools to increase the marketability and profitability of NWFPs for a more competitive rural economy.\n\nTo unlock the potential of NWFPs, project partners will work with forest owners, resource managers and other public/private entities to develop methods for better management and broader use of multipurpose trees and NWFPs. In addition to researching potential markets, they are establishing partnerships between research organisations and small and medium-sized enterprises to develop innovative new products, processes and successful marketing strategies to increase their competitiveness.\n\nBy evaluating regional case studies, consulting with foresters and engaging with stakeholders to understand their needs, STAR TREE aims to streamline the research-to-market forestry value chain. Their guidelines for managing forest trees and providing wood and NWFPs in a range of European environments are informed by models, and are complemented by support material on NWFP markets, regional policies, and innovation strategies.\n\nDiversifying the traditional forestry industry to include both wood and non-wood products will aid the EU objective of basing its economy on sustainable, resource-efficient growth.
