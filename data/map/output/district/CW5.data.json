The newly developed low-fat cheese will be suitable for use in pizzas, ready meals, fast food, sandwiches and salads. Our primary target markets are the industrial cheese sector for chilled and frozen pizzas and ready meals. We will also target the retail and foodservices sectors.\n\nWe propose to develop a Mozzarella-type cheese with <3% fat which is a significant improvement on the currently available 5% fat cheese. Reduced (12% fat) and lower fat content Mozzarella-type cheese are currently available on the market but with very poor qualities of flavour, texture and melting, widely prevents them from consumer acceptance. Therefore we will introduce new innovative starter cultures for improving the flavour and texture of low-fat Mozzarella-type cheeses and optimize appropriate processing conditions of temperature, pH, milk fat and casein-to-fat ratio in the milk. Furthermore, we will develop an innovative oil coating process for improving the meltdown of the low-fat cheese after it is shredded in the meal in preparation. Based on the scientific findings of the coating process, we will then develop an oil coating device which will successfully coat cheese shreds.\n\nWe will enhance our knowledge of starter cultures and oil coating of cheese and hence provide the end consumer with a cheese displaying desired texture, flavour and melting profiles. We strongly believe that our technology will help the European cheesemaking industry which is facing the threat of losing a significant proportion of its market  as  a result of European legislation which calls for limiting saturated and trans fat content both in cheese and cheese-based products.", 287645.0, 2056106.0, "CHEESECOAT", "Mozzarella goes low fat", "Reinventing and upgrading low-fat mozzarella-type cheese is set to enable cheese lovers to have their cake and eat it.", "Cheese-making in Europe is under threat with new EU legislation that calls for limiting fat content in cheeses. The industry is therefore looking at ways to decrease fat while maintaining taste, texture and melting ability of cheeses.\n\nThis is the aim of the EU-funded project http://www.cheesecoatproject.com/ (CHEESECOAT). The project is developing a mozzarella-type cheese with less than 3\u00a0% fat that would taste much better than low-fat varieties available on the market.\n\nTo achieve its aims, the project team is isolating novel starter cultures to enhance the texture and taste of low-fat mozzarella-like cheeses, improving processing stages related to acidity, milk-fat ratio, casein-to-fat ratio, melting factor and temperature. It is also creating an oil coating process of cheese shreds to improve the properties of the cheese without all the fat.\n\nThe initiative, which brings together 11 partners from several European countries, businesses and research centres, began by investigating the latest advances in low-fat cheese-making. It found that low-fat mozzarella improves with higher moisture content, less calcium and improved proteolysis, brought about by better starter cultures and processing. After screening 100 microbial cultures and culture combinations for proteolytic ability and other characteristics, the project team chose eight cultures that displayed better performance. These cultures were further developed with optimised growth media and scaled up before being tested in cheese-making.\n\nIn parallel, CHEESECOAT made significant progress in developing a promising fat-based emulsion coating, based on dairy-derived ingredients, to enhance melting behaviour of cheese, aiming to optimise its results in the future. In addition, a spray-coating equipment for in-line application of the coating on shredded cheese have been manufactured. So far, the results have been very good, paving the way for more research and for new mozzarella-type cheeses to hit the market.\n\nArmed with these developments and advances, the small and medium-sized businesses under the project are expected to increase their market competitiveness. Dieters, pizza fans, sandwich makers, health-conscious individuals and cheese lovers will undoubtedly welcome the new product.", "http://www.cheesecoatproject.com", "http://www.joseph-heler.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/149051.jpg", "fp7_101553_962328465"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5HZ", "Moving Classics Network For New Music", "CURATED PLACE LTD", 153643.0, "Moving Classics European Network for New Music (MClass) embraces the strong connection and long history shared between music and storytelling in the construction of identity beyond national borders. By enabling new ways of producing and presenting classical music inspired by literature and landscape the project will explore how stories and sounds have acted as the precursors to our rapidly shifting modern experiences of space and place - always traveling freely across political boundaries. Aiming to reinvigorate those traditional forms that shaped a European identity for a digital age the project will enable emergent composers selected from across Europe via the international network of Music Information Centres (present in 20 EU states) to work with professional-standard ensembles in Iceland, Norway and the UK through a series of production-based residencies. The project will develop 6 new contemporary classical works and performance formats inspired by regional musical, lliterary, poetic and artistic traditions, interpreted through the eyes of an outsider working in each host region. It will deliver a range of festivals, workshops, master-classes and debates alongside professional development meetings and an online resource for organisations involved. This will focus on the Network for New Music which enables production staff working with those composers and ensembles to develop knowledge networks to increase mobility, share audiences, strategise marketing, and develop opportunities across international borders in a sustainable fashion.Created with the intention of engaging modern audiences that may not have experienced contemporary classical music (believing it to be elitist, exclusive and demanding) the project will seek to reshape the perception of taught musicianship by showing its role in a shared European identity, embracing the emergent experience economy and moving the performance space from the concert hall to found spaces and the public realm.", "http://www.curatedplace.com", "CURATED PLACE LTD", "creative_552296-CREA-1-2014-1-UK-CULT-COOP1_coordinator"], ["5HZ", "European Light Expression Network", "CURATED PLACE LTD", 172632.0, "European Light Expression Network (ENLIGHT)will enable artists to develop new skills working with technicians and scientists to create a series of accessible, large-scale public realm works realised through international collaborations for international audiences.
