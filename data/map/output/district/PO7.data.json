This holds particularly true now that these technologies are rapidly being embedded in today's road vehicles. With this in mind, the EU-funded project 'Galileo receiver for mass market applications in the automotive area' (GAMMA-A) developed a cost-effective three-frequency GPS/Galileo receiver for more reliable positioning in cars.\n\nSuch a project is especially important in areas with low satellite signals affected by environmental elements or in built-up cities that hamper communication. Reliable satellite technology could eventually be used to avert or minimise accidents, intervening at critical moments to save lives. Against this backdrop, the project team worked on a receiver that finds its position very rapidly and maintains a strong hold on it even under challenging conditions.\n\nIn parallel, the team studied solutions for secure signal authentication and reduction of interference, enhancing responsiveness and safety requirements in a myriad of scenarios. It worked on cost reduction as well by integrating many receiver parts, and created a prototype supported by digital signal processing. Upon testing its prototype inside the car, the team observed an accuracy of 1\u00a0metre, which could become as little as 10\u00a0cm as even newer technology is integrated.\n\nThis bodes well for cutting-edge automotive applications such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). It also improves upon current navigation solutions, thanks as well to the development of a powerful new antenna for the GAMMA-A prototype and integration of leading semiconductor technology.

In this context, satellite positioning and navigation technologies available are being implemented in innovative personal navigation devices. But existing products and solutions based on GNSS fail because they lack accuracy and integrity, they don't provide a suitable and efficient man-machine interface adjusted to this user segment, or rely on costly infrastructures.ARGUS project focuses onto a satellite based navigation (GNSS/ EDAS) terminal for people with impaired visually capabilities, guiding them along pre-defined tracks (pre recorded or automatically calculated route), using specifically designed HMI such as acoustic and haptic signals. ARGUS project introduces the opportunity to develop an innovative guidance support system for visual impaired people based on the provision of a track perception to the end user through holophonic technologies. Neither research or patents, nor products, have solved the problem of providing a track line perception. Track perception would allow blind people to imagine the geometry of the path and walk along it. This will provide 'track navigation' instead the classical 'waypoint or route navigation' which is used for car navigation or people with all visual capabilities. This project focuses on visually impaired community which requires some modification to the traditional navigation guidance providing them personal inclusion and integration into daily life. Information collected by the users, will be gathered in a server supporting a social network where Argus users (and also any other user who could benefit from the data collected) could access web services delivering useful information that can increase safety or enhance the experience when performing outdoor activities.The user groups identified for ARGUS are visually impaired people, covering all levels of visual impairment, and also people working in environments with low visibility.

Roller transport limits and potentially prohibits fine detail treatment and reduces yield (to 10% in extreme cases) due to damage caused by contact with such rollers. Current technology employs long process tanks and slow speeds to minimise contact damage. In applications where contact is of less concern rollers still limit capability as the force required to turn them results stretching or breaking of the foil limiting foil type, thickness, and process residence times.\nFluid Foil will provide frictionless, non-contact, modular transportation and fluid delivery technologies that enable chemical processing of any feature size without risk of damage to the web. Extremely low re-wind tensions enable processing of thin delicate and porous materials. Web processing density of 30 meters of web per linier meter of system dramatically increases processing speeds and most importantly places no limit on web length. Modular control software will complete activities such as data logging and real time fault analysis.\nFluid Foil will have the capacity to accelerate innovation printed, organic & flexible electronics as well as enabling potential new markets to emerge (e.g. graphene, e-textiles and paper products). This will be achieved via the provision of low cost and adaptable machinery to fabricators, opening up chemical processing to SMEs. The commercial aim of the project is to limit the time-intensive work that goes into the customisation of machines and software and reduce the lead time and cost to the customer while increasing our output.Our goal for the overall project is to develop and build a suite of demonstrator modules which will help generate customer confidence and gain orders from early adopters before we go on to license the system.", 39196.0, 55994.0, "Fluid Foil", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_200617_924386333"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PO7"}
