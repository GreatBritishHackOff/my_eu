This holds particularly true now that these technologies are rapidly being embedded in today's road vehicles. With this in mind, the EU-funded project 'Galileo receiver for mass market applications in the automotive area' (GAMMA-A) developed a cost-effective three-frequency GPS/Galileo receiver for more reliable positioning in cars.\n\nSuch a project is especially important in areas with low satellite signals affected by environmental elements or in built-up cities that hamper communication. Reliable satellite technology could eventually be used to avert or minimise accidents, intervening at critical moments to save lives. Against this backdrop, the project team worked on a receiver that finds its position very rapidly and maintains a strong hold on it even under challenging conditions.\n\nIn parallel, the team studied solutions for secure signal authentication and reduction of interference, enhancing responsiveness and safety requirements in a myriad of scenarios. It worked on cost reduction as well by integrating many receiver parts, and created a prototype supported by digital signal processing. Upon testing its prototype inside the car, the team observed an accuracy of 1\u00a0metre, which could become as little as 10\u00a0cm as even newer technology is integrated.\n\nThis bodes well for cutting-edge automotive applications such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). It also improves upon current navigation solutions, thanks as well to the development of a powerful new antenna for the GAMMA-A prototype and integration of leading semiconductor technology.

Roller transport limits and potentially prohibits fine detail treatment and reduces yield (to 10% in extreme cases) due to damage caused by contact with such rollers. Current technology employs long process tanks and slow speeds to minimise contact damage. In applications where contact is of less concern rollers still limit capability as the force required to turn them results stretching or breaking of the foil limiting foil type, thickness, and process residence times.\nFluid Foil will provide frictionless, non-contact, modular transportation and fluid delivery technologies that enable chemical processing of any feature size without risk of damage to the web. Extremely low re-wind tensions enable processing of thin delicate and porous materials. Web processing density of 30 meters of web per linier meter of system dramatically increases processing speeds and most importantly places no limit on web length.
