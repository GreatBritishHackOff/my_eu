The increased numbers of cores is commonly regarded as a design challenge in the safety-critical area, as there are no established approaches to achieve certification.\nAt the same time there is an increased need for flexibility in the products in the safety-critical market. This need for flexibility puts new requirements on the customization and the upgradability of both the non-safety and safety-critical critical part. The difficulty with this is the large cost in both effort and money of the re-certification of the modified software, which means that companies cannot fully leverage the advantages of modular software system.\nRECOMP will provide reference designs and platform architectures together with the required design methods and tools for achieving cost-effective certification and re-certification of mixed-criticality, component based, multi-core systems. The aim of RECOMP is to define a European standard reference technology for mixed-criticality multi-core systems supported by the European tool vendors participating in RECOMP.\nThe RECOMP project will bring clear benefits in terms of cross-domain implementations of mixed-criticality systems in all domains addressed by project participants: automotive systems, aerospace systems, industrial control systems, lifts and transportation systems.\nRECOMP will thus provide solutions that will allow European industry to increase its market share in the growing market of mixed-criticality systems.", 57953.0, 20573192.0, "RECOMP", null, null, null, null, "http://www.highintegritysystems.com", null, "fp7_109070_988205931"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9EE", "STages Erasmus pour les Professeurs Stagiaires", "Bristol Bordeaux Partnership", 16164.0, "The ESPE - Graduate School of Education and Teacher Training of the University of Bordeaux delivers a 2-year Masters Course that prepares students for primary and secondary school teaching and professions connected to education. Inasmuch as international mobility has proven to be highly relevant for the acquisition of professional skills linked to education, and helps open the door for future teachers, and thereby their future pupils, to European and international exchanges, the ESPE uses its own funds to finance 2-week international training courses during the first year of the Masters course. The aim of the STEPS project is to develop this mobility via European financing for 33 students, in their second year of the course, who have passed the teaching examination and thus gained the status of trainee civil servant.  \r\nIn February-March, participants will undertake a two-week training course in a primary or secondary educational establishment in one of the following eight countries (UK, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Greece, Ireland, and Bulgaria). To the extent that participants are at the head of a class in France on a part-time basis, this course will be held over a period split between the school holidays and the work time of their schooling with the ESPE. Placements in educational establishments will be made by way of intermediary placement organizations (universities or higher schools of education, associations, etc.) with whom the ESPE has been working for a number of years.  \r\nThe international course experience will be fully integrated into the learners' curriculum. It will be prepared under the teaching course units of \"training course support\", \"digital educational project\", \"initiation to research\" and \"teaching in a foreign language\".  It will foster the work produced by students aimed at validating the second year of their Masters course.\r\nThe project should help to train new-generation teachers and educators who will be able to enhance their knowledge with teaching practices developed in other European countries. On a regional and local scale, it will strengthen already active bilateral cooperation programmes. On a national scale, it will provide the wherewithal to test a new form of mobility during students' initial training that could prove transposable to other ESPEs. On the European scale, it will help to boost pan-European education. Inasmuch as the beneficiaries are teachers starting out on their careers, the project will have a significant multiplier effect. By financing an international training placement for a student, there could potentially be over 1200 pupils (for a primary education teacher) and over 4,000 pupils (for secondary education) likely to benefit from greater European openness.", "http://www.bristolbordeaux.org/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036972_5"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["9DU", "TIMMUS LIMITED*", 14340.0, "Scientific and technical support for Union policies on a competitive basis (10.04.03)", "fts_2016_70200", 2016], ["9DU", "TIMMUS LIMITED*", 663.0, "Scientific and technical support for Union policies on a competitive basis (10.04.03)", "fts_2017_63072", 2017], ["9EE", "BRISTOL BORDEAUX PARTNERSHIP", 6542.0, "Europe for citizens \u2014 Strengthening remembrance and enhancing capacity for civic participation at the Union level (18.04.01.01)", "fts_2017_70914", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "BS41"}
