The increased numbers of cores is commonly regarded as a design challenge in the safety-critical area, as there are no established approaches to achieve certification.\nAt the same time there is an increased need for flexibility in the products in the safety-critical market. This need for flexibility puts new requirements on the customization and the upgradability of both the non-safety and safety-critical critical part. The difficulty with this is the large cost in both effort and money of the re-certification of the modified software, which means that companies cannot fully leverage the advantages of modular software system.\nRECOMP will provide reference designs and platform architectures together with the required design methods and tools for achieving cost-effective certification and re-certification of mixed-criticality, component based, multi-core systems. The aim of RECOMP is to define a European standard reference technology for mixed-criticality multi-core systems supported by the European tool vendors participating in RECOMP.\nThe RECOMP project will bring clear benefits in terms of cross-domain implementations of mixed-criticality systems in all domains addressed by project participants: automotive systems, aerospace systems, industrial control systems, lifts and transportation systems.\nRECOMP will thus provide solutions that will allow European industry to increase its market share in the growing market of mixed-criticality systems.", 57953.0, 20573192.0, "RECOMP", null, null, null, null, "http://www.highintegritysystems.com", null, "fp7_109070_988205931"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["9DU", "TIMMUS LIMITED*", 14340.0, "Scientific and technical support for Union policies on a competitive basis (10.04.03)", "fts_2016_70200", 2016], ["9DU", "TIMMUS LIMITED*", 663.0, "Scientific and technical support for Union policies on a competitive basis (10.04.03)", "fts_2017_63072", 2017], ["9EE", "BRISTOL BORDEAUX PARTNERSHIP", 6542.0, "Europe for citizens \u2014 Strengthening remembrance and enhancing capacity for civic participation at the Union level (18.04.01.01)", "fts_2017_70914", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "BS41"}
