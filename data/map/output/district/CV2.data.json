Airways disease costs the European Union in excess of \u20ac56 billion per annum. Current therapies are inadequate and we do not have sufficient tools to predict disease progression or response to current or future therapies. Our consortium, Airway Disease PRedicting Outcomes through Patient Specific Computational Modelling (AirPROM), brings together the exisiting clinical consortia (EvA FP7, U-BIOPRED IMI and BTS Severe Asthma), and expertise in physiology, radiology, image analysis, bioengineering, data harmonization, data security and ethics, computational modeling and systems biology. We shall develop an integrated multi-scale model building upon existing models. This airway model will be comprised of an integrated 'micro-scale' and 'macro-scale' airway model informed and validated by 'omic data and ex vivo models at the genome-transcriptome-cell-tissue scale and by CT and functional MRI imaging coupled to detailed physiology at the tissue-organ scale utilising Europe's largest airway disease cohort. Validation will be undertaken cross-sectionally, following interventions and after longitudinal follow-up to incorporate both spatial and temporal dimensions. AirPROM has a comprehensive data management platform and a well-developed ethico-legal framework. Critically, AirPROM has an extensive exploitation plan, involving at its inception and throughout its evolution those that will 'develop' and 'use' the technologies emerging from this project. AirPROM therefore will bridge the critical gaps in our clinical management of airways disease, by providing validated models to predict disease progression and response to treatment and the platform to translate these patient-specific tools, so as to pave the way to improved, personalised management of airways disease.", 705.0, 12552591.0, "AirPROM", null, null, null, "http://www.airprom.eu", null, null, "fp7_97980_998888444"], ["2DX", "Markers for emphysema versus airway disease in COPD", "University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire National Health Service Trust", "COPD is characterized by emphysema (destruction of the lung alveoli) and airway disease (inflammation and thickening of the bronchial wall) both of which lead to airway obstruction. These two features co-exist in most patients but some patients present with only emphysema (E) or only airway disease (A). The aim of the project is to identify markers specific to E and A of COPD. Our hypothesis is that the mechanisms leading to these pathologies are distinct with respect to the type of inflammatory response and in terms of genetic predisposition. The differential pathogenesis for emphysema (E) and inflammatory airway disease (A) entails that in the two forms of COPD are linked to different markers at the DNA, RNA and protein level. Using computer tomography (CT) scans  for selection of  patients with emphysema only and airway disease only, we will obtain material from lung (leukocytes, bronchial cells) and blood (leukocytes), and will analyse elements of gene expression (SNP array, transcriptome). Data analysis will be done for E versus A (EvA) and versus a control cohort leading to identification of markers linked specifically to either E or A.  These markers will be elements involved in a differential pathogenesis for the different disease processes in COPD. They can be used for diagnostic approaches and as therapeutic targets.", 161270.0, 3434197.0, "EVA", "Making inroads into pulmonary disease", "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ranks high on the global mortality list. It is characterised by emphysema and airway disease, both of which lead to airway obstruction.", "Although most chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients have both emphysema and airway disease, in some cases only one of the features is present. The 'Markers for emphysema versus airway disease in COPD' (EVA) project aims to identify markers linked specifically to emphysema and airway disease at the DNA, RNA and protein levels. The EU-funded project is working on the hypothesis that the processes leading to these pathologies can be differentiated with regard to inflammatory response and genetic predisposition.\n\nParticipating clinical centres have to date recruited some 180 cases and 170 healthy controls. Computer tomography (CT) scans are being used to select patients with either emphysema or airway disease. Image analysis will further define emphysema based on density of the lung tissue, and airway disease based on thickness of the airway wall. By plotting airway wall area against lung density, patients can be identified as having emphysema only or airway disease only.\n\nMaterial obtained from lungs and blood will be analysed for elements of gene expression. However, crucial analysis will be performed in a single batch at the end of the study, when all samples have been collected. At that point, DNA, RNA and protein data will be available for cases as well as controls. This will help EVA produce the results required to identify markers specifically associated with emphysema and airway disease sub-phenotypes.\n\nAs elements of the differential pathogenesis for the different disease processes in COPD, these markers will be extremely useful for diagnosing the sub-phenotypes. Such markers will also provide a basis for exploring targets for new therapeutic approaches to COPD. This will also afford greater opportunities to better manage the disease.", "http://www.eva-copd.eu/", null, "/docs/results/images/2011-08/45926.jpg", "fp7_87739_998888444"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["2DX", "R1A", "WALSGRAVE HOSPITAL"], ["2DX", "RKB", "UNIDENTIFIED HOSPITAL"], ["2DX", "RKB", "UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL (COVENTRY)"], ["2DX", "RLT", "COVENTRY & WARWICKS HOSPITAL FACILITIES"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CV2"}
