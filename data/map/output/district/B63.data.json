Many of these technologies are spearheaded by the contributions of Small and Medium Enterprise (SME).  There is a clear opportunity to revolutionize space technologies by leveraging advancement in the commercial electronics market.  However, despite the obvious benefits to the space industry, it remains difficult for SMEs to get involved due to the significant cost, effort, time, and paper work to qualify parts for space applications.  A trend toward smaller and cheaper satellites allows for a novel approach to space qualification and testing.  Nanosatellites (between 1kg and 10kg) can be launched at a relatively low cost as piggy back payloads for larger satellite missions.  Since the cost of failure is an order of magnitude lower than conventional satellites, nanosatellites offer an ideal platform for high risk demonstration missions.\n\nThe aim of this project is to flight qualify a wide range of SME payloads in a 3U 3kg nanosatellite platform operating at a 700km orbit.  The primary purpose of this spacecraft is as a technology demonstrator.  Each SME in the consortium will be responsible for contributing a particular spacecraft subsystem.  The University of Surrey will integrate these systems into the nanosatellite platform, and will also be responsible for the ADCS and CMGs of the satellite.  ISIS will oversee the launch opportunity and deployment of the satellite.  Astrium, as a Large System Integrator (LSI), will help roadmap the technology demonstrated in this mission to future applications within the European space framework.", 15792.0, 1480552.0, "SME-SAT", null, null, null, "http://www.surrey.ac.uk/ssc/research/onboarddata/smesat/", "http://www.satserv.co.uk", null, "fp7_106745_956882303"], ["3TT", "Intra-Logistics with Integrated Automatic Deployment: safe and scalable fleets in shared spaces", "Logistic Engineering Services Ltd", "Today, intralogistic services have to respond quickly to changing market needs, unforeseeable trends and shorter product life cycles. These drivers pose new demands on intralogistic systems to be highly flexible, rock-solid reliable, self-optimising, quickly deployable and safe yet efficient in environments shared with humans. ILIAD will enable the transition to automation of intralogistic services with key stakeholders from the food distribution sector, where these challenges are particularly pressing. We will develop robotic solutions that can integrate with current warehouse facilities, extending the state of the art to achieve self-deploying fleets of heterogeneous robots in multiple-actor systems; life-long self-optimisation; manipulation from a mobile platform; efficient and safe operation in environments shared with humans; and efficient fleet management with formal guarantees. Scientifically, ILIAD pursues ambitious goals for complex cognitive systems in human environments beyond a specific use-case. We will overcome limitations in the state of the art in tracking and analysing humans; quantifying map quality and predicting future states depending on activity patterns inferred from long-term observations; planning of socially normative movements using learned human models; integration of task allocation, coordination and motion planning for heterogeneous robot fleets; and systematically studying human safety in mixed environments, providing a foundation for future safety standards. Our consortium is uniquely placed to tackle these challenges and to maximise exploitation beyond the project\u2019s duration. It includes partners with a proven track record in all key research areas, leading technology providers for intralogistics, end users that are leading in their respective markets, and the National Centre for Food Manufacturing at partner UoL, facilitating access to realistic test sites.
