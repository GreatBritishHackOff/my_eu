Many of these technologies are spearheaded by the contributions of Small and Medium Enterprise (SME).  There is a clear opportunity to revolutionize space technologies by leveraging advancement in the commercial electronics market.  However, despite the obvious benefits to the space industry, it remains difficult for SMEs to get involved due to the significant cost, effort, time, and paper work to qualify parts for space applications.  A trend toward smaller and cheaper satellites allows for a novel approach to space qualification and testing.  Nanosatellites (between 1kg and 10kg) can be launched at a relatively low cost as piggy back payloads for larger satellite missions.  Since the cost of failure is an order of magnitude lower than conventional satellites, nanosatellites offer an ideal platform for high risk demonstration missions.\n\nThe aim of this project is to flight qualify a wide range of SME payloads in a 3U 3kg nanosatellite platform operating at a 700km orbit.  The primary purpose of this spacecraft is as a technology demonstrator.  Each SME in the consortium will be responsible for contributing a particular spacecraft subsystem.  The University of Surrey will integrate these systems into the nanosatellite platform, and will also be responsible for the ADCS and CMGs of the satellite.

This objective is the focus of the project, though it does not detract but instead guarantees, other parallel goals around improving multicultural competencies, learning foreign languages and increase significantly the employability and job opportunities for our students in other EU countries. Retrieved on potential students, we have an estimation of participation of five students, once taken into account that some interested ones might fail. If unexpectedly these posts were not occuped, we have defined the duration of the project in 24 months, so that if necessary, some mobilities could be managed in the next academic year, either students or exceptionally recent graduates. The participation of two teachers involved in the mentioned computer studies, who will be preferably selected from among those who collaborate with European projects and / or bilingual programs, is also provided. In both cases, students and teachers must have a B1 level of English or the same in the host country language.The student activities will be aimed to integrate and complement the curriculum of our degree. For this, a training agreement related to the competencies of students should be prepared to be developed in the company. Before the departure, students receive training and they make arrangements to develop their traineeships and reach goals related to multiculturalism, language learning and employability. During their stay they follow a language course in the host country. Teacher\u2019s activities allow them to learn and participate in the medium in which the employment and education of its students is developed, but this also allows increasing the quantity and quality of these kinds of mobilities or other Erasmus+ projects.The months from September to January serve primarily to train and select students on everything relevant to ensure its success in the host company: motivation, fitness, foreign language, culture clashes and activities of companies. In the months of January and February, practical and logistical issues like traveling, accommodation, insurance and local information, should be treated, without forgetting other outstanding formal aspects of the project such its training program, documentation and monitoring. Duration of student mobility is three months from March 15 to June 20. The methodology for teacher training periods (five days) is similar and parallel, and although no less complex, it is more feasible due to responsibility, because involvement and rigor are expected in participants.As a result we will improve the personal and professional maturity of participants through intercultural environment and companies in other EU countries, skills acquisition in a second and / or third foreign language, the possibility of employment in other EU countries, the removal of frontiers to the individual, and especially their freedom, not only to be employed but also to choose the place in Europe where they can do it. Apart from the impact on participants and our school, this project is a collaboration with the mobility programs that are managed with the participation of different actors ranging from the authorities of the EC to local companies providing related services.In a medium term we intend to consolidate traineeship in other EU countries by the students from our centre.

The sending organisations include IES Cartuja, CE Ave Maria San Cristobal, IES Polit\u00e9cnico Hermenegildo Lanz, IES Francisco Ayala, IES Aynadamar, IES Zaidin Vergeles, CDP Atl\u00e1ntida and IES Virgen de las Nieves. This VET schools have experience in the management of European projects. With this new initiative, we intend to join efforts to contribute to the improvement of educational quality and to increase job opportunities.\r\nTo achieve this, we propose activities for students, who will do internships in companies, and activities for teaching staff, who will carry out a job-shadowing activity in VET schools. Regarding the students, the project includes 58 mobilities: 54 students of Initial Vocational Training (FPGM) will do their internship in companies for 87 days, hosting countries include the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Ireland, United Kingdom and France; 4 students of Basic Vocational Training (FPB) will do their internships in Italy for 3 weeks. For Initial Vocational Training students, the project includes 13 accompanying teachers during the first week of stay. For Basic Vocational Training students, there are 2 accompanying teachers during the 3 weeks to reinforce the monitoring.\r\nThe internships will be recognised by the official module of Company Placements (FCT), which is common to all students. However, this experience will entail an added value for the participants at a personal and professional level. In addition to acquiring knowledge and skills in their field of speciality, they can benefit from a linguistic and cultural immersion, expanding their linguistic and personal skills. This will foster their autonomy and they will acquire a more versatile profile, which will facilitate their access to the labour market. It will also encourage motivation to continue with their education.\r\nAs for the teaching staff, the project includes 9 mobilities for a week in Finland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Teachers can learn about other educational systems and observe the work carried out by other professionals. Thus, they can enrich their professional and methodological knowledge. They can learn about different resources, ICT, training programmes, etc. All this will have a very positive impact on the quality of the education provided, adapted to the needs of today's society.\r\nFor the proper management of the project, communication channels will be established between all the parties involved throughout the entire project. There will be a continuous contact between the City Council, school mobility coordinators, teaching tutors, participants, host and intermediary organisations and company tutors.\r\nThe City Council will be part of the Association of European Cities XARXA FP. This supposes an improvement in the quality of vocational education in Granada, promoting the mobility of students and teachers. In addition, we have the cooperation of different companies, including intermediary and host organisations with great experience in European projects, which will allow us to achieve the expected results.\r\nRegarding the selection process, it will be carried out in a fair and transparent manner, publishing the established selection criteria. Then, we will organise practical issues (travel, accommodation, insurance, etc.) and quality issues (training programmes, agreements between different parties, etc.). Pedagogical, linguistic and cultural preparation will also be provided before the mobility.\r\nMonitoring will take place during mobility period. Participants will have a teaching tutor and a company tutor, and communications will be established among all the parties to ensure compliance with the training programme and the adaptation and satisfaction of participants.\r\nAt the end of the mobilities, participants will obtain a certificate and the Europass Mobility document.\r\nEach member will hold a meeting with the participants for the final evaluation of the project. All results will be shared between the coordinator and the members of the consortium to maximise the results. The results will be disseminated through different means: meetings, press and local TV, web pages, European platform, social networks ...\r\nIn conclusion, we intend to promote the internationalisation of education through innovative training programmes for students and lifelong training of teachers. In addition, we establish a European cooperation network for future projects, creating a greater sense of European citizenship and promoting Unity in Diversity.", "http://www.halesowen.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA102-049621_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B63"}
