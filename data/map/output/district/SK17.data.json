The system is primarily based on the Bioelectric Recognition Assay (BERA) technology. Furthermore a specially designed electronic interface is realized in order to acquire and manipulate the corresponding signals from the real time analysis.\nThe pre-production prototype developed during this project is a Bioelectric Recognition Assay (BERA) sensor aimed at the detection of organophosphate and carbamate pesticides, 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyalcanoic (MCPA), other phenoxyalcanoic herbicides, or other small organic contaminants, e.g. 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA) (in cork and wine). The product is developed by an SME consortium based in Cyprus, Spain, Germany, Greece and Portugal with the support of RTD performers from the UK and Greece.\nThe European farming community is under a number of threats not least due to the increasing demands to produce higher quality food to increasingly stringent standards. They lack the technology to test their produce for the presence of pesticide residues at the site of production. If a system was developed that gave farmers, food companies and distributors the flexibility to test for a range of analytes regularly and in a cost effective way it would allow them to offer remedial solutions quicker than is currently possible.\nThe conventional analysis of pesticide residues in food commodities is a labour intensive procedure. Standard analysis methods include extensive sample pre-treatmentand determination by gas chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography to achieve the necessary selectivity and sensitivity for the different classes of compounds under detection.

Bioresorbable  devices do not need a removal operation, reducing patient trauma and significant healthcare costs. Due to the ability to add antibacterial or antibiotic drugs and to control the release rate at the implant site, such devices can reduce the number of post-operative complications and open up possibilities for new therapies.\nHowever, development times for new devices can be lengthy and extremely expensive. Bioresorbable materials have a high cost and are difficult to process, resulting in high scrap rates. The addition of fillers such as bioactive particles further complicate the manufacture. In Bio-PolyTec, sensor technology - centering on optical spectroscopic techniques - will be developed for in-process monitoring of the key quality measures of polymer degradation and additive dispersion. The availability of this information in real-time rather than after time-consuming and expensive laboratory testing represents a significant improvement in Quality Control for bioresorbable devices as well as enabling better process control. The influence of typical processing procedures on the degradation and mixing and hence subsequent bioresorption/release behaviour and mechanical properties will be fully investigated for the commercial products of the consortium SMEs to optimise their processes to achieve specific and consistent product requirements. In particular the processing of Polylactic Acid (PLA) and dispersion of bioactive Calcium Phosphate particles for orthopaedic implants will be investigated among other polymer/filler systems.\nThe innovations in sensor technology will extend outside the consortium to enable other device manufacturers to reduce scrap rates and hence production costs for bioresorbable devices.

It consists of a series of electrochemical-optical sensors and microsystems suitable for various biomediators (microrganisms, DNA, proteins or cells) and based on new technologies studied and developed by the research performers in the consortium. The transduction approach is suggested by two main biomediator properties, often exploited in biosensor operation in response to analyte or modification of a physical-chemical condition: the variation of the bioluminescence/fluorescence emission and the internal electrical behaviour. These changes when transduced to readable electrical signals can give complementary information: the modification of a current signal is correlated to the electrogenic property of the biomediator (e.g. inhibition of Photosystem II electron transfer in the presence of a pesticide), while a modificaton of fluorescence is often correlated to a conformational modification (e.g. interaction of Photosystem II protein with ionizing radiation).

These limitations are at the basis of recurrent troubles of this technology to reach essential applications in different areas, such as food safety, diagnosis, security, environment\u2026  The present project proposes a new bioelectronic nose based on olfactory receptors in order to mimic the animal nose. For this aim, micro/nano, bio and information technologies will converge to develop an integrated bioelectronic analytical nanoplatform based on olfactory receptors for odour detection.   Briefly, the basis of the nanobioplatform will be the olfactory receptors, prepared in the form of nanosomes immobilized onto the nanotransducers (NANO and BIO). An array of smart nanotransducers will acquire and process electronically the detected odour (NANO and INFORMATION). Such an easy-to-use nanobioplatform, with user-friendly interface and odorant identification algorithm, will detect and discriminate the odorants (NANO and INFORMATION).  The scientific and technological challenges of the BOND project can only be solved by integrating a multidisciplinary consortium at European level with expertise in areas such as biotechnology, surface chemistry, nanofabrication, electronics and theoretical modelling. The partners involved in the BOND project are experienced partners used to work in large consortia with distributed laboratories all over the European Union and offer competences and resources to build a complementary partnership for the successful implementation of the nanobioplatform.

While existing electronic nose devices can detect and identify some odorants, they do not meet all of the requirements for many of the potential applications.\n\nDuring the EU's Fifth Framework Programme (FP5), the SPOT-NOSED project developed a new approach for electronic noses by using olfactory receptors (ORs), the proteins responsible for the detection of odors in most animals, as the sensing elements. Based on this new concept, the EU-funded 'Bioelectronic olfactory neuron device' (BOND) project was established.\n\nBOND's objective was to develop a new generation of bioelectronic nose devices relying on the amazing analytical properties of the mammalian nose: specificity, sensitivity, identification of mixed signatures and real-time response. The project set out to develop an array of smart nanobiosensors containing a large number of different ORs for the detection of odorant signatures.\n\nInitially, the project developed and integrated the main technologies and components of the new bioelectronic analytical platform before assembling the first complete prototype. Then, preliminary tests of the prototype were carried out in order to validate this new technology for a target application in the area of food quality.\n\nThe completed project has successfully developed and produced a nanobiosensor able to monitor the presence and measure the concentration of specific odorants. The potential for the novel electronic nose covers many different fields and uses, including medical applications, where it could drastically reduce the cost of diagnosing and monitoring disease.
