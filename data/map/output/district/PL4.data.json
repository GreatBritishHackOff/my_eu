The principal scientific objectives of this project are to study how the full sensorial context of an embodied robot platform can be used to drive behaviour; how such behaviour can be self-organized in real-time to enable learning in dynamic (and learning) contexts; and how to not only ground existing symbols in the sensorimotor interaction, but also adapt the structure of the neural substrate to enable a development of the set of symbols used. These objectives will be achieved through theoretical studies concerning the relationship of a robot\u2019s \u201cstate\u201d and a robot\u2019s sensed context; through an open source software implementation of a developmental learning that associates high-dimensional sensor input to actuation in real-time; and through controlled experimental evaluations with the iCub humanoid robot and human teachers.

The principal reason for this lack of progress is the difficulty of conducting structural geological investigations on 1-D drill core samples.

Two major causes connected to corrosion of reinforcing steel are the carbonation and chloride attack. Concrete carbonation produces a carbonated surface layer in which the pore solution pH value is depressed to near-neutral levels. A fall in pH to values below 10 at the steel can render the steel passive film thermodynamically unstable and thus cause steel corrosion. While chloride attack causes localised breakdown of the passive film that initially forms on steel as a result of the alkaline nature of the pore solution in concrete. The harmful chloride ions can be originated from the use of contaminated mix constituents or from the surrounding environment such as deicing salts or seawater. The corrosion of steel not only reduces the strength of reinforcement but also can lead to cracking and spalling of cover concrete because of the substantial volume increase that accompanies the transformation of iron to rust. To promote the effective application of reinforced concrete it is important to protect the reinforcing steel from corrosion during its service life. This proposal is to explore a new electrochemical remediation of reinforced concrete structures by combining conventional electrochemical processes, such as the electrochemical chloride removal for chloride contaminated concrete and the electrochemical realkalisation for carbonated concrete, with electrochemical nanoparticle injection. Using the new electrochemical processes, not only can they remove chlorides from concrete and increase alkalinity in concrete pore solution but also simultaneously inject nanoparticles into the concrete to enhance its mechanical properties as well as improve its porosity to stop the further penetration of chlorides and CO2 from its surrounding environment, and thus provide a permanent solution for concrete repair suffered from carbonation and chloride attack.", 84764.0, 259277.0, "DOSECOPS", "Corrosion protection for reinforced concrete", "Corrosion of the embedded steel in reinforced concrete significantly decreases service life with potentially dangerous consequences.

Both have a vested interest in the problem given the ageing European infrastructure and the many new buildings in China already showing signs of corrosion. The proposed solution exploits electrochemical remediation together with electrochemical injection of nanoparticles.\n\nCarbonation and chloride ions are the targeted offenders. Cement paste is highly alkaline (has a high pH), primarily due to calcium hydroxide or lime content. The alkalinity passivates the steel surface with an oxide film, protecting it from corrosion. Carbonation occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) becomes dissolved in rain water and reacts with the limestone in the cement. Chloride ions from contaminated mixes or from ions in the environment such as de-icing salts or saltwater cause localised breakdown of the film. Carbonation and chloride attack both lower the pH, rendering the passive film unstable.\n\nElectrochemical technologies are facilitating realkalisation of carbonated concrete, chloride removal and nanoparticle injection. Proven cathodic prevention systems enabling current injection to suppress corrosion are also under development for new reinforced concrete structures.\n\nNow at its midpoint, the project is validating the new processes with experimental and numerical studies. Carbonated and chloride-contaminated concrete are being treated with processes exploiting carbon fibre-reinforced polymer meshes and embedded microcapsules, respectively. Novel performance-based cathodic prevention systems for marine structures are also being tested.\n\nThe technologies will remove chlorides from the concrete and increase alkalinity.

MedSeA will forecast chemical, climatic, ecological-biological, and socio-economical changes of the Mediterranean driven by increases in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, while focusing on the combined impacts of acidification and warming on marine shell and skeletal building, productivity, and food webs. We will use an interdisciplinary approach involving biologists, earth scientists, and economists, through observations, experiments, and modelling. These experts will provide science-based projections of Mediterranean acidification under the influence of climate change as well as associated economic impacts. Projections will be based on new observations of chemical conditions as well as new observational and experimental data on the responses of key organisms and ecosystems to acidification and warming, which will be fed into existing ocean models that have been improved to account for the Mediterranean\u00b4s fine-scale features.

Effects of this are a lowering of pH and carbonate ion concentration. Most research prior to the 'European project on ocean acidification' (EPOCA) project has focused on creatures that make shells and skeletons with the carbonate ion converted into calcium carbonate.\n\nEPOCA was the first international research effort on ocean acidification. The 27-member consortium put many other processes likely to be affected under the microscope. These include nutrient uptake, reproduction, acid-base regulation, nitrogen fixation and primary production. Changes in the dynamics of these biological processes are likely to affect marine flora and fauna profoundly.\n\nThe four-year long project produced results based on four themes. One of the major findings under the first, ocean chemistry, is that acidification measured in terms of pH drop in the Arctic near Iceland is 50\u00a0% faster than average rates in sub-tropical zones in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nFor biological and ecosystem responses, EPOCA researchers studied a broad range of marine life. There is now robust evidence that many calcifying organisms are adversely affected by ocean acidification although there is considerable difference in sensitivity, even between closely related species. Citing just one of the alarming effects of acidification that came to light, severe tissue damage in Atlantic cod larvae was recorded. Synergistic effects of multiple stressors, including warming, deoxygenation and eutrophication, were also investigated.\n\nProject researchers coupled Earth system models (ESMs), global and regional ocean models, and a sediment model to anticipate how acidification will alter ocean biogeochemistry. Climate change has little effect on acidification except in the Arctic, where freshening from ice melt exacerbates the situation. Regional model simulations highlighted the vulnerability of some near-shore regions as a result of river input and organic matter degradation as well as local upwelling systems.\n\nThe book 'Ocean Acidification' contains a great deal of information from the EPOCA project including advances from the modelling initiative and the majority of the synthesis chapter.

This potential includes the ability of ENM to induce damage at the cellular, tissue, or organism levels by interacting with cellular structures leading to impairment of key cellular functions. These adverse effects may be mediated by ENM-induced alterations in gene expression and translation, but may involve also epigenetic transformation of genetic functions. We believe that it will be possible to create a set of biomarkers of ENM toxicity that are relevant in assessing and predicting the safety and toxicity of ENM across species. The ENM-organism interaction is complex and depends, not simply on the composition of ENM core, but particularly on its physico-chemical properties. In fact, important physico-chemical properties are largely governed by their surface properties. All of these factors determine the binding of different biomolecules on the surface of the ENM, the formation of a corona around the ENM core. Thus, any positive or negative biological effect of ENM in organisms may be dynamically modulated by the bio-molecule corona associated with or substituted into the ENM surface rather than the ENM on its own. The bio-molecule corona of seemingly identical ENM cores may undergo dynamic changes during their passage through different biological compartments; in other words, their biological effects are governed by this complex surface chemistry. We propose that understanding the fundamental characteristics of ENM underpinning their biological effects will provide a sound foundation with which to classify ENM according to their safety.

In addition, they can sometimes result in an increase in fuel consumption, while there are little to no other economic benefits.\n\nOther solutions like liquefied natural gas, compressed natural gas, fuel cell, diesel electric or all-electric propulsion all require major modifications to the engine room and large investments, which also makes them unattractive business-wise.

They tested the performance of both innovative and traditional defences, such as floating energy converters, submerged reefs, dikes and breakwaters, and nourishment operations in the context of increasing sea-level rise and extreme weather events. To increase coastal resilience THESEUS also examined a wide range of ecologically based strategies, such as maintenance and reinforcement of wetlands, dunes and biogenic reefs, and cost-effective non-technological solutions, such as insurance, land-use plans, business recovery actions and promotion of risk awareness.\n\nProject outcomes were synthesised in a book of guidelines and in a GIS-based decision support system (DSS). The guidelines detail the best practices and advances of engineering, ecologically based, social and economic strategies for sustainable defence planning.  The DSS is an exploratory tool allowing the users to perform an integrated coastal risk assessment and to scope different combinations of adaptation options, across short, medium and long-term scenarios, taking into account physical and non-physical drivers such as climate change, subsidence, population and economic growth.\n\nTHESEUS has developed a systematic approach in assessing and managing European coasts that have become growing erosion and flood risks, as well as in delivering safer coastal habitats.", "http://www.theseusproject.eu/", "http://www.plymouth.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/149719.jpg", "fp7_92871_999854661"], ["8AA", "Genetic testing in Europe - Network for the further development, harmonization, validation and standardization of services", "University of Plymouth", "EuroGentest is an FP6 European network for the harmonization of genetic testing and for the further improvement of quality in genetic services across Europe.\nThis proposal is to support EuroGentest2, a Coordination Action that will cover the different aspects of quality assurance of genetic practice and has all the ingredients to fulfil the needs.

In particular, the project studied the expression of genes involved in glutathione (GSH) and phytochelatin (PC) synthesis.\n\nPCs are the best understood intracellular ligands in plants and play a crucial role in minimising the detrimental effects of metals. These small sulphur-rich peptides are created through the synthesis of GSH by two different enzymes, which act as an antioxidant within in the cell.\n\nMaintaining the equilibrium between synthesis and utilisation of GSH in order to reduce oxidative damage and produce PCs could be critical to combating metal stress. In addition, the toxic effects of metals are associated with reactive oxygen metabolism. Therefore, tolerance to metal stress depends upon systems that involve antioxidant enzymes, to prevent (or at least reduce) oxidative damage.\n\nProject partners determined the level of tolerance to copper by measuring growth and photosynthesis in strains of E.\u00a0siliculosus. The algae were collected from sampling sites with different pollution histories and exposed to a range of metal concentrations. Copper toxicity was also assessed in the spores of brown alga, revealing that this life stage is more copper sensitive than the adult plant, resulting in fewer reproductive organs being formed.\n\nResults highlighted the importance of PCs as intracellular metal chelators in brown algae in response to low copper levels.

CD133/Prominin1 is often expressed by stem cells but its functions are still unknown. Increasing evidence suggest Notch and CD133 might have close biological connection. Based on my preliminary results, I hypothesize that Notch and CD133 play synergistic roles in regulating epithelial cell fates. Using the tooth as a model system, my find that Notch1 and CD133 are co-expressed in the epithelium of the developing tooth. Notch1 and CD133 also co-localize in oral mucosa epithelial cells, suggesting a possible common functional link between these two molecules. The significance of these findings is reflected by my further results that CD133 knock-out mice exhibit a defective tooth epithelial developmental phenotype (i.e., amelogenesis imperfecta) similar to that observed in mutant mice in which canonical Notch signaling is conditionally inhibited. This phenotype is at least partially due to decreased epithelial stem cell numbers and the defective terminal lineage differentiation. Moreover, in cultured tooth epithelial cells, I observed (i) that increased CD133 expression induces stem cell marker expression and lineage differentiation in a Notch/RBP-Jk-dependent manner and (ii) that increased Notch activity elicits effects similar to those of CD133 overexpression.

A key aspect is the strength of the continental lower crust, which is thought to depend on the water content of rocks and its effect on their creep strength.\nThe distribution of deformation and strength in the continental lithosphere is likely to depend critically on the tectonic environment. This proposal aims to model the strength evolution of the lower crust from rifting to continental collision, and to do so with an innovative multi-disciplinary and multi-scale approach. The project will: test whether the strength evolution of the lower crust is determined by cycles of dehydration and hydration; determine the quantities of water required to weaken the lower crust and promote viscous flow; assess the duration of dehydration/hydration events in the lower crust, and the provenance of infiltrated fluids by means of isotopic studies.\nThe focus of the project will be high-strain zones in granulite bodies that record rifting and subsequent continental collision. A combination of structural geology, petrology, infrared spectroscopy and isotope geochemistry will shed light on the rheology of such lower crustal rocks.

This highly interdisciplinary field of robotics benefits greatly from the direct collaboration with child psychologists and the modeling of child development phenomena in robots. One classic approach to studying child development is to look at the errors that children sometimes commit. Young children, for example, sometimes make a serious attempt to perform impossible actions on miniature objects. We suggest that these errors may result from the onsets of language and propose to test it empirically: does a child with a larger vocabulary and/or more advanced grammatical skills perform more errors than a less advanced child? The hypotheses derived from the study will be replicated in experiments with the developmental robotics platform iCub to demonstrate the impact of such an embodied cognitive approach in the design of integrated action and language capabilities in robots.

However, these methods are inaccurate because arousal is loosely associated with deception. Moving beyond the notion of arousal, the neurocognitive approach adopted here integrates ideas from cognitive theories of deception postulating that deceptive responses are cognitively more complex than honest responses, and a framework that treats deception as a neurocognitive process and examines directly the brain, the organ that produces lies. This approach aims to identify specific neural patterns produced by cognitive processes associated with deception.

River silt originates in the catchment and the primary driver for mobilisation and translocation downstream is agriculture where loss of soil from slopes threatens food security. Knowledge of sediment source, transfer and residence time dynamics is critical to inform management for future food and water security and cutting-edge nuclear techniques have been developed in a joint UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and International Atomic Energy Agency Coordinated Research Programme to trace river silt back to source.

Moreover, the existing photon based treatments (photodynamic therapy) are highly invasive and usually require open-cranium surgery, due to the need for external light sources.
