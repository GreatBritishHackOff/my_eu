The principal scientific objectives of this project are to study how the full sensorial context of an embodied robot platform can be used to drive behaviour; how such behaviour can be self-organized in real-time to enable learning in dynamic (and learning) contexts; and how to not only ground existing symbols in the sensorimotor interaction, but also adapt the structure of the neural substrate to enable a development of the set of symbols used. These objectives will be achieved through theoretical studies concerning the relationship of a robot\u2019s \u201cstate\u201d and a robot\u2019s sensed context; through an open source software implementation of a developmental learning that associates high-dimensional sensor input to actuation in real-time; and through controlled experimental evaluations with the iCub humanoid robot and human teachers.

The principal reason for this lack of progress is the difficulty of conducting structural geological investigations on 1-D drill core samples.

Two major causes connected to corrosion of reinforcing steel are the carbonation and chloride attack. Concrete carbonation produces a carbonated surface layer in which the pore solution pH value is depressed to near-neutral levels. A fall in pH to values below 10 at the steel can render the steel passive film thermodynamically unstable and thus cause steel corrosion. While chloride attack causes localised breakdown of the passive film that initially forms on steel as a result of the alkaline nature of the pore solution in concrete. The harmful chloride ions can be originated from the use of contaminated mix constituents or from the surrounding environment such as deicing salts or seawater. The corrosion of steel not only reduces the strength of reinforcement but also can lead to cracking and spalling of cover concrete because of the substantial volume increase that accompanies the transformation of iron to rust. To promote the effective application of reinforced concrete it is important to protect the reinforcing steel from corrosion during its service life. This proposal is to explore a new electrochemical remediation of reinforced concrete structures by combining conventional electrochemical processes, such as the electrochemical chloride removal for chloride contaminated concrete and the electrochemical realkalisation for carbonated concrete, with electrochemical nanoparticle injection. Using the new electrochemical processes, not only can they remove chlorides from concrete and increase alkalinity in concrete pore solution but also simultaneously inject nanoparticles into the concrete to enhance its mechanical properties as well as improve its porosity to stop the further penetration of chlorides and CO2 from its surrounding environment, and thus provide a permanent solution for concrete repair suffered from carbonation and chloride attack.", 84764.0, 259277.0, "DOSECOPS", "Corrosion protection for reinforced concrete", "Corrosion of the embedded steel in reinforced concrete significantly decreases service life with potentially dangerous consequences.

Both have a vested interest in the problem given the ageing European infrastructure and the many new buildings in China already showing signs of corrosion. The proposed solution exploits electrochemical remediation together with electrochemical injection of nanoparticles.\n\nCarbonation and chloride ions are the targeted offenders. Cement paste is highly alkaline (has a high pH), primarily due to calcium hydroxide or lime content. The alkalinity passivates the steel surface with an oxide film, protecting it from corrosion. Carbonation occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) becomes dissolved in rain water and reacts with the limestone in the cement. Chloride ions from contaminated mixes or from ions in the environment such as de-icing salts or saltwater cause localised breakdown of the film. Carbonation and chloride attack both lower the pH, rendering the passive film unstable.\n\nElectrochemical technologies are facilitating realkalisation of carbonated concrete, chloride removal and nanoparticle injection. Proven cathodic prevention systems enabling current injection to suppress corrosion are also under development for new reinforced concrete structures.\n\nNow at its midpoint, the project is validating the new processes with experimental and numerical studies. Carbonated and chloride-contaminated concrete are being treated with processes exploiting carbon fibre-reinforced polymer meshes and embedded microcapsules, respectively. Novel performance-based cathodic prevention systems for marine structures are also being tested.\n\nThe technologies will remove chlorides from the concrete and increase alkalinity.

MedSeA will forecast chemical, climatic, ecological-biological, and socio-economical changes of the Mediterranean driven by increases in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, while focusing on the combined impacts of acidification and warming on marine shell and skeletal building, productivity, and food webs. We will use an interdisciplinary approach involving biologists, earth scientists, and economists, through observations, experiments, and modelling. These experts will provide science-based projections of Mediterranean acidification under the influence of climate change as well as associated economic impacts. Projections will be based on new observations of chemical conditions as well as new observational and experimental data on the responses of key organisms and ecosystems to acidification and warming, which will be fed into existing ocean models that have been improved to account for the Mediterranean\u00b4s fine-scale features.

Effects of this are a lowering of pH and carbonate ion concentration. Most research prior to the 'European project on ocean acidification' (EPOCA) project has focused on creatures that make shells and skeletons with the carbonate ion converted into calcium carbonate.\n\nEPOCA was the first international research effort on ocean acidification. The 27-member consortium put many other processes likely to be affected under the microscope. These include nutrient uptake, reproduction, acid-base regulation, nitrogen fixation and primary production. Changes in the dynamics of these biological processes are likely to affect marine flora and fauna profoundly.\n\nThe four-year long project produced results based on four themes. One of the major findings under the first, ocean chemistry, is that acidification measured in terms of pH drop in the Arctic near Iceland is 50\u00a0% faster than average rates in sub-tropical zones in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nFor biological and ecosystem responses, EPOCA researchers studied a broad range of marine life. There is now robust evidence that many calcifying organisms are adversely affected by ocean acidification although there is considerable difference in sensitivity, even between closely related species. Citing just one of the alarming effects of acidification that came to light, severe tissue damage in Atlantic cod larvae was recorded. Synergistic effects of multiple stressors, including warming, deoxygenation and eutrophication, were also investigated.\n\nProject researchers coupled Earth system models (ESMs), global and regional ocean models, and a sediment model to anticipate how acidification will alter ocean biogeochemistry. Climate change has little effect on acidification except in the Arctic, where freshening from ice melt exacerbates the situation. Regional model simulations highlighted the vulnerability of some near-shore regions as a result of river input and organic matter degradation as well as local upwelling systems.\n\nThe book 'Ocean Acidification' contains a great deal of information from the EPOCA project including advances from the modelling initiative and the majority of the synthesis chapter.

This potential includes the ability of ENM to induce damage at the cellular, tissue, or organism levels by interacting with cellular structures leading to impairment of key cellular functions. These adverse effects may be mediated by ENM-induced alterations in gene expression and translation, but may involve also epigenetic transformation of genetic functions. We believe that it will be possible to create a set of biomarkers of ENM toxicity that are relevant in assessing and predicting the safety and toxicity of ENM across species. The ENM-organism interaction is complex and depends, not simply on the composition of ENM core, but particularly on its physico-chemical properties. In fact, important physico-chemical properties are largely governed by their surface properties. All of these factors determine the binding of different biomolecules on the surface of the ENM, the formation of a corona around the ENM core. Thus, any positive or negative biological effect of ENM in organisms may be dynamically modulated by the bio-molecule corona associated with or substituted into the ENM surface rather than the ENM on its own. The bio-molecule corona of seemingly identical ENM cores may undergo dynamic changes during their passage through different biological compartments; in other words, their biological effects are governed by this complex surface chemistry. We propose that understanding the fundamental characteristics of ENM underpinning their biological effects will provide a sound foundation with which to classify ENM according to their safety.

In addition, they can sometimes result in an increase in fuel consumption, while there are little to no other economic benefits.\n\nOther solutions like liquefied natural gas, compressed natural gas, fuel cell, diesel electric or all-electric propulsion all require major modifications to the engine room and large investments, which also makes them unattractive business-wise.

They tested the performance of both innovative and traditional defences, such as floating energy converters, submerged reefs, dikes and breakwaters, and nourishment operations in the context of increasing sea-level rise and extreme weather events. To increase coastal resilience THESEUS also examined a wide range of ecologically based strategies, such as maintenance and reinforcement of wetlands, dunes and biogenic reefs, and cost-effective non-technological solutions, such as insurance, land-use plans, business recovery actions and promotion of risk awareness.\n\nProject outcomes were synthesised in a book of guidelines and in a GIS-based decision support system (DSS). The guidelines detail the best practices and advances of engineering, ecologically based, social and economic strategies for sustainable defence planning.  The DSS is an exploratory tool allowing the users to perform an integrated coastal risk assessment and to scope different combinations of adaptation options, across short, medium and long-term scenarios, taking into account physical and non-physical drivers such as climate change, subsidence, population and economic growth.\n\nTHESEUS has developed a systematic approach in assessing and managing European coasts that have become growing erosion and flood risks, as well as in delivering safer coastal habitats.", "http://www.theseusproject.eu/", "http://www.plymouth.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/149719.jpg", "fp7_92871_999854661"], ["8AA", "Genetic testing in Europe - Network for the further development, harmonization, validation and standardization of services", "University of Plymouth", "EuroGentest is an FP6 European network for the harmonization of genetic testing and for the further improvement of quality in genetic services across Europe.\nThis proposal is to support EuroGentest2, a Coordination Action that will cover the different aspects of quality assurance of genetic practice and has all the ingredients to fulfil the needs.

In particular, the project studied the expression of genes involved in glutathione (GSH) and phytochelatin (PC) synthesis.\n\nPCs are the best understood intracellular ligands in plants and play a crucial role in minimising the detrimental effects of metals. These small sulphur-rich peptides are created through the synthesis of GSH by two different enzymes, which act as an antioxidant within in the cell.\n\nMaintaining the equilibrium between synthesis and utilisation of GSH in order to reduce oxidative damage and produce PCs could be critical to combating metal stress. In addition, the toxic effects of metals are associated with reactive oxygen metabolism. Therefore, tolerance to metal stress depends upon systems that involve antioxidant enzymes, to prevent (or at least reduce) oxidative damage.\n\nProject partners determined the level of tolerance to copper by measuring growth and photosynthesis in strains of E.\u00a0siliculosus. The algae were collected from sampling sites with different pollution histories and exposed to a range of metal concentrations. Copper toxicity was also assessed in the spores of brown alga, revealing that this life stage is more copper sensitive than the adult plant, resulting in fewer reproductive organs being formed.\n\nResults highlighted the importance of PCs as intracellular metal chelators in brown algae in response to low copper levels.

CD133/Prominin1 is often expressed by stem cells but its functions are still unknown. Increasing evidence suggest Notch and CD133 might have close biological connection. Based on my preliminary results, I hypothesize that Notch and CD133 play synergistic roles in regulating epithelial cell fates. Using the tooth as a model system, my find that Notch1 and CD133 are co-expressed in the epithelium of the developing tooth. Notch1 and CD133 also co-localize in oral mucosa epithelial cells, suggesting a possible common functional link between these two molecules. The significance of these findings is reflected by my further results that CD133 knock-out mice exhibit a defective tooth epithelial developmental phenotype (i.e., amelogenesis imperfecta) similar to that observed in mutant mice in which canonical Notch signaling is conditionally inhibited. This phenotype is at least partially due to decreased epithelial stem cell numbers and the defective terminal lineage differentiation. Moreover, in cultured tooth epithelial cells, I observed (i) that increased CD133 expression induces stem cell marker expression and lineage differentiation in a Notch/RBP-Jk-dependent manner and (ii) that increased Notch activity elicits effects similar to those of CD133 overexpression.

A key aspect is the strength of the continental lower crust, which is thought to depend on the water content of rocks and its effect on their creep strength.\nThe distribution of deformation and strength in the continental lithosphere is likely to depend critically on the tectonic environment. This proposal aims to model the strength evolution of the lower crust from rifting to continental collision, and to do so with an innovative multi-disciplinary and multi-scale approach. The project will: test whether the strength evolution of the lower crust is determined by cycles of dehydration and hydration; determine the quantities of water required to weaken the lower crust and promote viscous flow; assess the duration of dehydration/hydration events in the lower crust, and the provenance of infiltrated fluids by means of isotopic studies.\nThe focus of the project will be high-strain zones in granulite bodies that record rifting and subsequent continental collision. A combination of structural geology, petrology, infrared spectroscopy and isotope geochemistry will shed light on the rheology of such lower crustal rocks.

This highly interdisciplinary field of robotics benefits greatly from the direct collaboration with child psychologists and the modeling of child development phenomena in robots. One classic approach to studying child development is to look at the errors that children sometimes commit. Young children, for example, sometimes make a serious attempt to perform impossible actions on miniature objects. We suggest that these errors may result from the onsets of language and propose to test it empirically: does a child with a larger vocabulary and/or more advanced grammatical skills perform more errors than a less advanced child? The hypotheses derived from the study will be replicated in experiments with the developmental robotics platform iCub to demonstrate the impact of such an embodied cognitive approach in the design of integrated action and language capabilities in robots.

However, these methods are inaccurate because arousal is loosely associated with deception. Moving beyond the notion of arousal, the neurocognitive approach adopted here integrates ideas from cognitive theories of deception postulating that deceptive responses are cognitively more complex than honest responses, and a framework that treats deception as a neurocognitive process and examines directly the brain, the organ that produces lies. This approach aims to identify specific neural patterns produced by cognitive processes associated with deception.

River silt originates in the catchment and the primary driver for mobilisation and translocation downstream is agriculture where loss of soil from slopes threatens food security. Knowledge of sediment source, transfer and residence time dynamics is critical to inform management for future food and water security and cutting-edge nuclear techniques have been developed in a joint UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and International Atomic Energy Agency Coordinated Research Programme to trace river silt back to source.

Moreover, the existing photon based treatments (photodynamic therapy) are highly invasive and usually require open-cranium surgery, due to the need for external light sources.

It is also in compliance with the three main lines of the academic project : 1. School success for everyone everywhere 2. Learning and acting in the 21st century world 3.Investing in staff training.\r\n\r\n3) Participants and activities\r\n27 head teachers and inspectors are staying one week in a European country where they are involved in job shadowing or structured courses. There, they will have the opportunity to find out about some European education systems. They will also exchange best practices and learn how to handle pupils' learning difficulties and implement the 2016 French secondary school reforms. Their applications were studied with various criteria. They had preferably to work in a Priority Education Network and have a view of the dissemination plan they would develop afterwards. Then, through this project, our staff members will get an expertise which will make the best practices in the educational field easier to develop.\r\n\r\n4) Results\r\nThe activities carried out during the mobility period will improve the personal, cultural, intercultural and professional competences of the staff.  The staff will also develop their professional motivation and their capacity to support/coordinate future European mobility projects in their schools.\r\n\r\n5) Impacts and long-term profits \r\nThe project will have a sizeable impact on the participants\u2019 competences and professional practices.

There are eight trainees posted at a time, who are carefully selected in advance by their internal and academic achievements as well as their motivation letters. \r\nBackground of the project are the positive experiences with the Go.for.europe project and Erasmus+ programme in 2014 up to 2016 in which overall 14 trainees were posted abroad.\r\nThereby a very large value for the company has been recognized, resulting in the following objectives for the current project. Through the internships, the trainees should expand their social and intercultural skills as well as their professional and language\r\ncompetences. These include increasing the language skills, mobility, flexibility, openness plus independence and obtaining self-assurance in dealing with business partners. Furthermore, the project is accompanied by the increase in attractiveness of the dual education system and of Wilhelm Gienger KG as a training company and business company. This image enhancement should have a positive impact on employees, potential applicants, and other external people such as our customers. With the support of our junior staff on their way to qualified professionals, we will get high performing employees that secure the long-term success of the company.\r\nThe project will be offered to full-aged trainees in the second and third year of apprenticeships, who already provide basic knowledge. An optimal preparation is ensured by a detailed information transfer over the course of the project and preparation seminars.\r\nThe trainees are posted for three weeks at a time. The accommodation is provided by host families who are carefully selected by the Tellus Group. On the first day the students take part at a welcome meeting which informs about the next steps and the internship companies. After an one-week intensive language course, the trainees will complete two-week internships.\r\nThe travel arrangements and insurances are arranged by the company Wilhelm Gienger KG. The Tellus Group is organising the accommodations, internships as well as the programme and are in charge of the group. There is steady contact with the Tellus Group and the trainees also have the opportunity to communicate to us at any time during their stay.\r\nThe evaluation of the project will be effected by means of participant reports, feedback from our project partner, personal interviews with trainees and presentations of the project results.", "http://www.tellusgroup.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003842_1"], ["6LF", "Europakaufleute und Berufspraktika", "TELLUS EDUCATION GROUP LIMITED", 25822.0, "Vocational trainees shall get international experience to improve their linguistic, cultural and professional knowledges and skills.\r\nAll participants are working in enterprises, which cooperate with others in foreign countries - for example as part of an international group or as customer or as supplier.

A part of our students have little self-confidence as well as difficulties in theoretical learning and in self-assessing their skills and competences realistically. Furthermore, their communicative competency in English is often not very advanced and encounters with people from different cultural backgrounds are restricted to a private or school environment. However, this is a stark contrast to the expectations employers have of their employees like the ability to perform job-related tasks independently and the mental and physical readiness to adapt to changes. It goes for all students that as future employees they are going to have more and more job-related contacts with people from a different cultural background \u2013 especially so in our Dutch-German border region. Thus our students\u2019 learning needs are developing a realistic job prospect which matches their skills, refining their personality, improving their foreign language and intercultural competences and realistically assessing the chances of temporarily learning and working abroad as a future prospect. In addition to that some of our teachers would like to learn from schools or educational institutions or do further education abroad because they wish to develop themselves further and improve the content and methods they apply in lessons and training-scheme-related tasks outside teaching.\r\n\r\nProject aims and expected results and effects\r\nThe project aims are derived from the learning needs described above: increase the participants' employability and scholastic aptitude by improving their job-related, personal, foreign language and intercultural competences as well as their mobility. We expect our students to return from their work placements abroad with enhanced self-confidence and open-mindedness towards life in different countries and in dealing with other cultures and foreign languages and also with a clearer idea concerning their future career. Ideally the work placement abroad results in a successful application for a job or an apprenticeship. For the educational staff and our school we expect an extension of knowledge and intercultural competence and connected to that enhanced teaching quality with respect to content and methods. Our project team will very likely intensify their knowledge concerning international cooperation and increase their organisational skills. We also hope to attract more students to our school by offering work placements abroad and to provide our region with young people who are employable and open for new developments. Apart from these future and hard-to-measure results we expect tangible results in the form of a documentation in German and English or Spanish consisting of texts, pictures, films or sound recordings or presentations about the work experience or further education abroad.\r\n\r\nActivities and methods\r\nOur student beneficiaries will complete internships abroad in the social institutions like creches, senior citizens institutions or youth institutions or in hotels, restaurants or canteen kitchens.

Furthermore, they should increase their social\r\nand international expertise. In a pre-agreed contract between the partners the working areas will be set; Eg. participants are used in\r\nhotel trades in the \"reception\" and in commercial occupations in the \"Shopping / Sales Export\". After training, the learners become\r\nmore flexible by their increased mobility readiness, so that their career prospects will improve.

Furthermore, we will also carry out and implement the evaluation and public relations work together  with our partners abroad. The tasks of our foreign partners are essentially in the acquisition and provision of suitable companies, appropriate internships and accommodation facilities abroad. The vocational school Elmshorn Europaschule and the BBZ M\u00f6lln will assist in the selection and preparation of suitable participants for stays abroad as well as in making contact with interested companies and partners abroad.\r\nParticipants:\r\n80 trainees from the fields of bakery, hotel / catering and travel, tourism and leisure and other commercial professions.\r\n30 internal VET Trainers & teaching staff\r\nRequirements and needs:\r\nIn particular, workers and trainees from the fields of hotel / catering and travel, tourism and leisure need increasingly foreign\r\nlanguage skills, intercultural skills and a particularly high degree of adaptability for their daily interaction with guests. This applies\r\nequally to commercial staff in international companies. Both from the perspective of the companies that are active in international\r\nmarkets, as well as for the professional perspective of the trainees, the need arises to acquire these skills.\r\nObjectives:\r\nLearners should use and deepen their professional knowledge during the stay abroad. Furthermore, they should increase their social\r\nand international expertise. In a pre-agreed contract between the partners the working areas will be set; Eg. participants are used in\r\nhotel trades in the \"reception\" and in commercial occupations in the \"Shopping / Sales Export\". After training, the learners become\r\nmore flexible by their increased mobility readiness, so that their career prospects will improve. In addition, participants will learn\r\nmore about the current and historical culture of the country.\r\nResults:\r\nAn essential part is to demand and support and to raise awareness of a growing Europe. Significant results are improved language\r\nskills of the participants, as well as the better cultural understanding of all involved with each other. Degradation of language and\r\ncultural barriers in terms of the European idea will create higher common potentials in personal development or in the context of\r\nbusiness cooperation. Each participant will complete a 2-4 week stay  abroad and thereby improve personal and professional skills. These include the elimination of language barriers through improved language skills, a greater cultural understanding, an in-depth knowledge as well as an increase in personal self-consciousness. Overall, thereby the personal job situation for the trainee improves.\r\nAdditional results:\r\nAll participants will receive the Europass-Mobility; Reports of the participating students; Project report;\r\nPublication of project results through information flyers, websites of the consortial-partners and events of 3K-AKTIV e.V.\r\n\r\nProject management: 01/06/2017 to 31/05/2019", "http://www.tellusgroup.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-004065_1"], ["6LF", "let's go!- und lift- Einzelstipendien", "TELLUS EDUCATION GROUP LIMITED", 114166.0, "The present pool project \"individual scholarships let's go! and lift\" is a nationwide initiative to promote practical trainings abroad for apprentices of skilled trades as well as technical trainees in industry and trade who are taking part in a vocational education and training under the dual system. Its objectives are fixed against the background of a previously relatively low mobility of young people in the dual training system which currently stands at about 4 percent. Additionally, conventional measures of mobility for apprentices are usually carried out in groups and are too inflexible for interested individuals or do not match due to their technical, spatial or temporal orientation. However, this project provides promotion of individual practical trainings abroad, irrespective of time, country of destination and the occupation requiring formal training. But the project determines clearly the funding period which in each case is scheduled to last three weeks. This schedule is based on the experience that this period usually already allows young people to a positive experience mobility with sustainable effect and that on the other hand longer periods of absence of the apprentices is in most cases hardly accepted among their training companies. Moreover, the realisation of practical trainings abroad shall now also be possible for those youngster, who just finished their apprenticeship. The 3-week-training abroad has to be completed within the first 12 months after their successful final examination. The experience showed that some of the apprentices do not have the opportunity to do an intership during their vocational education under dual system due to timely and operational reasons. \r\n\r\nThis project shall enable the mobility consultation services of the Chambers of Skilled Trades and the Chambers of Industry and Commerce to provide a funding offer to apprentices who are interested in individual scholarships.

This application already ensures the prompt provision of information to the training company and the vocational school by obtaining the respective letter of reference from them. The applicant\u2019s formal and personal suitability for an individual training abroad will be tested in a selection and awareness section conducted by the notifier or the regional support partners (mobility coaches of the Chambers). In case of a positive evaluation the preparation of the internship abroad will be planned. As soon as a suitable hosting institution/company is found and a learning agreement regarding the stay has been reached, the applicant will be informed of the authorisation of the funding. During the internship abroad different measures of the sending and hosting institutions will ensure the support for the young person and the documentation will start. After returning home the documentation will be finished and the final evidences will be provided.

The individual internship abroad promotes the intercultural and language competences and supports the personal and professional development of the participating apprentices and trainees. The positive impact of the acquired competences will become clear in the domestic apprenticeship. At the same time it is expected that the restraining threshold of the participants for future long-term work in other European countries will be lower.\r\nRegarding the quantitative need: The nationwide concept of the project is geared towards the whole group of apprentices of skilled trades and of technical trainees in industry and trade as well as towards young people recently aquired their certificat of vocational education in the mentioned two occupational groups.

They particularly appreciate information about the origin of offered product. \r\n2) Analysis of the job market in the touristic, wine and food and hospitality sectors\r\nUnlike other professional sectors, which in the last five years have experienced the aftermaths of the difficult economic cycle, this sector is enjoying a growing trend. However, positions in the sector are not always filled by graduates of Hotel Management VET Schools \u2013 who graduate with the ambition of growing professionally \u2013 and are often filled by workers with disparate professional backgrounds.

The school acknowledges that in order to solve our shared European challenges, we need to start with bringing change to our local communities. Our focus as a school is on our students to be \u201cpreparing for the future, and learning for life\u201d. We take our social assignment seriously and see that internationalisation is an important tool to achieve goals in the county regional plan for the entire course of schooling. There are demands for a holistic schooling with emphasis on quality and relevant training, including establishing arenas for interaction and learning.\r\nOur school has a long-term commitment to strengthening students' understanding of, and expertise in, how to live in a multicultural society built on democratic values and human rights. The importance of internationalisation is well understood by the school management, as well as in the county administration, and our head of department takes an active part throughout the process.\r\nIn the Department of Health- and childcare, Krakow was chosen for our student mobilities in order to meet community needs for expertise in migration pedagogy. In Vestfold county the inward labour migration from Poland is significant, and students will meet Poles in their future careers in the Health- and childcare sector.\r\nThere is an average of 140 students attending Health- and childcare programmes every year. Student mobility is offered students at year 2 at the Childcare and youth worker programme, the Health worker programme, and to students belonging to our special Health- and childcare programme, where the students become qualified for higher education in addition to receiving vocational training.\r\nThe students will be in practice for two weeks either in the privately owned nursery Bright Child, or at Ognisko, public day centres for mentally retarded adults.\r\nAt work, the students will take part in the normal day to day activities, but also be expected to initiate and lead planned activities on their own. Students will participate in reflection groups each afternoon and blog about their experiences throughout their stay, as well as complete an interdisciplinary project assignment. While in the host country each student will be sharing a small flat with another student, and together they will be responsible for grocery shopping and cooking, keeping the flat tidy and clean, laundry, being on time for work as well as keeping other appointments.\r\nThere will be two teachers present during the entire practice period, and they will be in close contact with the nursery and day centres, in addition to having professional guidance sessions with the students. The teachers will provide support for students both individually and in groups, and make sure they get to sample some of the local culture.\r\nThe aim of the international practice is to ready the students for linguistic and cultural challenges in a multicultural society, through first-hand experience of what it is like to work and live in a foreign country. Their reflections underway provide learning for life, and ensure quality of training.\r\nWe believe that this will make our pupils and teachers more tolerant regarding other cultures and respect for other norms and values. An experience that can be shared with collegues and other pupils at our school. Increased multicultural understanding will have a positive effect on the  environment at our school. Another competence aim that will be covered is increased knowledge of languages. They will also develop communication- and cooperation skills and increase their social competence. Our school also focus on the cooperation between our two vocational lines of studies and emphasize relevant goals in these two lines of studies.\r\nOn the one hand, a long time goal for sending student mobilites to Krakow, is to encourage professional and personal growth, as well as resilience, independence, responsibility and tolerance for each student. On the other hand, we would like students to gain valuable multicultural expertise preparing them for their future careers.\r\n\r\nAs a school we see internationalisation projects as a way to increase student motivation and thereby up the number of students completing secondary school.

As a partner for coaction we have chosen a company Tellus College, which works on the UK market and they will help develop our students work opportunities and experience within respective suitable domains within the programme \u201eWork based learning\u201c.\r\n2 groups of 3rd and 4th grade students studying \u201eTransport and logistics\u201c  plus \u201eLogistic  and  financial services\u201c would participate in the program. We would like to show the students new possibilities which their profession offers within the EU. We shall motivate them and further their education while raising  their qualification. The selection of students will be arranged by our teachers (able to assess their specific knowledge and competencies, incl.language and personal premises). The project will form a healthy competition in the school, inspire an interest among the students in their specialized branches and also help their specific/personal character progress. Work-training abroad will also develop a competitiveness of our students on job market within the CR and other EU countries. \r\nThe project shall implement units of learning ECVET. Worktrainings will be orientated on work in dept.of logistics (activities connected with manual and informational flow of reserves either in written/electronic communication or execution of operations linked with purchase and sale and the use of modern PC  techniques). The result of the work training, in relation to a learning plan, is going to advance specific proficiencies and competencies. Our students will acquire all of them during their work in a foreign company.  Achieved proficiencies of our students will be acknowledged/accounted for within the subject Special training, after their return back to the CR.  The ECVET units were created for this project in cooperation with the foreign partner Tellus in such way to use them afterwards on the national level\u2013within work trainings in local companies. By applying ECVET the foreign partner will perceive the professional profile of a student equally to other students from the EU. During the preparation of this we have planned: the project schedule, organization, project management, accountability of involved partners, implementation of ECVET units, monitoring, evaluation & dissemination of the project.\r\nThe task of the school management is to advertise the project and increase the knowledge of possibilities of cooperation in Europe.\r\nActivities for the dissemination and exploitation of results are planned from the beginning, as a part of the project and after its end to include activities aimed at ensuring the visibility, accessibility & applicability. The results of the project (work experience, gained and confirmed skills and competencies of JVU, European cooperation) will be spread by all participants. Students will disseminate the results and experience informally among their classmates, teachers, parents and friends in person, through social networks.\r\nThe school will present a summary of this project and its experience to the professional public at the meeting of Association of Professional Schools ICT, postal, banking and logistics, a group for transport, logistics and mail as well as social partners. Another important point is sharing the experience with the implementation of European tools through professional training. This  work experience abroad will be motivating for new students and make our program more attractive for students. By acceptance of ECVET, both the foreign partner and the school or other training organizations would have access to a professional qualification profile and would be ready to participate in all activities associated with Erasmus +.\r\nThe main aim of the project is to develop job competencies and partnerships between vocational secondary education and the labor market in the EU, increasing the qualifications of our students with the use of units of learning outcomes ECVET and harmonization with the European Qualifications Framework (level 4) and last but not least student\u00b4s personal developments.

The most important points were agreed and made into project objectives on which we will focus.   \r\n   Creating this project was based on need to deal with problems created by decreased number of our students caused by population decline. At the same time we want to react to demanding requirements of the labour market where high demand for our graduates speaks clearly in our favour. With this project we want to improve linguistic and practical knowledge of our pupils who will be able to develop professionally, therefore able to find work more easily. Moreover we want to react to their high demand for activities abroad. Unlike grammar schools and business academies our students are usually from socially lower classes and some of them have never been abroad. Our school is also attended  by Immigrants from Ukraine, Romania and Asia.\r\n\r\nWe approached to the project comprehensively and it will address the issue of improving the quality of education.\r\nOur involvement in this project within ERASMUS+ is regarded as an important element for improvement of teaching as such. The main objective of the project is to increase students\u2019 employability in short supply professions on the labour market not only in regional areas of the CR but also in the international European space. The current motivation of students for further study is also very important for their future profession as well as for development of their foreign language skills. The contribution to quality of education is also expected since students of engineering branch will work with technologies that our school does not provide and gain knowledge of fulfilling tasks given in English language. Studens of economy branch will improve their skills in working with\r\nspecial economic PC programs, activities connected with setting up a company and its ensuring,  creating and using a bank account.\r\nThe expected benefit is also in the shift of teachers\u2018 thinking in European context together with introduction of ECVET. \r\nOther benefits for students themselves:\r\n- Obtaining the document Europass Mobility (for better employability at labour market)\r\n- Including of gained results (credits) of education within principles of ECVET without having to be re-examinated\r\n- Increase of readiness for A- levels \r\n- Improvement of professional shaping up and improving of employability orientation in their branches\r\n- Familiarity with the culture and social environment of GB, its differences and particularities via their staying in host families and participation in afternoon activities prepared by TELLUS\r\nWe are planning to send 24 students (12 of engineering branch, 12 of entrepreneurs assistant branch) of second and third year.  All planned activities are based on the same principle, they have the same objective and they will meet the same needs of the participants. They differ only in their professional focus of education branches.  They have a possibility to find their inner motivation to study foreign languages and be employable in other countries in the future.\r\nAfter approval of the project a general contract (Memorandum of understanding) will be worked out and will be valid for the whole period of project time.\r\nThe general contract will be signed by all three subjects (a student, sending and welcoming organisation) before sending students to a specific mobility so called Learning Agreement.\r\nThe organizations will proceed together when fulfilling necessary steps for gaining documents for students within Europass \u2013 Mobility.\r\nFor the assessment of learning outcomes in ECVET, activity units of learning outcomes will be developed for each activity unit where acquired results of learning will be assessed and recorded by welcoming school. \r\nThe skills and knowledge gained from well-prepared internships will be of a great significance in its contribution to the improvement of teaching students. The use of European instruments or certificates in turn increases the quality of work, not only teachers involved but also educational organizations, too. These are, of course, also the goals of this project.\r\n\r\nDue to their mobilities, all participants will develop and improve their language and communicative competences, experience new, innovative teaching methods and broaden their horizons in terms of multicultural relations, education towards European unity and the process of globalization.\r\nInternational mobilities are irreplaceable  in respect of acquiring practical experience.

In the whole, ten groups of students and two groups of teachers will travel abroad for an internship.The increasing number of foreign mobilities and the strengthening of an international cooperation are the basic objectives of the strategic development plan of our school.\r\nThe offer of the study programmes at our school has nearly doubled over the past few years and the number of students has increased up to the current 957. \r\nIn addition to the traditional field of study Applied Chemistry being taught in several specializations, there are some new study programmes such as Fire Protection, Security and Legal Studies, or study programme Hairdresser and Beauty Services. To meet the educational needs of our students and allow them to travel to a foreign mobility within their study focus, we expanded our circle of cooperating organizations on the current nine and now we have fully covered all the educational programmes taught at our school with mobilities. We plan to send participants in six European countries (Germany, Cyprus, Great Britain, Spain, Italy, Slovakia 4x). Among our project partners there are six upper secondary technical schools, three universities and one educational center. With four of our project partners we will implement reciprocal mobilities.\r\nThe hosting organizations of our Chemistry students will be schools SBG Dresden, Vocational Chemical School in Bratislava, IIS P.

Students in the branch of study Fire Protection will participate in an internship at Vocational School of Fire Protection in \u017dilina (Slovakia). Students in Security and Legal Studies will pass their practice at the Faculty of Security Engineering of the University of \u017dilina, specifically at the Department of Crisis and Security Management. Another group of these students will complete a course on forensic analysis at Vocational Chemical School in Bratislava. For students in the branch Beauty Services and Hairdresser there is ensured professional experience in beauty and hairdressing salons at Vocational school specialized in hairdressing and making visage in Bratislava. Simultaneously with the increase in number of mobilities, we also strive to raise up the quality of the project. In all mobilities of this project, we will apply the principles of ECVET system and will be testing units of learning outcomes. We will also deal with the procedure of participants assessment. Within this project we also plan mobilities of pedagogical staff - VET teachers as we believe that professional development of teachers is a prerequisite for quality assurance in education. Besides professional and pedagogical skills of teachers we also want to strengthen their language skills. In this project we want to focus on vocational teachers in the field of Security and Legal Studies who will complete work-programme at the Faculty of Security Engineering, and further on teachers in the field of Applied Chemistry who will participate in a working program at ITT Buonarroti-Pozzo in Trento focused on the use of information technology in teaching and learning. On the side of students we see the impact of the project in the acquisition of new knowledge and skills, strengthening linguistic communication and lexical knowledge, improving self-confidence and also motivation for further education. Thanks to this experience students gain an overview of the demands put on their profession, learn about possibilities of study abroad and employment at the European labor market.

Throughout their period of training, our students can improve their linguistic competence, acquire professional skills, discover cultural differences, develop their autonomy and their ability to travel abroad, learning about the constraints of working in another country, compare methods, working times, techniques, materials and procedures, all in a foreign language, and becoming better European citizens in the process. They will be assessed by evaluation proformas which will provide evidence of their periods of training in companies and will be used by the assessors (teachers and examiners) in the award of the Professional Diploma (Baccalaur\u00e9at).

What is even more, to be competitive at the labour market, one needs additional knowledge.  \r\nThe main goals of the project are  improving the students' skills in practical education (in their own field and to also get additional knowledge), to improve their knowledge of foreign languages, to improve their level of ICT knowledge, for them to learn how to function independently and also as a part of an international team, and nevertheless to become more open to other cultures and various work possibilities. We would also like to take is project as an opportunity for our staff to improve their professional skills, knowledge of English language and to add into the curriculum of practical education (for hairdressers, computer technicians and machine technicians) new topics that will make our students more competitive at the labour market. \r\nThe core of the project consists of 4 mobilities to 2 countries, to Malta and Great Britain in 2 years.  The project involves all together 40 students, 10 students for each round of mobility. Also at each mobility 2 accompanying persons will be present (the Project Manager of the school and the teacher of practical education regarding the students' professional field) all the time of the students' stay abroad. Students included into the project come from 2 different directions: 20 computer technicians and 20 hairdressers. \r\nThe project has 4 repetitive phases/cycles. First the participants will be picked, then preparations will start for the 10 computer technicians and everything will be prepared for their stay on Malta (October 2017, duration 3 weeks, work in companies).  After their stay abroad the students and the accompanying persons will present their knowledge to their classmates/colleagues, the students will fill out a poll and final report, the project team will have a meeting on how the project's goals/objectives were met and there will be meetings regarding the change of curriculum. The students will get their Europass Mobility certificates and ECVET certificate. Then the 2nd stage of the project will begin in January 2018 for the 10 hairdressers going to Great britain (March 2018, 3 weeks, practical traiing in a traininig center), the same procedure as for the computer technicians. In September 20168 the 3rd stage will start for the 10 computer technicians going to Malta (October 2018, 3 weeks, work in companies).   The last mobility will take place in March 2019, when 10 hairdressers are going to Great Britain (3 weeks, work in a training center). \r\nThe expected results are broadened knowledge of the students in the field of practical education and other fields, improvement of the students' language skills, improvement of the students' individual and  team-work, and discovered ideas/options for different ways of work and possible ideas to work abroad . Personally the students will become more independent, more self-confident, open to other environments and cultures,  disciplined, hard-working..., which will make them more competitive at the labor market.  Staff will improve their professional skills, language skills and a change of the curriculum for practical education in the 2 directions in the project will be carried out. \r\nThe project will have long term  benefits for the students because they will be more competitive at the labor market and they will be more successful in life, they will discover new work possibilities. Our school will benefit, because the participants will have new knowledge and pass their knowledge and experience on to other students/work colleagues,  so work at school will get easier and better done,  the changed curriculum will enable future generations to be more competitive at the labour market,  more students will enroll , future project mobilities will get improved and with the partners more future cooperations are possible.", "http://www.tellusgroup.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SI01-KA102-035342_2"], ["6LF", "Zavezani prihodnosti", "TELLUS EDUCATION GROUP LIMITED", 257907.0, "The Consortium of Schools of Economics of Eastern Slovenia (Celje School of Economics, Grammar School Celje - Center, Murska Sobota School of Economics, Secondary School of Economics Maribor, Secondary School Slovenj Gradec and Muta, Novo mesto School of Economics) has formed partnership with partners in the United Kingdom, Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Malta for the purpose of collaborating in the mobility project for our secondary school students from five of our regions that is taking place from June 2017 until June 2018.

Firstly, Warsaw and its surroundings are the places popular among tourists. After the organization of sporting and cultural events of European and world interest, the number of foreign tourists in Warsaw has increased. This contributed to the development of catering sector in Masovia. The demand for qualified, experienced, foreign language speaking catering and customer service employees is increasing.

The region Hauts-de-France has nearly 6 million inhabitants, which represents 9.4% of the population of metropolitan France. It is thus the third most populated French area in the new territorial organisation. The new region is characterized by its youth with the highest proportion of under-25-year-olds and student attractiveness. Raising the level of training remains a significant objective for the new region while, at the same time, the number of school leavers without qualifications is still above the national average. While the rate of unemployment is below the national average from the level V, the lack of training is a major handicap in the career and for the integration into the workplace. Improving the level of training, the rise of abilities for employees, the lifelong learning for job seekers, or even strengthening the fight for literacy and preventing from dropping out of school before the first qualification remain major issues. \r\nThe main objective of the MOBinov17 project is to foster the mobility of targeted beneficiaries in order to secure their training route and to favour their long-term professional integration.

Everything has been carefully planned and scheduled for students\u2019 mobilities :from our partners(companies,accommodation) who have agreed to collaborate  to the organizational aspects of the mobility (transportation, logistics and general organization). At least one reference teacher will be with them to help and supervise visits,  training period assessments, health monitoring, and moral support as most learners are under age. Thus, the student-teacher relationship is changed, allowing a new relationship between the X and Z generations so as to close the gap and provide better understanding between these two generations. \r\n\r\n Two cities were chosen for the mobilities for several reasons : Bristol (direct flight from Toulouse, Airbus subsidiary, city size ...) and Valencia (its economic and cultural wealth, a city as big as Toulouse, less famous and less known than Madrid  or Barcelona in our region). These mobilities will be divided into two specific periods with 6 students in each city (28 days in June 2017 and January 2019).\r\n\r\nOur school is located in the South of France and teachers are mostly Generation X, but they are still in a dynamic educational approach of their job : always  curious and willing to  discover new pedagogical tools in order to be able to make knowledge accessible to students and motivate them. Anxious to be as close as possible  to the  school European identity, 8 colleagues have obtained certification - DNL- to teach their subject in a foreign language. These certifications allow a broader offer in terms of curriculum in our high school. Consequently, these 14- day mobilities will  allow  them to practice and improve their skills, including foreign language ones. Each teacher is responsible for his/her own mobility organization with regards to his /her personal and professional goals and wishes. They must define their objectives and target needs beforehand. A  good practice committee  has also been created so that teachers will  be able to share their mobility outcomes and experience with the educational community and encourage new colleagues to go abroad. When they return, teachers must produce tools, documents, detailed reports on their mobility objectives and outcomes so as to share their results.

As a result, fewer students continue their education after secondary school, and not even all of them take the exams. After examining the problem we tried  to solve it on many levels, but in-depth analysis in the form of interviews and surveys showed that the primary cause of failure is lack of motivation for learning, lack of faith in students' own abilities and lack of prospects for the future. An additional problem is a nationwide trend, which is  the popularity of general education over vocational training among junior high school students.  Last we noticed the severity of attitudes expressing lack of tolerance for other cultures and religions (in connection with plans to accept immigrants in our city). \r\nTo change this situation, we have developed a project which main goal is to increase students' motivation to develop knowledge and improve skills, gain new skills, improve language skills- mostly English , increase the mobility of participants, increase their chances on European and national labor market, increase self-esteem, increse intercultural competences, improve the quality and attractiveness of vocational education in the school and in the region, prevent early school leaving and reduce failure in education.  the teachers will  develop their skills in the diagnosis of pupils' needs and learn more attractive teaching meathods.

The project will increase students\u2019 intercultural awareness, understanding of other cultures and countries and it will enhance the feeling of citizenship and European identity.\r\n \r\nThe main participants of the project will be 80 students from 5 classes who, in the school year 2017/2018, will have their obligatory apprenticeship. Other beneficiaries will be the whole school and the local community.\r\n \r\n32 students from the ICT class will go for two weeks of work training in Great Britain. Their apprenticeship will take place in Plymouth at the Centre of Vocational Training Tellus Education Group. The apprentices will carry out tasks connected with designing and making local computer networks and managing ICT networks. Additionally, they will learn the basics of robotics and design Internet sites.\r\n \r\nIn cooperation with the organisation euroMind, two-week apprenticeships in Spain will be organised for the students of the other professions taught in our school. A group of 16 students of Surveying will have their apprenticeship under the supervision of a surveyor from the company Iniciativas el Condado. As part of their professional training, the students will carry out measurements in the field, perform calculations using the AutoCAD program and create maps. They will learn the specifics of work in a Survey company and in a technical office of the town hall in Sevilla.\r\n \r\nA group of 16 students of electronics will gain their professional experience in Sevilla constructing drones, and a group of 16 students-technicians of renewable energy systems will work on the installation of a solar house. Additionally, the electronics students will visit a company producing drones, while the other group will visit the largest solar power plant in Europe. Participation in the project will enable our students to gain a lot of new competences, which are impossible to get at school. It will give them the chance to compare European industry solutions with ones used in Poland and verify their theoretical knowledge in a practical aspect. They will develop their language competences, improve their communication skills and their knowledge of professional vocabulary. Living with host families or in hostels, often with course participants from different countries, will help the students gain a better understanding of other cultures, openness and tolerance. The experiences of the apprentices and the teachers supervising them will have a positive influence on the whole school. The materials created by them (presentations, training diaries, an Internet site, maps, fanpage) will be used in the process of education and will influence the curriculum.

The students will be provided with international transport, insurance, accommodation, full board, and the mentoring of teachers from ZSEiO and the employees of the host organisations. Before starting their apprenticeship, the students will receive organisational support that will make their stay abroad easier. During English classes they will boost their professional vocabulary. They will receive basic information about the culture, traditions, customs and the economy of the country they are going to. They will be familiarised with the rules of the apprenticeship, the programme and the regulations of the training, their rights and duties, health and safety rules during the journey and for the stay abroad as well as with the cultural differences.

In the context of the school\u2019s development process the following objectives and priorities were stated:\r\n-  prepare future educators for the challenges of an international world of work\r\n-  improve foreign language skills, esp. in their field of work\r\n-  promote intercultural competences and skills\r\n-  implement inclusion \r\nThe Bavarian curriculum for training colleges for educators as well as the  Bavarian curriculum for children in day care emphasize the necessity to systematically promote intercultural competences.\r\nThe diversity of values and the necessary communication of values are at the centre of educator training. A constructive debate is vitally important for educators in a plural and globally changing society.\r\nThrough additional qualifications we enable our students to expand their knowledge within the generalist training and provide the impetus for \u201clifelong learning\u201d, e.g. through the project SmS (playing with  your voice) in cooperation with the Academy of Music in Marktoberdorf or the training license for the promotion of physical activity in children and adolescents in cooperation with the Bavarian Sports Association.\r\nPresently the FakS (Training College for Educators) is cooperating with about 300 institutions (at home and abroad) and invites lecturers on a variety of current topics.\r\nThe FakS has successfully provided internships since 2001, first through Leonardo da Vinci and later through Erasmus+ thus allowing almost 400 students to do internships in the UK, France, Ireland, Austria and Spain. Several projects received the \u201cbest practice\u201d award. In 2015 the FakS received the Mobility Charta as an appreciation for excellent mobility projects and in 2010 it received the Mobility Certificate. The Profile of our college is profoundly characterized by the participation in EU- educational programmes and the experiences abroad are an integral part of our internationalisation strategy.\r\n\r\nDue to the successful cooperation all our cooperating partners abroad have increased the number of participants and deepened the exchange of experience with our teaching staff.\r\nIn 2017 we are not going to send students to the UK due to the constantly rising intermediary fees and the uncertainty with regard to the impending Brexit. At present we have sufficient internships in other foreign countries, in addition we are looking for a suitable host country for 2018.\r\nIn the future we want to emphasize teacher exchanges. So far we have invited guests from at home and abroad to gain an insight into our training system and the Bavarian education system.\r\nAs the only training college for educators in Swabia our college is participating in the model trial \u201cOptiprax\u201d which aims at A-level students offering them a shortened period of training. We would also like to offer those students the chance of a work experience abroad. Currently there are financial and bureaucratic obstacles that need to be overcome.

Our cooperation with many successful and internationally active companies in the fields of agricultural machinery, chemistry and the metalworking industry demands a vocational training which prepares trainees, and the teaching staff as well for the challenges of a growing European job market. \r\nThe GEK is a European School which highly values on their European oriented education. One example is the variety of language courses on offer such as English, Dutch, French and Spanish. We consider it to be important that our students have the opportunity to use these languages in real-life professional situations. These take place during a three week internship work placement abroad.\r\nHere, our project background and our project objectives are closely linked. The VET mobilities of trainees as well as trainers lead to an increased cross-cultural understanding of a common Europe.\r\nThe experiences of our students abroad lead to a higher self-confidence and encourage them to seek for job possibilities beyond their country borders. Another project objective is that \u201cEurope\u201d is part of the school\u2019s curriculum. Lessons in various subjects deal with topics that are relevant for a European way of thinking. This is supported by the school\u2019s annual European week which offers the students a variety of projects focusing on Europe.   \r\nWith the start of ERASMUS+, the GEK is able to offer almost 100 mobility participants the chance to travel and work abroad in 2017/18. This is the largest number of participants so far and follows the plans of our district council in Cologne to raise the number of vocational mobilities to 10%.  These participants are for example technicians for illumination advertisements, electricians for automation engineering, chemical lab assistants, metal workers and technical assistants in the field of design.\r\nSo far we have organized VETPRO-projects for trainers and teachers which took them to our partners abroad for one week. Last year they worked under the title \u201cTeaching the European Way\u201d. Our IVT-projects under the title \u201cDifferent Places-Different Faces\u201d enabled our students to work for three weeks in Finland, Rumania, Malta, Great Britain and on the island of La Palma.\r\nAll those activities are now coming together with ERASMUS+ and the GEK is now offering future participants to work under the title \u201cIVT quality+\u201d. In addition to our student mobility under KA1, we also succesfully applied for a KA2 strategic partnership. \r\nBut the GEK does not only send students abroad, we also welcome our partner school\u2019s students from Finland here in the Rhineland area. The teachers and trainers of the GEK organize accommodation and internships with our cooperating companies in the field of electrical engineering, chemistry and design. These internships usually last from four to six weeks.\r\nOur project implementation has been consistently improved and is now divided into 3 main stages: The first stage is the application phase. In this stage students qualify by participating in cross-cultural preparation lessons. Here they also create a europass CV in English and pass a mobility interview, to show their motivation to work abroad. This stage ends in an intercultural evening which prepares all the participants for their upcoming departure day.\r\nThe second stage is their actual stay abroad. During this time, the students are monitored, both by the local partners as well as the responsible teachers and trainers of the GEK. The participants document their linguistic, social, personal and professional impressions and experiences in a travel diary called \u201cTravelog\u201d. It is an important instrument of the third stage of the mobility project. This is where the evaluation of the experience abroad is going to take place. With the help of the Travelog their gained competence are documented and can be comprehended. Later on these competences are evaluated in our competence overview, which are used to fill out the europass Mobility certificate.\r\nThe project results, their benefits as well as their impact are closely related. The Europass Mobility is one example. It is used for future applications by our trainees after the end of their vocational training, as well as by our teaching staff for better career chances. This document increases their career prospects on both the national and European job market. \r\nOur collaboration with regional companies that employ apprentices of our foreign project partners, often results in the decrease of language barriers and more cultural acceptance.

Its framework is an educational approach based on meaningful learning and centred on the promotion of the human being. \r\nThis project, which is the initial stage of a four-year plan, consists of a first mobility flow of 40 students towards the United Kingdom, France and Germany who will be coordinated by 4 teachers and 4 members of our staff. \r\nThe middle and long-term strategy aims at a gradual increase of the mobility: from the second year, this will be implemented by expanding the destinations located in the Mediterranean area and/or in the Northern, Central and Eastern European countries; in the third year, due to the expected increase of know-how and operational strategies, we will increase the number of students (up to 50) involved in the mobility project. The time spent abroad will enable beneficiaries to carry out an internship in companies or institutions selected with the support of transnational partners (A1 activity of the present form). The privileged sectors will be consistent with the educational targets of our school: cultural heritage and tourism, public and private institutions operating in the field of communications (primarily for students enrolled in the classical humanities course of our school); art and entertainment, with particular regard to music and dance, will be the fields of interest of some other students (especially those who are enrolled in Liceo Azuni's music and dance related courses).   \r\nThese activities will allow the implementation of disciplinary theoretical acquisitions and the development of the ability to transfer the so-called soft skills in the workplace. It is expected that the placements will produce effective results in terms of a conscious study and/or work guidance and, thanks to the Europass certification provided within the project, enhance employability. The habit to intercultural dialogue and the familiarity with foreign languages, as natural outcomes of the mobility experiences, will allow young citizens living in a place strongly determined by insularity, to open themselves up to local, regional and national opportunities, which of course relate to the European context of the knowledge society and to the global market.\r\nThese targets are consistent with those identified by the European International Agenda 2020, which is an essential point of reference for our school's educational plan. The latter already promotes the learning of two foreign languages through a series of activities: exchange projects with European schools and linguistic internships abroad (Germany, France, Denmark); collaboration with the local branch of the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and with the authorized Cambridge and IELTS test centres in the organization of courses for the achievement of international linguistic certifications.

rate of emigration, as a means of overcoming social and economic development.\u00a0In a long-term strategy, it may be necessary to rethink some of our practices, arising the need to adapt to new realities, as has been the case with the participation, more and more frequent, of underage beneficiaries.\u00a0For this reason, we consider important the existence of the figure of the companion person when performing these mobilities.\u00a0This companion person can always check the conditions of the training experiences, as well as meet new partners who have recently integrated the project, correct and improve procedures, verify accomodation conditions and strengthen relationships between the various partners.\u00a0The accompanying teachers are usually people who belong to the working group responsible for carrying out this typology of projects, teachers of the different technical areas of our courses or, also, elements of the school's management, as part of our strategy of

social-economic improvement with worthy of Trefort \u00c1goston\u2019s life-work.\r\nOur application\u2019s central unit is the student mobility with which in this application period there will be a possibility for 71 students to go on vocational training in a foreign country. In choosing the target countries the main viewpoint is the possibility to gain knowledge in high level, to have practice either in a factory or in a school with fruitful experiences. The majority of the mobilities are in factories. We have made an effort that the members of the mobilities cover more vocational areas than before. These planned mobilities cover electronic-electro technical, transport, automation, IT, mechanical engineering and building engineering technician vocational areas in 9 vocations. Beside our traditional European target countries such as Finland we have tight relationships with the bordering, surrounding countries schools\u2019 inhabited by Hungarians. Our international relationships are based on reciprocity as we also receive foreign students or teachers from our partner schools and we organize their programmes in Hungary. We prefer non-profit receiving partner organisations with efficiency in the expenses of spending the subsidy. For the student mobilities we only have accompanying teachers in those cases for the necessary period of time where their present is reasonable.\r\nOur relationships do not stay on only the level of mobility. We strive for professional relationships which are in a long run and active. B\u00e9k\u00e9s county\u2019s economic organisations must be active in international competition as they are attached to the European Union\u2019s markets with thousand threads. That\u2019s why it is expected from us to train specialists who are able to be competitive in the European scene with high level of language knowledge, work experience abroad. The student mobility helps on this and in the same time creates the feeling of being European citizen in our students. \r\nIn the case of expert mobilities the primary aim is for the teachers to ensure professional knowledge which is up-to-date and marketable, to get to know the newest achievements and their applications in education. For this reason during all the expert mobilities we create pieces of syllabus which we use and spread around in our fellow institutions. The innovation group which is formed in our school makes diverse activities. That means creating syllabus, technical improvements. These are made together with our fellow institutions. \r\nIn our days it\u2019s a challenge to adopt the zero energy-consumption building\u2019s technological solutions for education. Because of this the expert mobilities concentrate to these areas. The participants are teachers who work in the areas of building technician, building automation and electrical industry. The results of their activities are new syllabus elements. With the usage of these new elements the level of our school\u2019s education is improving.\r\nIn the expert mobilites our aim is to involve as much colleagues as we can, we try to avoid accumulation, except the project coordinator and the professional leader. Because of the high quality of the expert mobilities occasionally we invite outer participants. Our activities are in close relation with \u00d3buda University, with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of B\u00e9k\u00e9s County and with the Government Office of B\u00e9k\u00e9s County Employment Major-Department.
