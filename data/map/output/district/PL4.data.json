The principal scientific objectives of this project are to study how the full sensorial context of an embodied robot platform can be used to drive behaviour; how such behaviour can be self-organized in real-time to enable learning in dynamic (and learning) contexts; and how to not only ground existing symbols in the sensorimotor interaction, but also adapt the structure of the neural substrate to enable a development of the set of symbols used. These objectives will be achieved through theoretical studies concerning the relationship of a robot\u2019s \u201cstate\u201d and a robot\u2019s sensed context; through an open source software implementation of a developmental learning that associates high-dimensional sensor input to actuation in real-time; and through controlled experimental evaluations with the iCub humanoid robot and human teachers.

The principal reason for this lack of progress is the difficulty of conducting structural geological investigations on 1-D drill core samples.

Two major causes connected to corrosion of reinforcing steel are the carbonation and chloride attack. Concrete carbonation produces a carbonated surface layer in which the pore solution pH value is depressed to near-neutral levels. A fall in pH to values below 10 at the steel can render the steel passive film thermodynamically unstable and thus cause steel corrosion. While chloride attack causes localised breakdown of the passive film that initially forms on steel as a result of the alkaline nature of the pore solution in concrete. The harmful chloride ions can be originated from the use of contaminated mix constituents or from the surrounding environment such as deicing salts or seawater. The corrosion of steel not only reduces the strength of reinforcement but also can lead to cracking and spalling of cover concrete because of the substantial volume increase that accompanies the transformation of iron to rust. To promote the effective application of reinforced concrete it is important to protect the reinforcing steel from corrosion during its service life. This proposal is to explore a new electrochemical remediation of reinforced concrete structures by combining conventional electrochemical processes, such as the electrochemical chloride removal for chloride contaminated concrete and the electrochemical realkalisation for carbonated concrete, with electrochemical nanoparticle injection. Using the new electrochemical processes, not only can they remove chlorides from concrete and increase alkalinity in concrete pore solution but also simultaneously inject nanoparticles into the concrete to enhance its mechanical properties as well as improve its porosity to stop the further penetration of chlorides and CO2 from its surrounding environment, and thus provide a permanent solution for concrete repair suffered from carbonation and chloride attack.", 84764.0, 259277.0, "DOSECOPS", "Corrosion protection for reinforced concrete", "Corrosion of the embedded steel in reinforced concrete significantly decreases service life with potentially dangerous consequences.

Both have a vested interest in the problem given the ageing European infrastructure and the many new buildings in China already showing signs of corrosion. The proposed solution exploits electrochemical remediation together with electrochemical injection of nanoparticles.\n\nCarbonation and chloride ions are the targeted offenders. Cement paste is highly alkaline (has a high pH), primarily due to calcium hydroxide or lime content. The alkalinity passivates the steel surface with an oxide film, protecting it from corrosion. Carbonation occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) becomes dissolved in rain water and reacts with the limestone in the cement. Chloride ions from contaminated mixes or from ions in the environment such as de-icing salts or saltwater cause localised breakdown of the film. Carbonation and chloride attack both lower the pH, rendering the passive film unstable.\n\nElectrochemical technologies are facilitating realkalisation of carbonated concrete, chloride removal and nanoparticle injection. Proven cathodic prevention systems enabling current injection to suppress corrosion are also under development for new reinforced concrete structures.\n\nNow at its midpoint, the project is validating the new processes with experimental and numerical studies. Carbonated and chloride-contaminated concrete are being treated with processes exploiting carbon fibre-reinforced polymer meshes and embedded microcapsules, respectively. Novel performance-based cathodic prevention systems for marine structures are also being tested.\n\nThe technologies will remove chlorides from the concrete and increase alkalinity.

MedSeA will forecast chemical, climatic, ecological-biological, and socio-economical changes of the Mediterranean driven by increases in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, while focusing on the combined impacts of acidification and warming on marine shell and skeletal building, productivity, and food webs. We will use an interdisciplinary approach involving biologists, earth scientists, and economists, through observations, experiments, and modelling. These experts will provide science-based projections of Mediterranean acidification under the influence of climate change as well as associated economic impacts. Projections will be based on new observations of chemical conditions as well as new observational and experimental data on the responses of key organisms and ecosystems to acidification and warming, which will be fed into existing ocean models that have been improved to account for the Mediterranean\u00b4s fine-scale features.

Effects of this are a lowering of pH and carbonate ion concentration. Most research prior to the 'European project on ocean acidification' (EPOCA) project has focused on creatures that make shells and skeletons with the carbonate ion converted into calcium carbonate.\n\nEPOCA was the first international research effort on ocean acidification. The 27-member consortium put many other processes likely to be affected under the microscope. These include nutrient uptake, reproduction, acid-base regulation, nitrogen fixation and primary production. Changes in the dynamics of these biological processes are likely to affect marine flora and fauna profoundly.\n\nThe four-year long project produced results based on four themes. One of the major findings under the first, ocean chemistry, is that acidification measured in terms of pH drop in the Arctic near Iceland is 50\u00a0% faster than average rates in sub-tropical zones in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nFor biological and ecosystem responses, EPOCA researchers studied a broad range of marine life. There is now robust evidence that many calcifying organisms are adversely affected by ocean acidification although there is considerable difference in sensitivity, even between closely related species. Citing just one of the alarming effects of acidification that came to light, severe tissue damage in Atlantic cod larvae was recorded. Synergistic effects of multiple stressors, including warming, deoxygenation and eutrophication, were also investigated.\n\nProject researchers coupled Earth system models (ESMs), global and regional ocean models, and a sediment model to anticipate how acidification will alter ocean biogeochemistry. Climate change has little effect on acidification except in the Arctic, where freshening from ice melt exacerbates the situation. Regional model simulations highlighted the vulnerability of some near-shore regions as a result of river input and organic matter degradation as well as local upwelling systems.\n\nThe book 'Ocean Acidification' contains a great deal of information from the EPOCA project including advances from the modelling initiative and the majority of the synthesis chapter.

This potential includes the ability of ENM to induce damage at the cellular, tissue, or organism levels by interacting with cellular structures leading to impairment of key cellular functions. These adverse effects may be mediated by ENM-induced alterations in gene expression and translation, but may involve also epigenetic transformation of genetic functions. We believe that it will be possible to create a set of biomarkers of ENM toxicity that are relevant in assessing and predicting the safety and toxicity of ENM across species. The ENM-organism interaction is complex and depends, not simply on the composition of ENM core, but particularly on its physico-chemical properties. In fact, important physico-chemical properties are largely governed by their surface properties. All of these factors determine the binding of different biomolecules on the surface of the ENM, the formation of a corona around the ENM core. Thus, any positive or negative biological effect of ENM in organisms may be dynamically modulated by the bio-molecule corona associated with or substituted into the ENM surface rather than the ENM on its own. The bio-molecule corona of seemingly identical ENM cores may undergo dynamic changes during their passage through different biological compartments; in other words, their biological effects are governed by this complex surface chemistry. We propose that understanding the fundamental characteristics of ENM underpinning their biological effects will provide a sound foundation with which to classify ENM according to their safety.

In addition, they can sometimes result in an increase in fuel consumption, while there are little to no other economic benefits.\n\nOther solutions like liquefied natural gas, compressed natural gas, fuel cell, diesel electric or all-electric propulsion all require major modifications to the engine room and large investments, which also makes them unattractive business-wise.

They tested the performance of both innovative and traditional defences, such as floating energy converters, submerged reefs, dikes and breakwaters, and nourishment operations in the context of increasing sea-level rise and extreme weather events. To increase coastal resilience THESEUS also examined a wide range of ecologically based strategies, such as maintenance and reinforcement of wetlands, dunes and biogenic reefs, and cost-effective non-technological solutions, such as insurance, land-use plans, business recovery actions and promotion of risk awareness.\n\nProject outcomes were synthesised in a book of guidelines and in a GIS-based decision support system (DSS). The guidelines detail the best practices and advances of engineering, ecologically based, social and economic strategies for sustainable defence planning.  The DSS is an exploratory tool allowing the users to perform an integrated coastal risk assessment and to scope different combinations of adaptation options, across short, medium and long-term scenarios, taking into account physical and non-physical drivers such as climate change, subsidence, population and economic growth.\n\nTHESEUS has developed a systematic approach in assessing and managing European coasts that have become growing erosion and flood risks, as well as in delivering safer coastal habitats.", "http://www.theseusproject.eu/", "http://www.plymouth.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/149719.jpg", "fp7_92871_999854661"], ["8AA", "Genetic testing in Europe - Network for the further development, harmonization, validation and standardization of services", "University of Plymouth", "EuroGentest is an FP6 European network for the harmonization of genetic testing and for the further improvement of quality in genetic services across Europe.\nThis proposal is to support EuroGentest2, a Coordination Action that will cover the different aspects of quality assurance of genetic practice and has all the ingredients to fulfil the needs.

In particular, the project studied the expression of genes involved in glutathione (GSH) and phytochelatin (PC) synthesis.\n\nPCs are the best understood intracellular ligands in plants and play a crucial role in minimising the detrimental effects of metals. These small sulphur-rich peptides are created through the synthesis of GSH by two different enzymes, which act as an antioxidant within in the cell.\n\nMaintaining the equilibrium between synthesis and utilisation of GSH in order to reduce oxidative damage and produce PCs could be critical to combating metal stress. In addition, the toxic effects of metals are associated with reactive oxygen metabolism. Therefore, tolerance to metal stress depends upon systems that involve antioxidant enzymes, to prevent (or at least reduce) oxidative damage.\n\nProject partners determined the level of tolerance to copper by measuring growth and photosynthesis in strains of E.\u00a0siliculosus. The algae were collected from sampling sites with different pollution histories and exposed to a range of metal concentrations. Copper toxicity was also assessed in the spores of brown alga, revealing that this life stage is more copper sensitive than the adult plant, resulting in fewer reproductive organs being formed.\n\nResults highlighted the importance of PCs as intracellular metal chelators in brown algae in response to low copper levels.

CD133/Prominin1 is often expressed by stem cells but its functions are still unknown. Increasing evidence suggest Notch and CD133 might have close biological connection. Based on my preliminary results, I hypothesize that Notch and CD133 play synergistic roles in regulating epithelial cell fates. Using the tooth as a model system, my find that Notch1 and CD133 are co-expressed in the epithelium of the developing tooth. Notch1 and CD133 also co-localize in oral mucosa epithelial cells, suggesting a possible common functional link between these two molecules. The significance of these findings is reflected by my further results that CD133 knock-out mice exhibit a defective tooth epithelial developmental phenotype (i.e., amelogenesis imperfecta) similar to that observed in mutant mice in which canonical Notch signaling is conditionally inhibited. This phenotype is at least partially due to decreased epithelial stem cell numbers and the defective terminal lineage differentiation. Moreover, in cultured tooth epithelial cells, I observed (i) that increased CD133 expression induces stem cell marker expression and lineage differentiation in a Notch/RBP-Jk-dependent manner and (ii) that increased Notch activity elicits effects similar to those of CD133 overexpression.

A key aspect is the strength of the continental lower crust, which is thought to depend on the water content of rocks and its effect on their creep strength.\nThe distribution of deformation and strength in the continental lithosphere is likely to depend critically on the tectonic environment. This proposal aims to model the strength evolution of the lower crust from rifting to continental collision, and to do so with an innovative multi-disciplinary and multi-scale approach. The project will: test whether the strength evolution of the lower crust is determined by cycles of dehydration and hydration; determine the quantities of water required to weaken the lower crust and promote viscous flow; assess the duration of dehydration/hydration events in the lower crust, and the provenance of infiltrated fluids by means of isotopic studies.\nThe focus of the project will be high-strain zones in granulite bodies that record rifting and subsequent continental collision. A combination of structural geology, petrology, infrared spectroscopy and isotope geochemistry will shed light on the rheology of such lower crustal rocks.

This highly interdisciplinary field of robotics benefits greatly from the direct collaboration with child psychologists and the modeling of child development phenomena in robots. One classic approach to studying child development is to look at the errors that children sometimes commit. Young children, for example, sometimes make a serious attempt to perform impossible actions on miniature objects. We suggest that these errors may result from the onsets of language and propose to test it empirically: does a child with a larger vocabulary and/or more advanced grammatical skills perform more errors than a less advanced child? The hypotheses derived from the study will be replicated in experiments with the developmental robotics platform iCub to demonstrate the impact of such an embodied cognitive approach in the design of integrated action and language capabilities in robots.

However, these methods are inaccurate because arousal is loosely associated with deception. Moving beyond the notion of arousal, the neurocognitive approach adopted here integrates ideas from cognitive theories of deception postulating that deceptive responses are cognitively more complex than honest responses, and a framework that treats deception as a neurocognitive process and examines directly the brain, the organ that produces lies. This approach aims to identify specific neural patterns produced by cognitive processes associated with deception.

River silt originates in the catchment and the primary driver for mobilisation and translocation downstream is agriculture where loss of soil from slopes threatens food security. Knowledge of sediment source, transfer and residence time dynamics is critical to inform management for future food and water security and cutting-edge nuclear techniques have been developed in a joint UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and International Atomic Energy Agency Coordinated Research Programme to trace river silt back to source.

Moreover, the existing photon based treatments (photodynamic therapy) are highly invasive and usually require open-cranium surgery, due to the need for external light sources.

Their work will consist of: sorting out the post, managing diaries, answering the phones, greeting clients, writing business letters, preparing presentations, using ICT in administration and using office devices (fax machine, copy machine, etc). The students of logistic technician program will fill in transport documentation and do logistic correspondence using ICT. \r\nAs a part of Vocational matura exams students are obliged to make a project work, so the participants of this mobility will focus in their projects on comparison of Slovenian and English economy systems and on transposition of good business practices in the Slovenian environment.

Current discussions in vocational training in Health and Social Care as well as Business Administration (BA) give rise to the issues dealt within this project. Due to the two participating departments, the project focusing on current European perspectives in vocational training will be twofold.\r\nIn the BA department the issue of work-life-balance (WLB) is particularly gaining in importance in times of demographic change, internationalization and changing values. Being aware of the positive implications of WLB can decisively contribute to enhancing corporate competitiveness on the European labour market and to increasing a company\u2019s attractiveness for highly skilled staff.\r\nIn their project task during their internship the students are not only asked to deal with the topic from the employers\u2019 perspective, but also from the angle of employees, families and politics.\r\nPrior to their internship they deal with human resources management including different working time models in their BA classes, develop questionnaires/observation sheets to analyze the existing framework in the target country, e.g. key economic data, the availability of childcare etc.\r\nThey work out the specific features in their designated countries through interviews and independently evaluate their observations (PPP, collages, internship report). After the internship their results are compared with those gained in Germany.\r\nThe new focus of the work experience of the social department results from current discussions about changing pedagogical attitudes in elementary education in Germany. This new pedagogical attitude requires a resource-orientated view from the child to promote children`s individual development according to their strengths and competences.\r\nWorking \u201cinclusively\u201d in every field of education and promoting children`s individual needs have become a chore issue of pedagogical work, in theory.

In addition, apprentices and teachers of the social department at the RvW college will closely work together on this project. Whereas apprentices will practice the new resource orientated view from children with the help of observation and documentation sheets, teachers will discuss this issue with teachers and tutors from European partner institutions to obtain fresh ideas for the tuition and training of their students in Germany (A1, A2). \r\nIn the BA department activities include the exchange of experiences between two teams of VET staff and the students\u2019 tutors in the host companies with the aim of benefitting from synergy (e.g. cross curricular European projects) in both main subjects of the BA department (English and BA), thus enhancing the specific profile of the department.\r\nThe close link between the students` and teachers` mobility serves to guarantee the project`s quality by the following aspects: the teachers` interchange of possible concepts as regards a child`s individual promoting or the concept of a WLB respectively is structured in the same way as are the students` internships, namely through specific tasks (called \u201cAgenda\u201d) and its results are meant to help improve class teaching and the didactic structure of the departments.

The overlap between the current economic crisis and the data, that emerge from ISTAT surveys on training poverty of young people, give us a complete inescapable picture: in Italy there are more than 113.000 young people between 14 and 17 years old out of the school\u2013training channels and they represent 5% of the resident population in the same age group; there are more than 2 million young people who do not work and do not study, representing 22% of the population, the incidence is significantly higher than in other European countries; the proportion of NEET is prevalent in the South, where the incidence of the phenomenon reaches 30,9%, although in recent years is also growing in the Central-North, especially the Northeast, where the crisis has intensified the phenomenon of non-employment.

These young people come from the network CONFAP (National Entities for Vocational Training) and Professional Technical Institutes of the Province of Padua.

The young beneficiaries come from 17 Italian regions (from North to South Italy).

The correspondence between the type of beneficiaries, professional profiles and countries of destination is designed on the specific professional sectors in relation to the offer of the labour market of the European territorial contexts involved. The profiles of mechanics, electricity, thermo-plumbing will go in Germany, UK, Spain and Sweden. The profiles of the catering will travel to France, Germany, Spain and Malta. The profiles of agro-alimentary transformation will go to Spain. The profiles of well-being will travel to UK. The graphic profiles will go to Germany. The pedagogical approach of the project is intercultural because the internship activities foreseen are designed in function, on the one hand, of the reinforcement of learning already established by the beneficiary in Italy (strengthening of the starting situation), from another hand, in function of the learning to be acquired in the country of destination (differences-comparative learning; product/typical processes of the country of destination, the various laws of hygiene and safety in the workplace; different measurement techniques; different types of raw materials used for processing).

This will ultimately benefit vocational students of the tutor and enable the tutor to pass on new skills and information with a broader European scope.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to: 1 Provide a period of \u2018real work\u2019 experience for beneficiaries studying environmental and craft courses in the UK at VET level. 2. To ensure that this period of European experience is of relevance to the participant\u2019s course of study and can be accredited as such. 3. To increase the appreciation in beneficiaries of the benefits of European cooperation and the fact that we are facing similar challenges across Europe. 4. To provide beneficiaries with sufficient time and support to increase competencies in key environmental and craft skills being used on the placement. These include:\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Skills: planting, coppicing, footpath design and construction, countryside furniture construction (bridges, steps benches etc), biodiversity assessments and species identification, basic surveying, habitat management, organic sustainable food production.\r\n\r\nCraft Skills: weaving, embroidery, silversmithing, blacksmithing, ceramics, wood carving, green wood construction, traditional building techniques (natural materials), \r\n\r\n 5. To develop a sustainable European VET partnership (hosts, UK colleges and Grampus) which can share experience and develop future cooperation projects. 6. To increase the employment prospects of participating students through gaining real-work experience and laying the foundation for language skills 7. To enhance UK VET training provision in environmental and traditional skills by providing 7-day staff placements for tutors with relevant European hosts.\r\n\r\nThe project management methodology for the PETS consortium is consistent with the 2001 Recommendation on mobility for students, persons undergoing training, volunteers, teachers and trainers and the ten principles set out in in the European Quality Charter for Mobility.\r\n\r\nStudents are accredited as part of their UK course of study for the mobilities. All participant mobilities are recognised through the Europass certificate as well as the Europass CV and language passport. Host partners provide a minimum of four language lessons with professional tuition. All staff mobilities are recognised within an agreed CPD plan with their own organisations. Host partners also provide certification and a record of achievement in their own format as additional evidence of achievement.\r\n\r\nDetailed learning agreements are drawn up prior to placement through discussion between participants, hosts and UK colleges.

Now we apply for one more school in order to benefit from our joint experiences and strengths and to help each other.\r\n\r\nWe are three consortium members: The applying Allvar Gullstrand together with Selma Lagerl\u00f6f and Sval\u00f6fs gymnasium.  Selma and Sval\u00f6f keep the contact with the two municipalities Landskrona and Sval\u00f6v for a joint and collected dissemination of our results. Sval\u00f6f also has a long experience from ECVET knowledges.\r\n\r\nObjectives and impacts, organization level: We want to establish a placement network for the upper secondary schools in Landskrona and Sval\u00f6v. This is our main objective. Furthermore as a sidetrack we want to give our teachers an extended international school- and professional perspective that the students may benefit from.\r\n\r\nLandskrona and its vicinity is a region with high youth employment and many of our students are second/third generation immigrants so the project is a possible way to reduce the employment through enhanced European mobility and thereby increase the knowledge about EU/what EU can offer young people in our region. For the municipalities of Landskrona/Sval\u00f6v it is importantant that we keep the education on a high level, fight the segregation between natives and immigrants, offer our students a future without unemployment and counter the student migration from us to the big school cities in south: Lund, Malm\u00f6 and Helsingborg.\r\n\r\nObjectives and impacts, students: It is important for the students to see more of the outside world to create user friendly, ergonomically correct and competitive products and services and moreover to attune their professional skills and experiences to European demands and values. We want to increase their innovation abilities, strengthen their vocational qualifications and their employability in a mobile world where competition no longer has any geographical, cultural and language borders.\r\n\r\nResults and longer term benefits: The students should feel that the whole of Europe is their future labour market and that their products and services should have an international imprint to be able to match different needs in different countries. Instead of practicing for the third time at a local company we give the students the possibility to \u201cExtend their Horizons\u201d. To encounter this students will enhance their language skills. Young people who have been practicing abroad bring back more experience and a broad, international perspective that together with increased quality awareness, level of creativity and entrepreneurship are welcome contributions for future employments in companies in Landskrona and elsewhere, which adds to the Swedish initiative.\r\n\r\nThe placement experiences of the students form the basis for future education and placements at a local level.\r\n\r\nContext/Background, students: All the students come from the third year vocational programs. They have during their first two years been practicing at local companies as a complement to their theoretical studies in their vocational subjects. Abroad they use the skills they have acquired during their upper secondary school years and learn new curricular skills. \r\n\r\nMethodology: We intend to use ECVET, which means a written Memorandum of Understanding and a Learning Agreement. Through ECVET we hope even better to be able to document and identify what results each student should achieve abroad, how to assess, validate and quality ensure and in what way the new skills can be incorporated in their individual education plan. \r\n\r\nProfile, activities, impact, staff: Concerning the staff who are to participate in the staff training we intend the teachers who are directly involved in the students who are sent abroad, but not strictly vocational teachers but also others as language teachers, social sciences teachers etc. as they all partake in the teaching of our vocational students. \r\n\r\nActivities and number of participants: We apply for 81 students and 7 assistants on placements abroad and 10 teachers for staff training. The students are selected; they write their CVs, are prepared linguistically and intercultural, enter agreements and contracts concerning future placement.\r\n\r\nAbroad the students take part in practical modules with an educated monitor at their hand, as a part of their theoretical and practical education. The monitor will be present during all the three weeks. \r\n\r\nAfter the placement period the students get written assessments, the result is validated, and is credited in the students\u00b4 education plan.

This is why in the recent (since Sept. 2003) curriculum of the Colleges for educators in Bavaria about 440 lessons are set for the teaching of unit 3 \u201cPerceiving and understanding diversity \u2013 supporting inclusion\u201d.\r\nToday`s children, adolescents and young adults grow up within a pluralistic, constantly changing society, they come from a variety of backgrounds. These facts as well as participation on an equal level and supporting inclusion are the main topic.\r\nIn spite of several educational reforms the chances of education are still different depending on the children`s social background. \r\nAlso the system of early child care and education does not really guarantee the same chances to every child from the beginning. That is the reason why the perception and the development of diversity at the child care level is an aim, striving for values such as democracy and tolerance, but is also an important tool for (self) \u2013education.\r\nTargets of the project\r\nThe students are to be encouraged to perceive the diversity in their respective places of practicum,4 that is the special situation of children from migrant families, disabled children, children with a special religious background or socially disadvantaged children.

In subjects like music, art, handicrafts and physical education the project topic is put into practise and extended in all its implications. The students receive specific assignments for the practicum abroad, such as recording one particular activity, observing things in general and handing in a portfolio of the placement. About two months before the practicum abroad starts, the students are informed about their placement and about details, the age of the children they are going to work with etc. They are expected to prepare individually and are supported in this by regular meetings.

The development of digital competencies is fundamental for ensuring that young people are able to access the modern job market and for allowing them a full participation and inclusion in today\u2019s digital society. \r\n\r\nThe project is based on the innovative and involving method of alternation of education and training and it answers the needs of the targeted students. In fact, recent research showed that, despite the numerous advancement of the modern school system, newly graduated high school students are often not prepared to approach the job market because they:\r\n\r\n- possess basic skills and competencies but lack technical and operative skills usable in the job market;\r\n\r\n- show a natural  incline towards  digital and web technology, but  they are not \u201cdigital competent\u201d, that is their knowledge of digital technology is not adequate to a work context;  \r\n\r\n- show a general lack of confidence in their possibilities and dissatisfaction with the work  environment, which is felt more acutely in this period of crisis;\r\n\r\n- have transversal competences (team work, communication skills, problem solving attitude),  but only tried in the school environment;\r\n\r\n- have a limited knowledge of the local production system due to the absence of a true contact with the labour market.\r\n\r\nThe mobility experience will be preceded by a thorough linguistic, cultural, pedagogical and sectorial preparation (25 hour distance language training, propaedeutic seminars, orientation to job market or university, 1 module on labour law and work safety, 1 open day with local companies).

This topic is central to the project because it arouses the students' awareness for various approaches to gender pedagogics in the different European countries.\r\n\r\nOne aim is to foster professional competence and social skills in reference to gender pedagogics. All students prepare themselves for their stay in concern to language and culture in meetings over a six-month period. In these meetings students grapple with the project topic and reflect upon methodical and didactical transfer in their future facilities.\r\n\r\nStudents also have to rely on themselves while preparing and organizing the whole stay, so this offers the possibility of personal growth in organizational skills, communication and team competence.\r\n\r\nThe Tellusgroup is our partner in Plymouth and is responsible for the organization of guest families and traineeships. The Bakip (Bildungsanstalt f\u00fcr Kindergartenp\u00e4dagogik) provides for the housing and the traineeships in Linz.

The Project will also enable VETteachers to observe the communication and balance between demand and supply in terms of providing adequate human resources through analyzing the sector\u2019s HR need. In the vocational environment, sectorial experience, thought and point of view, which are special for the field, will certainly redound a new perspective to the education.  The aim of this point of view is to contribute to the gaining of the knowledge skills and gains that demanded by the sector primarily to the teachers which then to be transferred to the students. Increasing the vocational knowledge, cultivation and the competencies of the VET teachers is to contribute to the improvement of all the actors in the VET system. Hence, the skills training of trainers will provide a positive contribution to the improvement of the quality of VET, to provide a closer link between labor market and educational institutions, to the integration with the EU and to the creation of a balance between demand and supply in the labor market will also enable the participants to provide appropriate competencies for these priorities.

The most important thing for the participants is that they know how to transfer information and they interiorize the information by seeing and applying. Without application, no information is persistent. Hence the Project expects participants to do and learn and interiorize the information they learn.

The will have international experience  which will add also credibility to their future activity in the field of educational environment related to conflict potential and violence management.

During the training period the students will be acquainted with the company work organization and using information technology at work, they will broaden their knowledge gained at school and they will get to know the market economy. They will see other organization solutions and company management models in a multicultural environment.

Those internships give them the opportunity to discover other procedures and equipment or to diversify their work experience because in France they most often do their internship in food industry laboratories, medical or cosmetic laboratories. \r\nAs for  our pupils studying to become salespersons, they can do their internship in retail outlets, supermarkets such as SuperValu in Bandon or in catering shops such as On the pig's back in Douglas. \r\nIn fact, the teachers who had accompanied the pupils last October-November 2013 during their stay in Ireland had to try and find some places of internships for the pupils studying sales.

The objectives are to improve the participants' competences, develop more effective training methods and help close the gap between vocational training and entrepreneurship. It is expected that the project will positively contribute to the fight against youth unemployment by encouraging the young people to engage in entrepreneurial activities and improving their skills in that field.\r\n\r\nAs an overriding objective, the project is seeking to address the issue of youth unemployment.  Currently, Italy is facing one of the highest rates of youth unemployment in the EU. Promotion of entrepreneurship is one of the solutions to fight unemployment among the young. Entrepreneurial education can strengthen problem solving skills, improve the ability to analyse and develop business ideas and  increase confidence in starting a new business. Effective entrepreneurship promotion and teaching is very important in attaining these results and can be achieved by improving knowledge and competences of VET school teachers and business incubator mentors.\r\n\r\nThis staff mobility project aims to support professional development of its participants by improving their competences and knowledge in the field of entrepreneurship and in a new environment. Through the exchange of best practices, it intends to develop more effective training methods of VET teachers and business incubator mentors. The project also aims to address the existing gap between vocational training, employment and entrepreneurship by promotion and improvement of entrepreneurial education in VET centres.

One of its priorities is the promotion of teaching and learning of foreign languages among teachers and students. As a consequence, there is an increasing number of Primary and Secondary multilingual schools in Navarra, which teach different subjects in English (CLIL approach-Content and Language Integrated Learning).\r\nAmong all the Primary multilingual schools, which are called PAI (ELP-English Learning Programme) in Navarra, there is an important core of small rural schools  in a disadavantaged situation due to their small size and their geographical location, with limited access to the learning of foreign languages in comparison to other urban and much larger schools. Due to its orography, Navarra shows a big geographical dispersion. The students living at those locations are in a clear disadvantaged position. These schools have a small number of teachers, who must often work in more than one school at the same time. In order to guaranty the equality of opportunities, the Department for Education aims at the participation of this kind of schools in different programmes promoting the teaching and learning of foreign languages, as included in the spirit for the internationalization of the Education system in Navarra. Once the needs of these schools, concerning their internationalization and their teachers' training have been detected, and taking into account their limited means so as to to be able to to manage this kind of projects, the Department for Education has decided to lead this School Education Consortium. \r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\nThis Consortium consists of 4 members, all of them being rural schools that work through the CLIL approach.

Students will be given two options concerning the duration of these stays abroad: they can either spend 6 weeks abroad using the obligatory four-week-workplacement of the respective training scheme and adding two weeks of the Easter holidays or they spend four months abroad after the completion of  their training.  Many of our students have difficulties in finding access to the labour market or to apprenticeships because the can not or only with a lot of effort achieve the formally required qualifications (school leaving certificates). These students often perfom well in practical tasks but less well when challenged with theoretical knowledge. They often lack self-confidence and/or misjudge their own skills and knowledge. Additionally, even students who have few problems at school increasingly need to gain experience abroad if they consider studying at a university or a  university for applied sciences because  employers  expect mobility of their employees and especially of those with a degree. As our school is situated in the German-Dutch border region all our students will have an increasing number of contacts to people in or from other countries as future employees. However, many students have not considered living and working abroad for a while or working across the border. Furthermore, our students' knowledge of English is often limited when it comes to communication and the contact to other cultures is often restricted to school or a private context. A second foreign language is only rarely learned or used. Our students therefore have the following learning needs: to develop their personalities and realistic job prospects matching their skills; to improve their foreign language and intercultural competences; to realistically assess temporary learning and working abroad as a future prospect. \r\n\r\nProject aims and expected results and effects\r\nThe project aims are derived from the learning needs described above: increase the participants' employability and scholastic aptitude by improving their job-related, personal, foreign language and intercultural competences as well as their mobility. We expect our students to return from their work placements abroad with enhanced self confidence and openmindedness towards life in different countries, dealing with other cultures and foreign languages and also with a clearer idea concerning their future career. All this ideally results in a successful application for a job or an apprenticeship. For the interns doing their workplacement during their training the main aims will be to gain some insight into working life, to experience themselves in a professional environment and acquire some job-related skills. For students doing their internships after their training the focus will be on the extension of the skills and knowledge gathered during their school-based training. Apart from these future and hard-to-measure results we expect tangible results in the form of an internship documentation in German which contains some parts in English or Spanish, e. g. a film or sound recording, an interview or a power point presentation about the host company.\r\nWe also expect of our partners and of ourselves as sending organisation an extension of our already gained knowledge about international relations and our organisational skills.\r\n\r\nActivities and project procedures\r\nOur beneficiaries will complete internships abroad in the following occupational areas: the  social sector (e.g. creches, senior citizens institutions or youth institutions),  the health sector (e. g. hospitals, surgeries or therapy centres), housekeeping and nutrition (e. g. hotels, restaurants or canteen kitchens).

The students, who train to be a bank clerk, industrial clerk or office clerk, are all in their second year of vocational training. During the course the students are able to improve their language skills in English as well as their knowledge in business administration issues.\r\n\r\nAt the college the students attend lessons every working day between 9.30 am and 4.45 pm. The lessons deal with topics which are related to their vocational training in Germany. The lessons are held by specially trained and experienced teachers from the college. In addition to the daily lessons, the participants have to write out an assignment on a special economic or social-economic topic, which is chosen by them individually. This as well as the final presentation at the end of the course, enhances the language skills immensely.\r\n\r\nConcerning project 2, 12 wholesale and retail clerk trainees take part in a two-week internship in various commercial companies. They will get a close insight into the job-related practical experience and get the chance to interchange with their British colleagues.

The topics are then prepared in English by the student teams, so that they can be presented by them in London respectively Plymouth and the surrounding area during the group excursions. \r\n\r\nAnother major aim of the project is to enlarge the intercultural, social and individual skills of the students.

They will take part in a one-week language course and a two-week work placement with an English company.

Their competence and behaviour are vital for their business partners' impression of their company. But it is also helpful for their personal lives to be able to handle different cultures and new points of view in a respectful and open-minded way. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, staying in Portsmouth will show our students what it is like to live and work in an English city of a size similar to the cities in the German Ruhr area they know. They will learn to be flexible and to live like citizens of their new temporary home. By practising to independently handle their personal and work-related matters in a foreign country, they gain interesting key qualifications for the European labour market.

We are the sending organisation, Tellus is the host. Meetings between the students and the coordinators take place before, during and after the mobility - for an appropriate preparation, realisation and evaluation.\r\n\r\nOur trainees stay with host families who may have up to eight guests from different countries. In this environment, they use English constantly. During the first week, the students take part in a language course which is tailored to their individual competence levels in English. The work placement takes place during weeks two and three. Additional activities (e.g. movie nights, excursions, conversation classes) are offered throughout the stay.\r\n\r\nStudents are provided with useful tips, security information and emergency numbers. They can receive help from Tellus, their host families and us. Insurances include: accident insurance, health insurance, indemnity insurance, travel cancellation insurance and travel interruption insurance.\r\n\r\nAll our trainees receive a Europass mobility document and a certificate for the language course and the work placement.\r\nThey will be asked to present their results to their friends, parents and employers. The results will be published (e.g. in newspapers, on our website, at our school).\r\n\r\nLONG-TERM IMPACT\r\nThe idea of a unified Europe cannot simply be promoted by doing this project once. However, if we get the chance to send students to Portsmouth regularly and successfully, more and more students and companies will hear about this and tell others about its chances.

From 1991 to 2014 sequa has carried out more than 1,900 mobility measures for apprentices, journeymen and professionals in TVET sector. \r\nThe commitment of sequa in the field of occupational mobility began in 1991 with the founding of the SESAM program for journeymen, which was initially restricted to the cooperation between German and French Chambers of Crafts. \r\nGoing abroad allowed the participants to learn new techniques within their occupations in the host country and increased their language skills and intercultural competences. \r\nThe funding opportunities of the EU Leonardo da Vinci programme, now Erasmus+, allowed the extension of the programmes and lead in 2008 to the establishment of the sequa mobility programmes SINDBAD and TRANSDUAL. TRANSDUAL aims at trainees in commercial occupations and supports business language and skills training in France, the UK and Spain. The programme SINDBAD involves apprentices of all professions with internships throughout Europe. Between 2014 and 2016 sequa will implement 592 SINDBAD/TRANSDUAL mobilities.

This underlines the importance of \"Mobility\" within sequa.\r\nAdditionally sequa offers since 2012 mobilities for professionals in Vocational Education. The programme move-it (mobility of vocational educational institutions and trainers) enables individual professionals in Vocational Education to exchange work experiences and techniques with other professionals abroad. These professionals in Vocational Education are important multipliers in mobility.

Children most of all discover their environment through movement, thus giving evidence of the fact that there is such a thing as innate kinetic energy. This activates mental, social, emotional and kinetic development and enhances health and bodily well-being. In his treatise on Salutogenesis Antonovsky discusses factors, positive and negative concerning the well-being of educators of all kinds and their charges in childcare centres and schools. Lack of exercise, for example, might be a risk factor.\r\nAims: The students are to be enabled to recognize children\u2019s need for exercise and bear it in mind when planning activities for them. Children, experts of their own development, can take their own part in attaining health and well-being. It is important to get a feeling of one\u2019s own strength, develop mobility, train endurance, reduce stress, learn how to relax and calm down. What children need for this is enough space, time, teaching materials and suitable methods. Above all it needs trained staff who are in a position to act as guides towards people\u2019s health and mobility. Teaching this is essential as to a person\u2019s general approach to sports and has considerable impact on his or her health and well-being. In the BEP (Bayer. Bildungs- und Erziehungsplan) as well as in the student\u2019s curriculum there are sections bearing on the matter.\r\nActivities / carrying out the project:\r\nThe project theme is to be taught in class in order to give theoretical an methodological-didactic background information. The students on practicum will be given concrete tasks, such as to observe the children closely in regard to their need for exercise an they are to take a closer look at the way the staff at their placement handles matters of health and fitness. The students are to support any health-related measures in cooperation with the supervisor and find out about the framework within which health and well-being are developed. The students have to hand in a portfolio reflecting the measures concerning health activities at their place of practicum. \r\nNumber and qualification of participants: 36 students get the chance of doing a practicum in Ireland, England, France, Austria or Spain, working at childcare centres, nursery schools or primary schools respectively. The students taking part (aged 18-19 years) have already finished a two-year training course leading to tivated, have acquired some knowledge of English and are able to do an educational abroad practicum successfully. They apply after having been informed about the practicum abroad by teachers and by participants of the year before. Those who take part are thirdyear students, chosen according to personal qualification (assessment/commitment). Two month before leaving for their practicum they ate informed about their individual place, which age group they are going to teach etc. They are expected to prepare on their own, but there are meeting in advance providing information as to travelling arrangements, accomodation, features of their respective places of practicum. They will have to work 5 days a week, about 7 hours daily. During their stay abroad they are in close contact with the N\u00f6rdlingen college \u2013 the have to report back at least once a week \u2013 and are looked after by the local supervisors who are in contact with the college as well.

The project offers the participants insights into the concept of \u201cinternationalization\u201d and broadens the base for \u201cEurope-work\u201d at the Rvw-BK.  Currently the project has the following enrollment: 18 participants focusing on business studies and modern languages preparation with additional qualification as bilingual secretary; 34 participants doing a three-year-course in Health and Social Care / Childcare training to be nursery nurses  and 4 participants focusing on wholesale/retail and industrial management.  These participants are scheduled to attend a 4/8 week internship in a European country.  Additionally, there will be 22 staff/faculty members attending a three-day- mobility-phase  in the respective countries.  For the first time, faculty from the technical disciplines will also be in attendance. The goal of this faculty-mobility-activity is to initiate a co-operation with European partners, which will in turn enable 2 students to participate in the placements in phase two.\r\nThe project content has been further developed from the last year\u2019s project.  The content addresses discipline-specific topics.  For the pedagogic field, the placement focus is on the current discussion \u201cchange of pedagogic philosophies and their impact on early child development\u201d.  The new philosophy changes the understanding of the teacher\u2019s role in relation to the child.  The teacher takes the role of \u201cthe one learning from the child\u201d, aiming to support the child in their development and learning process by involving them in decisions based on their current capabilities.  The project goal is to examine this question through a European lens.  To do so, the participants will observe and practise the methods and processes during their placement.  The faculty will learn from their peers and bring back impulse to improve faculty development.  Both activities will be linked closely to obtain the best possible results. This project goal is in line with the RvW-BK European partnership work.\r\nIn the discipline of business administration and economics, the focus is on \u201cwork-life-balance\u201d (WLB) and how one attains this while participating in career, family and social activities.  The participants will study existing work-time models and develop recommendations based on their findings.  The study will have the following elements:  interviews of peers and supervisors with the aid of questionnaires; discussions with supervisors about economic and demographic challenges in their host country; analysis of the differences in WLB expectations by age group and with reference to the various work-time models and comparison of their findings in the host country to those of students who did their work placements in Germany.\r\nThe faculty members of the technical departments will focus on interactive teaching structures at the partnering facilities, preferably with heterogeneous learning groups that are aiming to improve and  self-learning.\r\nThe close linkage between student placement and faculty visits guarantees the quality of the project.  Structured activities and tasks (\u201cAGENDA\u201d) bring it all together.  The results will help to improve the teaching and didactic structures of each discipline.

The EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people take advantage of the opportunities open to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET schemes are a particular focus of this commitment, and the Member States recently set a target of enabling 6% of all learners in initial VET to have completed a period of VET study abroad by 2020. \r\n\r\nIn line with these objectives and European policies, through GREEEN II, I.I.S (Institute of Higher Education) MERLONI MILIANI of Fabriano aims to improve the quality of education and vocational training, giving a European dimension to the learning paths and thus providing the young participants the opportunity to test and improve their skills: professionalism in the specific areas of vocational education (renewable energy and environment), cultural knowledge and linguistic preparation.

From our teaching experiences, it emerges that the most widespread deficiencies among students aged 15 to 19 are the loss of enthusiasm about their future and the lack of connection of their studies to the needs of the labour market. In a society where the youth (aged 15-24) unemployment rate rose from 10,0 % in 2012 to 43,2.% in 2014 (ISTAT), students consider the learning experience too far from real life and not linked to the world of work . In this changing and complex context , teachers have multiple roles to perform : they are expected to be not only knowledge transmitters but also coaches, facilitators, learning mentors, guidance counselors. To fulfil all these roles professionally, teachers need to be competent in their responsibility towards their students both inside and ouside the classroom  at all levels: local, national and international level.OBJECTIVES It is our project priority to create a  group of highly motivated, well-prepared school professionals, closely linked to the world of enterprises and business and able to meet the challenge of bridging education and training to employment in a European perspective at the same time helping students increase  their  self-esteem, employability  and entrepreneurship.We want to offer a multi-level/inter-institutional training to a group of our talented professionals : they will spend one week abroad  job shadowing VET teaching techniques, exploring models of apprenticeship /Internship and experiencing job placement techniques at VET schools and organisations, enterprises and training centers in Plymouth, Devon, United Kingdom.Upon their return they will be able to transmit their improved/acquired skills to create a quality \u201cCareer Guidance and Counseling Service\u201d and a quality \"Internship Service\"at school in order to reduce the GAP between Education, Training and Employment.Experience and expertise of grant holders will lead to a higher degree of innovation in teaching and research, as well as an increase of international cooperation capacity at both personal and institutional level.NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS : 15 in 3 different fluxes of departurePROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS : Participants are all VET schools teachers DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIESThe Project planned activities are the following:- Job shadowing ( consisting in  peer coaching, peer learning and peer review activities ) /observation activities at VET schools on VET school subjects of the teachers' Sectors;- Workshops of self-reflection activities on teaching- learning practices in the field of Career Guidance and Counseling ;- Job shadowing/observation activities  at Enterprises and Hotels hosting learners on their apprenticeship;- Job shadowing/observation activities at Training centers/Job centers.TITLE OF THE TRAINING ACTIVITY IN THE LANGUAGE OF TUITION : BETOE - Bridging Education and Training to EmploymentTYPE AND ORIGIN OF THE TRAINING ACTIVITIES: JOB SHADOWING/OBSERVATION PERIOD aimed at VET StaffTHEMATIC FIELDS OF THE TRAINING: Career guidance and counseling ; Combating failure in education;Fight against school failure & link school and wor; Employment support.LANGUAGE USED FOR THE TRAINING: English LANGUAGE VERSION(S) IN WHICH MATERIALS WILL BE PRODUCED: English- ItalianMETHODOLOGY The project will make use of  Peer Learning Activities ( PLAs), related to Peer Coaching and Peer Reviewing Activities  in a variety of higly motivating European contexts both formal and non- formal , offering ful immersion into a European socio-economic environment.RESULTS AND IMPACT Remarkable impacts and results are expected on teachers partcipating/ beneficiaries, on the participanting organisations , on the Community and the Territory.

This partner will also provide cultural and linguistic activities for the participating students.\r\nIn terms of results, it is expected that this project allows participants to increase their employability skills, being quickly integrated into the labour market (comparing with non-participants) and that teachers update their technical knowledge.\r\nIn terms of organization, it is expected that these activities and subsequent learning contribute to the modernization and innovation of the organization itself and the services it provides, empowering ATEP\u00b4s image as a dynamic, forward-looking institution, with Europe on the horizon. \r\nFinally, it is expected that, long-term, this project will reinforce work methodologies and international exchange, enabling experiences that make the difference in students' lives, both professionally and personally.", "http://www.tellusgroup.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-PT01-KA102-012603_1"], ["6LF", "AVE PLUS", "TELLUS EDUCATION GROUP LIMITED", 86230.0, "The AVE PLUS Project aims to promote the mobility of learners for learning purposes, as well as meeting the needs identified in the Ave Region.

Experiments with mobility in the United Kingdom have already addressed these needs and fixed objectives.  \r\nToday, in order to pursue our commitment to encourage young people to broaden their horizons and to value their professional training, we are presenting this mobility project from Plymouth in the United Kingdom. \r\n\r\nOur target group consists of 24 students, doing the first part of the Professionnal Baccalaur\u00e9at in administrative management. Since middle school most of these students have given up studying another language and feel that it is of little or no importance to their future career to speak other languages.\r\nThese students, lacking confidence in their academic and personal abilities, have difficulty studying and accept jobs with very little job security so that they can stay in a familiar environment and social circle.\r\nA pilot group made up of teachers and administrative staff runs and supports this project. Our aim is to address the needs which we identified from our student\u2019s profiles:\r\n\r\n- Offer a concrete approach to learning languages and avoid disengagement by putting in place activities which show the importance of learning English. \r\n\r\n- Introduce the concept of a Professionnal Baccalaur\u00e9at in administrative management through educational projects which develop initiative, self reliance, an appreciation of their own abilities and better interpersonal skills. \r\n\r\n- Increase the professional horizons of students from rural areas. \r\n\r\n- Help these students to be mobile by giving them confidence and by making them a driver of the project.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n\r\n- Improve how we teach and learn the English language with activities throughout the whole school: preparatory workshops \u2018Move your CV\u2019 plus hours of non linguistic work to prepare the student to be mobile (linguistic, educational and cultural). Organise activities with a European theme (a direct link with teaching how a project is professionally managed). Key learning points are identified which give a structure to teaching the English language.\r\n\r\n- Avoid educational disengagement thanks to a project, which includes professional administration management training, and increases self esteem both at a personal and an educational level.\r\n\r\n- Give added professional value by increasing employability and complementary experience in Europe thanks to the mobility necessary (increased unemployment amongst young people). \r\n\r\nThis project will allow our students studying administrative management to put into practice their skills organising events showing the importance of European citizenship and increasing their knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe students will improve their communication skills and will understand and use a language adapted to the professional needs of this sector (written and oral communication, commercial activities). This requires total immersion in the environment at Plymouth: one French student per business and per host family. Obtaining the EuroPro award with the \u2018Mobility\u2019 option on the Bac Pro diploma proves the benefits of a professional training.  \r\n\r\nThe consequences and the advantages for the students are:\r\n\r\n-A Professional Baccalaur\u00e9at in administrative management including EuroPro with a mobility option.\r\n-Learn how to speak conversational English with ease.\r\n-Gain self-confidence, independence, maturity and responsibility\r\n-Cultural awareness and personnel development\r\n-Regain confidence in the educational system with a view to undertaking further studies.\r\n-Added professional value \r\n\r\nAs part of a policy to be more accessible to Europe in our school, the success of this project should consolidate the work undertaken to reconcile students to learn foreign languages, and encourage new mobility projects to other countries and in new professional sectors.

Indeed, because of the low level of English of the students (A1 instead of B1 demanded by the companies), some of the companies could not unforunately maintain the students in their internship, which brought some harm on a professional and educational level on one side. On the other side, that period of time abroad helped the students to move from level A1 to level A2 at the end, thanks to the organization of language courses which happened instead of the internship in companies. \r\n\r\nFrom now on, to avoid these types of  incidents ant to enable our participants who go for mobility projects to carry on their internship in companies in the best conditions, so that they can reach the professional standards described within the frame of reference of their initial course and part of their exam, I have decided with the help of the language coordinator, to organize a language Challenge within our school, which will at the end, allow us to select 15 A levels  or NVQ level 1 students from all the different sections with an A2 or a B1 level. \r\n\r\nUntil now only tne students from the electronics and numerical system students had been involved in the mobility projects.

The trainings range from the 9th grade to the HND.\r\nWe are actively taking part in the international field.\r\nIn 2008, we opened a European branch for two main reasons. First, we were aware of the necessity to bring back together our students and the learning of foreign languages, especially English. Also, we felt the need to offer them a window on the world.\r\nConsequently, a group of teachers and the board of directors decided to enrol in a mobility approach. Since 2009, we successfully carried out several mobility projects.\r\n- 5 \u201cL\u00e9onardo\u201d,\r\n- 6 \u201chosting a Comenius assistant\u201d two effective hosts,\r\n- 1 \u201cComenius multilateral\u201d with one visit to study the project, \r\n- 1 \u201cComenius teacher mobility\",\r\n- several trips to England and Ireland,\r\n- 2 partnerships with American high schools,\r\n- exchange of trainees (Sweden, Norway).\r\nWe got more and more organised and structured : an international team of about 20 persons was formed, with a consistent assignment of tasks, according to each person\u2019s skills and wishes. This sharing of tasks is visible on an organization chart. Also, we have created a working schedule based on our previous experiences and this programme constitutes our guide for the school year.\r\nRegarding our investment and the continually growth of our actions, our headmaster appointed a referent for the mobilities and granted 5 hours a week for this person. He also provided the team an office with a computer and a phone.\r\n\r\nThanks to our experience, we know that we can trust the seriousness and the efficiency of our partners who are with us from the beginning of this adventure. However, we are constantly trying to improve our existing collaborations and we are always looking for new partners.\r\nThe mobilities are intended for the first-year-students who joined the \u2018European section\u2019 of our school for the school years 2014 or 2015. The number is estimated at 63. These volunteers have 2 more hours a week in their timetable : one hour for an English class and one hour for the Non linguistic subject. Therefore they practise their English more intensively and they are more sensitive to the international opening. Most of the time, they are not familiar with trips abroad and often they are not very academic so they live up this experience as a real opportunity which leaves a long-term mark.\r\nAs they are in a vocational school, they must undergo several periods of work placements. We thought it would be interesting for them to experience an immersion through a work placement in a company related to their studies. The 2nd year is the most appropriate moment, for they would have gained the professional autonomy necessary to work.\r\n\r\nGenerally we organized this mobility on 5 weeks (3 in Norway), including a period of adaptation to their new environment. The participants will attend language lessons: about a dozen of initiation hours, either within our school, before the mobility (for the Norwegian and Swedish partnerships) or on site (for the other partners) so that our students get familiar with the technical English they will need during their work placement. We encourage them to open up to the host culture (visit museum, take part to different events such as Easter...). Then, they rapidly integrate the company which was attributed according to their professional field, curriculum vitae and cover letter. Then, they must fit in the working team, do the tasks expected by the tutor and the teacher.\r\n\r\nWe aim at several objectives but the main ones are focused on our pupils. What we principally expect is : the upgrading of their professional path, a better motivation to learn other languages, their improvement in English, better marks at their English exam. On their baccalaureate diploma, they will get an added value thanks to the obtaining of the European distinction and the optional mobility unit.\r\nWe noticed that most of the participants go on with their studies, find more easily a work placement or summer jobs in the short term, and in the medium term, we observed that they are better integrated in the working world. They allow themselves more varied ways.\r\n\r\nThe school is identified as a go-ahead school in terms of international opening. Our commitments and results help keeping some of our labels such as \u2018Lyc\u00e9e des M\u00e9tiers\u201d and \u201cQualyc\u00e9e\u201d.

As a result, fewer students continue their education after secondary school, and not even all of them take the exams. After examining the problem we tried  to solve it on many levels, but in-depth analysis in the form of interviews and surveys showed that the primary cause of failure is lack of motivation for learning, lack of faith in students' own abilities and lack of prospects for the future. An additional problem is a nationwide trend, which is  the popularity of general education over vocational training among junior high school students. To change this situation, we have developed a project whose main goal is to increase students' motivation to develop knowledge and improve skills, gain new skills, improve language skills: English and German, increase the mobility of participants, increase their chances on European and national labor market, increase self-esteem, increse intercultural competences, improve the quality and attractiveness of vocational education in the school and in the region, prevent early school leaving and reduce failure in education. Thanks to the cooperation with a partner school in Germany and the training of job-shadowing, our employees will expand their professional competence and language. They will  develop their skills in the diagnosis of pupils' needs and learn more attractive teaching meathods. The cooperation will contribute to the exchange of best practices, gaining experience through practical activities and ability to cooperate at the international level. On the basis of the experience of the German school we will develop a system that will contribute to diagnosing and assisting students with educational problems more professionally. The project is also  a preparation for the planned strategic partnership in the field of education, training and youth, which we intend to participate in the partner institution. \r\nThe most important results of the project will include obtaining Europass Mobility certificate , obtaining ECVET points, acquiring new skills, improving language skills and filling in the European Language Passport, increasing the mobility of participants, increasing students' chances on European and national labor market, increasing self-esteem and motivation to learn, which will help to reduce the number of early school leavers, learn intercultural competences among students and teachers, improve the quality and attractiveness of vocational education in the school and in the region, as well as the preparation to the strategic partnership in the future.", "http://www.tellusgroup.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-PL01-KA102-014790_1"], ["6LF", "M\u0142odzie\u017c z pasj\u0105 - kszta\u0142cenie zawodowe na po\u0142udniu Europy", "TELLUS EDUCATION GROUP LIMITED", 54780.0, "The Participants of the Project will be 30 students of Zespol Szkol Gastronomiczno-Hotelarskich in Bytom: a technician of hotel industry, a technician of nutrition and household.

In addition, the project assumptions are dictated by the policies of the Ministry of Education and meet the horizontal and structural priorities.The main objective of this project is to prepare teachers to participate in foreign trainings through participation in courses which improve language skills or allow to learn new languages in striving of multilingualism. It is planned to organize four language courses: English (beginner and pre-intermediate level in the UK), Spanish (beginner level in Spain) and Italian (beginner level in Italy). In addition, an English teacher will take part in observation of the work of a foreign language school, called job shadowing. These courses and observations will help to improve the quality of teaching at Polish school, because on the basis of received information it is advisable to introduce elements of a foreign language during vocational subjects and humanities (elements of CLIL), as well as using the latest teaching methods and techniques of a foreign language observed abroad. The project will also contribute to broaden the horizons and worldview, to skill sharing with teachers from other European countries and promoting the concept of lifelong learning. Teachers will be able to familiarize themselves with various education systems in Europe. The next objective will be to establish new international contacts and increase teachers\u2019 involvement in the development of new application forms of European Programme, as well as sharing their experience from a language course abroad with students going for training abroad.In order to prepare for departure, each participant will have the opportunity to take part in the cultural preparation and short language course in Poland. When it comes to language courses organized abroad, they will be prepared and carried out by an organization Tellus Education Group from the UK which has extensive experience on the international market in organizing language, methodical and professional courses, not only in England, but also in Italy, Spain and Poland. The project activities have been planned so as not to interfere with the work schedule at school, so the dates within which the courses will be organized include a period of winter and summer vacations. During the project essential tests will be carried out to assess the level of participants\u2019 language skills (before and after the course), as well as other forms of assessing their progress in order to achieve the best results.For the purpose of the project,  European School Development Plan for 2016-2018 was developed and adopted by the teaching staff. It describes various stages of activities related to the preparation, implementation and dissemination of the project. All activities undertaken during the project implementation will be monitored by the project coordinators. There are several methods that will be used in order to obtain it: direct observation of the language courses, current interviews with project participants and an analysis of information posted on websites, facebook and publications connected with the dissemination process. In order to assess the activities and results of the project an analysis of the results of the survey conducted among the participants after the course completion will be interpreted. The project itself and its results will form the foundation for future projects offering further training for staff working in the school.Project activities will bring numerous additional benefits, not only for all participants, but also the whole teaching staff, such as increase in the teachers\u2019 mobility, improving language skills, the development of tolerance and openness to other cultures, overcoming prejudice and stereotypes, familiarizing with work in different linguistic and cultural conditions, as well as the ability to work in an international environment. In addition, it will enrich the educational offer of the school.

This problematic situation leads directly to the most important goal of the project \u2013 improving the employability of apprentices, students in full-time vocational training as well as those who have just completed their vocational training course. We want to reach this goal by offering the target group customized high-quality learning settings abroad. To achieve this we will continue cooperating with the vocational schools, the apprentices\u2019 companies, the Chamber of Commerce as well as with the trade unions and professionals\u2019 organisations. To flank the achievement of these goals we aim to strengthen the competences of the professionals working in schools (particularly at the management level), so they can better aid the young learners to enter the European employment more successfully.An overriding objective of the project is to increase the integration of participants with a migrational background, who are young parents or who are disadvantaged learners into the work force.The following are the main activities we will offer the youths mentioned above:- internships abroad for the youths in their fields- project work abroad for the youths on topics related to participants' vocational fields A majority of the participating youths will be from the following fields: clerical occupations, media, hotel, gastronomy, carpenters/joiners.These main activities will supported by the following flanking activities offered to professionals and student teachers in vocational training centers in Berlin: - Advanced and further training abroad with the topic \u201cprofessionalizing the teacher\u2019s acting in the classroom on the European level aiming to better prepare students for the European job market\u201d.- Professional development training for school management staff regarding \u201cstudents with special needs\u201d.- Training for student teachers with the focus on \u201eLearning from the Best in Europe \u2013 enhancing methodical expertise!\u201d- Training for future school management staff: \u201cHow to successfully develop a vocational training school/institution\u201dOur GoEurope mobility network encompasses 30 different partner organizations in 10 EU countries plus Turkey.

They are well connected with the vocational training centers and political institutions in their respective regions. As soon as the decisive parameters of a mobility flow have been defined with our local training institutions the project is actively promoted to the target group and participants are selected from the applicants. As soon as the participants for a particular flow have been secured the partner organization in the host country is commissioned with carrying out the preparations for the flow. The quality of each flow is ensured by a number of measures, e. g. mid-term reports, evaluation meetings, accompanying visits and/or a preparatory visit. The most desired outcome of the stay abroad is always to improve the participants' employability (roughly 10 % of our participants even receive a job offer abroad), improved social integration of participants who are young parents, have a migrational background or learning disabilities, improved proficiency in foreign languages as well as personality development.

Both of the school\u2019s locations are situated in major economically important areas near Cologne. Our cooperation with many successful and internationally active companies in the fields of agricultural machinery, chemistry and the metalworking industry demands a vocational training which prepares trainees, and the teaching staff as well for the challenges of a growing European job market. The GEK is a European School which highly values on their European oriented education. One example is the variety of language courses on offer such as English, Dutch, French and Spanish. We consider it to be important that our students have the opportunity to use these languages in real-life professional situations. These take place during a three week internship work placement abroad.Here, our project background and our project objectives are closely linked. The VET mobilities of trainees as well as trainers lead to an increased cross-cultural understanding of a common Europe.The experiences of our students abroad lead to a higher self-confidence and encourage them to seek for job possibilities beyond their country borders. Another project objective is that \u201cEurope\u201d is part of the school\u2019s curriculum. Lessons in various subjects deal with topics that are relevant for a European way of thinking. This is supported by the school\u2019s annual European week which offers the students a variety of projects focusing on Europe.   With the start of ERASMUS+, the GEK is able to offer almost 100 mobility participants the chance to travel and work abroad in 2016/17. This is the largest number of participants so far and follows the plans of our district council in Cologne to raise the number of vocational mobilities to 10%.  These participants are for example technicians for illumination advertisements, electricians for automation engineering, chemical lab assistants, metal workers and technical assistants in the field of design.So far we have organized VETPRO-projects for trainers and teachers which took them to our partners abroad for one week. Last year they worked under the title \u201cTeaching the European Way\u201d. Our IVT-projects under the title \u201cDifferent Places-Different Faces\u201d enabled our students to work for three weeks in Finland, Rumania, Malta, Great Britain and on the island of La Palma.All those activities are now coming together with ERASMUS+ and the GEK is now offering future participants to work under the title \u201cIVT quality+\u201d. In addition to our student mobility under KA1, we also succesfully applied for a KA2 strategic partnership. But the GEK does not only send students abroad, we also welcome our partner school\u2019s students from Finland here in the Rhineland area. The teachers and trainers of the GEK organize accommodation and internships with our cooperating companies in the field of electrical engineering, chemistry and design. These internships usually last from four to six weeks.Our project implementation has been consistently improved and is now divided into 3 main stages: The first stage is the application phase. In this stage students qualify by participating in cross-cultural preparation lessons. Here they also create a europass CV in English and pass a mobility interview, to show their motivation to work abroad. This stage ends in an intercultural evening which prepares all the participants for their upcoming departure day.The second stage is their actual stay abroad. During this time, the students are monitored, both by the local partners as well as the responsible teachers and trainers of the GEK. The participants document their linguistic, social, personal and professional impressions and experiences in a travel diary called \u201cTravelog\u201d. It is an important instrument of the third stage of the mobility project. This is where the evaluation of the experience abroad is going to take place. With the help of the Travelog their gained competence are documented and can be comprehended. Later on these competences are evaluated in our competence overview, which are used to fill out the europass Mobility certificate.The project results, their benefits as well as their impact are closely related. The Europass Mobility is one example. It is used for future applications by our trainees after the end of their vocational training, as well as by our teaching staff for better career chances. This document increases their career prospects on both the national and European job market.

Italy sports a high number of galleries whose offers are highly sought after by both national and international clients. In a European context, this clientele is used to deal with a professional figure generally known as the Art Gallery Manager, as distinct from the Gallery\u2019s owner. The AGM is responsible for the day to day management of the Gallery, liaises with clients and artists, chooses the works of art, co-ordinates the setting up of exhibitions, evaluates the possible risks involved in any of the activities and devises budgets. In Italy, as well as abroad, the job market of professions linked to the art world and to that of cultural heritage has undergone many changes over the last few years. Whereas in the past these profiles would traditionally be drawn from an almost exclusive humanities background, today both museums and galleries call for more managerial roles with cross competencies that vary from artistic knowledge to commercial awareness to legal and financial skills. It is because of this that it has been made sure that the Schools taking part to the Project offer different curricula options, especially in view of the fact that coming from diverse academic backgrounds can only add value to the composition of such complex role as that of the AGM.The Consortium makes provisions that the activities planned to take place both during the VET traineeships abroad and the preparation phase are personalised according to the different academic backgrounds of the students taking part, to favour cross-fertilisation. This, in the underlying belief that each different field can act as a complement to the other ones and the students can only benefit from being exposed to a more holistic view. The final goal being that at the end of the experience, all the students taking part would have acquired the same level of skills and competencies regardless of their academic background, by going through comparable learning experiences that would complement and supplement their original ones.Thirty bodies from five different countries, Italy, Malta, Spain, Slovenia and the UK, take part to the Project. The national Consortium is composed of 26 bodies of which 18 are the Secondary Schools sending partners from the Lazio region (16 Licei Secondary Schools and 2 Technical Secondary Schools).The Project aims to achieve three macro-objectives:1. In the preparatory phase, to provide all the students taking part with the professional competencies that will complement their academic background and will allow them to approach more confidently the VET learners traineeships in companies abroad and enhance their overall experience abroad;2. To facilitate the access of the students taking part to the job market, through professional skill building activities that will take place during the 3 weeks of mobility abroad, in co-operation with museums, galleries and local bodies that already avail themselves of the help of this professional figure. Each of the 18 sending Schools will select 10 students and an accompanying tutor for a total of 180 students taking part to the Project. The choice of offering VET learners traineeships stems from the belief that in order to take proper advantage of an experience with real professional skill building outcomes the students need to learn \u201con the field\u201d how to develop their own skills and competencies and how to network in the job market.3.

ICTs are having a highly significant impact on manufacturing processes with ICT enabled processes such as computer integrated manufacturing, \u201cdigital factories\u201d, etc. Companies require the adoption of new internationalisation strategies aimed not only at cost reduction but at quality improvement and more advanced techniques.Against this background teachers agree on the manifold benefits of work-based learning experiences abroad allowing learners to enrich and expand classroom learning, to show them how concepts and theories are applied in practical situations in multicultural working contexts; to offer learners access to tools, equipment and facilities generally not available in schools. The project fits into school-work alternance scheme aimed at providing learners\u2019 with supervised hands-on, curriculum-related working experiences. A school-work alternance experience abroad means a whole set of different requirements for a student compared to a work placement in the home country.

Another point is that our students should be able to meet the demands of today\u2019s job market; hence, work placement is one of the steps to their future careers.TEN STEPS TO SUCCESSStep 1: Motivation: students get familiarised with the idea that mobility can improve their employability in the future.Step 2: Application: students write covering letters, fill up application forms for K1, which might serve as a mock application in their recruitment process.Step 3: Writing CVs: students are taught how to write good CVS to become eligible candidates.Step 4: Role-play: students take different roles in job interviews.Step 5: A job interview: taken at work-placement abroad; provided by our partner agenciesStep 6: Testing professional terminology: students are expected to use professional terms in different contexts.Step 7: Taking work placement.Step 7: Evaluation: carried out by both students and their mentors. Students are given immediate feedback.Step 8 Final evaluation (via Skype) all the parties involved: students, mentors (abroad and at \u0160CNM), \u0160CNM project manager and a training officialStep 9: Certification Logistics and partnership:Work placements will take place in Malta, the UK, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Germany. Criteria for the selection of partners/agencies are determined by our previous cooperation. These agencies are striving to ensure that the training is relevant, engaging and tailored to specific/individual needs. One must not forget that most of the anticipated students\u2019 mobilities will be taken for the first time; therefore it is important to guide the students through the whole process of recruitment and the programme. All the arrangements will be taken care of by the \u0160CNM project manager and will include the plans for accommodation, itinerary, insurance, possible emergency situations. Furthermore, she is also responsible for finances, contracts and agreements, contacts with the partnership agencies and for supervising the entire placement. Assessment:Students will assess their own progress at work placement by filling in adapted ECVET formsAccompanying personsDue to safety regulations and demands on the part of some partners in Germany, the UK and Ireland, the students will be provided by accompanying teachers.This means that in the above-mentioned countries, the students will be supervised by two mentors (a teacher-trainer from \u0160CNM and a mentor in a company), by a project manager at \u0160CNM. The accompanying teacher will take care of professional skills; the mentor at a company will be focused on health and safety issues, on delivered tasks and will also give advice when necessary.", "http://www.tellusgroup.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-SI01-KA102-021502_3"], ["6LF", "New skills for the future", "TELLUS EDUCATION GROUP LIMITED", 87785.0, "The project \u201cNew Skills for the future\u201d is based on the principle that a capable and competent professional has, today (and tomorrow), technical and personal characteristics different from the ones that were valued a few years ago. It is currently valued technical knowledge, acquired through formal learning, but also the experiences of non-formal and informal learning, desirably transversal. Personally, we pursue autonomy and responsibility but also flexibility, dynamism and proactivity, abandoning the idea of a \"job for life\".Therefore, in a complex, changing labour market where it is not always easy for young people to enter, due to their lack of experience, there is a need to provide young people with differentiating tools for the transition to working life.With this project we aim to enable 35 students and recent graduates from ATEP professional courses (level IV of the European Qualifications Framework) to contact with the world of work abroad (Spain and England), through traineeships in a partner entity. With this experience we intend to develop student\u00b4s employability profile in order to facilitate their entry into the world of work, namely:- develop autonomy and responsibility, just by being \"outside\"; - develop technical skills in a particular area of learning; - develop interpersonal skills through social contacts; - contact with a foreign language and culture as a way to differentiate their learning and experience over other job applicants; - raising awareness of the possibility of working abroad.The project also includes the possibility of three of its teachers of technical areas to carry out training aboard in order to develop its technical profile, namely:- contact with other realities and different ways of working;- upgrade technical skills in a particular area;- promote contact with a foreign language and culture;- improve their technical skills, bringing benefits to the process of teaching-learning.To develop this project, ATEP has a partner (Tellus Education Group e Education&Mobility) that will support the organization / preparation, monitoring and evaluation of the placements, which will be adapted to the participants areas of training.In terms of results, it is expected that this project allows participants to increase their employability skills, being quickly integrated into the labour market (comparing with non-participants) and that teachers update their technical knowledge.In terms of organization, it is expected that these activities and subsequent learning contribute to the modernization and innovation of the organization itself and the services it provides, empowering ATEP\u00b4s image as a dynamic, forward-looking institution, with Europe on the horizon.

Paretners complement each other - schools offer different VET qualifications and coordinator has wide network of EU partners and can offer beneficiaries added value in nonformal education in the area of career guidance. It is the cooperation that allows access to new information, sharing of experience and knowledge, and searching for common solutions. The aim of project Turiec to Europe, Europe to Turiec 2016 is mostly to use current knowledge and experience and formed partnerships for the purpose of maintaining high quality of offered VET, and gaining knowledge, skills and competencies of participants and share the results within schools on regional and national level. Our long term effords are aimed at implementing ECVET elements into mobilities and thus assess and validate the learning outputs (LO) gained abroad. By involving the school management and VET teachers into mobilities we create solid foundation for broader cooperation in next years, not only by sending, but also hosting students and teachers. Also allow participants to improve their language skills and bring new education techniques and design improvments in existing educ.programs. The management of schools is also involved in the mobilities, together with VET teachers they will improve the professional competencies and the students will enhance or gain new LO, in coherence with their qualification. In the preparaton period the students will attend the course of bilan de compet\u00e9nces with BdC counsellor from KABA, thanks to which they will gain overview of their dominant competencies, the importance of setting goals and career orientation based on their strenghts. The main goal of the project in the first phase is to send in 5 turns 24 managers, VET teachers and employees of schools and KABA, who will improve the knowledge in their respective fields, for future implementation in their sending organizations (schools) and also as added value in the cooperation with CZ and UK partners to also prepare detailed vocational program and LO for mobility of students, that is closer described within this project.In second phase will be send 20 students of OAMT in the field business academy in 2 turns to CZ and UK, and 10 students of travel and tourism to companies in CZ. 20 students of SPS will be sent in 2 turns to UK for practice in the fields of logistics and technical lyceum. 10 students of mechatronics and electrotechnics will attend practice in CZ. 20 students from SOSOaS will improve their knowledge, skills and competencies in PL and CZ hotels in the fields cook, waiter, food&drinks and hotel academy and in ES companies  will be placed beautician and hairdresser.

The project aims at broadening the range of this critical part of the studies by providing  placements in an international context. These participants will do their curricular internship period at English/Spanish companies located in Portsmouth and Valencia for 16 weeks.This project combines three needs that must be addressed together in order to achieve an integral European training experience:- Language proficiency (including \"techspeak\");- Bridging school to work environment;- Providing an international experience, qualification and validation to extend the professional prospects of vocational students.OBJECTIVES AND CONTENTS- Young people's mobility in an entrepreneurial context;- European dimension - natural and feasible in a period where teen unemployment is increasing;- Adequate framework at cultural and social level - differences, equality and inclusion must be respected;- Technical knowledge and mastering of the use of specific tools;- Linguistic tools - real development of communication skills in English/Spanish, at work and in social life;- Recognition and validation of competences - Europass;- Effective impact and dissemination to extend the project scope - best practices, follow-ups.NUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS22 students selected among final-year students:3D Digital Drawing (4)Graphic Design (4)IT Management (4)Multimedia (4)Video (4)Electronics & Telecommunications (2)DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIESThe project implies an integral education of the participants through the following activities:- 16-week technical training  acquired in a key area of the course, in a professional company;- Previous linguistic training at school (general and technical English); OLS language assessment and OLS language course, and additional language course during the mobility, organised by our partners; - Social and cultural preparation - meetings with the participants to gain knowledge of the host country (prevent cultural clash)- Human and personal education, naturally built on the experience of the mobility, closely accompanied by the tutor/accompanying person.METHODOLOGY TO BE USED IN CARRYING OUT THE PROJECTThese are the main stages of the project:1. Pre-mobility:- Selection of partners and research for placement companies;- Selection and preparation of participants; - Planning the mobility;- Linguistic preparation and support.2. Mobility- Development of the project at the work placements;- Language course and cultural activities;- Monitoring: accompanying person from EPVR (face-to-face and remote) and partners;- Evaluation.3. Post-mobility- Reports, certificates (including Europass Mobility Document);- Dissemination.SHORT DESCRIPTION OF RESULTS AND IMPACTWe expect to improve students' competences relevant for the labour market, increasing mobility and cooperation between education and the world of work, also fostering our institution's international dimension by promoting European cooperation. This awareness of an European lifelong learning complements our national educational system, making a better use of EU transparency and recognition tools and dissemination of best practices. We will  also increase foreign language proficiency and the use of ICT, and broaden their use at work and in everyday communication.POTENTIAL LONGER TERM BENEFITSBy testing and evaluating in a real working environment, internships buffer the transitional impact from school to work. If that is attained at an international level, with the appropriate linguistic, cultural and social preparation, then the skills obtained to prepare professional life acquire an added value as new opportunities arise in the European labour market. The project also provides these pre-working youngsters a solution that makes up for the saturation of the small and economically recessive Portuguese market in their professional areas, thus providing a widening of their professional expectations. Moreover, the students' linguistic skills will not only improve in the scope of the project, that is, in the specific jargon of their working area, but also in the daily use of the language, thanks to the immersion during the 16 weeks of the mobility. Finally, the contact with a different culture and society, where we will stimulate a path towards independence and autonomy, will equally contribute to a multicultural enrichment.", "http://www.tellusgroup.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PT01-KA102-022413_1"], ["6LF", "Nemzetk\u00f6zi gyakorlatok \u00e9s tapasztalatok a szakk\u00e9pz\u00e9sben", "TELLUS LIMITED", 131519.0, "Background:Trefort \u00c1goston Vocational School and Student Dormitory of B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba Center of Vocational Training has been involved in international projects since 2003.

We believe, therefore, that the promotion of mutual learning opportunities and the sharing of some of our best practices by all participants, whether students, staff or graduate students in professional contexts with social, cultural and linguistic characteristics much different from our reality, will enhance a greater efficiency of our responsibility as a training organisation.This way, taking into account the current context at national and international levels regarding employment, we believe that this application, in particular, and our participation in other European projects like this one, encourages competitiveness policies and entrepreneurship in order to increase employment in a medium and long term period, contributing also to reduce poverty in Europe.Another aspect we consider relevant in this application, is the social aspect we wish to enhance. Actually, we believe that this project is a starting point for participants towards social inclusion and fighting poverty. Our experience shows us that these projects can be an opportunity for disadvantaged participants to experience new professional, cultural and linguistic experiences and even perhaps achieve a future employment status. The participants that will be involved in the planned activities should reach their own increasing needs and professional improvement on one hand, and personal development in the other hand, acquiring also language and cultural skills. The participants may be learners, graduate students or staff, who will be invited to accomplish this type of mobility experiences by contacting with different professional and training realities as opportunities of promoting enrichment and professional training. We intend to involve in this project a amount of 34 participants, 26 learners, 6 members of staff and 2 graduate students. So, the planned activities are addressed to different types of participants: beginning learners, young people who have completed their training and staff willing to acquire skills, answering to the learners and the organisation needs as a whole. The participants at their initial training will realise mobilities with a duration of four weeks. They will be accepted in companies or other organisations which develop a set of tasks that constitute their training plan, previously scheduled for sending, intermediary and host organisations. During the achievement of these training periods, the participants will have the opportunity to improve practices and also acquire new knowledge and contact with different professional backgrounds. Regarding the post-training activities for young level IV technicians (graduates), the training period will be longer than in the case of the learners, as these young people are about to start their working lives. We intend to realise mobilities with a duration of three months for these participants. For this reason, we believe that this project can be also a way to fight against youth unemployment in addition to make up gaps in terms of manpower qualification.Finally, this project is also intended to staff with mobility activities , in order to strengthen or acquire skills, by observing and comparing different practices and working methods or by developing small formative experiences during five days. During the achievement of this project, we will develop a monitoring work of the mobilities of the different groups of participants in a very close way, being possible to maintain a permanent contact between the responsible for the trainee monitoring, whether they are the training or formative tutors or representatives of our partner companies and intermediate schools. Therefore, we believe that the existence of a good strategy for cooperation and communication between all stakeholders is the most important fact fot the success of our planned activities. This strategy starts immediately with the selection of the applicants and the appropriate choice of training places until the execution of the entire evaluation process.As we are living in a changing living context in which the labor market is increasingly competitive, we believe this application will change and stimulate undoubtedly the spirit of entrepreneurship of each one of the participants in this project.This way, we hope being capable of answering, in a long-term way, to some common problems throughout all the European context such as the societies ageing and the existence of gaps in the workforce qualification, as well as the need to monitor all the technological developments in several professional contexts.", "http://www.tellusgroup.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PT01-KA102-022708_1"], ["6LF", "Constru\u00e7\u00e3o e desenvolvimento de compet\u00eancias profissionais e lingu\u00edsticas.

The proposed courses involve  different contents and approaches to foreign language teaching with the use of new tecnologies, thus reaching our objective of overcoming the training needs expressed by the participants, especially by teachers who have the responsibility of teaching vocational course pupils.The main objectives are: 1. To learn new professional practices that will allow for creativity and innovation in the development of vocational aptitude projects;2. To promote the sharing of knowledge, processes and working methods between the pupils and the receiving organizations;3. To develop skills and practices that support problem solving and foster creative and entrepreneurial spirit.4. To develop skills in foreign languages, with a view to improve educational outcomes through the use of innovative methodologies ;5. To contact with other cultures, promoting European citizenship based on the use of multi-language skills.Thus, this project proposal tries to answer the needs felt by  these youngsters to broaden their horizons, to get to know other ways of life, to try new work procedures and methodologies, to improve on their vocational aptitude projects, to develop the domain of other languages, to contact with other cultures, to comply with our entrepreneurial educational approach and to provide evidence that the European Community can offer important labour market possibilities.Mobility will take place in Seville (ES) and Portsmouth (UK) in two periods of six weeks each: between May and June 2017 and between April and May 2018.

These teams, members of the MOPAAM16 project steering committee, will be involved in all the project phases: distribution & preparation of the mobilities, implementation of the mobilities, valorization & dissemination of the project results, project assessment.The MOPAAM16 project is a necessary and ambitious project in an region where challenges are significant.", "http://www.tellusgroup.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA102-023196_9"], ["6LF", "\u0395\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03cc\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0391\u03c3\u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0395\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03ad\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd  \u03c3\u03b5 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2.", "TELLUS LIMITED", 110089.0, "The Greece as one of the most earthquake-prone countries in Europe and is particularly sensitive to issues of earthquake protection and safety.

The region Nord-Pas-de-Calais \u2013 Picardy has nearly 6 million inhabitants, which represents 9.4% of the population of metropolitan France. It is thus the third most populated French area in the new territorial organisation. The new region is characterized by its youth with the highest proportion of under-25-year-olds and student attractiveness.Raising the level of training remains a significant objective for the new region while, at the same time, the number of school leavers without qualifications is still above the national average. While the rate of unemployment is below the national average from the level V, the lack of training is a major handicap in the career and for the integration into the workplace. Improving the level of training, the rise of abilities for employees, the lifelong learning for job seekers, or even strengthening the fight for literacy and preventing from dropping out of school before the first qualification remain major issues. The main objective of the MOBinov 16 project is to foster the mobility of targeted beneficiaries in order to secure their training route and to favour their long-term professional integration. About thirty partner organisations (secondary schools for vocational training, apprentices training centres, training organisms) are going to federate within the consortium and experience joint projects in a sector-based logic.A steering committee, in accordance with a coordinating team, will supervise the implementation of the project.

The project comes out of significant needs of school, which are met by its implementation.The offer of educational programmes at our school has nearly doubled over the past few years and the number of students has increased to the current 880. To meet the educational needs of our students, we extended the number of cooperating organizations in this project up to the current 9 and we have fully covered all the educational programmes taught at our school with mobilities. Apart from several school educational programmes under Applied Chemistry there are some other programmes such as Fire Protection, Security and Legal Studies, Cosmetic Services and apprenticeship Hairdresser. We plan mobilities into six European countries (Germany, Cyprus, Great Britain, Spain, Italy, Slovakia 4x). Our project partners are vocational schools, technical colleges and businesses. With four of our partners we realize reciprocal mobilities.The receiving organizations for students in chemical branches are vocational schools (SBG Dresden, IIS Scalcerle Padova, SOS Chemical Bratislava), two technical colleges (University of Plymouth and the University of Nicosia) and a Spanish pharmaceutical company BIOT Microgen, mediated by Europroyectos LdV Granada.Students in the branch of Fire Protection will participate in an internship at The Secondary School of Construction in \u017dilina, which disposes of excellent technical background in the fire fighting equipment and works closely with the Secondary School of Fire Protection, which will also partake in our students training.Students in the field of Security and Legal Studies pass their practice at the Faculty of Safety Engineering University of \u017dilina, namely the Department of Safety Engineering and the Department of Emergency Engineering.For students of Cosmetic Services and Hairdresser we secured professional experience in beauty and hairdressing salons at Secondary Vocational School (Beauty and Care School).Simultaneously with the increase in number of mobilities, we also strive to raise up the quality. In all mobilities of this project, we will apply the principles of ECVET. Some units of learning outcomes have been created in previous projects and some new are just being created.Within this project we also plan mobilities of pedagogical staff - VET teachers as we believe that professional development of teachers is a prerequisite for quality assurance in education. Besides professional and pedagogical skills of teachers we also want to strengthen their language skills. In this project we want to focus on vocational teachers in the field of Security and Legal Studies who will complete work-programme at the Faculty of Safety Engineering, and vocational teachers in Applied Chemistry who will complete training programme at IIS Scalcerle in Padua.On the side of students we see the impact of the project in the acquisition of new knowledge and skills, strengthening linguistic communication and lexical skills, improving self-confidence and also motivation for further education. Thanks to this experience students gain an overview of the requirements imposed on their profession, learn about possibilities of study abroad and employment on the European labor market.  Through this experience the profile of graduates has been improved, which brings benefit to strategic partners of our school (employers, tertiary education).On the side of school, we see an apparent increase in the attractiveness of school resulting in an increased interest of studying science.

In March 2018, another group of 16 students will go on a 2-week  apprenticeship to Greece. The programs have been developed in close connection with the guidelines of apprenticeship programs based on the curriculum of particular professions, but are to be implemented on the basis of modern facilities and equipment, and focus on learning new technologies and to develop skills particularly desired by the local labor market. Within the project 6 ZS2 vocational teachers will participate in the training  as supervisers. The project is a response to a problem which occurred in our school: poor recruitment to school, poor school performance, and consequently poor performance in professional examinations and Matura examinations. As a result, fewer students continue their education after secondary school, and not even all of them take the exams. After examining the problem we tried  to solve it on many levels, but in-depth analysis in the form of interviews and surveys showed that the primary cause of failure is lack of motivation for learning, lack of faith in students' own abilities and lack of prospects for the future. An additional problem is a nationwide trend, which is  the popularity of general education over vocational training among junior high school students. To change this situation, we have developed a project whose main goal is to increase students' motivation to develop knowledge and improve skills, gain new skills, improve language skills- mostly English , increase the mobility of participants, increase their chances on European and national labor market, increase self-esteem, increse intercultural competences, improve the quality and attractiveness of vocational education in the school and in the region, prevent early school leaving and reduce failure in education.  the teachers will  develop their skills in the diagnosis of pupils' needs and learn more attractive teaching meathods. The cooperation will contribute to the exchange of best practices, gaining experience through practical activities and ability to cooperate at the international level.  The most important results of the project will include obtaining Europass Mobility certificate , obtaining ECVET points, acquiring new skills, improving language skills and filling in the European Language Passport, increasing the mobility of participants, increasing students' chances on European and national labor market, increasing self-esteem and motivation to learn, which will help to reduce the number of early school leavers, learn intercultural competences among students and teachers, improve the quality and attractiveness of vocational education in the school and in the region, as well as the preparation to the strategic partnership in the future.", "http://www.tellusgroup.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PL01-KA102-024320_2"], ["6LF", "Mobilno\u015b\u0107 szans\u0105 na rozw\u00f3j zawodowy i osobisty", "TELLUS EDUCATION GROUP LIMITED", 155633.0, "The promotor of the project is Byt\u00f3w ZSE-U school.The realization is planned for 2017-2018.Our intermediate partners are the Centre of Vocational Training in Schmalkalden,Germany and Tellus Group in Plymouth,England.The receiving organizations will be the leading enterprises in which 50 students will have a 4-week internship in May 2017 and in May 2018.The third-grade students will be having work placements in specialised enterprises in Thuringia in Germany and in exclusive hotels and tourist centres in Hampshire County in England.Moreover, 16 of our graduates will have a 3-month internship from June to August 2017 and 2018.The graduates will have their apprenticeship in the same places as the third-grades.In addition, our intermediate partner is Vitalis Betreuungsgesellschaft f\u00fcr Modellprojekte mbH -Saxony organising a week job shadowing placement for 8 vocational teachers in May 2017 and in May 2018:the one for hotel and catering department teachers-in S.Eger CKZ enterprise, the second for economy and logistics teachers in CSP \u201eZAGWmbH\u201d in Leipzig.

Thus, the project is about to undertake 52 working stays in Irish, Italian, Lithuanian or UK companies and undertake business and management tasks during 5, 8 or 12 weeks as a maximum as participants cannot have longer stays because of personal reasons and the need they have to look for jobs.\r\n\r\n- Teachers and professional staff working for the SEFED Programme: the project allows us to offer a unique opportunity for teachers and professional staff working for the SEFED Programme to be able to share and improve their knwoledge and experiences in a different country and in different organizations, including the transfer of skills and/or methods and innovative ways of doing things in the training field. The transfer of know-how is meant to improve the quality and access to continuous training, to update and adapt the european educational and training systems.

Although mobility is recognised as school-work alternance to all intents and purposes, its duration cannot fully overlap school lessons.  For this reason it can take place with only partial overlapping at the beginning or at the end of the school year, as in the past.  The participants come from different schools where they study technical subjects (Agriculture; Computer Sciences), Economics (Administration, in a Marketing framework; Tourism) and Vocational subjects (Wine and Food and Hospitality services, Rural Development Services). The foreign partners and destinations for this first year of the project with the Erasmus+ Charter have been identified on the basis of past experience, taking into account participants\u2019 needs, the educational opportunities they can offer and their relevance for the project subjects: UK (Reading, Cardiff, Plymouth), France (Nice), Spain (Valencia), and Austria (Vienna).  These are destinations where the management and promotion of tourism and the valorisation of resources are supported by digital technology (typical agricultural products or their transformation, but also cultural and landscape resources). Mobility will be very important for the young participants in an economic context where exports of quality products are particularly significant and at the same time the foreign tourist trade has a relevant market share.  It will assist learning in new contexts different from those of a school laboratory or local enterprise for the development of language skills and to experiment work environments that employ different technologies and job organizations and have different missions.  The experience will make it possible to develop both specific professional and transversal competences: the business environments will stimulate reflection, curiosity and a desire to learn; to promote and increase adaptability and flexibility, autonomy and the ability to work in a team.  Experience in an unknown international context will also be a wonderful opportunity to develop relationship skills, intercultural open-mindedness and personal responsibility, all characteristics necessary to work in the local economy.As at the end of the fourth form many participants are still minors, schools consider it necessary to have them accompanied by a teacher who will act as facilitator and take care of the participants and their safety.All institutes will take part in STAFF mobility.

The certified project \u201cExperiencing Horizons 2010 \u2013 2014 (LLP-LdV-MC-10/S/689) included three schools, later merged into two . When we applied for VET Learner Mobility 2014-KA102-000277, we involved one more school and established a consortium. Through the consortium we instituted a placement network for schools in Landskrona/Sval\u00f6v, also envisioned in the certification application 2010. We have during these years enlarged the number of partners abroad. The school in Sval\u00f6v did not fulfill the criteria for the VET Mobility Charter application 2015 but the second school in the consortium is expected during spring 2016 due to reorganizations, to merge into the school management district of Allvar Gullstrand, the reason for why we from now on will work with this extended school management district, in tot. 7 vocational programs. Allvar Gullstrand works with an internationalization strategy with clear mobility goals with the help of a \u201cSchool ambassador for EU\u201d, educated autumn 2011. These goals are included in the general quality evaluation/development plan of the school.It is important for the students to see more of the outside world to create user friendly and competitive products and services and to attune their professional skills and experiences to European demands and values. We want to increase their innovation abilities, strengthen their vocational qualifications and their employability in Europe where competition no longer has geographical, cultural and linguistic borders. We want to give the students more self-confidence contributing to their personal development. Through the placement abroad we try to expand/extend the horizons for them to explore/ experience and give them an international perspective for their future. The professional world is international and by working at companies abroad during the last placement period with succeeding feedback, discussions, validations (ECVET, Europass) and dissemination at home the students develop their quality awareness, their creativity and their entrepreneurship at the same time as we fortify the European idea. Europe is their future labour market! We want to emphasize the importance of languages skills in Europe with extended contacts across the borders and for future employers. Some students suffer from ADHD/ADD/other psychological disorders, which demand an adult there at the beginning of the placement.The experiences the students bring home affect the modeling of future education and placement periods at local level. Their international perspective is a welcome contribution for future employment in local companies or elsewhere enlarging the competitiveness of Swedish enterprise. Landskrona has a high youth unemployment percentage and also many immigrants of second/third generations. This project tries to offer a way to diminish youth unemployment and enhance the knowledge of EU and what EU has to offer youths in Landskrona. It is important that we can keep the education quality on a high level, counteract the segregation between natives and immigrants, offer a future without unemployment and work against the school dropout rate and the movement of students to the nearby big cities. In small municipalities we must keep school quality on a high level to survive sinking amounts of students. The quest for further education among the staff was long weak but a visit to Brussels/EU institutions in June 2015 expanded the horizons.

We also want to intensify the benchmarking project COLLEAGUE, included in our internationalization strategy, focusing on pedagogical further training for our staff through job shadowing at successful schools abroad. Because of this we enlarge the amount of foreign partner schools for vocational education or mixed vocational/general in the south, at three schools in ES, one in IT and two in HR. Teachers are expected to increase the education quality through feedback, validation (ECVET, Europass), dissemination among colleagues. Through job shadowing the staff has the possibility to see and experience other pedagogics at the same time as they develop their quality awareness, their creativity and get a consolidated feeling for the European idea by studies/experience of modern use of ICT, multicultural classrooms, school dropout rate, EU for youths/as future labour market and an international standard in vocational education.

For this activity the school kept the partners for the students \u2018trainings from the Renewable Energy courses, Automobile Mechatronics and Socio and cultural Animation and sought a new partner for the course of Metalworking Production, as it is the 1st time we will have trainings in this area. For each gflow, we included an accompanying teacher, who will stay with the students during the 1st week and help them to integrate in the companies, the culture and group environment. Most of these students are under 18 and travel abroad for the first time.For the A2 activity, we kept the work plan for graduate students, so as to carry out a 150-day mobility in companies. Comparing to the year before, we reduced the number of mobilities from 8 to 6, since we will have a lower number of graduate students this year. For this activity, we kept the same partners, considering the good performance shown. However, and bearing in mind the previous experience, we believe it would be very helpful for them to have a teacher to do the monitoring and integration in this period of mobility. We realized that many students would even like to try this European experience, but they end up quitting as they are afraid of going alone and without the support of a teacher.In 2015 we started to organize the mobility for the 10th grade students to provide them a period of training in schools / training centers abroad, so as to prevent failure and dropout, and to increase their motivation to attend professional courses and their language learning. Both students and parents reacted very positively to the innovative proposal, which registered a high level of interest. So, for this A3 activity, we decided to keep the same number of mobilities (total of 30, divided into 3 flows). In what concerns the selection of partners, we took into account the targeted training areas in reference schools. Since these students are under 18, we included in each flow, a teacher who will accompany them throughout the whole period of mobility.For all the participating students, we will work on the validation of training modules according to the ECVET and provide support on the award of the Europass document.In what concerns the staff - A4 activity,  we foresee to organize 10 mobilities. We increased both the number of flows and partners to cover different training realities and to enhance enriching experiences for the participants, which will surely be useful for their professional performance in CIOR.In summary, the application proposal provides a total of 81 mobilities among 4 types of activity to be held during the year 2016/2017, according to the start and end dates of the project, 61 of these mobilities are for students, 11 mobilities are for accompanying teachers and 10 mobilities are planned for the professional development of Staff. In order to develop this project Cior has established 15 partnerships, in 9 EU country's. The criteria for the selection of participants will remain the same as those defined in previous projects, highlighting the inclusion of students with fewer opportunities or special needs.The dissemination activities planned for the GPS 4 project include a greater focus on the presentation of results outside our school, especially within other educational institutions.In order to reinforce the cultural and linguistic preparation of students, in addition to the actions developed in the training context, Cior established partnerships with local Youth Associations, which work in the area of citizenship and inclusion (Yupi).The Evaluation Plan provided for this project includes the overall assessment of its impact in what concerns the students and staff learning outcomes as well as the School pro-European projection provided by this project.", "http://www.tellusgroup.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PT01-KA116-022425_1"], ["6LF", "Zagraniczne praktyki zawodowe szansa lepszej pracy", "TELLUS EDUCATION GROUP LIMITED", 223794.0, "The project reflects the strategy of internationalizing the Agricultural Complex of Schools in Namys\u0142\u00f3w and involves the 4-week foreign vocational training in 2017 for 97 students of the technical vocational school in 7 professions and also the staff training. From 01/05/2017 to 26/05/2017 there are 4 groups of students which are going to be trained and these are: 12 students in the profession of an IT specialist in the training center in Plymouth in the Great Britain, where 13 other students will undertake training in the profession of a photo technician in companies, 31 students of: the technical vocational school of the tourist service, hotel industry and nutrition technology will be placed for training in hotels, restaurants and travel agencies in Rimini, Italy, 20 students of nutrition technology in Malaga, Spain. 2 more groups in July: 9 students of the landscape architecture of the technical vocational school in the botanical garden of Malaga, and 12 students of agribusiness in August and September in agricultural farms of southern Hesse. In September 2016 the school headmaster together with the deputy and two teachers will undertake a job shadowing training in school of Dieburg, and in July next year 7 teachers of vocational subjects will undertake a two-week internship in hotels and restaurants of Malaga. Staff training is going to be a new undertaking to the school mobility program.According to the internationalizing strategy two new hosting organizations have been acquired:  TRIBEKA TRAINING LAB S.L. in Malaga and Landrat-Gruber-Schule in Dieburg. The cooperation with current hosting organization will be maintained:  Tellus of Plymouth with its branch in Rome, Sistema Tourismo of Rimini, Starkenburg Farmers Association in Darmstadt, Germany. The main goals of the project are: the development of skills and professional knowledge of students and staff and their ability to communicate in foreign languages and their personal development: increase in their responsibility, self-reliance, self-confidence, tolerance for other cultures and the ability to deal with difficult situations. The project is crucial for the learning and development process of students of technical vocational schools due to the fact that it gives them new skills and professional knowledge and it increases their mobility on the labor market. Future graduates are better prepared for work. The project is putting more emphasis on the European aspect of technical vocational education and encourages students in linking theory and practice, in better understanding of foreign cultures and customs, together with the development of language skills, especially with using professional language. The project is contributing to the mobility and the personal development of its participants, allowing them to know foreign cultures more adequately, without the threat of feeling alone in an unknown environment, establishing new contacts and friendships, coping with difficult situations and their increase in pride and self-esteem.Staff training increases their professional skills. The headmaster and the deputy will benefit from experience exchange and will try to implement organizational solutions to their school management to increase its overall performance.As a result of bonding the labor environment with the educational environment the project is enhancing the chances of employment for its future graduates on the European service market. The project is promoting the transparency and credibility of professional qualifications in Europe based on The European Credit Transfer System for Vocational Education and Training (ECVET).Care of the students will be supervised by the teachers from the Agricultural Schools Complex and the representatives of the partner organizations, as well as caregivers in individual enterprises. Teachers presence is crucial as they will provide comfort and safety for students, will help them in difficult situations, ease language barriers and verify their training outcome.Another result of the project is to increase students' skills in communicating in English, German,  Italian and Spanish languages, and the acquisition of independence and responsibility. Students will be prepared pedagogically, culturally and linguistically. The project participants will be provided with travel, insurance, accommodation and meals abroad, tickets for transport and pocket money.

The framework of the context refers to users with low rates of study motivation and high levels of school dropout in an area at high social risk in which the school discomfort can no longer be considered as an emergency, but actually as a structural feature of the training system and this calls for a new revision. A training course led abroad would enable teachers, through their comparison with colleagues from other countries, to acquire new group class management techniques in order to detect and prevent the phenomena of school drop-out, which undoubtedly represents an element to counteract.\r\nThe teachers that will take part in this project are highly motivated to increase their  didactic, methodological, linguistic  competencies as well as ICT abilities, in order to improve the educational offer of that the Institute, promoting this project, is able to deliver.\r\nThe main aims that the project is going to pursue are the following: \r\n- to explore, develop and evaluate the best practices resulting from the cooperation of a large group of teachers and educators;\r\n- to attend English language courses in order to reach level B2 in anticipation of a possible CLIL course;\r\n- to acquire language skills in L2 for professional debates and prepare more interesting teaching materials and tools able to adapt to different learning needs;\r\n-to reduce the level of early school drop-out;\r\nThe number of participants will be of 15 people, and they will be selected among the teaching and management staff of the Institute and the group will live an experience functional to the improvement and strengthening of their competencies within the partner institutes in United Kingdom, which are, more precisely, the Conlan School in St. Asaph and the Tellus Education Group in Plymouth, coordinated by T.E.E.P. \u2013 Training Education and European Project. \r\nThe activities planned and offered by the Institute are the following:\r\n- statistical analysis of cohorts, analysis of the criteria of selection of those students resulting more at risk; \r\n- use of active listening techniques and peer-tutoring so as to identify difficulties and/or criticisms;   \r\n- personalized interventions;\r\n- feedback and evaluation results.\r\nThe need to evaluate students\u2019 performance, along with the implicit/explicit expressions of discomfort is not new, but the methodological tools of research characterizing this project are innovative, based on a \u201cpreventive approach\u201d and connected to aspects of both statistical and psycho-pedagogical nature. \r\nThe project will monitor the impact on the general didactic activity of the institute and will evaluate whether the training activities carried out abroad will have triggered the change and innovation desired.

In addition, the project assumptions are dictated by the policies of the Ministry of Education and meet the horizontal and structural priorities.\r\nThe main objective of this project is to prepare teachers to participate in foreign trainings through participation in courses which improve language skills or allow to learn new languages in striving of multilingualism. It is planned to organize language courses in four countries (Great Britain, Spain, Italy and Germany). In addition, foreign language teachers will take part teacher training. These courses and observations will help to improve the quality of teaching at Polish school, because on the basis of received information it is advisable to introduce elements of a foreign language during vocational subjects and humanities (elements of CLIL), as well as using the latest teaching methods and techniques of a foreign language observed abroad. The project will also contribute to broaden the horizons and worldview, to skill sharing with teachers from other European countries and promoting the concept of lifelong learning. Teachers will be able to familiarize themselves with various education systems in Europe. The next objective will be to establish new international contacts and increase teachers\u2019 involvement in the development of new application forms of European Programme, as well as sharing their experience from a language course abroad with students going for training abroad.\r\nIn order to prepare for departure, each participant will have the opportunity to take part in the cultural preparation and short language course in Poland.

A part of our students have little self-confidence as well as difficulties in theoretical learning and in self-assessing their skills and competences realistically. Furthermore, their communicative competency in English is often not very advanced and encounters with people from different cultural backgrounds are restricted to a private or school environment. However, this is a stark contrast to the expectations employers have of their employees like the ability to perform job-related tasks independently and the mental and physical readiness to adapt to changes. It goes for all students that as future employees they are going to have more and more job-related contacts with people from a different cultural background \u2013 especially so in our Dutch-German border region. Thus our students\u2019 learning needs are developing a realistic job prospect which matches their skills, refining their personality, improving their foreign language and intercultural competences and realistically assessing the chances of temporarily learning and working abroad as a future prospect. In addition to that some of our teachers would like to learn from schools or educational institutions or do further education abroad because they wish to develop themselves further and improve the content and methods they apply in lessons and training-scheme-related tasks outside teaching.\r\n\r\nProject aims and expected results and effects\r\nThe project aims are derived from the learning needs described above: increase the participants' employability and scholastic aptitude by improving their job-related, personal, foreign language and intercultural competences as well as their mobility. We expect our students to return from their work placements abroad with enhanced self-confidence and open-mindedness towards life in different countries and in dealing with other cultures and foreign languages and also with a clearer idea concerning their future career. Ideally the work placement abroad results in a successful application for a job or an apprenticeship. For the educational staff and our school we expect an extension of knowledge and intercultural competence and connected to that enhanced teaching quality with respect to content and methods. Our project team will very likely intensify their knowledge concerning international cooperation and increase their organisational skills. We also hope to attract more students to our school by offering work placements abroad and to provide our region with young people who are employable and open for new developments. Apart from these future and hard-to-measure results we expect tangible results in the form of a documentation in German and English or Spanish consisting of texts, pictures, films or sound recordings or presentations about the work experience or further education abroad.\r\n\r\nActivities and methods\r\nOur student beneficiaries will complete internships abroad in the social institutions like creches, senior citizens institutions or youth institutions or in hotels, restaurants or canteen kitchens. Our partners in Spain, England and Ireland organize work placements, accommodation and where applicable language courses and they also act as mentors and supervisors and provide some parts of the  documentation.

Its objectives are fixed against the background of a previously relatively low mobility of young people in the dual training system which currently stands at about 4 percent. Additionally, conventional measures of mobility for apprentices are usually carried out in groups and are too inflexible for interested individuals or do not match due to their technical, spatial or temporal orientation. However, this project provides promotion of individual practical trainings abroad, irrespective of time, country of destination and the occupation requiring formal training. But the project determines clearly the funding period which in each case is scheduled to last three weeks. This schedule is based on the experience that this period usually already allows young people to a positive experience mobility with sustainable effect and that on the other hand longer periods of absence of the apprentices is in most cases hardly accepted among their training companies. Moreover, the realisation of practical trainings abroad shall now also be possible for those youngster, who just finished their apprenticeship. The 3-week-training abroad has to be completed within the first 12 months after their successful final examination. The experience showed that some of the apprentices do not have the opportunity to do an intership during their vocational education under dual system due to timely and operational reasons. \r\n\r\nThis project shall enable the mobility consultation services of the Chambers of Skilled Trades and the Chambers of Industry and Commerce to provide a funding offer to apprentices who are interested in individual scholarships.

They particularly appreciate information about the origin of offered product. \r\n2) Analysis of the job market in the touristic, wine and food and hospitality sectors\r\nUnlike other professional sectors, which in the last five years have experienced the aftermaths of the difficult economic cycle, this sector is enjoying a growing trend. However, positions in the sector are not always filled by graduates of Hotel Management VET Schools \u2013 who graduate with the ambition of growing professionally \u2013 and are often filled by workers with disparate professional backgrounds.

The school acknowledges that in order to solve our shared European challenges, we need to start with bringing change to our local communities. Our focus as a school is on our students to be \u201cpreparing for the future, and learning for life\u201d. We take our social assignment seriously and see that internationalisation is an important tool to achieve goals in the county regional plan for the entire course of schooling. There are demands for a holistic schooling with emphasis on quality and relevant training, including establishing arenas for interaction and learning.\r\nOur school has a long-term commitment to strengthening students' understanding of, and expertise in, how to live in a multicultural society built on democratic values and human rights. The importance of internationalisation is well understood by the school management, as well as in the county administration, and our head of department takes an active part throughout the process.\r\nIn the Department of Health- and childcare, Krakow was chosen for our student mobilities in order to meet community needs for expertise in migration pedagogy. In Vestfold county the inward labour migration from Poland is significant, and students will meet Poles in their future careers in the Health- and childcare sector.\r\nThere is an average of 140 students attending Health- and childcare programmes every year. Student mobility is offered students at year 2 at the Childcare and youth worker programme, the Health worker programme, and to students belonging to our special Health- and childcare programme, where the students become qualified for higher education in addition to receiving vocational training.\r\nThe students will be in practice for two weeks either in the privately owned nursery Bright Child, or at Ognisko, public day centres for mentally retarded adults.\r\nAt work, the students will take part in the normal day to day activities, but also be expected to initiate and lead planned activities on their own. Students will participate in reflection groups each afternoon and blog about their experiences throughout their stay, as well as complete an interdisciplinary project assignment. While in the host country each student will be sharing a small flat with another student, and together they will be responsible for grocery shopping and cooking, keeping the flat tidy and clean, laundry, being on time for work as well as keeping other appointments.\r\nThere will be two teachers present during the entire practice period, and they will be in close contact with the nursery and day centres, in addition to having professional guidance sessions with the students. The teachers will provide support for students both individually and in groups, and make sure they get to sample some of the local culture.\r\nThe aim of the international practice is to ready the students for linguistic and cultural challenges in a multicultural society, through first-hand experience of what it is like to work and live in a foreign country. Their reflections underway provide learning for life, and ensure quality of training.\r\nWe believe that this will make our pupils and teachers more tolerant regarding other cultures and respect for other norms and values. An experience that can be shared with collegues and other pupils at our school. Increased multicultural understanding will have a positive effect on the  environment at our school. Another competence aim that will be covered is increased knowledge of languages. They will also develop communication- and cooperation skills and increase their social competence. Our school also focus on the cooperation between our two vocational lines of studies and emphasize relevant goals in these two lines of studies.\r\nOn the one hand, a long time goal for sending student mobilites to Krakow, is to encourage professional and personal growth, as well as resilience, independence, responsibility and tolerance for each student. On the other hand, we would like students to gain valuable multicultural expertise preparing them for their future careers.\r\n\r\nAs a school we see internationalisation projects as a way to increase student motivation and thereby up the number of students completing secondary school.

In the whole, ten groups of students and two groups of teachers will travel abroad for an internship.The increasing number of foreign mobilities and the strengthening of an international cooperation are the basic objectives of the strategic development plan of our school.\r\nThe offer of the study programmes at our school has nearly doubled over the past few years and the number of students has increased up to the current 957. \r\nIn addition to the traditional field of study Applied Chemistry being taught in several specializations, there are some new study programmes such as Fire Protection, Security and Legal Studies, or study programme Hairdresser and Beauty Services. To meet the educational needs of our students and allow them to travel to a foreign mobility within their study focus, we expanded our circle of cooperating organizations on the current nine and now we have fully covered all the educational programmes taught at our school with mobilities. We plan to send participants in six European countries (Germany, Cyprus, Great Britain, Spain, Italy, Slovakia 4x). Among our project partners there are six upper secondary technical schools, three universities and one educational center. With four of our project partners we will implement reciprocal mobilities.\r\nThe hosting organizations of our Chemistry students will be schools SBG Dresden, Vocational Chemical School in Bratislava, IIS P. Scalcerle in Padua, two universities - the University of Plymouth and the University of Nicosia and a Spanish training centre in Cartagena. Students in the branch of study Fire Protection will participate in an internship at Vocational School of Fire Protection in \u017dilina (Slovakia). Students in Security and Legal Studies will pass their practice at the Faculty of Security Engineering of the University of \u017dilina, specifically at the Department of Crisis and Security Management. Another group of these students will complete a course on forensic analysis at Vocational Chemical School in Bratislava. For students in the branch Beauty Services and Hairdresser there is ensured professional experience in beauty and hairdressing salons at Vocational school specialized in hairdressing and making visage in Bratislava. Simultaneously with the increase in number of mobilities, we also strive to raise up the quality of the project. In all mobilities of this project, we will apply the principles of ECVET system and will be testing units of learning outcomes. We will also deal with the procedure of participants assessment. Within this project we also plan mobilities of pedagogical staff - VET teachers as we believe that professional development of teachers is a prerequisite for quality assurance in education. Besides professional and pedagogical skills of teachers we also want to strengthen their language skills. In this project we want to focus on vocational teachers in the field of Security and Legal Studies who will complete work-programme at the Faculty of Security Engineering, and further on teachers in the field of Applied Chemistry who will participate in a working program at ITT Buonarroti-Pozzo in Trento focused on the use of information technology in teaching and learning. On the side of students we see the impact of the project in the acquisition of new knowledge and skills, strengthening linguistic communication and lexical knowledge, improving self-confidence and also motivation for further education. Thanks to this experience students gain an overview of the demands put on their profession, learn about possibilities of study abroad and employment at the European labor market. Through this experience the profile of graduates has been improved, which brings benefit to strategic partners of our school (employers, tertiary education).\r\nOn the side of school, we see an apparent increase in the attractiveness of school resulting in an increased interest of studying science. Through mobilities the school receives valuable feedback about the quality of education. The school benefits from the exchange of experience and the transfer of good practice in the practice of school. Within this project we above all want to test the units of learning outcomes and start using them for national mobilities afterwards as well.\r\nThe project will be disseminated through the school website, the educational portal of the Pardubice region authority, local and regional press.

After a rigorous selection process our students will be preparing for their professional diploma in the following specialities: restaurant sales and service; cooking; bakery and pastry making; support, care and service to individuals.  The possibility of such a period of study abroad has attracted new students and families to our school.  For them, the possibility of a period of study abroad adds value to their professional training, allows them access to a European training programme, encourages them to consider themselves European citizens, and increases their employability.

The countries targeted (Belgium, Spain, England) are suited to the needs of the students concerned since it is necessary to know the dishes and working methods and/or the procedures used in service to the individual in Europe, as well as communication competences in English and Spanish at level B1+ to succeed in the continuous assessment part of their final year examination and to get the European certification (for waiters and waitresses). Throughout their period of training, our students can improve their linguistic competence, acquire professional skills, discover cultural differences, develop their autonomy and their ability to travel abroad, learning about the constraints of working in another country, compare methods, working times, techniques, materials and procedures, all in a foreign language, and becoming better European citizens in the process. They will be assessed by evaluation proformas which will provide evidence of their periods of training in companies and will be used by the assessors (teachers and examiners) in the award of the Professional Diploma (Baccalaur\u00e9at).

The region Hauts-de-France has nearly 6 million inhabitants, which represents 9.4% of the population of metropolitan France. It is thus the third most populated French area in the new territorial organisation. The new region is characterized by its youth with the highest proportion of under-25-year-olds and student attractiveness. Raising the level of training remains a significant objective for the new region while, at the same time, the number of school leavers without qualifications is still above the national average. While the rate of unemployment is below the national average from the level V, the lack of training is a major handicap in the career and for the integration into the workplace. Improving the level of training, the rise of abilities for employees, the lifelong learning for job seekers, or even strengthening the fight for literacy and preventing from dropping out of school before the first qualification remain major issues. \r\nThe main objective of the MOBinov17 project is to foster the mobility of targeted beneficiaries in order to secure their training route and to favour their long-term professional integration. About thirty partner organisations (secondary schools for vocational training, apprentices training centres, training organisms) are going to federate within the consortium and experience joint projects in a sector-based logic.\r\nA steering committee, iwith the support of a coordinating team, will supervise the implementation of the project.

They include the education of entrepreneurial students who are aware of being Europeans, and who are also able to make their own challenges, achieve goals and professional success. Additionally, there is also crucial need of improving the language skills of our students. These abilities will help the students find themselves in the labour market at local, regional and international levels.\r\nWe wish to become a school that prepares its students to participate actively on a wide labour market.

They often choose their training by default, sometimes after having experienced a chaotic schooling.It is an audience with few financial and cultural opportunities.\r\n\r\nThus, the project main objectives are to give them the possibility to get some positive experience outside the traditional educational framework. \r\n\r\nThey will develop new skills (such as autonomy, foreign languages, cultural awareness), new notions (sharing, living together, having some job experience) and knowledge about different cultural, social  and business environment. These target skills are part of their training but  we hope that this foreign experience will add benefit to their Professional diploma as they must do their training period in tertiary companies - Commerce, Sales Management and Administration - according to their Btec diploma option as specified in the French professional curriculum.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  living in a foreign country will encourage foreign language learning as students will have to communicate, express themselves and be understood. This one-month training period abroad will allow them to overcome their fears about foreign language learning and be fully involved in their work experience. Being involved in a \u00ab real life \u00bb consistent project, students will develop\"here and now\" skills and will be more motivated by academic  learning outcomes as they will change focus and give sense to their learning. by doing so they will widen their skill scope - knowledge and attitudes - for a \u00ab somewhere else, later \u00bb experience.\r\n\r\nWe believe that these first cultural experiences abroad will encourage further exchanges across borders, whether in a professional environment (jobs, internships, training courses) or at  university (Erasmus work placement in Higher Education).\r\n\r\nThese objectives are defined and implemented by our European Department, based on our prior experience with European projects. Everything has been carefully planned and scheduled for students\u2019 mobilities :from our partners(companies,accommodation) who have agreed to collaborate  to the organizational aspects of the mobility (transportation, logistics and general organization). At least one reference teacher will be with them to help and supervise visits,  training period assessments, health monitoring, and moral support as most learners are under age. Thus, the student-teacher relationship is changed, allowing a new relationship between the X and Z generations so as to close the gap and provide better understanding between these two generations. \r\n\r\n Two cities were chosen for the mobilities for several reasons : Bristol (direct flight from Toulouse, Airbus subsidiary, city size ...) and Valencia (its economic and cultural wealth, a city as big as Toulouse, less famous and less known than Madrid  or Barcelona in our region). These mobilities will be divided into two specific periods with 6 students in each city (28 days in June 2017 and January 2019).\r\n\r\nOur school is located in the South of France and teachers are mostly Generation X, but they are still in a dynamic educational approach of their job : always  curious and willing to  discover new pedagogical tools in order to be able to make knowledge accessible to students and motivate them. Anxious to be as close as possible  to the  school European identity, 8 colleagues have obtained certification - DNL- to teach their subject in a foreign language. These certifications allow a broader offer in terms of curriculum in our high school. Consequently, these 14- day mobilities will  allow  them to practice and improve their skills, including foreign language ones. Each teacher is responsible for his/her own mobility organization with regards to his /her personal and professional goals and wishes. They must define their objectives and target needs beforehand. A  good practice committee  has also been created so that teachers will  be able to share their mobility outcomes and experience with the educational community and encourage new colleagues to go abroad. When they return, teachers must produce tools, documents, detailed reports on their mobility objectives and outcomes so as to share their results. Dissemination is a key step to strengthen and consolidate the European identity and citizenship in our school, a core target of our school educational project. \r\n\r\nThis aspect has been enriched over the years thanks to teachers and students\u2019 mobilities.\r\nIn the long term, these mobilities represent a real vector of social integration for our students, help break down stereotypes and strengthen our sense of European belonging for all.

In September 2018 -12 students- mechanic technicians and automotive technicians- will go on a 4-week- training to the UK and 16 pupils- telecommunications technicians and environmental protection technicians will leave for 4-week vocational training in companies in Portugal.  \r\n  For the same reason, an internship in Dresden has been planned in two editions during the winter holidays in 2018 and 2019.  The programs have been developed in close connection with the guidelines of apprenticeship programs based on the curriculum of particular professions, but are to be implemented on the basis of modern facilities and equipment, and focus on learning new technologies and to develop skills particularly desired by the local labor market. During each round of the internship students will be accompanied by vocational teachers (depending on the group size): one (United Kingdom) or two (other mobility) .\r\nThere also will be nvolved 2 vocational teachers in job-shadowing in our partner school in Weilheim.\r\nBefore leaving for training students and teachers receive support in the form of the inguistic, cultural and pedagogical preparation \r\n-530 hours in the project.\r\n The project is a response to a problem which occurred in our school: poor recruitment to school, poor school performance, and consequently poor performance in professionaland Matura examinations. As a result, fewer students continue their education after secondary school, and not even all of them take the exams. After examining the problem we tried  to solve it on many levels, but in-depth analysis in the form of interviews and surveys showed that the primary cause of failure is lack of motivation for learning, lack of faith in students' own abilities and lack of prospects for the future. An additional problem is a nationwide trend, which is  the popularity of general education over vocational training among junior high school students.  Last we noticed the severity of attitudes expressing lack of tolerance for other cultures and religions (in connection with plans to accept immigrants in our city). \r\nTo change this situation, we have developed a project which main goal is to increase students' motivation to develop knowledge and improve skills, gain new skills, improve language skills- mostly English , increase the mobility of participants, increase their chances on European and national labor market, increase self-esteem, increse intercultural competences, improve the quality and attractiveness of vocational education in the school and in the region, prevent early school leaving and reduce failure in education.  the teachers will  develop their skills in the diagnosis of pupils' needs and learn more attractive teaching meathods. The cooperation will contribute to the exchange of best practices, gaining experience through practical activities and ability to cooperate at the international level.  \r\nThe most important results of the project will include obtaining Europass Mobility certificate , obtaining ECVET points, acquiring new skills, improving language skills and filling in the European Language Passport, increasing the mobility of participants, increasing students' chances on European and national labor market, increasing self-esteem and motivation to learn, which will help to reduce the number of early school leavers, learn intercultural competences among students and teachers, improve the quality and attractiveness of vocational education in the school and in the region, as well as the preparation to the strategic partnership in the future.", "http://www.tellusgroup.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PL01-KA102-036849_2"], ["6LF", "Mobilit\u00e9 post apprentis", "TELLUS EDUCATION GROUP LIMITED", 62802.0, "The two year EURO+STEPHENSON Project involves 20 apprentices who are currently taking on BAC Professionnel (Vocational A-levels), BTS (Higher National Diploma) in Commerce, Tourism or Hospitality or MCAR (BTEC level 3 \u2013 Front Office Operations).

It can be applied through special activities or in an every day context to promote language development or integration of children with special needs e.g. behavioural disorders, developmental delays or other mental, physical or social needs. Music promotes the well- being and emotional strength of the recipients.

A constructive debate is vitally important for educators in a plural and globally changing society.\r\nThrough additional qualifications we enable our students to expand their knowledge within the generalist training and provide the impetus for \u201clifelong learning\u201d, e.g. through the project SmS (playing with  your voice) in cooperation with the Academy of Music in Marktoberdorf or the training license for the promotion of physical activity in children and adolescents in cooperation with the Bavarian Sports Association.\r\nPresently the FakS (Training College for Educators) is cooperating with about 300 institutions (at home and abroad) and invites lecturers on a variety of current topics.\r\nThe FakS has successfully provided internships since 2001, first through Leonardo da Vinci and later through Erasmus+ thus allowing almost 400 students to do internships in the UK, France, Ireland, Austria and Spain. Several projects received the \u201cbest practice\u201d award.

At present we have sufficient internships in other foreign countries, in addition we are looking for a suitable host country for 2018.\r\nIn the future we want to emphasize teacher exchanges. So far we have invited guests from at home and abroad to gain an insight into our training system and the Bavarian education system.\r\nAs the only training college for educators in Swabia our college is participating in the model trial \u201cOptiprax\u201d which aims at A-level students offering them a shortened period of training.

Our cooperation with many successful and internationally active companies in the fields of agricultural machinery, chemistry and the metalworking industry demands a vocational training which prepares trainees, and the teaching staff as well for the challenges of a growing European job market. \r\nThe GEK is a European School which highly values on their European oriented education. One example is the variety of language courses on offer such as English, Dutch, French and Spanish. We consider it to be important that our students have the opportunity to use these languages in real-life professional situations. These take place during a three week internship work placement abroad.\r\nHere, our project background and our project objectives are closely linked. The VET mobilities of trainees as well as trainers lead to an increased cross-cultural understanding of a common Europe.\r\nThe experiences of our students abroad lead to a higher self-confidence and encourage them to seek for job possibilities beyond their country borders. Another project objective is that \u201cEurope\u201d is part of the school\u2019s curriculum. Lessons in various subjects deal with topics that are relevant for a European way of thinking. This is supported by the school\u2019s annual European week which offers the students a variety of projects focusing on Europe.   \r\nWith the start of ERASMUS+, the GEK is able to offer almost 100 mobility participants the chance to travel and work abroad in 2017/18. This is the largest number of participants so far and follows the plans of our district council in Cologne to raise the number of vocational mobilities to 10%.  These participants are for example technicians for illumination advertisements, electricians for automation engineering, chemical lab assistants, metal workers and technical assistants in the field of design.\r\nSo far we have organized VETPRO-projects for trainers and teachers which took them to our partners abroad for one week. Last year they worked under the title \u201cTeaching the European Way\u201d. Our IVT-projects under the title \u201cDifferent Places-Different Faces\u201d enabled our students to work for three weeks in Finland, Rumania, Malta, Great Britain and on the island of La Palma.\r\nAll those activities are now coming together with ERASMUS+ and the GEK is now offering future participants to work under the title \u201cIVT quality+\u201d. In addition to our student mobility under KA1, we also succesfully applied for a KA2 strategic partnership. \r\nBut the GEK does not only send students abroad, we also welcome our partner school\u2019s students from Finland here in the Rhineland area. The teachers and trainers of the GEK organize accommodation and internships with our cooperating companies in the field of electrical engineering, chemistry and design. These internships usually last from four to six weeks.\r\nOur project implementation has been consistently improved and is now divided into 3 main stages: The first stage is the application phase. In this stage students qualify by participating in cross-cultural preparation lessons. Here they also create a europass CV in English and pass a mobility interview, to show their motivation to work abroad. This stage ends in an intercultural evening which prepares all the participants for their upcoming departure day.\r\nThe second stage is their actual stay abroad. During this time, the students are monitored, both by the local partners as well as the responsible teachers and trainers of the GEK. The participants document their linguistic, social, personal and professional impressions and experiences in a travel diary called \u201cTravelog\u201d. It is an important instrument of the third stage of the mobility project. This is where the evaluation of the experience abroad is going to take place. With the help of the Travelog their gained competence are documented and can be comprehended. Later on these competences are evaluated in our competence overview, which are used to fill out the europass Mobility certificate.\r\nThe project results, their benefits as well as their impact are closely related.

Its framework is an educational approach based on meaningful learning and centred on the promotion of the human being. \r\nThis project, which is the initial stage of a four-year plan, consists of a first mobility flow of 40 students towards the United Kingdom, France and Germany who will be coordinated by 4 teachers and 4 members of our staff. \r\nThe middle and long-term strategy aims at a gradual increase of the mobility: from the second year, this will be implemented by expanding the destinations located in the Mediterranean area and/or in the Northern, Central and Eastern European countries; in the third year, due to the expected increase of know-how and operational strategies, we will increase the number of students (up to 50) involved in the mobility project. The time spent abroad will enable beneficiaries to carry out an internship in companies or institutions selected with the support of transnational partners (A1 activity of the present form). The privileged sectors will be consistent with the educational targets of our school: cultural heritage and tourism, public and private institutions operating in the field of communications (primarily for students enrolled in the classical humanities course of our school); art and entertainment, with particular regard to music and dance, will be the fields of interest of some other students (especially those who are enrolled in Liceo Azuni's music and dance related courses).   \r\nThese activities will allow the implementation of disciplinary theoretical acquisitions and the development of the ability to transfer the so-called soft skills in the workplace. It is expected that the placements will produce effective results in terms of a conscious study and/or work guidance and, thanks to the Europass certification provided within the project, enhance employability. The habit to intercultural dialogue and the familiarity with foreign languages, as natural outcomes of the mobility experiences, will allow young citizens living in a place strongly determined by insularity, to open themselves up to local, regional and national opportunities, which of course relate to the European context of the knowledge society and to the global market.\r\nThese targets are consistent with those identified by the European International Agenda 2020, which is an essential point of reference for our school's educational plan.

We see this as a great success.\r\nGreen School is a new project also between several scientific schools in Europe. The participants meet once a year in small groups and work together. There are also individual trainees and training staff to be replaced. So the project is to come and stay in each school at the same level. It is constantly being developed and expanded.

EU internships have been implemented in the personnel development concept since 2016 and have been successfully implemented since 2017. Evaluations of the EU internships show a positive development. The attractiveness of the city of Wuppertal as an instructor has increased. The added value of stays abroad is recognised not only by EU trainees, but also increasingly by the staff. \r\n\r\nThe implementation of European policy is an ever-present cross-cutting theme in all areas of our local government.

This is particularly relevant for Germany as an exporting and immigration nation. A consequence is that skilled workers, willing to make their career, are expected to be ready to work abroad and work together with other foreign workers , for instance in branches of their companies, with business partners or in foreign companies. The field of electronics is no exception; many of the German medium-sized or large companies are global players and have business relations with international clients and they have got more and more foreign skilled workers.\r\n\r\nThis is the setting of the project of Werner-von-Siemens-Schule, a vocational school in Cologne, Germany. In the next two years we want to give about 50 apprentices of our school the opportunity to do an internship fulltime in an electronics company in a foreign country. All participants will be apprentices in the field of electronics, either fulltime at school or in cooperation with a company (Duales System). During their internship in a Spanish, Italian, French, Finnish or Hungarian firm, they will have learn to face and to handle professional situations in a foreign language environment. These experiences will help them later on to judge their professional and linguistic skills better and to approach similar situations more effectively in their future professional life. In the long run, they might even consider working abroad frequently or permanently to promote their career.\r\n\r\nFrom experience, most of the participants have only rarely been abroad so far and the fewest of them have already been in the country of destination. Quite a few of them have a migration background. Therefore, the exchange will also be a cultural experience for them, as they will get to know new attitudes and ways of living. Thus, they might even get a new outlook on life in Germany. In order to support this development, our partners will organize (inter-)cultural activities, such as common outings or meetings.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile our educational staff will get a higher level of profession by visiting our schoolish and business partners in Europe.

Furthermore, they should increase their social\r\nand international expertise. In a pre-agreed contract between the partners the working areas will be set; Eg. participants are used in\r\nhotel trades in the \"reception\" and in commercial occupations in the \"Shopping / Sales Export\".

Its objectives are fixed against the background of a previously relatively low mobility of young people in the dual training system. Additionally, conventional measures of mobility for apprentices are usually carried out in groups and are too inflexible for interested individuals or do not match due to their technical, spatial or temporal orientation. However, this project provides promotion of individual practical trainings abroad, irrespective of time, country of destination and the occupation requiring formal training.

This schedule is based on the experience that this period usually already allows young people to a positive experience mobility with sustainable effect and that on the other hand longer periods of absence of the apprentices is in most cases hardly accepted among their training companies. Moreover, the realisation of practical trainings abroad shall now also be possible for those youngster, who just finished their apprenticeship. The 2 till 4 week training abroad has to be completed within the first 12 months after their successful final examination. The experience showed that some of the apprentices do not have the opportunity to do an intership during their vocational education under dual system due to timely and operational reasons. 2 weeks are a possibility for trainees which can not stay away for long (Business reasons), the 3 weeks are the most popular option and the 4 weeks are a possibility for apprentice with with a company that can support this (exemption of the apprentice) or graduate. \r\nThe Average will be three weeks and need-oriented will be the possibilty to choose less (zwo weeks) or more (four weeks). \r\n\r\nThis project shall enable the mobility consultation services of the Chambers of Skilled Trades and the Chambers of Industry and Commerce to provide a funding offer to apprentices who are interested in individual scholarships.

Although we encourage employment of students in the local environment, we realize that their career paths may lead them abroad as well. In addition to good general knowledge of a foreign language, students need to get acquainted with the language for specific purposes and increase their confidence. They can gain these qualities by participating in the project.\r\n\r\nIn our project entitled From Foreign Work Experience to Better Employment Prospects we are going to focus on the following goals:\r\n1. Enabling students to improve or gain new technical competencies;\r\n2. Improving students' language competencies, encouraging a wide language diversity and intercultural awareness;\r\n3. Transferring examples of good practice of practical training from European labour markets to home environment;\r\n4. Becoming a more recognizable school at home and abroad;\r\n5.

It was created as our respond to the demand of students for the journey with experience in another country and also as the efforts of colleagues to increase motivation of students to learn foreign languages and to expand their professional competences. Our goal is to give students the opportunity to verify and expand their knowledge and skills in new environment and thus to be able to take advantage of the experience for their future work.

We want them to understand the evaluation of their expertise and experience a sense of appreciation when applying new skills from their mobility in practice and later in employment. We will support students by issuing the Europass and presenting results of the ECVET European Assessment Tool to see how their new experience and skills are valued on the labour market. These two documents will strongly increase their chance in future employment.\r\nAs a new partner, we appreciate the interest of the SBBS in German Jena, which has very good results in international work and mobility programmes in many European countries. Their system of work and practice will be inspiring for us as we have planned placements and teacher shadowing at this school. We want to learn more about the school as a partner and to negotiate the conditions for our future cooperation. That is why we have planned a visit to this school at the beginning of the project in September 2018.\r\nWith regard to the language we are studying, we also focus on England, where Tellus agency, with whom we have worked in the past, will ensure good professional leadership and implementation of work practices in South England, Plymouth.\r\n\r\nOur society is rapidly changing and young people react to changes according to their interests and possibilities.

The opportunity to create a mobility project, in which each student has to communicate with project co-creators, and gradually fulfil tasks to complete the required training to allow a practice abroad, we see as a great contribution for improving social skills and communication. During practice, students are increasingly meeting people of other nationalities with other cultural habits, and for this reason, mobility is a strong incentive to create positive international attitudes among students and to create correct responses to the perception of a different culture. We perceive the mobility program also as a major shift in the personal development of the project team members. When designing and implementing the project, they expand their own competencies in project design and management while respecting, identifying and helping to realize the long-term goals of the European School Development Plan.

Students from disadvantaged communities will have priority at the selection.\r\nThe aim of the project is to develop the vocational technical competences and key competences of the students and to increase the efficiency of the vocational training of our institution (the educational offer - by including dual education - and the learning techniques used) in order to integrate into a continuously developing labour market.\r\nSpecific objectives:\r\n1.Developing the professional competences in the Mechanical; Electric; Construction, Installations and Public Works fields  of the 42 students by conducting three-week (90-hour) work experience programs at Tellus Education Group by the end of the two-year project (2020), with a minimum of 40% of the participants being: ethnic minorities; students from poor single-parent families; with parents living abroad or students at high risk of school dropout.\r\n2.Development with 1 point on a behavioural observation grid (with levels 1 to 5) of the following key competences: a) social competences of collaboration and teamwork in workshops; b) entrepreneurial competences and critical thinking, by taking the initiative to solve problems; by the 42 students participating in the three-week (90-hour) internships by 2020\r\n3.Setting up at least 2 transnational partnerships and at least 2 national partnerships with employers from the technical field in order to have 10% of the 2021 graduates employed in their respective qualifications \r\n4. Increasing the quality and attractiveness of the vocational training of the institution through the effective implementation of dual education (minimum 1 class / year of project) and by using the specialized learning techniques observed by the 12 VET teachers participating in the 2 Staff Training Abroad mobilities at Tellus Group by 2020 .\r\nIn the first flow, 6 VET teachers will spend 5 days taking part in Staff Training Abroad in Plymouth, UK in order to observe the implementation of dual professional education. In the 2nd flow, 14 students from the Mechanics field (Mechanical technician for maintenance and repairs; Technician processing on CNC machines)will take part in a work experience program in Plymouth for 3 weeks. In the 2nd year of the project, 6 VET teachers will be participating in the 3rd flow in Staff Training Abroad in Salamanca, Spain, for 5 days, where they will have a hands-on observation period of the utilisation of the new AutoCAD graphical interface and of the CNC simulators. In the 4th flow, 14 students in Construction, Installations and Public Works (Technician in construction and public works)will participate in Technical based learning in Plymouth, UK for 3 weeks. In the last flow, 14 students from the Electric field (Technician in electrical installation) will undergo Technical based learning in Salamanca, Tellus Spain for 3 weeks.\r\nThese activities will help students develop competences in line with the \"Responsible work practice\" accredited with 1 ECVET. The student learning outcomes are in line with their field of training and correlated with the key competences in the Local Development Curriculum and set out in the MoU.\r\nThe methodology of implementation will include planning actions (with the Gantt chart), timing of activities, budget management, task distribution, training of participants, organising mobilities, monitoring, disseminating and exploiting results and project evaluation.\r\nThe learning outcomes for VET staff are the development of dual-learning implementation skills and of the knowledge about specialized educational techniques and the software used during Technical-based learning.\r\nThe impact of the project on the students will be by the development of professional competences, increasing their chances of integration on the labour market (using Europass and ECVET), by increasing their self-confidence and motivation regarding their field. The impact on the teachers will be by increasing the skills of implementing dual learning and their ability to bring change into the institution and the community.

In addition, there are young people with no motivation for employment, low-skilled in a second language, and with little ICT competences at a professional level, and therefore, with difficulty for access to labour market. Furthermore, we find companies in the province demanding prepared young people, as a consequence of the competitiveness misbalance within the European common market that cannot satisfy companies' needs, feeding the EU skills gap.\r\n\r\nIn order to overcome such skills gap of the province, with a strong rural character, the Diputaci\u00f3n has formed a Consortium, with 37 VET schools in Pontevedra and Employment Workshop and authorized courses with Certificate of Competences, which will offer 105 young VET graduates in one of these centres, the possibility of carrying out work practices, for 6 months (ErasmusPro), in a European company.

The sending organisations include IES Cartuja, CE Ave Maria San Cristobal, IES Polit\u00e9cnico Hermenegildo Lanz, IES Francisco Ayala, IES Aynadamar, IES Zaidin Vergeles, CDP Atl\u00e1ntida and IES Virgen de las Nieves. This VET schools have experience in the management of European projects. With this new initiative, we intend to join efforts to contribute to the improvement of educational quality and to increase job opportunities.\r\nTo achieve this, we propose activities for students, who will do internships in companies, and activities for teaching staff, who will carry out a job-shadowing activity in VET schools. Regarding the students, the project includes 58 mobilities: 54 students of Initial Vocational Training (FPGM) will do their internship in companies for 87 days, hosting countries include the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Ireland, United Kingdom and France; 4 students of Basic Vocational Training (FPB) will do their internships in Italy for 3 weeks. For Initial Vocational Training students, the project includes 13 accompanying teachers during the first week of stay. For Basic Vocational Training students, there are 2 accompanying teachers during the 3 weeks to reinforce the monitoring.\r\nThe internships will be recognised by the official module of Company Placements (FCT), which is common to all students. However, this experience will entail an added value for the participants at a personal and professional level. In addition to acquiring knowledge and skills in their field of speciality, they can benefit from a linguistic and cultural immersion, expanding their linguistic and personal skills. This will foster their autonomy and they will acquire a more versatile profile, which will facilitate their access to the labour market. It will also encourage motivation to continue with their education.\r\nAs for the teaching staff, the project includes 9 mobilities for a week in Finland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Teachers can learn about other educational systems and observe the work carried out by other professionals. Thus, they can enrich their professional and methodological knowledge. They can learn about different resources, ICT, training programmes, etc. All this will have a very positive impact on the quality of the education provided, adapted to the needs of today's society.\r\nFor the proper management of the project, communication channels will be established between all the parties involved throughout the entire project. There will be a continuous contact between the City Council, school mobility coordinators, teaching tutors, participants, host and intermediary organisations and company tutors.\r\nThe City Council will be part of the Association of European Cities XARXA FP.

In addition, we have the cooperation of different companies, including intermediary and host organisations with great experience in European projects, which will allow us to achieve the expected results.\r\nRegarding the selection process, it will be carried out in a fair and transparent manner, publishing the established selection criteria. Then, we will organise practical issues (travel, accommodation, insurance, etc.) and quality issues (training programmes, agreements between different parties, etc.). Pedagogical, linguistic and cultural preparation will also be provided before the mobility.\r\nMonitoring will take place during mobility period. Participants will have a teaching tutor and a company tutor, and communications will be established among all the parties to ensure compliance with the training programme and the adaptation and satisfaction of participants.\r\nAt the end of the mobilities, participants will obtain a certificate and the Europass Mobility document.\r\nEach member will hold a meeting with the participants for the final evaluation of the project.

Our cooperation with many successful, internationally active companies (in the fields of agricultural machinery, chemistry, metalworking industry) demands a vocational training which prepares trainees, and the teaching staff as well for the challenges of a growing European job market. \r\nThe GEK is a European School which highly values on their European oriented education. We offer a variety of language courses (English, Dutch, French, Spanish) and consider it to be important that our students have the opportunity to use these languages in real-life professional situations, which take place during a three week internship work placement abroad.\r\nHere, our project background and our project objectives are closely linked. The VET mobilities of trainees as well as trainers lead to an increased cross-cultural understanding of a common Europe.\r\nThe experiences of our students abroad lead to a higher self-confidence and encourage them to seek for job possibilities beyond their country borders. Another project objective is that \u201cEurope\u201d is part of the school\u2019s curriculum. Lessons in various subjects deal with topics that are relevant for a European way of thinking. This is supported by the school\u2019s \u201estudent-project-week\u201c, which offers a variety of projects focusing on Europe.   \r\nWith the start of ERASMUS+, the GEK is able to offer almost 100 mobility participants the chance to travel and work abroad in 2018/19. This follows the plans of our district council in Cologne to raise the number of vocational mobilities to 10%.  These participants are f. e. technicians for illumination advertisements, electricians for automation engineering, chemical lab assistants, metal workers and technical assistants in the field of design.\r\nSo far we have organized VETPRO-projects for trainers and teachers which took them to our partners abroad for one week. They worked under the title \u201cTeaching the European Way\u201d. Our IVT-projects under the title \u201cDifferent Places-Different Faces\u201d enabled our students to work for three weeks in Finland, Rumania, Malta, Great Britain and on the island of La Palma.\r\nAll those activities are coming together with ERASMUS+ and the GEK is offering future participants to work under the title \u201cIVT quality+\u201d. Therefore our teachers already had the possibility to take part in trainings for one/up to three weeks abroad.\r\nIn addition to our mobility under KA1, we also succesfully applied for a KA2 mobility. \r\nBut the GEK does not only send students abroad, we also welcome our partner school\u2019s students from Finland here in the Rhineland area. The teachers and trainers of the GEK organize accommodation and internships with our cooperating companies in the field of electrical engineering, chemistry and design. These internships usually last from four to six weeks.\r\nOur project implementation has been consistently improved and is now divided into 3 main stages: 1. The application phase: In this stage students qualify by participating in cross-cultural preparation lessons. Here they also create a europass CV in English and pass a mobility interview, to show their motivation to work abroad. The participants take part in the OLS-test before travelling abroad. This stage ends in an intercultural evening which prepares all the participants for their upcoming departure day.\r\n2. The actual stay abroad: During this time, the students are monitored, both by the local partners as well as the responsible teachers and trainers of the GEK. The participants document their linguistic, social, personal and professional impressions and experiences in a travel diary called \u201cTravelog\u201d. It is an important instrument of the third stage of the mobility project. 3. The evaluation of the experience abroad: With the help of the Travelog their gained competence are documented and can be comprehended. Later on these competences are evaluated in our competence overview, which are used to fill out the europass Mobility certificate. Conclusively the partcipants take part in another OLS-test after their return.\r\nThe project results, their benefits as well as their impact are closely related. The Europass Mobility is one example. It is used for future applications by our trainees after the end of their vocational training, as well as by our teaching staff for better career chances. This document increases their career prospects on the national and European job market. \r\nOur collaboration with regional companies that employ apprentices of our foreign project partners, often results in the decrease of language barriers and more cultural acceptance.

The mobility learning outcomes will be tailored to the single participant and specialization sector in order to obtain a final certification of competence in the relevant sector. The potential companies where the workexperience will take place have already been pre-selected, in order to identify quality environments where the learning outcomes can reasonably be met.

Its framework is an educational approach based on meaningful learning and centred on the promotion of the human being. \r\nThis project, which is in the second stage of a four-year plan, consists of a mobility flow of 40 students towards the United Kingdom, France and Germany who will be coordinated by 4 teachers and 4 members of our staff. \r\nThe middle and long-term strategy aims at a gradual increase of the mobility: from the third year, this will be implemented by expanding the destinations located in the Mediterranean area and/or in the Northern, Central and Eastern European countries and, due to the expected increase of know-how and operational strategies, we will increase the number of students (up to 50) involved in the mobility project. The time spent abroad will enable beneficiaries to carry out an internship in companies or institutions selected with the support of transnational partners (A1 activity of the present form). The privileged sectors will be consistent with the educational targets of our school: cultural heritage and tourism, public and private institutions operating in the field of communications (primarily for students enrolled in the classical humanities course of our school); art and entertainment, with particular regard to music and dance, will be the fields of interest of some other students (especially those who are enrolled in Liceo Azuni's music and dance related courses).   \r\nThese activities will allow the implementation of disciplinary theoretical acquisitions and the development of the ability to transfer the so-called soft skills in the workplace. It is expected that the placements will produce effective results in terms of a conscious study and/or work guidance and, thanks to the Europass and the ECVET certification provided within the project, enhance employability. The habit to intercultural dialogue and the familiarity with foreign languages, as natural outcomes of the mobility experiences, will allow young citizens living in a place strongly determined by insularity, to open themselves to local, regional and national opportunities, which of course relate to the European context of the knowledge society and to the global market.\r\nThese targets are consistent with those identified by the European International Agenda 2020, which is an essential point of reference for our school's educational plan. The latter already promotes the learning of two foreign languages through a series of activities: exchange projects with European schools and linguistic internships abroad (Germany, France, Denmark); collaboration with the local branch of the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and with the authorized Cambridge and IELTS test centres in the organization of courses for the achievement of international linguistic certifications. This is complementary to the CLIL methodology, which we intend to strengthen and extend to a second foreign language through the simultaneous mobility of staff members (A2 activity of this form). The latter will be able to optimize the effectiveness of the mobility project and make a direct impact on all members of the school and, by virtue of the formal and informal dissemination of activities among colleagues, improve the ability to change learning/teaching methods. Indeed, the strengthening of linguistic skills, CLIL teaching methods and the use of ITC, objectives shared with the partner organizations, will immediately lead to the enrichment of professional resources of the school, which will be also improved by the exchange of good practices acquired through future experiences of job shadowing. \r\nWe also intend to aim at new curricula that will cover from the starting year the learning of two foreign languages and that will allow the strengthening of student-centred teaching methods that optimize the resources offered by new technologies. \r\nIn view of the fact that a high percentage of students engaged in internship experiences abroad is represented by minors, the presence of teachers as tutors is required (one out of ten students for the entire duration of the mobility). Their ongoing professional support on-site guarantees the smooth running of the experience and its enrichment.

We plan to send 12 pupils - 6 pupils from the car-mechanic division and 6 students from the machine and equipment mechanics division. The accompanying teachers would be 4 - two from the Business and Services Department and two from the Food Department.\r\nPupils will take part in three-week professional practice at the workplace of the training center of the receiving organization in Krakow.\r\nWeekly training is available for employees.\r\nThe expected date for both activities is February-May 2019.\r\n\r\nOur strategy of internationalization is focused on developing the educational process by innovating the offered educational programs, increasing the expertise of pupils and our teachers and developing international cooperation. Participants will gain new experience in professional education at international level. At each stage of the project, we apply the elements of the ECVET system. \r\nPupils will participate in the receiving organization of professional practice, achieving learning outcomes described through knowledge, skills and competences. The participant who successfully completes the learning outcomes will be assessed in relevant subject. Recognition of acquired knowledge, skills and competences - learning outcomes - will be reflected in the qualification profile of the graduate - implementation in the training program, Report Supplement. Participants receive the Certificate and the Europass Mobility.\r\nPupils will acquire professional competencies - car-mechanic:\r\nDetecting errors, estimate needed and important repairs, repairs and replacement of damaged parts, testing the vehicle to check the repair, mount and service accessories such as radios and alarms\r\n- machine and equipment mechanics:\r\nSetting out the materials to be cut or joined, following engineering instructions and drawings, inspecting and testing cuts and joins, using precision measuring instruments, operating the semi-automatic spot-welding equipment used in high volume production lines, maintaining CNC machines\r\n\r\nThey will develop their personality skills, increase their self-esteem, self-confidence, taking responsibility, improve self-assessment, cooperation and develop interpersonal relationships. They will recognize the receiving organization, the culture of the host country. \r\nThey will learn to orient themselves in a foreign environment. They recognize their European citizenship and verify the application of the principle of equal opportunities for EU citizens in the labor market.\r\nThey will improve their English language skills in professional terminology - tools and aids used in diagnostics, repair and assembly of cars, machinery and equipment, as well as communication in everyday life - accommodation, travel, shopping, presentation of our school and our country Slovakia.\r\n\r\nGained international experience should positively influence the attitude of pupils towards lifelong learning, which is important for their application to the European labor market. They motivate pupils to participate in other international programs.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the teaching staff training is to transfer the acquired experience, new ideas, methods and approaches to teaching in our country - the innovation of the educational program.\r\nTeachers will know the partner institution and they will be able to compare training in our country and in Poland. Their international mobility will help them to develop language competencies.

We regularly carry out all the planned mobilities, which we expand every year, as we want to find quality learning places for all the educational programs that we implement. We update the content of curricula based on experience from abroad. Cooperation with education organizations lead to several examples of good practices (eg transfer of chemical labeling practices) to the introduction of modern methods of teaching. With mobility, we raise the level of professional profile of staff and thus the quality of the education process. VET practical education abroad enables the integration of professional and soft competences - in practice and in daily organizational problems. We strive to maintain a constant connection with global trends in the profession and the labor market, and therefore we strongly encourage staff training and therefore we cooporate in Erasmus + program as well as with national programs (Raising Vocational Teacher Competencies).\r\nIn the past year, we met with ECVET expert and implemented improvements to follow ECVET principles more systematically. In recognizing student learning outcomes, we take into account and assess the acquired knowledge abroad. One of the novelties is the form, which gives us an assessment of the practical knowledge of every student at a foreign employer. All participants in mobility also receive Europass mobility.\r\nThe selection of students is carried out on the basis of published criteria and the counseling service can propose candidates according to special needs and social status.\r\nWe pay special attention to the preparation of students for mobility - we conduct a workshop on preparing CVs and take care of the transfer of international experiences among students. A part of the preparations is also a language course and a review of the geography / history of the host.\r\nTeachers are involved in the preparation of documents and the organization of the path, and receive practical information from colleagues who have already been on training in a given host country.\r\nIn the past year, we attended a workshop at CMEPIUS entitled \"Strengthening the employment potential of students\" and implemented new methods in the framework of student mobility evaluation. After mobility, we meet with students and we embed an international experience with an emphasis on the acquired soft competencies. In this way, students share informal experiences with us, and on the basis of the information obtained we improve the next mobility and prepare students better for them.\r\nWith teachers returning from mobility, we discuss the quality of work placements and staff training places in order to improve them in the future. After the completion of the project, teachers are provided with instructions for obtaining points. They also submit a report to their pedagogical supervisor, to fulfill their training announced in the yearly work plan.\r\nStudents give their experiences to classmates and the general public (blog), and teachers to staff and employers. The result of knowledge learned abroad is a book pastry Kruharije & Cukrnije with recipes and methods, which have been taught abroad for many years. Teachers of the Veterinary Techniques (VT) program are regularly involved in the training and introduce the most recent practical tasks (PEPAS system) in professional matura courses of the VT program.\r\nEvery 2-3 years at BIC Ljubljana we organize an international professional conference where we connect our participants of education and professional public from Slovenia and abroad. We often associate the conference with Erasmus + invited lecturers from abroad.\r\nWith E + mobility we aim to improve the employability of students. The former student participated in the first mobility at the time she attended the BIC LJ as a confectioner. Later, she enrolled to vocational college BIC LJ and again successfully applied for the Erasmus + placement. She found her practice at a high-quality employer in Belgium - Del Rey confectionery, ranked among the 100 best confectioners in the world. At the end of the practice, she was offered an immediate regular employment, which she intends to accept immediately after graduation.\r\nGeneraly the sscope of mobility is expanding. In this project, we start with more long-term mobilities (14 - 60 days) and mobility without accompanying persons. For the first time in the application form we also add the possibility of practical training for adult participants in the VET  program and mobility after the completion of the high school programs.\r\nWe provide an accompanying person in some mobilities (short-term) because they relate practical work to the content of school work, and thus provide short-term mobility efficiency.", "http://www.tellusgroup.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SI01-KA116-046748_4"], ["6LF", "oblikujem svojo las(t)no kariero", "TELLUS EDUCATION GROUP LIMITED", 132128.0, "MAIN ACTIVITIES AND EVENTS DEVELOPMENT.\r\nAll activities needed to be accomplished for a quality mobility project are meant to achieve short- and long-term goals.We wish to increase the number of students and teachers to enjoy a quality mobility project abroad.\r\nFor this reason we made contact with a new partner organization from Malta, Easy Job Bridge, which we met at the Intern. Conference hosted by the School Centre NG, which has been cooperating with them for a long time.\r\nWe changed our partner organization in GB, because they did not help us reach our goals completely. We are therefore enhancing the number of students adding four more students and two teachers, which means 1% of the students in our school.\r\nWe are planning to improve the quality of our mobility projects for students and teachers and to increase the amount of school exchanges (mobilities).\r\nThe students involved in mobility project 2017 in London, visited two salons where two former students work. They both underlined that working abroad is very demanding. However, they constantly upgrade their career goals. The students also interviewed Trevor Sorbie, the owner of one of the two salons. His life experience deeply impressed the students and consequently their schoolmates too, because Trevor Sorbie is an internationally renowned hairstyling icon. He confirmed that we can overcome obstacles thanks to our good will, perseverance and commitment. \r\nWe will maximize further possibilities to enable students and accompanying (acc.) teachers to share their newly acquired knowledge and experience by making, for example, a presentation at the employer's salon, through various promotions at the elementary schools, at the Chamber of Craft and Small Business , at TV Ljubljana.\r\nIn 2018 we wish to increase the cooperation with schools from Central Europe and ex-Yugoslavia countries. We are arranging preparatory meetings at the secondary school in \u010cakovec, Croatia, in Novi Sad and Ruma, Serbia, where teachers who were at our school in December 2017 from the secondary school in Pe\u0107inci, Serbia, will help us.\r\nDuring our prep. meetings in 2017 in Parnu (EST.), Havirov (CZ), Lorient (FR) and teachers' visit to our school from Helsinki (FIN), \u010cakovec (CRO) and Pe\u0107inci (SRB) we presented our projects through our different school activities. We agreed with the coordinators on inviting on 9th May 2018 professional teachers from Lorient, Parnu, \u010cakavec and Havirov to our Hairstyling Fashion Show organized by our 3rd year students.\r\nIn 2018 we intend to continue with the Spanish language course after learning our first Spanish words in Spring 2018. If the teachers are interested, we will organize an English language course to enhance their knowledge.\r\nAs far as internationalization is concerned, we are organizing an English language course for employers owning a salon who are involved in mobility projects and help foreign students to carry out their vocational training placement. The course is held by our teacher Monica Caltran who is training skills in Erasmus+ projects at school. The main Erasmus+ coordinator is joining the education training 'Efficient and Effective Project Management for EU funded projects' in Barcelona from 30th July to 3rd August 2018.\r\nEVENTS DEVELOPMENT IN ATTACHMENT 1.\r\nNEED FOR ACCOMPANYING TEACHERS.\r\nOur students are 16 or 17 years old. Only few of them have already flown. Therefore the acc. teachers play a vital role starting from their help at the airport.\r\nThe teachers are together with the students only for one week. After that the students are supposed to be independent. As a relatively small school a teacher can't be absent from work for a long time. Due to family obligations teachers can't afford to stay abroad for a month. According to our experience our organization system works well. Although the students find it difficult to cope when the teachers leave, they are positively surprised after a few days by their independence and ingenuity. The transition is thus easier and smoother, the parents feel more relieved.The acc. teachers are in most cases also tourist guides, because they do some sightseeing with the students. They help them to orientate themselves, to get familiar with the new school and professional environment. Teachers and students keep contact with each other through e-mails, skype or telephone calls.\r\nIf two teachers take part in the mobility project, they join a job-shadowing. The teachers play two roles in this case. We are sending two professional teachers to Great Britain, because Salon International and The Alternative Hair Show are of fundamental importance from a professional point of view and enable them to share their expertise with the colleagues.\r\nIn 2017 one employer, who is a mentor to our and foreign students, participated in the above mentioned fair and show. In the future we are going to organize other mobility projects involving employers and making sure they will get high quality training in their field.", "http://www.tellusgroup.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SI01-KA116-046893_1"], ["6LF", "Nadgradimo znanje z izku\u0161njami", "TELLUS EDUCATION GROUP LIMITED", 188080.0, "Main activities\r\n\r\nThe selection procedure for mobility participants will be conducted according to a predetermined timetable. We want to make the process transparent, and open to all students. This can be achieved with clear selection criteria an competent commission We will start the selection process with a public call in March, and we will finish it by publishing the results  in the months of April or May.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to prepare a mobility program. We have already concluded agreements with host organizations with which we have agreed on responsibilities and tasks.\r\nAfter completing the selection process, we will send data on students, mobility participants (CV, \"Learning outcomes\") to all host organizations. On the basis of these documents, we will jointly develop training programs in times of mobility. Teachers of professional subjects will also assess the suitability of the program.  We will start with the introduction of ECVET tools for the WBL program.\r\nFor the teachers, we will prepare the program in cooperation with them and the coordinator of the host organization. Self-initiative by the teacher is important.\r\nOn the basis of the mobility program, we will prepare contractual documentation, which will be the basis for the financial and content implementation of each mobility.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the travel and accommodation of students will be organized in agreement with the host organizations. In previous mobility projects, this part of the preparations was carried out without major problems. It is important that the procedures are completed at least one month before the beginning of mobility.\r\n\r\nIn the field of preparing the participants of mobility, there are many possibilities for improvement. So far, we have carried out longer preparations only in the case of students leaving for mobility within the scope of 20 days. In this case, we organized the preparations within one week. In the future, we will continue with this form of preparation. In other cases, shorter preparations were carried out. In the new project, we intend to organize longer preparations for other students. The terms will be selected so that students will not miss regular classes (weekends, after school lessons).\r\n\r\nMonitoring of participants in the time of mobility is carried out in various ways. On the way to the host organization we always try to ensure the teacher's escort. The teacher as a companion is with the students only for the first few days. They teach students how to travel safely, check the quality of the accommodation and accompany pupils to the workplace.\r\nProgress at the workplace is monitored by the mentor of the student. Indirectly, the coordinator of the sending and receiving organization is included in the monitoring. So far, teachers of professional subjects have not yet taken part in this process. We will start this in the new project. A teacher of professional subjects will already be involved in the preparation of the training program, and then in contact with the mentor in the company. The system of cooperation of teachers of professional subjects and mentors in companies will be developed gradually.\r\n\r\nEvaluation of each mobility will be done in several areas. So far, we have not systematically dealt with the evaluation. The main method of evaluation was the interview with students who returned from mobility. In the document \"Strategy of Internationalization\", the areas of evaluation were defined. By preparing appropriate mechanisms and systematic work, we will be able to monitor and improve the overall mobility process.\r\n\r\nDissemination of activities will take place in the framework of all promotional activities of School Center Kranj: events, web site, social networks, Radio Kranj, Zlatopolj\u010dan magazine ... We will spread the results both among employees and participants in education as well as in the local environment.\r\n\r\nThe scope of mobility flows\r\n\r\nThe two-year project we will involve 86 students and 12 teachers. There are also 12 accompanying teachers envisaged.\r\nIn the project, all student mobility will take two to four weeks. The aim of all mobility is to improve knowledge in the field of expertise, better linguistic competence, a sense of understanding of the European perspective and the acquisition of other key competences.\r\nTeacher mobility will take place simultaneously with student mobility. In Macedonia, teachers will prepare education for the teachers of the school in the field of electrical engineering and mechatronics. In the United Kingdom, teacher mobility will be carried out in the form of \"Job shadowing\".\r\nThe task of accompanying teachers is to safely monitor students on the way to the host organization, help with the installation and viewing of the workplace of the pupil.

During the Call we are planning the cooperation with proven partners (a partner school, 2 hotels, 2 receiving organizations), rights and obligations with them will be clearly defined and insured through contracts. There will be also some underage participants among the interns, that\u2019s why we are planning the participation of accompanying persons for all short-term traineeship. We have verified that the accompanying person is very important for groups of interns (she monitors adherence to the content of the traineeship and the estimated learning outcomes, eliminates possible risks and is also important for the social climate formation). \r\nFor the three-month ErasmusPro long term mobility we have started a cooperation with a new partner in Ireland. The competences of the coordinator we had cooperated with during the LdV programme (PLM) are a kind of guarantee of the high-quality mobility. In spite of this fact, we are going to realize a planning visit before the traineeship. We are not planning a stay of accompanying person during the ErasmusPro traineeship. The work placement will also be a great motivation for studying foreign languages. While communicating in English the participants will use grounding in spoken language of the host country (Spanish, French). The participants will undergo special language, professional, psychological and cultural training before their departure abroad. After finishing the internship they will receive a certificate of taking part in the work placement as well as their work evaluation in terms of ECVET system and Europass-Mobility. \r\nLearning units have been worked out for every our branch of study. The school\u2019s traditional welfare partner - Regional economy chamber of Moravian-Silesian region \u2013 will be involved in the project. The projects will be under continuous monitoring and evaluation and will be presented at official school events, on web sites, facebook as well as in the regional mass media. It is expected that the participants of the internship will share a sense of the gained experiences with almost all our students at the school workshop which will be prepared and organized by all mobility participants.", "http://www.tellusgroup.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-CZ01-KA116-047207_3"], ["6LF", "Refor\u00e7ar a identidade europeia com a partilha de saberes, celebrando a diversidade e a riqueza cultural", "TELLUS EDUCATION GROUP LIMITED", 82684.0, "We understand that our project is part of a line of continuity of what has been our work over the past years in European projects. Initially, as a Leonardo da Vinci program and more recently with the Erasmus + program. However, it is our conviction that we can and should improve our practice in order to benefit our young people (former trainees and graduates) and our teachers and trainers, promoting the development of skills and the sharing of knowledge.\r\nIf we take into account the current context of change in Europe, it is urgent that our young people, as well as professionals, all European citizens, be challenged and prepared for the opportunities that are offered to them in a broader European context. For this reason, our mobility experiences are a tool that encourages, through the sharing of experiences and good practices, the promotion of European citizenship and European cultural heritage, understanding the specificities of each of us.\r\nOur experience in European projects allows us to invest in the training of all those involved in this project, focusing on the promotion of cultural diversity, social and inclusive cohesion and the social and economic development of all persons involved. These are intrinsic factors of this project operationalization. It is for this reason that we think it is crucial to maintain the European partners who work with us from the beginning of our experience, who have taught us a lot and with whom we share the best we can do in practical terms, but also in human terms. However, we felt that it was necessary to go further and try out new formative contexts and new cultural experiences for all involved. We have thus extended our network of partners in the European area, including new institutions as new partners from Italy, Austria, Finland and Spain.\r\nWe are convinced that we have achieved so far a level of excellence in our initial and continuing education processes, which translates into the differentiation of curricula according to the needs of local, national and international companies on one hand, but also, in what concerns the interaction between people and communities through the dissemination of their heritage, traditions and their technical and cultural know-how, thus promoting innovation, the sharing of good practices and the intercultural dialogue.\r\nOur intention with this project is answering to the challenges of Europe, satisfying the new demands of the labor market, promoting equitable and inclusive opportunities for all citizens, but also raising their awareness of social, linguistic, and cultural heritage, strengthening ties between European countries. We believe that it is through sharing experiences that those involved in this project will be more inclined to understand the importance of European themes in inclusive, prospective and transversal terms.\r\nWe understand that we have been consistent in achieving our objectives over the years, pointing out our continued participation in European projects as a continuous strategy for the future. In this way, our graduates and staff will always be able to experience new professional, linguistic, social and cultural contexts in order to also experience a different way of living their European citizenship. It is for all those involved, and for our Institution, a differentiating and enriching element in a market that wants to be more and more challenging and demanding. However, we do not forget in our strategy of continuity and future, the social, cultural and inclusive dimension of our project, despite the apparent economic recovery of our country, young people are increasingly moving in the European territory looking for better professional and social conditions. This project provides all the beneficiaries an empowering tool of opportunities for a future life, especially for the most disadvantaged.\r\nIn short, we understand that we are prepared to develop this project in an increasingly assumed form of our European citizenship, contributing to the investment in continuous training through the sharing of good practices, skills and knowledge. Moreover, we add our purpose to express our pride in our European identity, allowing the sustainable development of our economy and the promotion of our cultural heritage as part of the European Heritage.", "http://www.tellusgroup.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-PT01-KA116-047215_5"], ["6LF", "Zabra\u0148me tepeln\u00fdm ztr\u00e1t\u00e1m: Okna", "TELLUS EDUCATION GROUP LIMITED", 167075.0, "Project Stop Heat Loss: Windows is based on the needs and visions of St\u0159edn\u00ed \u0161kola stavebn\u00ed T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d described in the European Internationalization Strategy 2017 -2020 (EIS).
