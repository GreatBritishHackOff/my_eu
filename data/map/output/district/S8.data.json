Deemed as a 'Good' school by Ofsted, two-thirds of its students choose to study A-Levels at the school. It is awaiting a new Sixth form centre extension. Space for teaching and learning is problematic so innovative curriculum design, strong leadership, and maintaining staff morale pose key challenges during this difficult time. \r\n\r\nThe school has an ageing yet very experienced senior leadership team, and a training need for middle managers who aspire to become senior leaders, but lack the experience and quality training. Succession planning is a key priority. The school must market itself and its International ethos successfully to recruit, train and maintain staff well-being to retain the best teaching and support staff, and to train and develop aspiring leaders to fulfil some key school management roles in the future.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this application is to secure much needed funding to address these issues through bespoke and innovative leadership and management training courses in Europe, which will result in a positive impact on the school leadership strategy.\r\nOne of the 4 key whole school 2016-19 improvement priorities focusses on leadership and management, with 6 strands; Clarity of vision, values and priorities; high shared expectations and standards; rigorous quality assurance; leadership at all levels; staff development; resource development and management.  \r\n\r\nTo improve our school leadership and management, we will send 20 key staff to Sweden or Poland over the next two years to complete bespoke training courses. We are targeting aspiring leaders, and although we will adopt a fair and transparent internal application process, we expect participants to include Y7-Y13 Year team staff (comprising 7 Heads of Year and 7 pastoral managers) 1 SEN Manager, 1 Communications Manager, and 4 Curriculum leaders (some of these are Assistant Headteachers). These key staff aspire to lead the school in future and assume management roles. Our Authority Level support manager and British council ambassador has recommended the Swedish and Polish training providers as they have a proven track record of providing high quality bespoke training courses in school leadership and management for international delegates. We will select and send 10 staff in Year 1 to the Swedish partner locality, and a further 10 staff in Year 2 to the course in Poland. Course providers will tailor the training to the role profiles of successful applicants.\r\n\r\nParticipants will share good practice, learning outcomes and suggestions for improvement with whole school via INSET days and Year team meetings, and governor reports. They will play a strategic role in the implementation, dissemination, and evaluation processes, and will drive necessary changes (with support from the SLT) in 2019-20. The result will be whole school improvement. These staff will work with senior management to raise the profile of their work, which will have a stronger International dimension. This will have a positive impact on teaching and learning and raising of aspirations for staff and students.  They will modify systems and aspects of the curriculum to embed best practice observed during the project. \r\n\r\nLonger term, staff will be better skilled, happy and more confident in their ability to progress to leadership roles, to fill gaps left behind by the SLT as they leave or retire, and this will allow us to improve succession planning. This project will help to recruit and retain high quality staff, as they will see the opportunity for career development and progression routes within a forward-thinking school with a stronger International dimension.", "http://www.meadowhead.sheffield.sch.uk", "Meadowhead School Academy Trust", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035607_coordinator"], ["8BR", "Camino hacia un Mundo de Mujeres STEM", "Meadowhead School Academy Trust", 5856.0, "All current indicators regarding employment expectations in the near future in Europe are clearly oriented to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields of knowledge.  Fundaci\u00f3n San Valero is dedicating resources and efforts to promote effective teaching and learning in STEM, as one of our strategic lines of action is Educational Innovation. However, it is a reality within our School that rates of female students who undertake Technical Areas directly linked to STEM throughout all different educational levels, are still very low and in a near future they are to be displaced from a labor market where staff recruitment is clearly rising.  We need therefore to implement strategies for women to break the \"fear\" to access technical areas related to STEM and to encourage their interest in these disciplines in all educational levels we offer from the Fundaci\u00f3n San Valero of Secondary Education, \"Bachillerato\"and VET. In turn this need is oriented towards our vocation of social inclusion, in the broadest sense of the word, and particularly promoting gender equality.                                              \r\nIn order to address all needs previously identified, the current project has established as key targets to enhance training teachers' competences so as to improve their skills in teaching STEM subjects, as well as to acquire effective motivation strategies upon female students, improving team work and placing value on mixed team\u2019s greater efficiency. We also believe that it is important to foster inclusion in our school through gender equality when accessing STEM and always within a European context. This will allow incorporating successful strategies applied in similar contexts in other European countries, continuing the path we have undertaken all these previous years through COMENIUS and ERASMUS + actions.\r\nParticipant profiles in staff mobility will be School Departments Teachers related to STEM areas such as Sciences and Mathematics and also VET Technological subjects, standing out for being great expertise and passionate when teaching STEM subjects. They also have a clear vocation and motivation to act as ambassadors after mobilities have taken place. Two teachers will participate in each of all three mobility activities to different European countries, where at least one will be a female teacher.\r\nJob Shadowing activities will be programmed in three different partner schools, with key features that are lined up with our project objectives. \u201cMeadowhead School Academy Trust\u201d (Sheffield, UK), in particular, are experts in applying teaching methods in STEM Areas; In the \u201cGymnasium auf der Karthaus\u201d (Koblenz, Germany) where they are succeeding in promoting a greater number of women learning STEM and improving female student\u00b4s academic results through bilingualism (German-English); and in the \u201cSecondary Vocational and Technical School\u201d (Be\u017eigrad, Slovenia) by applying the design of Project- Based Learning programs in VET STEM fields. These activities will be complemented with companies, business associations and women's association\u2019s visits and meetings, in order to better understand status of women's access to STEM.\r\nAfter mobility activities take place, teachers are expected to acquire new skills in teaching methods and its implementation in the classroom, thus improving their teaching work in the STEM area, as well as strategies to motivate female students towards Stem, promoting gender equality. Motivation towards teaching work and the ability to become an ambassador with the rest of the teaching staff will be reinforced. As for the long-term impact, hopefully the number of female students at different levels of education accessing STEM areas are to increase, incorporation of new innovative teaching methods into STEM areas will be added to the School Innovation Plan and finally ties will be strengthen with all European partner schools by applying for a KA2 proposal in following Erasmus+ calls where female student mobility will be included.", "http://www.meadowhead.sheffield.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-037516_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "S8"}
