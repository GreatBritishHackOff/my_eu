Heating one end of a thermoelectric material causes the electrons to move away from the hot end towards the cold end. Electrons flowing from the hot to the cold side result in an electrical current.\n\nSuch devices made of different materials are already used for applications such as portable coolers and to cool off car seats. Researchers working on the http://www.innovteg.com/ (INNOVTEG) (An innovative very low-cost thermo-electric technology for large-scale renewable solar energy applications) project sought to open up thermoelectric materials to more applications.\n\nWith the support of the EU, the researchers have made progress on the performance of nano-structured thermoelectric materials. Thermoelectric materials can turn a temperature difference into electricity, but an efficient thermoelectric material would generate electricity without conducting heat.\n\nMost good electrical conductors are also good thermal conductors. INNOVTEG's solution is based on low-cost and abundant transition metal sulphides. The thermoelectric efficiency of tens of different materials \u2014 including NiCr2S4 \u2014 was evaluated to identify the best candidate materials for further development.\n\nThe performance of the selected materials was enhanced through modern synthesis techniques, including nano-structuring. Specifically, nanopowders synthesised of different sulphides were first characterised and then consolidated into dense pucks of thermoelectric materials.\n\nModelling carried out by the INNOVTEG team showed that the developed materials enable design of a thermoelectric system suitable for building integration. The thermoelectric generator prototype was integrated into a test panel and tested for safety and performance.\n\nThe INNOVTEG thermoelectric generator is expected to achieve an output of about 30\u00a0W per square metre across a range of European climatic conditions.

If they are unable to achieve targets, then this may have a significant negative impact on manufacturers. Cars also produce emissions such as Nitrogen oxides, Hydrocarbons, Carbon monoxide and particulate matter which are subject to tight controls. For marine application, existing and forthcoming legislation is aiming at reducing the emissions of Carbon Monoxide, Hydrocarbons and particulate matter. In addition, concerns about rising fuel costs are driving the need for greater fuel efficiencies. As a result, a disruptive technology step is required that will enable the manufactures or cars and marine engines to meet the forthcoming legislative standards. One very attractive way of achieving this is to generate power from the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) waste heat.\nA prototype system created by BMW can generate up to 250W of electricity under normal driving conditions that can cut fuel consumption by up to 2%. However, the thermo-electric materials used for these applications to date have a number of clear limitations as they can be easily thermally damaged, are expensive and only achieve low efficiencies.\nThe POWER DRIVER project aims to overcome the limitations relating to the production of an automotive and marine power generation system by integrating cutting-edge nano-structured silicide and functionally graded telluride thermo-electric materials into a heat exchanger assembly that will enable electrical power to be generated from the exhaust system without affecting back-pressure or engine balance. By doing this, the exhaust system created will offer greatly improved environmental performance due to improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions (CO2, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulates) at a cost that is affordable to the end-user.

While it has long been known that waste heat can be converted into energy the efficiency of early thermoelectric power generation systems was so low that it limited their applications.\n\nThermoelectric generators are essentially devices designed to convert heat directly into electricity using two materials and a temperature gradient. The greater the temperature difference between the 'hot' side and the 'cold' side the greater the power that can be produced.\n\nWithin the http://www.powerdriver.info/ (POWER DRIVER) project the focus was to design thermoelectric generators that could be mass produced for use in automotive waste heat recovery.\n\nSpecifically, two small thermoelectric generators have been designed: one based on silicide materials and another on telluride materials. Silicide and lead telluride (Pb/Te) based materials were synthesised and then processed using spark plasma sintering to produce thermo-electric materials with performance comparable to that found in the literature.\n\nThe thermoelectric devices have been integrated with control and power electronics. The most suitable solution was selected for mounting onto a hot air testrig where the exhaust of a 2litre gasoline car was simulated to establish its performance. This, in addition to estimated manufacturing and selling costs, was used to evaluate the new technology's commercial attractiveness.\n\nOnce completed the POWER DRIVER system will extract waste heat from the exhaust that will deliver direct current electrical power to the vehicle electrical system and thus reduce the alternator demand giving improved fuel efficiency by as much as 5 %.", null, "http://www.etdyn.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/148548.jpg", "fp7_102258_968703596"], ["0RX", "Waste Heat to Electrical Energy via Sustainable Organic Thermoelectric Devices", "European Thermodynamics Limited", "It is estimated that mankind wastes ~20% of the 15 terawatts required annually for global power consumption as low level heat (<200 oC).

Widespread availability of new low-cost organic thermoelectric devices would allow direct heat-to-electrical energy (H2E) from this vast, essentially untapped, resource generating a new industrial sector based on local power generation from otherwise wasted energy sources (engines, boilers, heat pumps, etc.)  amounting up to 50 billion \u20ac/yr. New materials and devices are needed to achieve such disruptive technology as present approaches are not viable for reasons either of: (i) device inefficiency, and/or (ii) global raw material unavailability preventing widespread implementation.

The EU is funding the project 'Waste heat to electrical energy via sustainable organic thermoelectric devices' (http://www.h2esot.com/ (H2ESOT)) to develop the necessary advanced and cost-effective organic thermoelectric materials to make this possible. Validation of the disruptive technology could forever change the sustainability of the energy landscape with a simple and inexpensive solution.\n\nThermoelectric materials are rated with a dimensionless ZT score of 0 for ineffective, above 1 for commercially interesting and more than 2 for unprecedented at room temperature. H2ESOT is pursuing development of tetracene-based materials, particularly tetrathiotetracene (TTT). Tetracene is a crystalline organic semiconductor. In the form of single crystals, tetracene-based materials could theoretically yield ZTs of 1 to 2.\n\nTeam members are now optimising synthesis of large quantities of functionalised tetracene-based materials with excellent electronic and physical properties. In parallel, researchers are working on issues of purification and deposition. The team has produced single crystals of TTT-based materials. New equipment is enabling unprecedented thermoelectric testing of small molecules for rapid screening. Evidence suggests that single crystals have higher conductivities than thin films and so they will be the focus for the remainder of the project.\n\nThe Holy Grail for the next 18 months is establishing exquisite control over crystal properties. Theoretical predictions from computational work showed that electrical conductivities rise by more than 10-fold as defects in the crystal decrease. This suggests that even a material with poor ZT could become an exceptional material if the properties of the crystals can be carefully controlled. Building on the already successful production of single crystals, the project is ahead of schedule in terms of device manufacture. Preliminary fabrication of components for the first prototypes is underway and a test rig is being made.\n\nH2ESOT could be a defining point in the history of energy and global climate change.
