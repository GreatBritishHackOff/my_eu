Treatment of younger patients with severe hip disease using a conventional THR presents a challenge with the rate of success being very low, (most failing within 16 years). To over come this Finsbury help develop the MoM BHR resurfacing hip with a survival rate of 93% over a conventional THR. However, studies have reported high concentrations of Co &amp; Cr in the serum and/or urine of patients with MoM resurfacing implants. Studies have shown that increased levels of Co &amp; Cr cause caners such as leukaemia and are linked with myocardiopathy. During the course of this project we intend to overcome these problems by developing a ceramic one ceramic or ceramic on polymer resurfacing hip. Like that of the MOM prosthesis will only cover the femoral head thus retaining all of the desirable properties associated with retaining an intact femur.", 30877.0, 1290540.0, "ENDURE", "Safer and more durable hip implants", "Increasing the durability of hip prosthetics is sometimes accompanied by the release of hazardous substances into the body. EU-funded scientists developed novel ceramic-on-polymer prosthetics for a superior implant.", "An unsatisfactory proportion of prosthetics implanted during conventional total hip replacement (THR) fails within the first 16 to 20 years. An orthopedic consultant may recommend a procedure called hip resurfacing, rather than a (THR) for more active patients whose bones are of good quality, allowing greater preservation of natural bone in and around the joint and providing greater durability. This involves replacing the damaged or diseased surface of the ball and socket joint in the hip with highly polished metallic capping, known as metal on metal (MoM) hip resurfacing.  However, reports of high blood and serum levels of cobalt and chromium in patients with MoM devices have raised important concerns about their long-term effects.\n\nEU-funded scientists set out to develop an improved hip prosthesis using high-performance ceramics with high compressive strength, wear resistance and chemical inertness. The project 'Enhanced durability resurfacing endoprosthesis' http://www.endure-fp7.com/ ((ENDURE)) set the ambitious goal of a prosthetic lifetime in excess of thirty years.\n\nIn order to arrive at the ceramic-on-polymer resurfacing hip prosthesis, researchers focused on alumina matrix composite bioceramics and carbon fibre-reinforced poly\u2013ether\u2013ether\u2013ketone. They developed new cost-effective polymer-processing methods and employed extensive theoretical and experimental testing to arrive at the final designs. The system and its implantation were successfully tested and demonstrated by specialised surgeons working on cadavers.\n\nPreliminary publication of results on the project website has led to a flurry of inquiries and expressed interest, providing the impetus for expediting the clinical trials process. Commercialisation will be of great importance to the EU economy and the competitive position of its small and medium-sized enterprises working in the field. Reduction in revisional surgeries will also enable tremendous savings for the health system and, of course, significantly enhanced quality of life for the many hip replacement patients of every age.", "http://www.endure-fp7.com", "http://www.invibio.com", "/docs/results/images/2014-01/58286.jpg", "fp7_92265_997804178"], ["4QD", "Multiscale reinforcement of semi-crystalline thermoplastic sheets and honeycombs", "Victrex Manufacturing Limited", "The M-RECT project aims to create multiscale-reinforced semi-crystalline thermoplastics (PEEK and PPS), which will outperform all reinforced polymers in terms of strength, stiffness, creep and mainly damping by upscaling and further developing state of the art production methods, within cost-efficient manufacturing routes. The envisaged multiscale reinforcement will comprise of dispersed straightened and aligned to polymer molecules multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and also fully impregnated, long carbon fibres (CF). In order to achieve this objective a number of novel technological achievements including CNT functionalization techniques, fluid-assisted CNT alignment, microwave and induction heating of composites, out of autoclave manufacturing including bagging techniques, DIRIS sandwich panel production, fluoropolymer radiation-absorbing coatings and polymer optical fibre technology will be further developed and used. The CNT or multi-scale reinforced PEEK or PPS sheets and the resulting sandwich panels will be used as raw material for manufacturing laminated complex prototypes covering a wide range of industrial applications such as automotive, railroad, aeronautical, space, civil engineering and biomedical. Optimized design of these structures will be based on suitably developed numerical modelling and optimization tools within the proposed project and which will be validated through extensive testing at nano, meso and macro-scale. The anticipated impacts of the development of the envisaged top-performance lightweight thermoplastic composites and their manufacturing routes will extend to an international level by decreasing energy and fuel consumption, decreasing waste production and improving recyclability, creating profitable spin-off activities, promoting safety and improving the urban environment.", 230571.0, 5886554.0, "M-RECT", "Improved recyclable reinforced thermoplastics", "Reinforced polymers are used in the automotive and aerospace industries as well as for civil infrastructure such as bridges and railroads.

The EU-funded project 'Multiscale reinforcement of semi-crystalline thermoplastic sheets and honeycombs' (http://mrect.risk-technologies.com/ (M-RECT)) set out to create novel thermoplastics incorporating functionalised CNTs that outperform other reinforced polymers. The project covered the entire supply chain from CNT functionalisation to aid their dispersion in polymeric matrices, to finished component design, manufacturing, testing and use.\n\nScientists developed technologies resulting in successful functionalisation of CNTs and improved dispersion. The functionalisation processes are scalable and resulted in a patent application. Composite laminates based on the thermoplastic polymers polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polyphenylene sulphide were manufactured from the novel materials. These polymers are recyclable because unlike thermoset polymers, they can be reheated and reshaped into desired forms over and over. The team produced the laminates with both conventional manufacturing approaches as well as a novel impregnation technology for which a patent application was filed.\n\nThe team evaluated the mechanical properties and damage tolerance of these materials. Fracture toughness of the PEEK-CNT composites was improved compared to laminates without CNTs. Simulation results using models developed within the M-RECT project were in good correspondence with test results on validation components. The models will be valuable in guiding future development campaigns.\n\nMultifunctional honeycombs such as the curved, centre-symmetric SILICOMB structure are gaining interest for their enhanced structural integrity and light weight. Investigators also developed a variety of novel morphing honeycomb systems based on SILICOMB. These could offer important benefits in insulation and reduced fuel consumption, and development will continue in a follow-up project.\n\nIn addition to materials development, the team created a technology for damage assessment that can be moulded into a thermoplastic composite for structural health monitoring. In addition, scientists produced a tool for risk evaluation that has been distributed to consortium members for use during future development work.\n\nM-RECT has stimulated the development and use of novel thermoplastic composites exploiting functionalised CNTs.

Using existing and novel polymers, researchers are targeting an increase in operating temperature from the current state-of-the-art maximum of 200 degrees Celsius. The goal is a range from minimum 260 degrees Celsius to a maximum of 400 degrees Celsius. Further, the materials and processes must be able to facilitate this high-temperature performance in a large-area format with required overall length of 5 metres in a single-piece multilayer PCB without joints.\n\nWithin the first reporting period, a number of multilayer PCB samples were prepared from a variety of advanced polymers. Scientists subjected them to thermal cycling tests over the range of 260 to 330 degrees Celsius, and also conducted random vibration tests. Microsection analysis following the test campaign allowed researchers to draw important conclusions regarding polymer degradation. In particular, they determined the rate of propagation of polymer degradation from the PCB edge, aiding in delineation of PCB design rules. In addition, having identified oxidation as the major source of polymer degradation, the team is focusing on improving the robustness of the oxygen barrier for PCB performance optimisation.\n\nLHTFPCB investigators expect to deliver full-scale (5 metres long) single-piece multilayer flexible PCBs capable of withstanding at least 260 degrees Celsius and achieving a TRL of 6 in engine-level testing.
