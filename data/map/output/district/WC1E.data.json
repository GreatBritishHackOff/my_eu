Together with EFPIA partners our aims will be to set policy & guidance and deliver robust information technology tools to address the potential for the reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through mobile applications and the recognition of drug safety signals from user comments in social media and the internet. The policies, guidance and tools delivered through WEB-RADR will be underpinned by extensive academic research and user testing to ensure the project meets the needs of all stakeholders, including patients.\n\nBackground\nReporting by healthcare professionals and patients by means of mobile devices and social media platforms to National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and marketing authorisation holders with subsequent transmission to EudraVigilance is a new, unexplored concept. The amount of information generated through social media requires a structured, scientific approach for monitoring, reporting, analysing and evaluation of ADRs. Whilst there are numerous benefits of the use of social media, the impact on healthcare professionals and patients and their behaviour towards the use of medicines needs to be further analysed. WEB-RADR will address these areas.\n\nLeadership\nWEB-RADR will be managed by the MHRA\u2019s project management team that are also leading the EC Joint Action (Strengthening Collaborations for Operating Pharmacovigilance in Europe, SCOPE). This will enable the alignment and consistency of the two projects. The MHRA has extensive experience in managing successful pharmacovigilance and IT projects (E2B compliant web-forms for ADR reporting; integration with EudraVigilance; drug and medical dictionary mapping; integration with NHS electronic health records) as well as being a leading regulatory agency, helping to shape the current legislative framework.\nEstablishing clear policies and guidance for stakeholders in the use of these technologies, in line with legislative requirements, is of paramount importance to regulators and industry. The EMA will provide leadership in this area, supported by colleagues from MHRA, HALMED & LAREB. As the central regulatory agency for medicines policy in the EU it is natural for the EMA lead in this area as the outputs of WEB-RADR will have a direct bearing on future operations affecting EudraVigilance, Good Vigilance Practice (GVP) guidance, signal detection and risk communication. Expertise from a national perspective together with EFPIA input will also be essential.\n\nTechnical Platform\nThe development of technical platforms for both the reporting of ADRs via a mobile application and recognising drug safety issues from social media will be led by Epidemico who already offer a number of products through an ongoing partnership with the FDA. Working with SRDC and EFPIA sponsors, WEB-RADR will produce an online dashboard and data feed of data identifying ADRs from social media in multiple languages. A mobile app for direct reporting of ADRs to national authorities in E2B(R2) Individual Case Safety Report compatible format will be developed. To achieve this we propose to expand the prototype MedWatcher Social platform to include social media monitoring in the EU and the MedWatcher App for reporting ADRs.\n\nAnalysis\nLed by UMC and working with SRDC, WEB-RADR will ensure the technical platform for gathering drug safety data from social media delivers meaningful and useable data in the EU pharmacovigilance setting. It is essential that data collected use standardised drug, product and medical terms. Mapping of the terms to ensure compatibility with EudraVigilance and NCA databases will be carried out so that terms in the Article 57 database and MedDRA are the basis for analysis. It is essential to detect and manage duplicate reports. A major effort in WEB-RADR will be the advancement of new methodologies to meet this challenge.

However, assessing the expected future value of the medicines when used in \u201creal world\u201d clinical practice requires additional information next to traditional (pre-authorisation) clinical trials.  Regulatory, HTA agencies and other healthcare decision makers have to make decisions on authorisation and access under conditions of uncertainty.  Currently, data packages which aim to minimise uncertainty on safety and efficacy may leave significant uncertainty in assessments of real world effectiveness of new medicines.  This results in further research commitments required post-authorisation (PASS, PAES, Reimbursement with Evidence Generation), and wide variability in access to medicines between countries. \nThe subsequent uncertainty relating to the reimbursement, and thus market implementation of new medication once approved by regulatory authorities, is negatively affecting the value of the drug development pipeline. The costly clinical developments to get to market approval, no longer seem to be a guarantee for market entry. This new risk presents a serious additional hurdle for drug developers that already face pipeline attrition. It also affects the speed and level of patient access, and therefore the extent to which patients and society might benefit from new medicines. \nIn recent years there has been considerable attention paid to the post-authorisation evaluation of treatments in real world clinical practice: study design and analytical methodology for assessing relative effectiveness; and use of registries and electronic healthcare data.

Telomeres are consumed during cell division but can be replenished by telomerase, a unique ribonucleoprotein enzyme that adds telomeric repeats onto chromosome ends to maintain telomere length.

Workers are exposed to the risk of unemployment, and workers with few assets will trade off the lower riskiness of a job against lower wages. Different asset holdings translate into different wages, thus amplifying inequality due to assets with wage inequality. The proposed analysis of unemployment risk can solve for an equilibrium model that incorporates the distribution of assets, while at the same time allowing for heterogeneity in skills. There is no doubt that fully understanding the asset-skill tradeoff is of primary importance for labor market policy.

An original, micro-level survey data set that provides information about subjective work/life stress (and background variables) and covers the finite population of British national parliamentarians is to be collected as part of this research project. An original micro-level data set covering Swedish and German national parliamentarians already exists (collected as part of my previous research), but the variables related to the topic of work/life stress have never before been analyzed. Parts of this political elite data will further be matched to existing, large-scale databases from the European Social Survey, consisting of representative samples of general citizens of the three nations, for the purpose of reference comparisons between the political elites and average citizens of respective country.\nThe research project will be carried out by the applicant at Birkbeck, University of London (UK), Department of Politics, Centre for the Study of British Politics and Public Life, under the supervision of Professor Joni Lovenduski.", 167415.0, 167415.0, "GENDER ELITE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.bbk.ac.uk", null, "fp7_188203_999833903"], ["6BT", "Atlantic Late Bronze Age Interaction through Metal Hoards", "University College London", "The aim of this project is to examine the nature and the degree of interaction between the Late Bronze Age communities of the European Atlantic fa\u00e7ade (c. 1300-850 BC) through the study of metal hoards.

The host lab studies the regulatory networks that control alternative splicing in the brain. Recently, the lab identified thousands of cryptic splice sites that are bound by the spliceosome, but do not lead to active splicing in the adult brain. In the present project, I will assess if splicing at some of these cryptic sites is regulated during brain development or disease. Moreover, I will determine the importance of such regulation for neuronal differentiation.\nMost of the cryptic splice sites are present within long introns of genes that are only expressed in the brain. Therefore, I will employ genome-wide experimental and computational methods to study the regulation of cryptic splice sites in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and mouse brain from several developmental stages.  It is known that binding of RBPs to target pre-mRNAs can actively repress cryptic splicing, which ensures expression of stable mRNAs. FUS and TDP-43 are two RBPs that regulate alternative splicing and lead to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when mutated. They have increased binding to the long introns and their depletion leads to decreased expression of long genes. I will therefore assess changes in splicing at cryptic sites upon depletion of FUS or TDP-43 in mESCs, in ALS mouse models, and in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from ALS patients.

In-depth analysis of tumour genomes is revealing evidence for branched evolution and cancer subclonal spatial and temporal intratumour heterogeneity (ITH). Drivers of ITH such as chromosomal instability (CIN) are associated with drug resistance and poor clinical outcome. However, despite increasing knowledge of tumour diversity, there is limited insight into the mechanisms driving genomic instability and ITH or the processes that shape cancer genome evolution over time and space. Many animal tumour models fail to recapitulate patterns of genomic instability witnessed in human tumours, limiting insight into the forces that shape tumour evolution in vivo. We have found evidence for parallel subclonal evolution, resulting in the same gene or signal transduction pathway being subject to distinct inactivating or activating somatic events in different regions of the same tumour (Gerlinger NEJM 2012). These data suggest that in-depth analysis of tumour evolution may help define routes through which tumours must progress, offering opportunities for novel therapeutic approaches. We will develop new animal models of ITH, by developing knock-out strains for two suppressors of replication stress and CIN, recently identified in our laboratory (Burrell Nature 2013).

We have recently shown that neonatal hypersensitivity to touch is due to the late maturation of glycinergic inhibitory signalling and that this signalling, in turn, requires nociceptive activity in the dorsal horn at a critical postnatal period. However, the phenotype of the interneurons involved and the mechanism for their maturation remains to be determined.

Infection of a limited set of favoured tissues is a parasite strategy to evade host immunity and maintain chronicity. Recent work shows the gut is a site of chronic T. cruzi infection in CD mouse models. L. donovani persists in liver and spleen, but the gut may also be a target. In cutaneous leishmaniasis, chronic persistence occurs in the skin due to unique immune responses that evolved to tolerate constant exposure to the environment. A similar situation exists in the gut, where inflammatory responses against commensal microbe and food antigens are unwarranted and potentially dangerous. As in the skin, the hypo-responsive environment of the gut may underpin host failure to clear T. cruzi and L. donovani.

Additionally, a new protocol has been established for generating T lymphocyte precursors ex vivo that retain their ability to engraft and develop into mature and functional T cells after transplantation.\n\nIn order to improve the safety of previously used viral vectors, scientists have engineered self-inactivating (SIN) vectors that render the virus genome transcriptionally inactive once inside a cell. The vectors destined for gene therapy applications to correct adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA), Artemis and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) are being manufactured to clinical grade and will be implemented in upcoming clinical trials.

These interventions have sought to target what are widely considered to be the most common and immediate causes of maternal death.\nYet this approach fails to address many underlying morbidities that are instrumental in generating high rates of maternal mortality, such as anaemia and inadequate birth spacing.

The PATHSEEK platform will open up a new era in clinical diagnosis and patient management by delivering, in one to two days, all the results needed to provide personalized treatment.

Identifying decay products for a light Higgs particle (about 120\u00a0GeV) from the overwhelming background of already known processes is extremely challenging. In such cases, it is crucial to look at all possible decay channels.\n\nTo help with this, scientists initiated the EU-funded project 'Understanding the origin of mass with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider' (HIGGS-ZAP). Specifically, the project focused on cases in which a Higgs boson was produced in association with a Z\u00a0boson and its subsequent decay in bottom quarks (b-jets). Z\u00a0bosons have a clear decay signature, thus offering a useful way to pick Higgs-Z events from the background. The Higgs particles were expected to decay into two b-jets that contained relatively long-lived hadrons. This helps to identify decays of Higgs particles.\n\nThe innovative element of the HIGGS-ZAP approach was that the Higgs and associated Z\u00a0bosons were required to have high energy. This made Higgs-Z events stand out from the background compared to the 95\u00a0% of all other potential Higgs events.Online tracking algorithms developed in the project helped to reconstruct particle tracks in the ATLAS inner detector. Based on these, an online monitoring system was used to select b-jets and leptons and to filter out irrelevant events.\n\nProject members performed the most up-to-date measurements for single b-jets and pairs produced in the Large Hadron Collider collisions for this new energy regime. This offered significant insight into proton collisions and proof-of-concept that high-energy Higgs bosons can be observed. Scientists observed for the first time high-energy Z\u00a0bosons decaying into two b-jets that merged into a fat jet. Algorithms based on real-time data compared with those based on reconstruction of particle tracks showed tolerable deviation in identifying highly energetic particles decaying into b-jets.\n\nProject results were published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at an international conference.

My previous studies reveal that modulation of post-translational modifications of the receptor, such as phosphorylation, regulate LXRa actions in a gene-specific manner. Our preliminary studies indicate that, in addition to phosphorylation, LXRa is subject to acetylation and that treatment with trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, affects LXRa protein concentration.

The focus is on the importance of the production and consumption of textiles for the development of city-states (as clothing, elite regalia, trade and exchange items, utilitarian textiles such as sails) and the implications of this for other aspects of the economy, such as the use of farm land, labour resources and the development of urban lifestyles.

It analyses data received from 3D primary surveillance radars to determine the altitude of an aircraft. At the same time, a network of passive radar sensors allows to view targets from different perspectives.\n\nThe combination improves the accuracy with which an object's position is determined as well as the extent of the area covered, thus reducing the blind areas while increasing safety in sensitive areas. The ARGUS 3D system is expected to provide a significant upgrade to the air traffic picture in critical situations like terrorist activities. \n\nFrom tests carried out under real-life conditions in the area around Rome, researchers determined the accuracy with which the position of non-cooperative aircraft can be estimated. There is room for improvement, especially through the use of antennas able to more accurately steer the emitted beams. However, in those cases analysed by ARGUS 3D, the altitude was estimated with accuracy that reaches 300 metres. \n\nBy analysing data from ground sensors, instead of solely relying on data transmitted by aircraft, alerts can also be provided in timely manner.

However, the mechanisms that drive this process are not fully understood. A recent experimental assay has measured the insertion of designed peptide sequences into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane via the cellular translocon machinery. This has provided the first quantitative estimate of the translocon-to-membrane transfer free energy of polypeptide segments. However, no suitable experimental setup currently exists that allows the direct measurement of the free energy change involved in transferring peptides from water into lipid bilayers. This is because peptides that are hydrophobic enough to insert into membranes generally aggregate in solution. I propose an experimental peptide setup that directly measures the water to bilayer partitioning of a series of designed peptides that do not have this problem. These will be derived by minor re-engineering of pHLIP, a peptide based on helix C of bacteriorhodopsin. This peptide has a set of unique properties that make it ideal for the proposed study. It is soluble at neutral pH and spontaneously inserts into lipid bilayers when the pH is lowered. Remarkably, the peptide partitions as a monomer, without disrupting the bilayer, and has been shown not to aggregate either in solution or inside the bilayer. For theoreticians the proposed direct measurements are highly desirable, since they allow the calibration of current computer simulation models under identical conditions.

Due to the innovative use of the S-band, a small form factor antenna was required to communicate with satellites, which is a major step for the acceptance of such technology paving the way for future commercialisation. The in-vehicle platform and communication module is housed in an on-board unit known as the GreenBox.\n\nWith 20 partners from 7 European countries, from the outset SafeTRIP was designed to deliver an open ITS platform to enable third parties to develop applications that will enrich the system and address the demands of road users. The SafeTRIP platform can also host entertainment services, such as digital radio, mobile TV and video on demand, which can help make journeys less stressful by entertaining the passengers and, hence, safer.\n\nBy the time SafeTRIP concluded its activities in the spring of 2013 it had successfully trialled and demonstrated the system integrated with both new innovative and existing applications.

The primary approach of this project is to harnesses emergent DNA sequencing technologies in order to measure evolutionary change in gene expression and coding sequence in response to different sex-specific selection regimes in a clade of birds with divergent mating systems. Sex-specific selection pressures arise in large part as a consequence of mating system, however males and females share nearly identical genomes, especially in the vertebrates where the sex chromosomes house very small proportions of the overall transcriptome. This single shared genome creates sex-specific phenotypes via different gene expression levels in females and males, and these sex-biased genes connect sexual dimorphisms, and the sexually antagonistic selection pressures that shape them, with the regions of the genome that encode them.\nThe Galloanserae (fowl and waterfowl) will be used to in the proposed project, as this clade combines the necessary requirements of both variation in mating systems and a well-conserved reference genome (chicken).

The EU-backed 'European consortium on synaptic protein networks in neurological and psychiatric diseases' (http://www.eurospin.mpg.de/ (EUROSPIN)) project aimed at improving understanding of the mechanisms leading to synaptopathies.\n\nA multi-level systems biology approach was used to unravel the mechanisms linking mutations in genes coding for synaptic proteins to the occurrence of neurological and/or psychiatric disorders. Such an approach relies on a wide range of disciplines and techniques, spanning from biochemistry to behavioural studies. Through an improved understanding of disease causation, the consortium delivered novel leads for diagnostic tools and therapies of synaptopathies.\n\nScientists completed large-scale screens of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of 1 340 synaptic proteins and generated PPI networks of 7 677 interactions. Moreover, mice lines were created that expressed tandem affinity purification-tagged synaptic proteins for several applications such as protein purification and screening of substrates. An antibody production pipeline enabled protein expression and localisation studies. In combination, these are very useful tools to study synaptic protein complexes and aberrant PPI changes in disease models.\n\nEighteen validated mouse lines representing different synaptopathies (e.g. SNAP-25 knockout (KO) mice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)) were used to analyse synaptic transmission and plasticity as well as behaviour. Additionally, cell biological and electrophysiological studies were carried out on disease-relevant synaptic proteins such as SNAP25, Munc18-1 and NLGN-2.\n\nAn important finding was that antiepileptic drugs could be useful in ADHD treatment. Using behavioural analyses, neuronal circuits in fear conditioning were characterised to assess plasticity and learning in mice models. Interestingly, NLGN-2 KO mice were unable to acquire fear in response to certain stimuli due to reduced inhibitory synaptic transmission in the amygdala.\n\nStudies revealed that a subset of 1 026 synaptic genes rather than an individual gene causes schizophrenia by affecting signal transduction, synaptic excitability, cell adhesion and trans-synaptic signalling.

Also, ideally interventions should be disease-modifying rather than merely controlling seizures.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.epipgx.eu/ (EPIPGX) (Epilepsy pharmacogenomics: delivering biomarkers for clinical use) study proposes to perform genome-wide analyses to identify genome-based biomarkers for epilepsy. The aim is to predict treatment response thereby improving the use of current AEDs and also identifying new therapy targets. Partners focused on the impact of the AEDs most commonly prescribed in the EU and those that incur huge healthcare costs.\n\nDuring the initial phase of the project, scientists extracted data from over 5,000 clinical cases and genotyped nearly 8,000 samples. Genome-wide association studies for broad drug resistance and AED adverse reactions is also ongoing. Exome sequencing will also offer information on rare genetic variation that may influence AED treatment.\n\nCollective analysis of these datasets should provide pharmacogenomic guidance to avoid serious adverse effects and help clinicians select the best-tolerated AEDs. Special emphasis will also be given on identifying biomarkers of teratogenesis that are associated with the use of the drug valproate in pregnancy.\n\nFurthermore, the consortium is interested in developing an in silico method to predict the best treatments and outcomes for individual patients. This platform is anticipated to attract great interest from the industry.\n\nOverall, the identification of biomarkers that can predict the pattern of response to AEDs will be of high clinical importance for people with newly-diagnosed and chronic epilepsy.

Disordered body representations are central to several serious psychiatric and neurological disorders. Thus, identifying factors which contribute to the formation and maintenance of body representations is crucial for understanding how body representation goes awry in disease, and how it might be corrected by potential novel therapeutic interventions. Several types of sensory signals provide information about the body, making the body the multisensory object, par excellence. Little is known, however, about how information from somatosensation and from vision is integrated to construct the rich body representations we all experience. This project fills this gap in current understanding by determining how the brain builds body representations (BODYBUILDING). A hierarchical model of body representation is proposed, providing a novel theoretical framework for understanding the diversity of body representations and how they interact. The key motivating hypothesis is that body representation is determined by the dialectic between two major cognitive processes. First, from the bottom-up, somatosensation represents the body surface as a mosaic of discrete receptive fields, which become progressively agglomerated into larger and larger units of organisation, a process I call fusion. Second, from the top-down, vision starts out depicting the body as an undifferentiated whole, which is progressively broken into smaller parts, a process I call segmentation. Thus, body representation operates from the bottom-up as a process of fusion of primitive elements into larger complexes, as well as from the top-down as a process of segmentation of an initially undifferentiated whole into more basic parts.

The successful observed outcome confirms the unique opportunity to scale-up an effective therapeutic approach into a widely accessible clinical technology, which could enhance not only the quality of life but even cure otherwise untreatable patients. However, a limitation of our current technology is the time it takes to re-populate the decellularized trachea. This may prove critical in the case of cancer patients. Further, the size of the transplant is currently limited due to the fact that the transplanted tissue needs to be efficiently and rapidly vascularised to prevent necrosis in vivo. To surmount these limitations, we aim to: i) improve our current technique of in vivo tissue engineering human tracheae in a small number of patients and subsequently begin a formal clinical trial, ii) develop pharmacological approaches to activate endogenous stem cells, stimulate tissue regeneration and vascularisation in situ, iii) develop a synthetic tracheal scaffold using a novel nanocomposite polymer as alternatives to natural human scaffolds and iv) develop good medical practice manufacturing process for safe, efficient and cost effective commercial production.

The extraordinary conservation of the bouquet has suggested that it plays an important role in promoting successful meiosis. My recent work revealed that bouquet formation plays crucial role in regulating the meiotic MTOC and spindle. This discovery raises a number of questions that bear on the relationship between chromosomes and the spindle apparatus.\nI propose that the chromosomal bouquet is a novel sensor system to monitor progression of meiotic prophase including meiotic recombination, which are required for meiosis I. Completion of these chromosomal events may be signalled from chromosomes to the MTOC to finish bouquet formation.  Such chromosome dynamics may be involved in proper formation of the spindle at the later phase, meiosis. I will therefore elucidate how the end of the bouquet is regulated and how such a event affects function of the MOTC using fission yeast as a model organism. Chromosomal components, structure and dynamics in fission yeast are highly conserved among higher eukaryotes.  In particular, telomere functions are often reproduced in higher organisms.

My group is world-leading in developing a method called Coherent X-ray Diffraction (CXD).  Our CXD strain images of a Pb nanocrystal were published in Nature in 2006.  CXD is sensitive to strain because the X-ray diffraction pattern surrounding a Bragg peak can be decomposed into symmetric and antisymmetric parts.  To a good approximation, the symmetric part can be considered to come from the real part of the electron density, while the antisymmetric part is a projection of the strain field.  The phasing of the data is a critical step that uses a computer algorithm, developed by us, which acts like the lens of a 3D X-ray microscope.

Given the movable nature of some body parts, for tactile information to be used in orienting behavior, the representation of its location must be remapped to reflect the position of the limb in external space, in a process named tactile remapping.\nDespite the key motor component implicit in this framework, to date, tactile remapping has been studied exclusively in the context of perceptual systems.

The EU-funded project 'Moving archaeological knowledge away from neo-colonialism' (MAKAN) investigated the issue in Egypt and Sudan.\n\nSuch disparity is of a complex nature. It spans from viewing local workmen as unskilled labourers needing constant supervision by non-locals in charge. Beyond that there is a lack of local interest in the past that is greatly overlooked. Funding of western projects in Middle Eastern countries far exceeds what the countries can afford for their own projects, leading to a kind of economic neo-colonialism within archaeology. Finally, the reports providing studies and site data are rarely published in the host country's language.\n\nDespite all the studies conducted on intercultural interactions on Middle East excavations and their impact on the lives and opinions of local inhabitants, topics relating to the politics of archaeology are rarely found in prominent journals. This is particularly true for Egyptology. Furthermore, objects from local territory may be housed far off in western countries and even local museums may not be accessible by locals.\n\nMAKAN examined the formative phase of Egyptian archaeology. Direct access to various archives helped create a self-critical history of the discipline. This led to a better understanding of the dynamics of knowledge production.\n\nUltimately, the aim was to create a productive means for raising awareness of the importance for local communities to reconnect with their past.

Its main research question is: how can the special status of religion in secular politics and law be explained and justified?\nIn western politics and law, religion has a special status. On the one hand, there is supposed to be a unique separation between the state and religion; and, on the other hand, the state gives special protection to religious beliefs and organizations qua religious.  The religious neutrality of the state and respect for freedom of religion are the two salient features of the relationship between religion, law and politics.\nWhat is rarely noted is that these features rely on a distinctive understanding of religion, born out of the particular trajectory of western secularisation. One upshot of long-standing, protracted struggles between religious and political authorities is that, in western society at least, religion is seen as importantly and relevantly distinct from other spheres of human and social life. So, instead of presenting the problem in a simplistically dichotomous fashion (\u2018secular\u2019 versus \u2018religious\u2019 or \u2018post-secular\u2019), RAPT sees religion itself as the contested term in the debate between secularism and its critics.\nThe central hypothesis of RAPT is that the \u2018specialness\u2019 of religion is defensible in light of important political and legal ideals, but that it needs to be substantially modified and refined in response to philosophical, anthropological, historical, political and sociological post-secular critiques.\nTo demonstrate this, RAPT is divided into three complementary projects: A Typology of the Political-Legal Construction of Religion; An Analytical Assessment of the Post-Secular Critique and A Normative Reformulation of Secularity and Religion.", 961680.0, 961680.0, "RAPT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ucl.ac.uk", null, "fp7_100659_999975620"], ["6BT", "Virtual GastrOintestinal tRact", "University College London", "Inflammatory Bowel diseases (IBDs) constitute on of the largest healthcare problems in the Western World, affecting over 1 million European citizens alone, 700,000 of whom suffer from Crohn's disease.Grading of Crohn's disease severity is important to determine treatment strategy and to quantify the response to treatment.

Understanding the exact mechanisms of discount pricing policy will help maintain healthy competition.", "Prices of goods and services in different industries can be fixed or can vary according to different criteria, such as demand, competition, discounts, profitability, etc. The concept of variable price changes is called nonlinear pricing, and is sometimes misunderstood by stakeholders or competitors. A concrete example would be frequent-flyer programmes in the airline industry which offer different prices to different people.\n\nYet there is a whole science and logic behind price changes and discounts, such as how to keep a product profitable or how to get rid of slow stock. Disentangling the reasons behind loyalty discount schemes is essential for competition and to separate anticompetitive actions from harmless or low-impact price changes.\n\nStudying nonlinear pricing is the objective of the EU-funded project 'Nonlinear Pricing in Vertically Related Industries' (Nonlin). It aims to produce results that will help in policy-making and formulating competition laws. Generally, nonlinear discount schemes in retail markets have received much attention and are clearer than those used in relationships between manufacturers and retailers. In these sectors, nonlinear pricing typically involves discounts where higher volume purchases lead to lower prices. Some of these discounts make buyers purchase more from the firm employing the discount and less from its rivals. But these practices and discounts often come under fire by antitrust laws (laws that maintain or promote market competition by regulating anti-competitive conduct). It is usually big businesses that are involved, and antitrust laws are normally concerned when these practices threaten the economic well-being of another large competitor.\n\nSometimes pricing policies which allow severe discounts by manufacturers pose a challenge to economic theory. This happens because it is difficult to explain why a firm would charge less for a larger order if its intentions were benign, and raises the eyebrows of antitrust law enforcers.\n\nBut economic research shows that associating dominant firms' use of such discounts with foreclosure might be inappropriate. Moreover, firms commonly employ such discounts where no foreclosure concern exists. These observations and other recent developments in European and US laws underline the importance of loyalty discounts.\n\nIn light of this, the project is studying the role of loyalty discounts in firms' commercial behaviour and identifying circumstances where loyalty discounts can generate efficiencies. It is now clear that there is not one answer on nonlinear pricing. It can be healthy in some cases and unhealthy in others.

Unlike in other tissues, a complex flow of information between neurons, astrocytes, pericytes and arteriolar smooth muscle regulates blood flow. Elucidation of the mechanisms coupling brain energy supply to energy use is essential for understanding how brain imaging data relate to neural function and for using these data to identify mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, Alzheimer\u2019s disease or schizophrenia, in which alterations in neurometabolic function are detected.

It is the optimal solution to maximise information transmitted per metabolic cost. This provides an explanation for the previously poorly understood fact that synapses are unreliable, often releasing neurotransmitters in only 25 % of the times that a presynaptic action potential arrives.\n\nSimilarly, experiments in rat lateral geniculate nucleus relay cells showed that the amplitude of postsynaptic currents is set to maximise the ratio of information transmitted in relation to postsynaptic energy consumption. These results suggest the existence of homeostatic mechanisms that regulate both energy consumption and information transfer at synapses.\n\nThe project\u2019s results extend our understanding of brain energy use by examining adenosine triphosphate (ATP) consumption in non-signalling tasks in the brain which could consume up to 50 % of the brain's ATP.

The transcriptional programmes that control the generation of the denervated repair cells are therefore an important issue in nerve biology.\n\nThe host laboratory has recently defined the concept of negative regulation of myelination, implicated two transcriptional regulators, c-Jun and Notch, in the control of dedifferentiation and the formation of the denervated cell, and shown that Schwann cell c-Jun has an essential role in controlling nerve regeneration.\n\nIn peripheral nerves, the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) is rapidly activated at the injury site following nerve transection, but the function of this factor in nerve injury has not been investigated. Perhaps the best known function of STAT3 is the positive regulation of cellular survival, a function that in many cell types is mediated by its ability to up-regulate the gene expression of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, anti-apoptotic factors. Mechanisms that ensure the sufficient Schwann cell survival in injured nerves are critical for nerve repair.\n\nThus, the present project will explore additional control systems in injured nerves and in particular whether STAT3 signalling in Schwann cells is an important mediator of the adaptive injury response of these cells in damaged nerves.

Due to the slow rate at which neurons regenerate (1\u20133\u00a0mm/day), the regenerating axons remain without target connections for months or years. Under these conditions, the Schwann cells in the distal nerve stump usually remain chronically denervated, losing their capacity to generate repair cells.\n\nThe STAT3-SCHWANN CELLS study showed that transcription factor STAT3 is expressed in Schwann cells and activated after nerve injury. STAT3 phosphorylation was induced in the distal stumps after transection of sciatic nerves.\n\nResearchers discovered that activation of STAT3 led to better survival of long-term denervated Schwann cells. However, they also found that STAT3 was not required for the formation of cellular substrates for regenerating axons and did not control the process of nerve repair.\n\nIn conclusion, project data revealed that STAT3 is not required for nerve repair, but is essential for the survival of long-term denervated Schwann cells.

Deep melt may exist in the Earth today, and the magma ocean may have left signatures of its presence.  However, these signals are still uninterpretable because of a lack of basic knowledge of the behavior of fluid silicates at extreme conditions: very little is known of the physics and chemistry of fluid silicates beyond the conditions of ongoing shallow magma genesis (<3 GPa).

This potential includes the ability of ENM to induce damage at the cellular, tissue, or organism levels by interacting with cellular structures leading to impairment of key cellular functions. These adverse effects may be mediated by ENM-induced alterations in gene expression and translation, but may involve also epigenetic transformation of genetic functions. We believe that it will be possible to create a set of biomarkers of ENM toxicity that are relevant in assessing and predicting the safety and toxicity of ENM across species. The ENM-organism interaction is complex and depends, not simply on the composition of ENM core, but particularly on its physico-chemical properties. In fact, important physico-chemical properties are largely governed by their surface properties. All of these factors determine the binding of different biomolecules on the surface of the ENM, the formation of a corona around the ENM core. Thus, any positive or negative biological effect of ENM in organisms may be dynamically modulated by the bio-molecule corona associated with or substituted into the ENM surface rather than the ENM on its own. The bio-molecule corona of seemingly identical ENM cores may undergo dynamic changes during their passage through different biological compartments; in other words, their biological effects are governed by this complex surface chemistry. We propose that understanding the fundamental characteristics of ENM underpinning their biological effects will provide a sound foundation with which to classify ENM according to their safety.

Their widespread misuse has put a strong selective pressure on microorganisms, leading to the emergence of bacterial strains resistant to a variety of antibiotics.To limit the development and spread of such resistant strains, the mechanisms involved in antibiotic action and the emergence of resistance need to be elucidated. \n\nScientists from the EU-funded http://www.ucl.ac.uk/antiresdev (ANTIRESDEV) project therefore studied the effects of administering a range of antibiotics (amoxicillin, minocycline, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin) to healthy volunteers.  They examined the impact of the antibiotics on the emergence of resistance in their indigenousmicrobiotas. The rationale was that the distinct chemical nature, pharmacokinetics and antimicrobial spectrum of each antibiotic is likely to cause different patterns of resistance emergence and persistence.\n\nFour cohorts of healthy individuals were recruited. After being administered a specific antibiotic, they were screened for the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial species at various body sites using culture-dependent and molecular  techniques. Samples were collected before treatment and at certain time points (upto one year) after treatment. \n\nSoon after antibiotic administration there was a transient increase in the proportions of antibiotic-resistant bacteria for all tested antibiotics, with the exception of amoxicillin. In the case of ciprofloxacin and clindamycin, increased proportions of some resistant species were observed up to one year after antibiotic administration..  None of the four antibiotics appeared to create selection pressure for the emergence of several pathogens of major clinical importance including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species.\n\nCulture-independent analysis revealed that administration of minocycline, clindamycin and ciprofloxacin, but not amoxicillin, had a profound effect on the oral and intestinal microbiotas.  However, after one month, the oral microbiota was similar to that which existed prior to antibiotic administration. One month after the administration of amoxicillin or minocycline, the intestinal microbiota was similar to that found prior to antibiotic administration. In contrast, a return to pre-administration values took 4 months in the case of ciprofloxacin and between 4 months and one year for clindamycin.\n\nTaken together, the ANTIRESDEV study demonstrated the new potential of some antibiotics to induce the emergence of resistant strains in healthy individuals. It also revealed their potential to disrupt the protective indigenous microbiotas at various body sites. This information could help clinicians to select the appropriate antibiotic to minimise both the emergence of antibiotic resistance and the disruption of the human microbiota.", null, "http://www.ucl.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140725438.jpg", "fp7_92468_999975620"], ["6BT", "Metastatic tumours facilitated by hypoxic tumour micro-environments", "University College London", "Recent research suggests that the hypoxic micro-environment of tumours is one of the major drivers of metastatic spread of cancer.

Healthcare DBs on 27 million persons in 5 countries will be used to calculate rates and relative risks of arrhythmic events during drug use. Predictions on arrhythmic potential will be compared with actual postmarketing risk to assess the predictive value of preclinical markers.

Literature reviews, databases with pharmacokinetic parameters, and databases with a cardiac safety profile were used to study the drugs.\n\nIn addition, researchers examined the relationship between these drugs and ventricular arrhythmia (VA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD).

ARITMO provided new information for 16 antihistamines and 20 antipsychotics and confirmed that anti-infective agents were generally in the low-risk category.\n\nThese and similar results have numerous implications. They can be used to help regulators make decisions about the risk associated with these drugs. They also can be used to prioritise drugs that should be evaluated.

BACKGROUND: Cilia are microtubule-based, centriole-derived projections from the cell surface. They transduce extracellular signals and regulate key processes in which signals of the extracellular environment are translated into a cellular response, such as cell cycle control, Wnt signalling, Shh signalling and planar cell polarity. Disruption of cilium-based processes by mutations can cause very severe disorders. Many of these ciliopathies have overlapping phenotypes. There is evidence, that ciliary proteins are organized in cell/context specific complexes and/or in shared regulatory circuits in cilia of affected tissues. Yet, knowledge of the composition, wiring, dynamics and associated signaling pathways of the corresponding molecular building blocks and associated protein networks remains very limited. APPROACH: We propose here that ciliopathies can be considered systemically as specific perturbations in a versatile dynamically regulated multifunctional molecular machine. Mainly based on the comprehensive description of the ciliary interactome, quantitative functional assays as well as human genetic data derived from ciliopathy patients, we will generate a comprehensive stream of content-rich quantitative data towards systemic analysis of ciliar function. These data will be used to generate and validate discrete models that describe functional modules and regulatory circuits in the ciliome as well as predicting biological context specific features of cilia as well as perturbations leading to ciliopathies.

Motile cilia propel fluid, for example to remove mucus and dirt by lung epithelial cells. Alternatively, immotile or primary cilia serve as antennas for receiving and transducing signals, for example by the sensory cilia of retinal photoreceptors.\n\nDysfunction of cilia gives rise to a group of hereditary disorders with overlapping clinical symptoms, known as ciliopathies. As a result, it is vital to understand how they contribute to human disease in order to develop novel therapies.  \n\nThe key objective of the EU-funded 'A systems biology approach to dissect cilia function and its disruption in human genetic disease' (http://syscilia.org (SYSCILIA)) project is to investigate the function of ciliary proteins in health and disease. For this purpose, they used a systems biology approach and set out to develop models capable of predicting the outcome of ciliary protein perturbations.\n\nAs a first step, partners analysed the ciliary proteome, which consists of over 1\u00a0000 proteins, found key motifs and stored the data on a central resource system. A network containing nearly 30\u00a0000 protein interactions was identified alongside 303 ciliary genes. A genome-wide RNA interference screen led to the discovery of target molecules that are responsible for the observed ciliopathy-associated perturbations.\n\nA substantial part of the project work was devoted to analyzing genetic models of ciliopathies.

Their comments raise an interesting question of how humans perceive time prior to action, in other words, how motor preparatory activity effects on visual processing to change the subjective flow of time.\nEvery daily event is associated with time, and we intuitively feel that we live on a constant and continuous time line. However, studies have revealed that physical temporal events and the perception of these events are not always matched. This counterintuitive nature of temporal perception has fascinated philosophers and scientists for centuries. Since humans are moving animals, perception of time must also be studied in an active situation. However, most studies relating temporal perception have, thus far, focused on static sensory processing and few studies have addressed how action can modulate an actor\u2019s perception of time.\nThe aim of this proposal is to understand the modulation of human temporal perception in an active context; focusing on the period when the brain is preparing for action. A series of behavioural and electrophysiological studies will be conducted to reveal the neuronal mechanism involved in this process. State-of-art machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze brain activity, and also a recently developed brain stimulation technique will be used to modulate brain activity, in order to elucidate the causal relationship between brain activity and temporal perception.\nThe proposed research is expected to advance research in neurocognition of action, a distinctively European research field, by incorporating state-of-art research techniques.

According to recent research by EU-funded scientists, it turns out that our brains in fact slow down or dilate time while preparing to act. The project 'Perception of time during action preparation' (ACTION AND TIME) demonstrated that visual sensory perception is modulated by preparation for a movement related to that input.\n\nSubjects were shown a visual stimulus, a white disk, on a computer monitor. They were asked to judge its duration as either short or long. Control subjects were not asked to do anything. In the experimental condition, the subjects were instructed to reach out toward a second disk that appeared on the monitor right after the white disk disappeared.\n\nResults showed that the visual stimulus was perceived to have a longer duration only when an action was prepared. In addition, the amount of time dilation was related to the degree of motor preparation, manipulated by the uncertainty that an action would be required. Interestingly, preparation for action not only dilated time perception but also slowed down the perceived frequency of a flickering stimulus. Experiments also showed that this slowing down was linked to an increased capacity for visual information processing.\n\nAs the first scientific study to support reports by baseball players that the ball seems to slow before they swing the bat to hit it, it received widespread media attention. The findings were broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC news), Le Figaro, the Austrian Broadcasting Company and CBS News in the United States.\n\nIn addition to its inherent value in deeper understanding of nervous system function, the project's outcomes are relevant to many fields in which action to a stimulus is required.

However, the current evidence base regarding the impact of this policy is not well developed, in part because of evaluation designs that are not able to capture all the necessary information for policy-makers to make informed decisions.

To aid communication and dissemination, they also supported the establishment of a virtual \u2018community of practice\u2019, which continues to share knowledge on financial access to health services in Africa.\n\nSpecifically, research centred on national policies designed to improve access to obstetric care in Burkina Faso, Benin, Mali and Morocco. Partners sought to understand the origins, financing, implementation and effects of these policies that introduced subsidies or fee exemptions for deliveries and caesareans.\n\nEmploying mixed methods research in four to six study sites within each country, FEMHEALTH conducted interviews, analysed data and used a realist evaluation approach to understand the determinants of differences in policy implementation, as well as examining effects on the wider health system and any unanticipated consequences.\n\nThe project found a narrowing of inequalities for the countries with survey data (Mali did not have recent data) and a substantial reduction in household payments for targeted services.

Solving the dark energy problem is the most pressing question in cosmology today. It is possible that dark energy does not exist at all, and instead Einstein s theory of General Relativity is flawed. Cosmologists hope to measure the properties of the dark energy using the next generation of cosmological observations, in which I am playing a leading role. I believe the most promising technique to crack the dark energy problem is gravitational shear, in which images of distant galaxies are distorted as they pass through the intervening dark matter distribution. Analysis of the distortions allows a map of the dark matter to be reconstructed; by examining the dark matter distribution we uncover the nature of the apparent dark energy. However to capitalize on the great potential of gravitational shear we must measure incredibly small image distortions in the presence of much larger image modifications that occur in the measurement process.

The aim is to test the hypothesis that intergenerational influences are important determinants of fertility, from fertility intentions to timing of births to number of children. The theoretical rationale derives from a hypothesis emerging from evolutionary biology that humans are  cooperative breeders : mothers need help from others to raise children, because human children are too costly for mothers to raise alone. The support of relatives, particularly intergenerational support, is thus vital to women in determining how many children they have. If so, there is a major gap in our understanding of fertility, since such influences have not been systematically studied.

This proposal builds upon previous EU funded pre-clinical projects and comprises a multidisciplinary and translational research group with wide-ranging relevant expertise. Building on encouraging clinical results targeting NY-ESO-1 in melanoma and the availability of clinical grade vector, the consortium proposes to rapidly initiate two landmark studies in this field: the first to examine the activity of engineered T cells in oesophago-gastric cancer as an example of a hard to treat common epithelial cancer;  the second to undertake a randomised phase II study to determine whether an optimised cell production system developed by the partners improves the current clinical response rates in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with NY-ESO-1 targeted T-cells. Success in these trials will enable the consortia and others to carryout larger trials and potentially approval of this type of therapy as a treatment for multiple cancer types. The inclusion of a major industrial partner focused on cell therapy technology and two SMEs focus on the delivery of cell therapy will facilitate future development of this area following these trials; indeed the project also includes plans to further automate and streamline cell processing to facilitate this development.

This will be achieved by: \u2022 Expression profiling of genes on single dopaminergic neurons via laser microdissection and transgenic lines in Mouse, Ciona and Zebrafish \u2022 HT-Sequencing of microCAGE assays on dopaminergic neurons, providing TSS usage and transcript discovery \u2022 Microscopy HTS of cis-regulatory elements \u2022 siRNA and morpholino network perturbation experiments \u2022 Innovative systems biology approaches to decipher and define molecular networks Data generated by microCAGE and microarray will define a set of key genes in dopaminergic neurons, in which cis-regulatory elements will be predicted and screened utilizing HTS in zebrafish. The data will aid network reconstruction, which will be validated by perturbation experiments. This project relies also on the availability of data produced through the many existing collaborations among consortium partners such as FP6 funded TRANSCODE project as well as the international Fantom3 consortium. Potential impact: The prevalence of PD in Europe today is ~2 million people. Within the next 50 years, the number is expected to rise to 5 million. Thus, the burden placed by dementia on the working-age population will rise dramatically. No treatments are known to slow the progression of the disease.

Within the next 50\u00a0years, the number is expected to rise to 5\u00a0million. No pharmacological treatment is currently available to slow or arrest neurodegeneration.\n\nPD is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) with motor symptoms caused by degeneration of A9 DNs in the mesencephalon (also called midbrain). The EU-funded http://www.dopaminet.eu ('Molecular networks of dopaminergic neurons in chordates') (DOPAMINET) aimed to find cis-regulatory elements and transcriptional networks that participate in the coding of DN identity.\n\nThe DOPAMINET consortium used an interdisciplinary approach to decipher complex networks consisting of protein-coding genes, non-protein\u2013coding genes and cis-regulatory elements within DNs in the brain. This approach was applied across four chordate organisms (human, mouse, zebrafish and ciona intestinalis) to identify core network modules that might play key roles in the biology of these neurons.\n\nThe entire repertory of channels and receptors of DNs was established. The olfactory receptors are selectively expressed in these cells, suggesting that specific types of odourant-like molecules may act as psychoactive drugs on DNs. The discovery of new isoforms of alpha-synuclein might lead to the development of new drugs to induce or inhibit the synthesis of the c-terminal part of the protein. The repertory of transcription factors (TFs) that are differentially expressed between different types of DNs was established.?Most importantly, the identification of new gene networks involved in dopaminergic cells' differentiation and maintenance has allowed the creation of cocktails of TFs. These can be used to trigger cell conversion from a dermal fibroblast to a dopamine-releasing neuronal cell. This will have a profound effect in future strategies for restorative therapy of PD.\n\nScientific results were disseminated through presentations at workshops and meetings. Researchers of the consortium published data in 26 papers in high-level journals.\n\nTherefore, the discoveries in DOPAMINET led to a better understanding of the disease.

The language, symbols, rituals and meanings adhering to these emotions reveal that they influenced history and have their own history.

Russian central and regional archives were examined for original, non-published sources such as letters from citizens to state and party leaders.\n\nThe findings have been published in two leading peer-reviewed journals relative to the field of Russian/Soviet studies. The first is titled 'The regime of forced trust: Making and breaking of emotional bonds between people and state in Soviet Russia', and the second 'Symbols of power in rituals of violence: The personality cult and iconoclasm on the Soviet Empire's periphery'.\n\nAnother research outcome is the monograph ''The best friend of the German people': The Stalin cult in East Germany, 1945-1961'. This is due for publication in 2014 by the Moscow-based publisher ROSSPEN in its long-standing series titled 'History of Stalinism'. FORCEDTRUST also completed two chapters for a forthcoming book on the history of trust and distrust with Soviet Russia as a case study. \n\nProject activities included the organisation of an interdisciplinary panel, 'At the boundary of trust and distrust: The shifting of normality and deviance in Soviet Russia'. This took place at the ASSEES Annual Convention in New Orleans in November 2012. A peer-reviewed international conference, 'Trust and distrust in the Eastern Bloc and the Soviet Union, 1956-1991', was also organised and hosted at University College London in July 2013.\n\nFORCEDTRUST succeeded in boosting networking opportunities and establishing a solid foundation for future research collaborations and ongoing knowledge transfer.

Measuring microbial activity using isotopic signatures is a well-established idea used for AMD production, however, is typically only applicable to the metabolism of specific microbes. In contrast, fractionation in phosphate that is required by all forms of life, has been shown to be a viable tracer for biological activity in near neutral environments by Prof. Blake at Yale University. At acidic conditions different speciations of phosphate play an important role in O fractionation but the signatures associated with minerals such as Fe-oxides and microbial metabolism is unknown. Thus, the proposed project will use a synergy of experimental, analytical and computational techniques to test whether the isotopic fractionation of oxygen in phosphate can be used as an isotopic tracer in acidic systems. To do this fractionation associated with relevant microbes and Fe-minerals will be examined using experiments, analysed by state of the art Thermo-Chemical Elemental Analysis and compared to natural AMD samples in the outgoing phase at Yale University. To predict whether these signatures can be retained within the Fe-minerals computational simulations, conducted at the return host University College London with Prof. de Leeuw, will be used to examine phosphate adsorption to different Fe-minerals and the competition of other molecules for adsorption sites.

It is not clear whether tasks of high perceptual load allow people to ignore distarctor information which has high motivational salience. Information that has been associated through learning and resulted in highly predictive outcome (called motivationally salience), should gain more attention than those less predictive, regardless of valence.

The associated neural correlates for selective visual attention were also identified.\n\nTo provide motivational salience, six neutral faces were associated with high or low gain and loss as well as indifferent outcome during a value learning task. These faces were then used as distractors in letter-search experiments with varying perceptual loads. Results revealed that 'high' predictable faces affected performance during letter-search tasks unlike 'low' and neutral faces.

Negative stimuli, be it emotions or pictures, had lower impact in terms of distraction during high-load tasks unlike positive or neutral stimuli. These results are consistent with the first set of experiments in terms of information processing during positive distractors.\n\nThe third set of experiments tested the combined impact of both motivational salience and emotional stimuli during visual information processing.

The main objective was to promote therapeutic strategies for the treatment of leukodystrophies.\n\nThe consortium generated a European database with the clinical data, mutations and biological samples of more than 500 patients. They validated biomarkers found in patients' biological fluids such as the peptide neurotransmitters N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) for leukodystrophies with inborn error of myelin formation.\n\nAdditionally, they investigated the role of oxidative stress in axonal degeneration to screen for new biomarkers. Patient fibroblasts exhibited an impaired mitochondrial metabolism. Without anti-oxidant compounds, this would result in oxidative damage. This finding alongside other results clearly indicated that oxidative stress constitutes a major causative disease-driving factor in leukodystrophies.\n\nA compound screen led to the identification of anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, or neuroprotective compounds for ameliorating disease symptoms. This was exemplified by a cholesterol derivative which induced a delay in the appearance of some behavioural symptoms in young mice.\n\nEnzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has limited efficacy in treating leukodystrophies due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB limits the delivery of arylsulfatase A (ARSA) from the blood to the brain parenchyma. To overcome this problem, the consortium explored the use of implantable minipumps to deliver ARSA directly to the brain.\n\nResearchers explored further therapeutic avenues in the form of innovative cell and gene therapy approaches. Clinical trials were initiated using haematopoietic stem cells transduced with viral vectors for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and presymptomatic metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). Results showed that expression of the mutated protein in nearly 10% of their circulating haematopoietic cells was restored. Moreover, this approach successfully arrested the progression of cerebral demyelinating lesions.\n\nIn symptomatic forms of MLD, gene therapy with direct brain injection of the viral vector has been successfully tested in animal models.

However, the neural mechanisms regulating sleep/wake behavior and its associated circuits in the brain are largely unknown.  Recent studies have illustrated the role of hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) in sleep regulation, but the mechanisms that control the Hcrt system and subsequent changes in neural circuit function are still poorly described. I will take advantage of the larval zebrafish, a genetically and optically accessible model organism whose brain shares basic sleep-related structures with the human brain, in order to systematically investigate how and to what extent serotonergic (5-hydroxytrypamine, 5-HT) neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus exert effects on sleep cycles via the Hcrt system and associated downstream circuitry.  Furthermore, I will disambiguate whether 5-HT neurons affect sleep by direct influence on Hcrt neuron activity or by signalling downsteam on Hcrt target neurons.  These analyses require a multidisciplinary approach possible only in zebrafish. First, I will use a novel bioluminescence-based method to investigate how drugs that target the 5-HT system, alter the activity of Hcrt and 5-HT neurons in freely behaving fish. Second, in order to verify a causal relationship between activity in 5-HT and Hcrt neurons and observed behavioral changes, I will activate the same neural populations with optogenetic methods while monitoring behavior in freely behaving fish. Third, I will use the same pharmacological and optogenetic approaches to visualize the direct effects of specific subpopulations of 5-HT and Hcrt neurons on activity throughout the whole brain with functional two-photon calcium imaging.

However, a poor knowledge of the physics of hypersonic entry is the limiting factor. Uncertainties increase with the entry speed, in particular as radiation becomes a considerable contribution to the overall heat load.

From the formal point of view, the key element that has been missing and therefore preventing the integration of the human element into ship design projects is a comprehensive quantification of crew performance failure. Given the natural uncertainty of the maritime environment, such quantification must be probabilistic and therefore commensurate with safety-driven ship design methods such as the Risk-Based Design.\n\nIn project FAROS, the rationalised nature of the Risk-Based Design will be used to integrate the human element into the ship safety framework and deliver ship concepts (ro-pax and tanker) that are safe, economic and \u201cgreen\u201d.

How- ever, the location stack on smartphones today largely relies on GPS, which does not work indoors. Today, phones scan for nearby WiFi access points (APs) and use the measured received signal strengths (RSS) to derive coarse indoor location. Owing to random fluctuations in received signal strength, this approach has an inherently-limited accuracy (5\u201310 metres) and can sometimes result in gross errors of up to 20 metres, resulting in a poor and unpredictable user experience.\nFrom conversations with potential users including museums, convention centres, and retailers, we have learned that a 5\u201310 metre accuracy does not suffice for the applications people want. For example, museums want to provide visitors with a mobile application that can show content specific to the current room, and nearest exhibit. Major retailers and brands are interested in providing location-based content and targeted offers to users shopping in stores, with a reliable location fix at the aisle level or better. The ability to provide a location fix with less than a metre accuracy will enable these applications, and also open up potentially exciting new applications such as augmented reality.\nThere exist approaches that use ultrasound, RF, or Bluetooth hardware to localise to within less than a metre. However these typically do not work across smartphone platforms, and require the widespread deployment of specialised infrastructure that must be powered and networked to a backhaul. This creates a huge barrier to commercial success because it increases acquisition cost. Additionally, each sale requires going through a lengthy process of clearance from IT and facilities departments in the organisation buying the solution.\nWe note an exciting opportunity to take the following fresh approach to indoor location that provides high accuracy and can work with the existing wireless AP infrastructure in the building. Most indoor spaces today already have such infrastructure, or plan to deploy it to provide visitor Internet access, and WiFi is available across smartphone platforms without exception. We also note the increasing prevalence of multi-antenna APs, mainly to bolster capacity and coverage with multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) techniques.\nWe propose SmartTap, an indoor location system that uses MIMO-based angle-of-arrival (AoA) techniques at the AP to track wireless clients in real time as they roam about a building. When a client transmits a single frame over the air, each SmartTap AP receives the packet and performs an AoA analysis on the incoming signal. A backend server then fuses the AoA information from each AP together in order to get a physical location fix on the client. As clients roam around the building, the backend server updates the location of each. AoA is superior to the RSS based methods in use today because it is more accurate, more responsive, and requires fewer APs, making it more robust in buildings with sparse WiFi coverage such as retail stores.\nThe expected outcome of the SmartTap project is a demonstration of the system localising clients in real time that can be shown to potential customers. We will develop a hardware module (the SmartTap) using off- the shelf components to tap into the baseband processor of already-deployed APs, with the goal of one-metre indoor localisation accuracy.

Tumours are characterised by new vasculature that provide the nutrients and oxygen required by rapidly growing cancer cells. Targeting the tumour vasculature could halt cancer growth.

For this purpose, partners had to identify molecules that are selectively expressed in the newly formed vessels within tumours.\n\nChemical proteomics methodology was developed by team members to modify proteins in cancer animal models with a reactive biotin moiety for use as markers. This was followed by selective isolation of modified proteins by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry analysis. An atlas of vascular proteins expressed specifically in various tumour types (colon, pancreas, breast cancer, glioblastoma) or in metastatic lesions of the liver and bone marrow was developed.\n\nThese tumour-specific antigens were subsequently used to identify monoclonal antibodies from phage libraries with strong and specific reactivity. Antibodies against the colorectal cancer marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) showed highly specific uptake in all tumour metastases.\n\nProject members planned to load antibodies with cytotoxic drugs or radionuclides for imaging or treating the tumours. Their pre-clinical efficacy would be tested in rodent models of cancer. For this purpose, over 50 new derivatives of highly potent cytotoxic compounds were synthesised.

At present, PDT with Foscan\u00ae can be very effective but is not selective because Foscan\u00ae accumulates in the tumour tissue as well as in healthy ones. A great improvement of the therapy can only come from the availability of a carrier able to seek cancer cells and deliver Foscan\u00ae selectively to them. Three types of nanosystems, namely, liposomes, silica nanoparticles or poly(lactide-co-glycolide) copolymer nanoparticles, have been selected as potential nanocarriers for the selective delivery of Foscan\u00ae. The selection was mainly based on the different chemical nature of these systems, which can affect biocompatibility. During the first part of the project each type of nanosystem will be optimised through in vitro and in vivo tests and leader nanocarriers will be selected and conjugated to cancer cells specific ligands for increasing the selective delivery of Foscan\u00ae.

In vitro and in vivo investigations will be carried to demonstrate the validity of our approach and deliver, at project conclusion, a final product which can then be tested clinically.

The project team studied three potential nanosystems for entrapping the drug, all of which proved successful.\n\nHowever, a challenge for the Nanophoto team was that the nanoparticles carrying the drug still had to evade the body's formidable defence mechanisms. So, the researchers coated the nanocarriers with a layer of polyethylene glycol to obtain nanoparticles with the ability to escape recognition and capture by white blood cells, i.e. stealth particles.\n\nIn tumour-bearing rats using the new formulation, tests showed that there was a threefold increase in drug uptake in the cancer cells, as compared to the standard formulation. In addition, the dosage of the drug could be lowered by 20?% while preserving the same therapeutic effect as that of the standard formulation. This result is particularly important for reducing the adverse side effects of PDT.\n\nIn conclusion, Nanophoto's studies showed that the new formulation substantially improves the treatment of cancer with PDT.

A promising path to explore in the search for active devices on the nanoscale is the coupling between molecules and plasmons.

It will also look at the scattering of plasmons from molecules and their subsequent propagation in order to identify possible anisotropy, which would allow for the application of the molecules as a plasmonic switch.

Networks are fundamental to our modern world: they appear throughout science and society, and continue to grow in size, complexity and importance. Whenever we observe entities and relationships between them, we effectively define a network of some sort. As structural objects composed of nodes and links, networks play a strong and well defined role across mathematics, science and engineering. As statistical objects made up of collections of measurements, however, network datasets require significant advances to be made in mathematical knowledge if we are to achieve fundamental understanding. The crux of the problem, and the essence of the approach to be undertaken in this research, lies in finding the right balance between complexity and parsimony. Currently, the network models that we understand fully from a mathematical viewpoint are too simple to accurately describe modern data. At the same time, models sufficiently rich to provide accurate descriptions are presently beyond our mathematical comprehension, meaning that we cannot use them to draw sound and repeatable conclusions from data. This fundamental lack of understanding slows scientific progress and affects every single economic, social or other policy decision that relies on the analysis of network data.

INTERACT will (1) establish a new approach to the science of mimicry, bringing together methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience and computer science, and (2) use this approach to understand the information processing mechanisms underlying mimicry of hand actions.  First, we will develop interactive avatars which can mimic a participant\u2019s hand actions or be mimicked by the participant in the context of a simple drum rhythm task.  Using computer-generated avatars allows us to precisely control and measure movement timing and structure during mimicry, and to record how participants interact with avatars with different socially-relevant features (age / attractiveness or even aliens).  Thus, the INTERACT system will enable high-resolution, well-controlled studies of how people detect and control mimicry.  Second, we will use the interactive avatars to examine mimicry in unprecedented detail, studying how the timing and structure of an action and form of the avatar impact on the control and detection of mimicry in typical adults.

Various signalling pathways (Wnt, Notch, Ras, Hippo, PI3K and JAK/STAT) have been linked with cancer onset and progression, but the full potential of signalling molecules as therapeutic targets has yet to be explored.\n\nIn this context, the EU-funded project 'Developmental molecular pathways in Drosophila as a model for human cancer' (CANCERPATHWAYS) brought together leading scientific experts in the field to produce fundamental advances in our understanding of cancer biology. The consortium used the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which represents a powerful model system for studying oncogenic pathways.\n\nTo study the functional outcome of individual genes in cancer development and identify novel targets of oncogenic signalling pathways, the scientists generated genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) reagents targeting nearly every gene in the Drosophila genome. For the design and evaluation of these genome-wide reagents, the software algorithm http://www.nextrnai.org (NEXT-RNAi) was developed. Based on this in vitro RNAi library, transgenic Drosophila in vivo RNAi lines were created for nearly 12 000 genes and were made publically available through the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center (VDRC).\n\nThe CANCERPATHWAYS consortium developed novel bioassays for the screening of genome-wide RNAi and small molecule compound libraries and for assessing their impact on cell fitness and specific pathway activities. Large-scale RNAi screening led to the identification of novel therapeutic target genes. High-throughput compound screens resulted in the identification of novel candidate molecules that interfered with the activity of oncogenic signalling pathways.\n\nPhenotypic screening of cell lines was also performed by image-based techniques, which enabled the simultaneous analysis of multiparametric features.

The novel approaches to the problem we will use are: study of multiple organ enzyme function using a systems approach in disease; use of proteomic aproach to understand GS post-translational modifications; use of GS KO mice to understand the role of muscle GS; use of gene therapy approaches to reconstitute GS; if we prove during this study that gene therapy to increase muscle GS has potential to decrease hyperammonaemia and slow the progression of liver disease, we will have a potential therapy for HE which can enter therapeutic trials in the clinics.'", 228264.0, 228264.0, "HE&GS", "Gene therapy for liver failure", "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complex disorder with gradual impairment in the mental performance and reactions to external stimuli.

The EU-funded Marie Curie 'The role of glutamine synthetase in liver failure: molecular, functional and therapeutic modulation' (HE&GS) project aimed to define the role of GS in liver failure and its therapeutic potential for HE treatment.\n\nAs an initial step, researchers obtained mouse knockout models in collaboration to test the importance of selective deficiency of GS in the muscle. The animals lacking muscle GS had significantly greater brain swelling and liver injury that was associated with more severe hepatic inflammation. This happens due to the greater migration of bacteria from the gut into the blood stream.\n\nMuscle depletion is frequently encountered in patients with cirrhosis and together with malnutrition is an independent prognostic factor for survival. Using mass spectrometry, researchers identified that the animals lacking muscle GS had more severe oxidative stress in the muscle proteins. These results explained why the lack of GS function in the muscle produced deficiency in energy storage and muscle loss.\n\nProject data suggested that the reconstitution of GS in the muscle is likely to be an important therapy. Researchers successfully developed a viral vector for safe delivery of a GS expressing construct to the muscle. Using this approach, it is now possible to produce a virus that can be used for the study of muscle GS replacement.\n\nThe results of this project have allowed further clarification of the important role of muscle GS, the mechanisms of the reduction of GS function and their effects in liver failure.

Moreover, in the longer run the presence of immigrants affects the choices of firms over new technology investments, and the choices of native workers over schooling and occupations. Thus simple static frameworks provide an incomplete and even potentially misleading perspective for understanding modern immigration patterns. The point of departure for this proposed research is the recognition that we need to reformulate the analysis of immigrant impacts in a fully dynamic framework, acknowledging the inter-temporal choices of immigrants, firms, and native workers and the ways that these three groups of agents interact over a longer horizon. Our approach involves treating immigration as a dynamic shock, where the dynamics relates to the different agents involved: immigrants, who change their position in the native skill distribution over time as a result of their life-cycle decisions; firms, who react by adjusting their technologies, product mix, and their involvement with institutions and regulatory environment; and native workers, who adjust by changing their career plans.

IL-27 then might suppress pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and induce generation of regulatory cells, namely Tr1 cells. We have found that IRF1 is specifically induced early on during Tr1 generation and that IRF1 is required to generate Tr1 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, it is also induced in cells treated with IFN-\u03b2.

Despite their importance in vision, the function of feedback signals has remained elusive, although multiple roles have been suggested. Feedback could account for contextual modulation of neural responses or explain attentional enhancement of responses to behaviourally relevant stimuli. Direct evidence supporting these roles is lacking, largely due to methodological limitations. We propose to take advantage of new imaging and genetic methods that allow for the first time direct measurement of feedback signals. We will inject genetically encoded calcium indicators in secondary visual areas in mice to label axons and synaptic boutons of neurons projecting back to V1. We will then measure the activity of feedback projections with synapse resolution using high-speed two-photon calcium imaging during different behavioural states to establish the functional role of feedback.

In this period of long-term economic downturn (or sometimes even crisis) and increasing competition from countries elsewhere in the world (e.g. China, India), it is important to find out how and under which circumstances European's urban diversity can be turned into social and economic advantages.\nMany current urban policies lack a positive view on urban diversity, because they generally focus on the negative aspects of diversity, such as intolerance, racism, discrimination and insecurity. New policies, instruments and governance arrangements are needed, and sometimes they already exist. We have to find out how they have become successful and how they can be implemented elsewhere.

Currently the fetus is delivered very preterm before fetal death or irreversible organ damage occurs. Affected neonates suffer intracranial haemorrhage, chronic lung disease, cerebral palsy, with heart disease and diabetes as adults; mortality is high. Recent improvements in the care of premature growth restricted neonates, means that more of them survive delivery, but at great cost. Small increases in fetal growth and gestation at birth are associated with major improvements in survival and morbidity.\nImproving uterine blood flow is key and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is important to achieve this. In preclinical animal models we showed that local VEGF gene transfer to the uteroplacental circulation using adenovirus vectors increases uterine blood flow, attenuates constriction of uterine arteries and increases angiogenesis; these changes result in improved growth of severely growth restricted fetuses. This is the first clinically-applicable evidence based therapy that could improve perinatal outcome in severe early onset FGR in man.\nIn collaboration with an SME experienced in gene therapy trials, our aim is to complete an agreed toxicology programme, identify specific ethical issues in stakeholders, and to perform a Phase I/II study in women with severe early onset FGR at four EU centres of excellence, using interventional radiology to deliver an adenovirus vector containing the mature processed form of human VEGF-D into the uterine artery.

Improving blood flow to the womb would significantly improve the outcome for such babies.\n\nWomen with normal pregnancies have appropriate levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in their blood, resulting in healthy blood flow to the womb. VEGF is a protein secreted by the placenta and women with FGR could benefit if the local VEGF levels in the blood supply to the womb are enhanced via techniques such as gene therapy.\n\nRecently, use of growth factor therapy in animals dramatically enhanced fetal growth through dilating the vessels supplying the womb and by providing new blood vessel formation that increased blood flow to the womb.

Additional concerns exist regarding drug eluting stents as there appears to be a small but real increase in late and very late stent thrombosis, particularly after discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy.\nThe novel concept we propose is use of a biodegradable magnetised stent (BMS) to deliver a novel biological therapy offering regenerative medicine solutions to the coronary artery vessel wall.

Many of these interventions have been derived from adult literature and have not been validated in the newborn. Dopamine remains the most common inotrope used despite little evidence that it improves outcome. Hypotension is not only associated with mortality of preterm infants but is also associated with brain injury and impaired neurosensory development in ELGAN survivors. Preterm brain injury has far reaching implications for the child, parents, family, health service and society at large. It is therefore essential that we now design and perform the appropriate trials to determine whether the infusion of inotropic agents is associated with improved outcome. We have assembled a consortium with expertise in key areas of neonatal cardiology, neonatology, neurophysiology, basic science and pharmacology with the intention of answering these questions.

Loss of dystrophin leads to inflammation and replacement of muscle with fibrous tissue.\n\nDespite prenatal diagnosis, the incidence of DMD is 1 in 5 000 births due to novel mutations that arise in the dystrophin gene. The dystrophin gene is one of the largest known, with 79 different protein-coding regions referred to as exons. Mutations in one of these exons interfere with the rest of the gene being put together and producing a functional protein.\n\nIn Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), DMD mutations still produce a shortened but functional dystrophin protein, and most patients are able to walk and have a normal lifespan. This occurs because although some exons are missing, the remaining can join together.\n\nBased on this observation, scientists have developed a method known as exon skipping, which essentially encourages the cellular machinery to skip the mutated exon. For this purpose, they are using oligonucleotides as molecular patches to produce the shorter version of the dystrophin protein.\n\nPrior work by the members of the EU-funded http://www.skip-nmd.eu/ (SKIP-NMD) consortium successfully demonstrated the therapeutic outcome of skipping exon 51 in clinical trials with boys with DMD.

Failure to activate this process leads to multiple enzyme deficiencies, dysfunction of the respiratory chain with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and altered iron metabolism with mitochondrial iron accumulation.\n\nSince the frataxin gene fails to express in FRDA patients, restoring frataxin levels has been identified as major therapeutic target.

Next, the models' ability to account for a large body of experimental data is evaluated. On the basis of how the model(s) fit the data, we can isolate the most plausible psychological mechanisms for sentence processing. The notion of 'word surprisal' is used to link the models to the data. Formally, word surprisal is defined in terms of informativeness of a word in sentence context. Quantitative measures of surprisal can therefore be extracted from different probabilistic language models. Empirically, surprisal can be viewed as the extent to which the word came unexpected to a reader or listener, having a measurable effect during sentence processing. To capture both aspects of word surprisal, the project combines psycholinguistic experimentation and computational modelling. On the experimental side, word-reading times and ERP data will be collected to obtain measurements of the surprise experienced by readers on encountering words. On the modelling side, several probabilistic sentence-processing models will be implemented to obtain estimates of word surprisal which serve to predict the empirical data. Matching the model's surprisal estimates to the experimental findings will identify the model(s) that provide(s) the most accurate description of human sentence processing.

The goal of this project is to provide novel evidence on the existence and sources of such agglomeration effects.\nIn the first part of the project, I use job creations and job destructions at a large scale (like the opening or closing of a large plant) to identify agglomeration effects in the local labour market. Local governments are often willing to substantially subsidise plants that may locate within their jurisdiction or loss-making plants that are at risk of failing. The main rational behind these incentives is that the opening of a new plant may lead to additional job creations, while the closing of an existing plant may trigger additional job destructions in the area.

The aim of this proposal is to reveal the intrinsic shape-generating potential of the cortex and to understand how this potential is used and controlled during cell division. To do so, we will first investigate how cortex tension, turnover and cell elasticity are controlled throughout division.

This observation, that physiological angiogenesis proceeds in response to solid-phase cues motivates our approach, namely creating bioactive resorbable materials as scaffolds that contain bound molecular signals to induce physiological angiogenesis in situations of tissue repair and regeneration.

Better prevention and management could potentially decrease costs and improve quality of care and health outcomes. An important means of accomplishing these goals is through the use of disease management (DM) interventions that educate patients about prevention and health management strategies, while also providing guidance, behavioral modification techniques, and social and emotional support. DM also seeks to assist providers by informing them about best practices and treatment opportunities. The underlying assumption is that DM leads to better quality of care, more health-conscious behavior, and improved disease prevention and control. In the short run, disease management would decrease costs by optimizing utilization of medical care. In the long run, DM lead to improved health status among patients with chronic conditions, thereby avoiding medical expenditures and improving workplace productivity.   Many health care systems in Europe and elsewhere are beginning to embrace DM programmes. Although the concept of disease management offers great promise, these programs\u2019 ability to reduce cost and improve care has not yet been empirically demonstrated; more and more policymakers are demanding objective assessments of a programme\u2019s impact. Part of the problem is that there are no universally accepted evaluation methods to measure and report programme performance in a scientifically sound fashion that is also practicable for routine operations.

The parental and segregant strains will be genotyped and phenotyped (in stressed and unstressed cells) using state-of-the-art sequencing, tiling array, and proteomics approaches, thus providing a rich basis for genome-wide association studies and computational modelling. Genetic, functional genomic, and proteomic approaches, along with computational methods, will be applied in parallel to develop protein and gene interaction networks that will further support the modelling efforts. Predictions based on the modelling will be validated with targeted wet-lab experiments to test and refine the mathematical models. Intimate inter-dependency between experimental and bioinformatic approaches based on close collaboration among participants with different expertise will be vital to develop successful models predicting the regulatory response to oxidative stress. The relative simplicity of yeast cells, which can be grown under tightly controlled conditions and with defined genetic and environmental perturbations, promises a thorough and deep understanding of the oxidative stress response system.

ROS are generated as metabolic by-products of aerobically growing cells and after exposure to environmental agents such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation.\n\nThe generation of antioxidant responses is central to the cell's viability and response impairment in humans is responsible for ageing, cancer, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Accumulating evidence indicates that the response to oxidative stress is mediated through activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, through expression of survival genes by the AP1-like transcription factor Pap1, and additionally in yeast through the action of the Prr1 regulator.\n\nUnderstanding the mechanisms involved in the regulation of oxidative stress was the subject of the EU-funded PHENOXIGEN project. To this end, the consortium used fission yeast as a model organism and aimed to associate genetic factors to phenotype.\n\nAlongside a detailed description of the cellular stress response, partners addressed fundamental biological questions regarding the natural genetic variability that affects the oxidative stress response. Given the established complexity of regulatory networks, the consortium undertook a genome-wide association analysis of specific molecular and cellular traits.\n\nScientists monitored the ability of over 170 genetically diverse yeast strains to respond to oxidative stress through continuous growth assays and measurement of various molecular properties, including RNA and protein expression. Mapping of these traits onto the yeast genome by quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis revealed a hotspot region of 713 genes implicated in the response to oxidative stress.\n\nThe PHENOXIGEN consortium generated important insight into the role of genetic variability in shaping cellular responses to oxidative stress.

The loss can be gradual, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, rapid as in stroke, or intermediate as in the delayed neuronal loss after stroke. Following damage, the nervous system is able partially to compensate through the formation of alternative connections and pathways, a process known as plasticity. Adults are therefore able to regain considerable function after stroke, and to compensate for the synapse and cell loss of Alzheimer\u2019s disease until it reaches a critical level. Children undergo a period of enhanced plasticity in most parts of the CNS at the end of development, known as critical periods. During these periods their ability to compensate for damage to the CNS is in many cases much greater than in adults. The overall concept behind this application is that restoration of the function in neurodegeneration can be achieved through plasticity (the formation of new functional connections, withdrawal of inappropriate connections, modulation of synaptic strength). Promoting increased plasticity in selected parts of the adult nervous system back to the level seen in children is a powerful method of enhancing recovery of function in animal models. Plasticity-promoting treatments could therefore be beneficial in a wide range of conditions that damage the CNS.  The PLASTICISE project integrates scientists from four scientific areas 1) Development of methods to promote plasticity 2) Development of models of neurodegenerative disease 3) Imaging of plasticity at the macro and micro level 4) Study of recovery of function through plasticity in human patients with brain disorders.

The Lactase Persistence trait is under extreme selection in humans; ancient DNA analyses suggesting that it was absent in the first Neolithic farmers. Modern phylogeographic patterning indicates a high degree of co-evolution of humans and domesticates. We will test these hypotheses by using sophisticated chemical and isotopic geochemical analyses of artefacts and bones, combined with traditional archaeology to obtain direct evidence of milk consumption and explore husbandry practices.  All these data will be integrated into a large database.  Mathematical modelling of gene flow and selection in Neolithic populations, constrained by archaeological data, will be compared with modern distribution of genetic diversity and ancient remains.  Each student will have their own research project, but will be encouraged to think and work as a team, by network activities, including a sophisticated set of Web 2.0 tools for communication, summer schools and their co-authorship of a book, the latter to teach them writing, editing and team-working skills.

Together with the researchers in training, the group generated fruitful discussion on the early history of dairy products and the importance of milk usage.\n\nThe project focused on lactase persistence, a trait believed to have been absent in the first Neolithic farmers. Lactase persistence is the continued activity of the enzyme lactase that digests helps digest lactose in milk. As such, the central question was whether milk was important before farming or if it became important only once farming was well-established in Europe (secondary product revolution).\n\nA total of 13 European organisations trained 13 PhDs and further supervised 2 recently graduated PhDs \u2014 1 each in Denmark, France, Ireland and the Netherlands, 2 in Sweden, 3 in Germany, and 4 in the United Kingdom. Training partners' expertise covered ancient DNA research, ancient organic compounds, and classic archaeology and osteology. Students hailed from both within and outside the EU, with training events comprised of summer schools, workshops and conferences.\n\nCombining data from the various areas of project activities, LECHE was able to address its original scientific question and show that lactase persistence co-evolved as the farming lifestyle spread. All findings indicate that milk was important from the early Neolithic stages, leading the network to conclude that the secondary product revolution was of lesser importance than previously thought.\n\nProject work led to 12 theses, a number of scientific papers in journals and a LECHE book, http://sites.google.com/a/palaeome.org/leche/leche-book ('May contain traces of milk\u00a0\u2013 Investigating the role of dairy farming and milk consumption in the European Neolithic').

Models of cultural group selection rely on patterns of cultural transmission that maintain differences between cultural groups, because either decisions are based on what most others in the group do, or non-conformists are punished in some way. If such biased transmission occurs, then humans may be following a unique evolutionary trajectory towards extreme sociality; such models potentially explain behaviours such as altruism towards non-relatives or limiting your reproductive rate.

Therefore, it is a central task in empirical economic research using non-experimental data to understand conditions under which the correlations or more generally associations obtained in statistical analysis can be interpreted as evidence for casual relationships. Studying these conditions is one of main econometric problems and generally viewed as an identification problem in econometrics. This research project aims to contribute to advances in understanding identification problems and developing estimation and inference methods using micro-level. In particular, the proposed research will: (1) develop point- and partial- identification results in microeconometric problems that occur naturally in empirical research in economics and social sciences; (2) develop semi- and nonparametric methods for estimation and inference in microeconometrics; (3) apply the state-of-the-art microeconometrics to important empirical problems in economics.", 136376.0, 1000726.0, "ROMETA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ucl.ac.uk", null, "fp7_92726_999975620"], ["6BT", "Inferring DNA binding specificities through in silico folding of natively unstructured protein regions", "University College London", "A major challenge in post genome biology is the functional assignment of gene products.

The overall goal of this project is to gain systems-level insight into the intriguing relationship between oxidative stress signalling and cell cycle regulation. Oxidative stress causes widespread cellular damage by increased concentrations of reactive oxygen species. Available data indicate that specific clusters of cell cycle-regulated genes, whose expression depends on members of the conserved forkhead family of transcription factors, are repressed during oxidative stress, and this repression then promotes cell survival. Using fission yeast as a powerful model system, we plan to use a wide range of genome-wide methodologies combined with genetics to elucidate two major questions regarding the connection between oxidative stress and cell cycle control: 1) how stress-activated signalling pathways regulate forkhead-mediated transcription, and 2) how repression of forkhead-mediated transcription in turn leads to oxidative damage protection. This project, which takes advantage of the use of a simple model organism and multiple high-throughput and integrative approaches, will promote a systems-level understanding of the complex interplay between cell cycle control and oxidative stress signalling.

The effect has previously been used to study introspection and self-knowledge in pair-wise decision tasks for faces (Johansson et al., 2005, 2006). These studies showed both that there were very few differences between verbal reports given in manipulated and non-manipulated trials, and that people in the experiments often confabulate reasons for their choices by refereeing to unique properties of the originally non-preferred face as being the properties that made the prefer this alternative. The failure to detect mismatches also influence subsequent behaviour, as the participants came to prefer the manipulated alternative in subsequent choices. In the proposed project we want to extend our initial findings and apply this research method to the domain of consumer choice. This is an important and interesting domain to study using choice blindness, as there is a long standing debate in the literature regarding what consumers know and what they just think they know about their own shopping behaviour. As a sub-field of consumer choice, we will also apply this method to economic decision making in the form of monetary gambles. In addition to analysing verbal reports, we will also study the dynamic effect choice blindness might have on the participants preferences, both for consumer goods and for risk strategies and preferences in monetary gambles.

We will initially concentrate on a population from the Gombak valley in Malaysia as this was the source for a laboratory based study of genetic variation. We will also investigate a distantly related population of T. dalmanni, to establish whether the same set of genetic loci contribute to genetic variation in eyespan in an evolutionarily divergent population.

IPF patients experience a gradual decrease in quality of life due to progressive dyspnoe and coughing, and usually die within 3-5 years upon diagnosis.

Based on these, partners were able to conduct extensive transcriptome, proteome and lipidome analyses that revealed a chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-response in the alveolar epithelium. This was accompanied by enhanced infection susceptibility, depletion of enzymatic antioxidants and deterioration of alveolar structure.\n\nParticular attention was given to the interactions between growth factors or proteases and cell-surface receptors, as well as to downstream signalling pathways. The aim was to define the key changes in cellular and protein interactions involved in the secondary fibrotic response to the trigger. To this end, the Wnt and Notch signalling pathways were shown to be important for the maintenance and regeneration of the alveolar epithelium.\n\nFurthermore, researchers developed new mouse models of IPF that reproduced the natural course of different trigger mechanisms. One model mimicked the outcome following application of amiodarone and pepstatin, while another genetic model was based on naturally occurring mutations (Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome genes 1 and 2).

The genetic potential of staple foods for increasing the micronutrient and antinutrient content will be evaluated and the determinants of success and failure of introducing biofortified staple foods in local farming systems will be assessed. The efficacy of biofortified staple foods with adequate levels of provitamin A will be determined. Concerning fortification, the project will develop and test new approaches to optimise iron and zinc fortification of staple food-based foods. The project will develop improved (traditional) processing methods of the staple foods concerned to enhance micronutrient uptake and bioavailability. The developed approaches in the area of biofortification, fortification and processing will be compared on efficacy of improving iron and zinc intake and status. The safety of the improved staple foods on immunity and infections will be evaluated as well as the impact on cognitive development of young children. Through capacity building and strengthening the scientific and technological excellence in the field of staple food-based approaches in Africa and Europe, the project seeks to significantly contribute to the improvement of the dietary quality of young children and their mothers living in resource poor areas in sub-Saharan Africa. New scientific knowledge will be exploited to strengthen the competitiveness of local SMEs targeted at evidence-based production of healthier (complementary) foods for African children.", 662744.0, 6588248.0, "INSTAPA", "Fortifying African foods against malnutrition", "An international research project has produced a number of strategies for improved micronutrient nutrition in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).", "Malnutrition remains a fundamental problem in SSA, causing widespread disease, poor health and even death.

It specifies in detail the economic environment (e.g., the available technologies and the informational asymmetries). The accurate specification of the economic environment will jointly endogenize the market imperfections the worker faces, and determine the set of available policies.

This is a topic of critical relevance: if LIDs development would be predictable from previous cortical dysfunction, it will be possible to adjust the DA therapy, in terms of dose and duration, basing on the grade of LID risk. To this aim, we will use a novel multimodal approach consisting in combining different techniques of non-invasive brain stimulation with electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), behavioral task and clinical evaluations.

Two groups of PD patients, with and without LIDs, will be investigated and monitored with two clinical follow-ups to evaluate the presence/grade of LIDs.

Thus, the proposed interdisciplinary project combines social psychology research with technical virtual reality innovations and envisages behavioural (synchroneous tapping paradigm), neuroimaging (fNIRS) and clinical (ASD) implementations.

These remarkable antibodies develop only during HIV infection, concurrent with immune dysfunction, not following vaccination. Crucially, the cellular processes whereby these antibodies arise need to be elucidated and I hypothesize that doing so using RNAseq, flow cytometry and imaging B cell activation will answer why only a minority of HIV\\ individuals develop neutralization breadth. Moreover, B cell dysfunction is associated to a range of malignancies and autoimmune diseases and, while much has been learnt from model antigens in mouse models, HIV infection provides a uniquely well-characterised human model to study B cell regulation. Another fundamental question is whether strain-specific antibodies are a stepping-stone to breadth, or a detour that must be eliminated in vaccination. I have shown that the best serum neutralization activity induced via stabilized HIV envelope protein immunization predominantly targets a strain-specific glycan hole, similar to many early responses observed in infection before broad neutralising activity develops. Therefore, I will determine whether non-neutralising and strain-specific antibodies affect the development of breadth by isolating a range of antibodies raised during viral infection from individual donors and comparing binding affinities, clonal ontogenies and B cell receptor activation.

There is little research on the connection between gender ideology and family structure, specifically single mothers by choice, therefore this study will address whether motherhood may be a site for social change for women so that they raise children who do not conform to gendered expectations and stereotypes that are damaging to children and to society.

Current models of disease typically account for two distinct stages of infection and disease, with mostly one-directional progression between them.

The consequence is that there is a growing risk that the decay of heritage will increase year by year because of lack of financial support. Cultural heritage is a non-renewable capital and it is linked to the economy because economics refers to the management of scarce and non-renewable resources; for these reasons, heritage conservation is also an economic choice. \nThe CLIC project addresses significant challenges of cultural heritage and landscape adaptive reuse.

S4CE will utilize monitoring data acquired during the project in these field sites on which (a) it will be possible to quantify the environmental impact of sub-surface geo-energy applications; (b) new technologies will be demonstrated; (c) data will be collected during the duration of the project, and potentially after the end of the project. Using reliable data, innovative analytical models and software, S4CE will quantify the likelihood of environmental risks ranging from fugitive emissions, water contamination, induced micro-seismicity, and local impacts. Such quantifications will have enormous positive societal consequences, because environmental risks will be prevented and mitigated. S4CE set up a probabilistic methodology to assess and mitigate both the short and the long term environmental risks connected to the exploration and exploitation of sub-surface geo-energy.

This deficit of understanding is especially pressing in low and middle income countries (LMICs) where few longitudinal cohort studies with IPV as an outcome exist. This study seeks to address this gap by following forward in time a cohort of 1200 Tanzanian women, using state of the art methods to measure violence, encourage disclosure and ensure participant safety.

Human capital is understood as a multidimensional object whose components (cognition and intelligence, socio-emotional skills, health) evolve in a complex way interacting with a variety of inputs and environmental factors. Disentangling the role played by different factors and inputs (including initial conditions, environmental shocks, parental inputs, centre based care) is important for our understanding of the process and for policy analysis. Second, we need to understand parental behaviour, as parents choose many of the investments in human capital development. Many questions are open: what are the constraints (resources, information, beliefs and attitudes) that parents face in making investment choices? Do parents make optimal choices? Do parents reinforce or compensate shocks? How are resources allocated across children of different gender and/or ability? Who makes decisions within the family?

In order to understand the forces catalyzing sex chromosome evolution, we require a study system at earlier stages of sex chromosome divergence, ideally one where there is still extensive polymorphism among populations and closely related species in the degree and region of recombination suppression, and with easily identified sexually antagonistic traits.

Citizen Science and Do It Yourself (DIY) scientific efforts demonstrate that this is possible, and our aim is to ensure that the European Research Area will become leader in \u2018deep\u2019 public engagement that is afforded by these advances.\nAs a 'Coordination and Support Action', this project will support and build upon DIY, grassroots, and frugal innovation initiatives so that in the short and medium term we sustain localised capacity building and in the long term the effects of these grassroots efforts channel to policy makers at different levels, from external advice to societal inputs, regarding appropriate research and innovation policies.\nThe proposal includes the participation of policy bodies (European Citizen Science Association, DE), SMEs (Tekiu, UK; Eutema, AT), Universities (University College London, UK; Universite Paris Descartes, FR; University of Gen\u00e8ve, CH), Science galleries and public spaces (Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, BE; Medialab-Prado, E; Kersnikova Institution, SL) and NGOs (Meritum Association, PL; Waag Society, NL)", 784792.0, 3412942.0, "DITOs", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ucl.ac.uk", null, "h2020_203160_999975620"], ["6BT", "Multisensory Integration in Time and Space", "University College London", "In natural environments, the brain is typically bombarded with multisensory information.

For example, when a rabbit hears footsteps and sees a blur, is the blur responsible for the footsteps, or are there two separate sources of danger? Animals use two types of information to make this decision: spatial correlations (are the footsteps and blur localized together) and temporal correlations (does the blur move in sync with the footsteps). Humans constantly perform these same operations. We use lip movements to help identify the words spoken by a friend, a subconscious process which becomes painfully apparent when watching a poorly dubbed movie.

Therefore, pain remains a major burden for the society (chronic pain alone costs the EU >\u20ac250 bns/yr). The reason is that pain is not a pattern of gene expression, but a state of neuronal activity. Therefore, the translation of mechanistic insights into effective treatments will depend critically on a better understanding of the electrophysiological changes that occur.

Brain imaging studies have found activation of motor areas when people process action-related words. Together, these findings suggest a link between sensory-motor experiences, gestures and vocabulary acquisition. But how are these related? One hypothesis is that children\u2019s manipulation of objects promotes their learning of concepts, these concepts then drive the use of iconic gestures rooted in actions with objects, as well as word learning. An alternative hypothesis is that iconic gestures scaffold vocabulary learning because gestures maintain important iconic similarity with the corresponding affordances and actions, while having communicative functions like words: thus emergence of gestures would be precursor to word learning. To-date, correlational data seems to support the first hypothesis, but existing data does not allow to clearly establish the direction of effects.

This balance can be maintained by regulating the number of neurotransmitter receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. A major inhibitory synaptic receptor is the hetero-pentameric GABAA Receptor (GABAAR), which is stabilised in the synapse by the intracellular scaffolding protein gephyrin. Gephyrin, in turn, is recruited to and stabilised at the synapse by the adhesion protein neuroligin-2 (NL2). Regulation of synaptic strength involves lateral diffusion of GABAARs into and out of synapses, endocytic downregulation followed by either degradation or membrane re-insertion, and altering the size of gephyrin clusters. Altered GABAAR trafficking is implicated in neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy and excitotoxicity in ischemia. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood.\nUbiquitination is a well-known mechanism that regulates protein trafficking and turnover, however its role in stability and plasticity of the GABAergic synapse remains unclear. Preliminary work from the Kittler lab suggests that: 1) the ubiquitin ligase Unk plays a key role in ubiquitination of the GABAAR; 2) gephyrin can be poly-ubiquitinated and that its proteasomal turnover may be regulated by the de-ubiquitinating enzyme OTUD4; 3) NL2 can be mono-ubiquitinated, potentially directing its trafficking, and that the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 may regulate this process. Thus ubiquitination may play several key roles in regulating the dynamics of receptor, scaffold, and adhesion molecules at the inhibitory synapse. \nUsing molecular, biochemical, cell biological, and state-of-the-art imaging approaches I aim to study how ubiquitination of GABAARs, NL2 and gephyrin affects GABAAR trafficking, and formation and stability of the inhibitory synapse.

Unlike ordinary materials, which are assembled at the atomic level, metamaterials are composite materials built up from artificially engineered meta-atoms and meta-molecules. The fundamental idea in this area of research is that remarkable physical properties beyond those available in naturally occurring materials can be achieved by designing the meta-constituents of the metamaterial and structuring it at a scale comparable or smaller than the optical wavelength. In this context, a new paradigm in metamaterials research emerges when the building blocks of metamaterials are quantum resonators, e.g., quantum dots (QDs), QD molecules, graphene disks coupled to interacting QDs, and quantum nanowires, case in which the macroscopic properties of quantum metamaterials are determined by the quantum properties of their basic constituents.

This, therefore, represents a truly collaborative effort to determine not only the role of the ECM in the development of epilepsy but also novel approaches to treat and to prevent epilepsy.\nThe academic partners will focus on specific research questions, whilst the industrial members will provide diagnostic, treatment and advanced research tools. The project has a strong translational theme and the combination of basic and translational science will be of great benefit for the training of young researchers.\nTrainees will be exposed to courses, workshops, joint research meetings and inter-laboratory visits.

One potential neural mechanism by which this could occur is replay, a phenomenon where neural activity patterns in the hippocampus evoked by a previous experience reactivate spontaneously during non-REM sleep, leading to coordinated cortical reactivation. While previous work suggests that hippocampal replay is important for encoding new memories, how memory consolidation is accomplished through cortico-hippocampal interactions is not well understood.\n \nThis research project has three major aims- 1) examine how cortical feedback influences which spatial trajectory is replayed by the hippocampus, 2) investigate how the hippocampal replay of a behavioural episode modifies cortical circuits, 3) measure the causal role of cortico-hippocampal interactions in consolidating memories.

First, recent research suggests that the main reason why schools in poor areas have low quality is because their teachers are ineffective. What is not known is how to identify an effective teacher, and whether we can compensate low quality teaching in early grades with high quality teaching later on. Second, there are strong associations between family socio-economic status and child development. But what is central for policy design, and researchers have not quantified, is the relative importance of different drivers of this relationship over the life of the child: resources, information, technology, or preferences. Third, although many welfare services are available for the poor, we often see low take-up rates, even for programs that can contribute to significant changes in the lives of families and their children. Two of the most cited reasons for low take-up are imperfect information and stigma. For both reasons, we expect take-up decisions to be strongly affected by social interactions. There is already evidence of strong correlations between an individual\u2019s welfare participation, and the participation rate of individuals she is likely to interact with. But we do not know precisely how social influences cascade through one\u2019s social network, and how this depends on whether social effects are mainly on information or stigma.

It answers a more general call for uncoupling the different economic forces driving teacher quality, socio-economic gradients in development, and the effectiveness of poverty alleviation policies (namely the role of social interactions).

However, multivariate morphological data provides a more complete picture of evolutionary and palaeoecological change.  Morphological data can also bridge deep-time palaeobiological analyses with studies of the genetic and developmental factors that shape variation and must also influence large-scale patterns of evolutionary change. Thus, accurately reconstructing the patterns and processes underlying evolution requires an approach that can fully represent an organism\u2019s phenome, the sum total of their observable traits.\n\nRecent advances in imaging and data analysis allow large-scale study of phenomic evolution.

Specifically, I will apply and extend new imaging, morphometric, and analytical tools to construct a multivariate phenomic dataset for living and extinct tetrapods from 3-D scans.

We have an intuitive sense of how dependable a concept is, which is crucial when we decide whether to rely on the concept. It can underpin our decision to reject some concepts (e.g. RACE) and embrace others in our theorising (e.g SPECIES).

Hearing aids and speech synthesis can help address this reduced capacity but their use imposes greater listener effort. The fundamental objective of the ETN 'Enriched communication across the lifespan' (ENRICH) is to modify or augment speech with additional information to make it easier to process. Enrichment aims to reduce the listening burden by minimising cognitive load, while maintaining or improving intelligibility. ENRICH will investigate the relationship between cognitive effort and different forms of natural and synthetic speech. Non-intrusive metrics for listening effort will be developed and used to design modification techniques which result in low-burden speech. The value of various enrichment approaches will be evaluated with individuals and cohorts with typically sub-optimal communication ability, e.g., children, hearing-impaired adults, non-native listeners and individuals engaged in simultaneous tasks. The ENRICH consortium consists of 8 beneficiaries and 7 partners from academia, industry and clinical practice in 9 countries, who collectively provide diverse infrastructure for investigating spoken communication and for applying innovations to end-user populations. ENRICH will address the unmet need for multi-skilled practitioners and engineers in this rapidly growing sector currently facing a serious workforce shortage.

The EMJMD EUPADRA is the result of a common programme developed by three highly specialized academic institutions sharing the same multidisciplinary, comparative and European approach to the study and advanced teaching of parliamentary procedures and legal drafting: the Centre for Parliamentary Studies (CESP) and the School of Government (SoG) at LUISS Guido Carli of Rome, which coordinate research activities and editorial initiatives in the field of parliamentary studies; the Parliamentary Law Institute of the Madrid Complutense University, which has a broad experience in the academic training of graduates in the sectors of parliamentary, constitutional and electoral law; and the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies (IALS) of London, which is a reference point in the field of legal drafting as confirmed by the success of the LLM in Advanced Legislative Drafting. The EMJMD is composed of 3 consecutive modules each of them granting 30 ECTS credits: the first module, \u201cThe 'shape' of parliaments in European constitutional democracies\u201d, at LUISS Guido Carli, introduces students to an understanding of the role and position of parliaments through the contribution of different disciplines: history, constitutional law, European studies, political science, etc. The second module, \u201cParliamentary procedures\u201d, at Madrid Complutense University, analyses more specifically dynamic aspects concerning the functioning of parliaments such as parliamentary procedures. The third module, \u201cParliamentary Legal Drafting\u201d, at the IALS, University of London, will deal with the general principles of the law-making process and the subsequent phases of implementation, interpretation and monitoring of legislation also in a comparative perspective. Moreover, students will complete the joint master with an internship, project work and a final master\u2019s thesis. Every module of the master includes a guest professional seminar series with the involvement of experts who will be invited to present their career and professional path to participants in order to provide mentorship. The strong interaction between scholars and eminent non-academic experts in parliamentary affairs, as shown also by the list of associated partners and supporters, is a key element in the overall structure of EUPADRA. While other masters in legislative studies adopt either a national or a European focus, EUPADRA is based on an understanding of the parliamentary decision-making process as a \u201ccompound\u201d and \u201ceuro-national\u201d process made of national and European elements interacting with each other. In other words, by exploring the interconnections between the national and the supranational context, EUPADRA offers an overview of the combination between the trend to \u201cEuropeanise\u201d national parliaments and the parliamentary dynamics of the European Union (as well as other regional supranational organisations). Students successfully completing the program will receive a Master of Arts in Parliamentary Procedure and Legislative Drafting jointly awarded by the three institutions.

For the students and teachers at Hof, developments in information technology and communication has opened new opportunities and could possibly keep the school open in the future, and thus, allow young people and families to receive fundamental education in this remote part of the country. In Hof, flipped learning could transform the way students receive their education as well as how the teaching takes place. For them it is not only a question of new possibilities in learning, it is a fundamental question concerning the equal right of all people to the same educational possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut our story doesn\u2019t stop at remote educational institutions. The equal right towards the same quality education also concerns the slow learners, the dropout students and the impaired.

Education outcomes need to be improved according to the 2013 monitoring report, and schools need to continuously improve their provision and quality of teaching to meet these goals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur previous work shows that Inspectorates of Education have an important role in driving school improvement, particularly in schools performing below inspection targets. Inspectorates of Education are however less well equipped to contribute to innovative and localized problem solving; their centralized top down approach enhances and legitimizes a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 strategy for success to national standards, encourage risk averse behavior in schools and window-dressing of successful rituals (see O\u2019Day, 2002). Also inspection feedback is often distant (in time) from the behavior the feedback is related to and therefore does not contribute to the trialing and testing of new solutions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany countries recognize the need to reshape their inspection systems and redefine the role of Inspectorates of Education to better fit localized decision-making and local structures and networks for improvement. These models are described as polycentric school inspections. Polycentric school inspections evaluate and assess the quality and functioning of networks of schools and/or their stakeholders, with the purpose of validating and supporting school to school improvement and cooperation at the local level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop and test these polycentric models of school inspections and specifically look at the mechanisms and context of their impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants \r\n\r\nA preliminary scoping exercise identified examples of polycentric school inspections in the Netherlands, England and Northern Ireland and examples being developed in Bulgaria. In each of these countries, researchers, Inspectorates of Education and a network of schools they will inspect are included as participants on this project. The extended project summary includes a description of each case and participating partners and how polycentric inspections will be evaluated in each country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology and description of activities\r\n\r\nIn the study we will use a case study approach to collect qualitative social network data in four countries about the knowledge exchange and interactions between schools and inspection organizations before, during and after an inspection visit and to learn about the role of school inspectors and the working methods they use, how these methods impact on improvement of schools and facilitate innovation and dissemination of knowledge. Additionally we will survey Inspectorates of Education across Europe (through the SICI network) to find good examples of polycentric inspections in other countries and use a literature review to evaluate their potential effectiveness for improvement of schools. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will include the following four phases: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Phase 1: mapping four existing examples of polycentric school inspections \r\n\r\n\u2022 Phase 2: literature review and ex ante evaluation\r\n\r\n\u2022 Phase 3: scoping good examples across Europe (survey and document analysis of SICI profiles)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Phase 4: studying impact of four examples of polycentric inspections\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the results and impact envisaged \r\n\r\nThe results include scientific papers, written and video narratives on a website, data collection instruments, presentations to SICI and scientific conferences, a MOOC and an international symposium.

A strategic game will be the core of the SUSEN learning arrangement. Students of 7th-8th grade to assume the role of a manager/entrepreneur in the market of energy provision and collaborate in teams. The game-character of SUSEN will typically raise motivation so the learning topic has the maximum impact with the student.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consortium selected the energy sector as a focus for the project to combine entrepreneurship education with education for sustainable development. Energy provision, energy mix and energy consumption are central issues for sustainable trajectories in times of climate change. Sustainability comprises not only environmental but also economic and social factors to consider. The game brings together economic questions of entrepreneurial success with questions of corporate citizenship and personal civic engagement.  As a consequence, the learning programme will combine a classroom game with elements of service learning. Participating students have the opportunity to learn outside the confines of school. Students will be confronted with tasks that require contacts with utility companies as well as with nonprofit/community organisations. With this enrichment of traditional game construction the partners intend to sensitise students not only for community but also to create opportunities and preparing young people for when they leave school. It will also engender cooperation between schools and business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe SUSEN game-based learning is innovative according to the mentioned combination of learning topics with their particular learning goals: education for sustainable development, entrepreneurship education, and civic education. Far more, it will support collaboration strategies between the game players besides strategies to succeed in a competitive environment. It fosters creativity and design thinking, self-efficacy and self-efficiency. Last but not least it requires transversal competences like a sense of initiative, learning to learn and digital competences. For this reason the consortium adopted a blended learning concept creating an online companion to accompany the game which is appealing to the younger audience offering  \u2018auditory\u2019 and \u2018visual\u2019 learning styles. \r\n\r\nTeachers are the multipliers of the SUSEN game development programme with its ambitious objectives as they will be paramount in its success in supporting the core objective. Firstly, the partners develop a \u2018self-starting\u2018 teacher support pack comprising all the required information, materials, and tools teachers need to implement the game in their lessons. Secondly, they develop a one day teacher training course providing future users with a syllabus and training materials. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo reach these objectives the consortium analyses at the first phase the learner\u2019s needs according to the different topics and main learning goals.  Simultaneously analysing the relevant curricula to ensure the intended programme is embedded more effectively in schools' regular processes. Regional/national differences are considered in game construction by adaption of rules. The partners develop the game rules, define players' roles, and identify relevant stakeholders (experts) who accompany the game development critically. The classroom game and the online companion will be piloted by schools in different programme partner countries. The evaluation of the whole programme leads to a final version of the game and the online companion. At this stage the teacher support pack will be developed as well as a syllabus and material to train teachers. This will be tested and evaluated in several multiplier events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consortium of six partners from Germany, UK, Poland, Belgium, and Switzerland were selected for its breadth of relevant knowledge and skills and partners' experiences referring to the topics entrepreneurship, sustainability and civic education as well as their experiences in proceeding EU projects.

I Creativity holds a strong position in early childhood and primary education, while it appears to be under greater pressure in the more formal educational environment of secondary education. It is therefore necessary to exploit, support and sustain the creative potential that is found in young children. \r\nScience education features highly in European education policy. Major EU reports urge countries to ensure that science education engages students before the age of 14 with science and scientific phenomena, through extended investigative work and \u2018hands-on\u2019 experimentation. The adoption of inquiry-based activities in science education is viewed as the only way forward (Rocard et al., 2007), as it is widely accepted that effective science education based on inquiry can lead to wonderment, and is fuelled by curiosity.\r\nSchool in Europe today would benefit considerably from acknowledging and fostering the link between science education, and creativity. Science education could (and should) be more creative. In the teaching and learning of science, a more creative approach based on curiosity and inquiry would be beneficial, involving, for instance, a move away from the pedagogy of the \u2018correct answers\u2019, which makes pupils believe that it is wrong to be wrong, and become progressively less willing and able to take risk and to unlock their creativity. Further, in a more creativity oriented science education, new modes of interactions within the classroom could be developed to stimulate self-expression \u2013 which, if nurtured, could manifest itself subsequently in later years in terms of an ability to create and innovate. Such a major shift towards more creativity in science education, though, both in terms of fostering creativity in science and teaching science creatively, would require a profound change in educational practices and cultures, demanding the development not only of new curricula, but most importantly of appropriate teacher training and professional development.\r\nThe CEYS project is a timely response to the aforementioned needs, at the European level, aiming at the development of a teacher development course and accompanying materials to be used in European  professional development to promote the use of creative approaches in teaching science in preschool and early primary education, in the frame of inquiry-based educational environments. \r\nThe CEYS project brings together a consortium of five distinguished partners from four countries across Europe. More specifically, the project brings together three internationally recognised universities (AUC, IOE, OU), a science education centre in a leading science research institute (INFLPR), and a distinguished educational research department operating within a school (EA) and thus providing close interaction with teachers, students and classrooms. This consortium has all the characteristics necessary to guarantee the successful and efficient realisation of the project activities.\r\nThe overall aim of the CEYS project is to adapt, test, implement and disseminate a new training framework (including an appropriate curriculum, training activities that include good in-school practices, as well as a variety of supporting material) that will support the training of teachers to use creativity and inquiry-based approaches in the teaching of science. CEYS will work on expanding the existing state of the art in early years and early primary inquiry-based science education and creativity, as this has been explored and described by the FP7 research project Creative Little Scientists.\r\nCEYS will enhance early years and primary teachers\u2019 capacity to teach science effectively using inquiry-based approaches and focusing on the development of children\u2019s creativity. This will make goals of inquiry-based science learning more likely to be realized and achieve meaningful impact for a critical mass of teachers, and consequently students, across the EU.

This can involve both \r\na) the use of serious games based on gamification as a design approach which leverages, based on expert knowledge and the literature base, understanding about technology design which effectively engages, motivates and guides participants towards learning outcomes based on gamification principles. In relation to children with special needs, the learning outcome can be wider than that considered for typical groups and may relate to social and life skills development as well as to emotional and social aspects. For some children, engaging with a moving object, designed to be visually attractive, on the screen, may constitute a learning outcome related to attention and concentration.\r\nb) the use of existing games or general app technology, not specifically denoted as or designed as serious games, but which nevertheless may be effective for particular groups of children with SEN in developing motivation and engagement as well as, for example fine motor skills. The dividing line between these two types of games for children with special needs is not always that clear and it may not be obvious which category a particular app fits in to. Nevertheless, it is a conceptually useful differentiation. In the GAMES project, we intend to develop innovative pedagogies through the use of games (both digital and non-digital) in order to support and enhance student\u2019s skills and knowledge. GAMES will support teachers who work with two types of target groups of student: students with special educational needs (SEN) as well as students without special needs.\r\n\r\nThe partnership will develop the implementation of games as a pedagogical tool that stimulates learning (both formal and informal) aiming, especially the SEN students, to perform better in formal school settings to be better prepared for the future. \r\n\r\nThe project will develop both teachers and students skills directly through:\r\na) Case studies documenting and sharing experiences of how games are used in formal educational settings with both  target group of students,\r\nb) A teacher guide to support teachers in using games to support the students reaching their educational goals, as well as choosing appropriate games that will support their objective.\r\nThe strategic partnership will also indirectly support the development of teachers skills by creating game design guidelines that will help teachers modify existing games and also give important guidelines to industry professionals, non-profit organisations  and other practitioners using and developing games as a method for supporting students with special educational needs. \r\nThe target group: \r\nTarget group: Teachers (inclusive special needs teachers) \r\nPrimary end-users: Teachers especially of learners with learning difficulties and disabilities (LDD) and special educational needs (SEN) in general, including teachers of young people (13-18) who are disadvantaged, disaffected and marginalised.

Together with the increasing number of multi-faith classrooms, this emphasises the need to equip prospective teachers and teacher educators, and thereby also pupils, with adequate interreligious and intercultural skills and competences that allow them to navigate such complex and diverse contexts and cope with the resulting implications for the individual life-styles. Subjects like Religious Education (RE) or Ethics play an important role in facilitating the discussion of these issues and offering answers and explanations.\r\n\r\nRE in public schools in Europe is designed in many ways. Each country\u2019s respective situation and form of organization differs significantly for mainly historical reasons. Despite the different contexts, an increasingly widespread discussion about the possible future of RE takes place. These discussions, however, are rarely linked together and have not yet reached the level of teacher education and training. Future religion teachers are normally only rather superficially familiar with the situation of RE (and related subjects) in other European countries and thus insufficiently prepared for a joint European perspective.\r\n\r\nIn addition, RE is faced with growing religious and ideological diversity of pupils and stakeholders alike across the entire European area. Current changes to the curricula and school structure, as well as wider debates on religion in the public sphere, have produced noticeable controversy about the place of RE in schools, how it should be delivered and what young people should be taught. \r\nIn the three-year Erasmus+ project \"Religious Education and Diversity - Sharing experiences of and approaches to teacher education in the context of 'Education and Training 2020' (READY)\", teacher training institutions in Germany, England, Italy, Austria, Scotland and Sweden will therefore explore the topic \u2018Religion and Diversity\u2019 in two respects: the mutual exchange of diverse forms of Religious Education and the variety of approaches to subject teaching and learning, in which the question of religious heterogeneity will be considered and discussed. The results will be examined and proposals for teaching Religion and Diversity in Europe will be published.\r\n\r\nMain target group of the project are teacher trainees for Religious Education. The project begins with a structured online communication between three pairs of trainee teachers from two European countries. This process leads to the development of a joint educational module on \u2018Religion and Diversity\u2019 between the two teacher education institutions. At the same time, profile descriptions of the situation of religion teacher education in the participating countries are exchanged, an interactive READY website is set up, which begins to unfold the diversity of RE across Europe, and a guideline for one week study visits is developed.\r\n\r\nIn the second year of the project, groups of five teacher educators and trainee teachers observe RE lessons in a European partner country for a week and hold discussions with trainee teachers, pupils and stakeholders responsible for RE. These experiences are analysed on the basis of a practical guide to European RE, processed and documented.  In parallel to these exchanges, local model RE lessons on \u2018Religion and Diversity\u2019 are systematically evaluated and their delivery in the classroom also partly videotaped. The pupils are encouraged to establish eTwinning contacts with a RE class in a partner country and in this way deepen their knowledge and experience of religious diversity across Europe.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, the entire project is designed to achieve broad dissemination and a long-term impact, which is facilitated by the experience, expertise, contacts and structures of the Comenius Institute M\u00fcnster. This includes, inter alia, a READY Newsletter, an interactive READY website, two national study days in T\u00fcbingen and London, a two-day final conference in Vienna and a documentation of key project results in book form.\r\n\r\nREADY focusses mainly on issues of didactics and pedagogy.

This makes it necessary for teachers to acquire new skills and innovative methods and tools to be able to deliver high quality teaching, to build flexible, personalised and inclusive educational paths, and to deal with complex class room realities. The existence of new educational technologies and the use of multimedia instruments within schools, furthermore requires new ways for how to design, manage and organise learning paths and educational material. Many of the existing learning design methodologies, even if being valid: either they are not flexible enough and thus not appropriate for the today\u2019s complex school reality; or they require work load not being sustainable. In addition, teachers often predispose annual plans, that don\u2019t support day by day design.\r\nThe aim of this project is to develop, test and transfer an interactive learning design methodology and App into the participating school and university systems of the partner countries, then promoting its adoption in further EU countries. In particular the objectives are:\r\n- To develop a Learning Design Methodology that will support teachers in managing new and complex class room realities, and differentiation between learner needs.\r\n- To develop an Application (a Google Chrome APP for PC and mobile App for Android and IOS), easy to use, to support the teacher in designing their learning activities, possible to use both in class room and at home.\r\n- To test and validate the Learning Design Methodology and App in several schools and at different levels in the partner territories.\r\n- To implement a MOOC to open up the learning opportunities to other territories and to promote the use of the methodology and the app;\r\n- To disseminate and transfer the Learning Design Methodology and related App to other schools, universities and teachers outside the partnership at both local, national and European level.\r\nTo achieve the above objectives, 10 partners from 4 different countries will cooperate throughout four different action phases:\r\n1) In the 1st action phase partners will define and fine-tune the methodological approach that the project intends to follow.\r\n2) In the 2nd action phase partners will develop an App for the Learning Design and organisation of pedagogical material, testing their use directly in schools and with teachers that belong to the networks of the consortium;\r\n3) In the 3rd phase a training process will be launched to consolidate the use of the Methodology and App: a) through a training course for the teachers of the involved pilot schools; b) by the introduction of the training content within the course curricula of the science education programme of the 4 universities involved, to prepare future teachers/trainers; c) through the development of the course content in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOCs), first of a series already planned, to guarantee a direct and permanent access and use by other schools, universities, teachers, students and stakeholders.\r\n4) The 4th phase is finally dedicated to transfer and mainstream results at local, national and European level, including the organisation of multiplier events.\r\nThis will result in validated tools and resources, that can be easily transferred, adapted and applied into different class room realities, schools and countries since they were jointly developed, tested and tried out in various schools, territories and countries representing different characteristics, problems and needs. \r\nThe positive effects of the project in terms of more personalised, inclusive and flexible learning paths, will contribute in maximising each individual\u2019s learning potential and will help them to better respond to the needs of the 21st century.", "http://www.ucl.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT02-KA201-036605_7"], ["6BT", "Strengthening Architecture and Built Environment Research", "UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON", 249484.0, "Architecture and Built Environment disciplines have been taught at European universities for over a century.

There is broad consensus that clinician-scientists (doctors/surgeons with a full scientific training) hold the key to bridge this gap. However, the number of clinician-scientists is declining due to the failure to retain them in the academic and industrial workforce. The three main sources of this problem are the lack of established career pathways for clinician-scientists, the limited possibilities for integration of clinical and scientific skills and lack of awareness amongst stakeholders of the added value of clinician-scientists.\r\n\r\nThe first objective of this Strategic Partnership is to create efficient, sustainable and attractive career pathways for clinician-scientists, including the development and implementation of a mentorship program. \r\n\r\nThe second objective is to integrate research and clinical components in the training of clinician-scientists.

Within different cultural and national contexts, a loss of authority, of bearings, and of moral values, inducing new relationships between generations and within education, is acknowledged, whereas the school as agent of transmission of the knowledge is questioned (School inequalities, dropping out, problematic school inclusion, lack of integration of migrant children, school/family tensions). There is also the expression of particularisms against the backdrop of a receding secular principle, bringing new communitarian claims into the public realm of education that are liable to threaten children\u2019s integration in the educative system and to draw them away from school. Contemporary uneasiness regarding education resonates strongly within our societies, especially as we cannot but witness the concurrent absence of prospects for our youth. Socio-cultural determinism seems more powerful than ever.  \r\nEducators are often distraught, even professionally suffering, and deplore the lack of training adapted to this context, especially as they intervene with very vulnerable and precarious populations. Anxious not to spread a vision of education marked by declinism, our project is to understand this multiform crisis and to better train educators in these new educational configurations.\r\n* Objectives: to better understand the crisis and to reinforce professionalism through meta-competences.\r\nComposed of five university staff (Paris 8 and Paris-Nanterre; Milano-Bicocca; Luxembourg; Institute of Education, University College London), three socio-educational institutions (Valdocco [Fr.], Duepuntiacapo Cooperativa Sociale [Ital.] and partners), the EducEurope Partnership is working on elucidating the notion of crisis in education through the crossed collection of narratives of practices and their analysis.\r\nThis work will be used as a basis for the conception of training which will aim to support the processes of professional drop-in and to develop meta-competences: diagnostic, creation and carrying of reflexive work, mediation especially with families, cultural and geographical mobility, coordination of partnerships at various scales (local, regional, national and European authorities).\r\nThe ambition is to define a new profile of stakeholders able to act at a meta-level to assist professionals in their evolution towards a new professionalism at the border between education, teaching and care, integrating a three-level analysis of situations: subjective, institutional and social dimensions operating in educational ties.\r\n* Methodology and progress of the project\r\nFrom the first year of Partnership a comparative transnational reflection is set up (Workshops and visits to educational institutions), bringing together teams of academics and social partners. This reflection allows us to confront the different realities and national figures of the crisis and lays the first basis for the production of a Thesaurus, \u2018Educations in crisis in Europe, what are we talking about?\u2019\r\nTaking up this same apparatus and complementing it, the second year will allow to discuss and consolidate the first results during study days, to design and co-animate transnational virtual classes.

The European Commission\u2019s Education and Training 2020 Strategy (ET2020) recognises the need to improve the quality and relevance of teaching and learning in higher education (HE), to modernise and digitise educational systems. We need to design future-looking, digitally rich, flexible courses (module), mobile-ready and attuned to students\u2019 expectations for engaging, professionally related learning experiences (e.g. UK Open University \u201cInnovating Pedagogy 2016\u201d).  Yet we know only a few pioneering academics currently have the design skills, technology knowledge and above all time to remodel their programmes to the creative standards they would like and the future of education demands. \r\n\r\nDeep sector change must by definition engage mainstream teachers, but course redesign processes, while effective, generally demand too much time and support to be scalable.  This contradiction frustrates educational ambition at all policy levels. Recognising the need for a radical rethink, the highly experienced digital education team at University College London (UCL) developed high-energy hands-on learning design workshop locally called ABC with a focus on blended (ICT-rich) learning. The key to this approach is pace, engagement and collaboration. In just 90 minutes using a \u2018rapid prototyping\u2019 format teaching teams work together to create a visual \u2018storyboard\u2019 outlining the type and sequence of learning activities (both online and offline) required to meet the course\u2019s learning outcomes. ICTs, assessment methods, cross-program themes and institutional policies are all integrated into the process. \r\n\r\nExtensive testing at UCL and other institutions has shown high levels of transferability, academic enthusiasm and satisfaction. ABC to VLE has grown from that experience and is an ambitious transnational project to further test, refine and expand this rapid-design format in other institutions taking into account cultural issues, localisation and language, alignment with local institutional strategies and technologies, alignment with quality and other policies, diverse delivery and evaluation approaches and localised support capacity. \r\n\r\nThe eleven partner institutions cover a broad range of contexts, representing ten countries, ten languages and a variety of supported educational technologies, meaning this project will provide outputs relevant to a large proportion of European universities, as well as being of benefit to those further afield.\r\n\r\nThe primary outcome is the development of a learning design and staff development online/downloadable \u2018pack\u2019 including contents, and methods for localisation, training or cascading (i.e. run locally). The pack will be validated in three ways, firstly by co-development by the project team, secondly by longitudinal case studies by the project partners in their own educational contexts, tracking the intervention though development to the student experience in order to refine the process and thirdly by the initiation and engagement of a transnational community of practitioners who will use and feedback on the pack throughout the project.
