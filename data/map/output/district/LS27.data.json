Innovative nano/micro particle based coatings, suitable for 3D printing, will be also developed to achieve anti-corrosion resistance, high mechanical strength, improved solar reflectance, improved ageing resistance and anti-vandalism properties. \n\nTo create the panels, an innovative manufacturing process will be created that includes Reconfigurable Moulding (RM) techniques, 3D laser scanning and 3D printed technology. In addition, 3D printed microstructured formworks will be developed as permanent external layer for the polyurethane panel to match the existing building aesthetics and provide solar radiation efficiency. The overall manufacturing process will (i) allow for mass production of panels, which take into account complex architectural and aesthetic issues, (ii) allow for faster production while lowering prefabrication costs and (iii) develop new controlled and cost effective solutions.\n\nIMPRESS will also develop a new Iterative Design Methodology, which will incorporate all stages of the Design-Construct-Install-Operate process. This will be integrated with a BIM cloud based database focussing on the interoperability between software tools required for the prefabricated process. Furthermore, new penalty based business models will be investigated. The final result will be demonstrated on two existing buildings where final as-built product performance will be validated against the initial design.", 4749.0, 5044927.0, "IMPRESS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_196758_943911754"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8JB", "Cultural Experiences Through Service To Others", "Morley Community Church Trust", 104189.0, "The project \u201cCultural Experiences Through Service To Others\u201d has been developed by Time For God drawing on our 50 years of experience in international volunteering. The project involves volunteers from 6 EU countries (Germany, Hungary, Italy, Sweden, Slovakia and Poland) travelling to the UK for a year to volunteer full-time in various projects based in local communities. The volunteers will be given lots of support by people in their local communities as well as Time For God, and will be able to develop their skills and improve their knowledge as well as benefitting the local communities. \r\nTime For God has built strong partnerships with organisations in the sending countries (Germany, Hungary, Italy, Sweden, Slovakia and Poland) who will help to recruit the volunteers and prepare them for the experience, as welll as supporting them during the project. \r\nThe project is designed to meet the following objectives:   \r\n-  Challenge young people to become actively involved in society by \u2018being there\u2019 and caring for others, especially those on the edge of society\r\n- Give the volunteer new skills and work experience through volunteering\r\n- Develop the volunteer\u2019s capacity to work, and/or live in, groups/teams\r\n- Get to know the British culture, people and language \u2018from the inside\u2019\r\n- Promote intercultural dialogue between young people (in the volunteer group, but also in the local community of which the volunteer is part)\r\n- Challenge the volunteer to reflect critically on his/her spirituality and be open to other religions & ways of life \r\n- Benefit the Receiving Organisation with the enthusiasm and cross cultural experience of a volunteer, who is able to augment the work of paid staff members with energy, new perspectives and time to build relationships with the community/ client group being served. \r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that this project will involve 14 volunteers, who will have a range of socio-economic backgrounds. In particular Time For God will encourage participation from volunteers who may otherwise struggle to access opportunities for higher education or work experience, whether this is due to geographical reasons, health problems or economic obstacles. It is hoped that the project will be accessed by an equal number of male and female volunteers. \r\n\r\nThe actual tasks that each volunteer will be involved in will vary depending on where they are based, but each placement will involve an element of service to others. At  the Cambridge URC placement, the volunteer will spend time working in a community caf\u00e9 alongside people with learning difficulties. The participants at SPEC will help with (and eventually lead) groups of children and young people at the retreat centre, encouraging them to try new activities and improving their self confidence. At the House of Light and Oakham Lodge Trust projects, participants will work in a home for adults with learning disabilties, helping them with daily tasks as well as creating new activity programmes based on the volunteers\u2019 own interests and skills. Volunteers at Wolverhampton Lea Road and Morley Community Church will be involved in a range of community activties which include working with youth groups, visiting the elderley and reaching out to disadvantaged groups. The projects at Marylebone Church Army, Yeldall Manor and Edinburgh Bethany all involve supporting people who are vulnerable through homelessness or recovering from addictions. All volunteers willl be given comprehensive training and ongoing support and supervision to help them manage the challenges of this type of work. \r\n\r\nSeveral methods will be used to monitor the success of the project and gain feedback on the learning achieved by the participants. These methods include the Youthpass tool, Time For God\u2019s On Arrival Checklist and Mid Term Review documents, and online surveys.
