The EURO-URHIS (www.urhis.eu) project funded by DG SANCO, identified urban health indicators and their availability. EURO-URHIS 2 aims to develop methodology and validated tools useful to policy makers at all levels to make health gains via evidence based policy decisions for urban populations. The objectives are to collect data at UA level; provide tools for evidence based policy; develop methods for cross-sectional and longitudinal assessment for urban population health including all relevant determinants of health; validate these tools and methods by using existing population-based registries and databases; apply the tools in the field and ensuring they are easy and intuitive to use by policy makers.  The data will be collected using surveys of existing sources; priorities of policy makers in terms of policies and interventions for their urban area and a lifestyle/environment individual survey.  The strategy will be formulated, piloted, translated and disseminated.  Data collected will be validated and analysed to develop the specific tools for policy makers to use.  The meta-data collected will form the context to investigating trends in policy, major health problems and investigating the link between the two.  Differences in health indicators could be compared for benchmarking and to make changes.  The opinions of policy makers regarding the tools will also be evaluated. We will collaborate with policy-makers, researchers and civil society through a number of activities including consultation during the development stage, through training workshops and the conference.  Dissemination will be multi-modal co-ordinated through websites in formats adapted to different user-groups. Training of doctoral and post-doctoral students will ensure future researchers interested in this expanding field. At all stages, stakeholders will be consulted.", 23760.0, 3103745.0, "EURO-URHIS 2", "Urban health for the win", "Increasing flows of people to urban areas elevates the importance of urban health and related policies. EU funding has enabled the advancement of tools that will help policymakers make evidence-based decisions for health gains for these populations.", "The 'European urban health indicators part two: Using indicators to inform policy' (http://www.urhis.eu/ (EURO-URHIS\u00a02)) project built on the project European Urban Health Indicator System (EURO-URHIS), which identified urban health indicators and their availability. This follow-up initiative went a step further, developing methodology and validated tools for policymakers at all levels.\n\nComprised of 18 partners from 14 countries (spanning Europe to Asia), the consortium described health and health determinants particular to urban areas in Europe. These covered cities in north, south, east and west Europe.\n\nWork involved collecting data at urban area level, providing tools for evidence-based policy, and developing methods for cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments of urban population health. Partners validated the tools and methods using population-based registries and databases, and applied the tools in the field with a view to ensuring their ease of use for policymakers.\n\nThe first study enabling trustworthy comparisons of health status between different European cities, EURO-URHIS\u00a02 supplemented information already locally available. Data from 26 urban areas in Europe are now available for between-city comparisons and benchmarking. As such, policymakers can now apply information in an evidence-based fashion when deciding on topics for urban health policy and interventions.\n\nProject partners collaborated with policymakers, researchers, non-governmental agencies and civil society through various activities. These included consultation and training workshops, as well as participation in the European Urban Health Conference in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (September 2012).\n\nEURO-URHIS\u00a02 efforts and outcomes have been widely disseminated, and more information on project results is available on a dedicated http://results.urhis.eu (project web page). Lay users, researchers and policymakers can access the web platforms for data and metadata.\n\nThe project has filled a gap in information that is lacking from national data sets. Using this information together with the tools promoted by EURO-URHIS\u00a02, significant improvements can be realised with regard to health requirements, health care and related services in the urban context.", "http://www.urhis.eu", "http://www.seftonpct.nhs.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/153869.jpg", "fp7_89377_998390640"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["4RQ", "Skills Development for Footbal VET Learners via EU co-operation", "David Campbell Event Management Limited", 62820.0, "David Campbell Event Management is a Liverpool-based training company with a 22 year history of excellence in football coaching & VET, facilitating sporting development, education and career opportunities for thousands of young people both in the UK & Internationally. Working alongside its sister company, David Campbell Soccer (for which it is most commonly known) which is a registered not-for-profit organisation providing work-based learning opportunities for learners on DCEM, the organisations are multi-award winning in delivery & the creation of projects supporting areas of social deprivation or political challenge/ diversification.\r\n\r\nThe Erasmus application is to take a party of 27 learners and 10 staff for vocational educational training involving the Spanish FA and facilitated by a host venue based Valencia which is to enhance learner development with the intention of up-skilling students & improving their employability & competitiveness in an increasingly challenging but growing marketplace. By undertaking study visits to top professional Clubs in one of the highest world ranking footballing nations of Spain, this mobility will enhance the educational elements of the courses for DCEM students allowing them the opportunity to experience first-hand, innovations in coaching techniques and methodology. \r\nHistorically, DCEM learners concentrated on their preferred sport to the detriment of formal education.  Many would have been disadvantaged in the labour market from not having gained the highest academic & soft skills available in their sector which are now so necessary in the job market. Many students are from disadvantaged backgrounds & were disengaged from education, only re-engaging through their interest in football combined with the well documented success of the DCEM programmes over a 15 year period at the forefront of sports education. \r\nThis mobility project proposes to allow such students to undertake formal qualifications, providing access to world class coaching methods, high intensity training & competition within the EU whilst covering many other aspects of football.\r\nDCEM has been providing full time educational courses for learners in the UK to train to become professional football coaches for 15 years, being one of the first training providers to do so. DCEM now offer NCFE Level 3 Extended Diploma and a City & Guilds Level 4 Higher Professional Diploma in Sport and Recreation Management, in addition to an Elite Academy established for highly skilled players released from professional Clubs. \r\nThe Premier League and Football League estimate between 60% and 65% of the circa 700 apprentices taken on each year in professional football clubs are rejected at 18. For these rejected players and for others, DCEM provides the opportunity to achieve a National qualification in 'Professional Sports Coaching and Management', in 'Professional Football Coaching' or as part of the Elite Academy, a pathway into playing professionally or semi-professionally. Uniquely all courses are open to both males and females and combine practical sessions with classroom lessons. \r\nIt is hoped the mobility experience will lead to a new way of strategic thinking for the participating learners on their return to the UK, irrespective of their ultimate career aspirations. The innovative European skills and competences derived from the mobility experience will be enhanced by the enhancement of informal learning & soft skills acquired as a direct result of participation in a work-based mobility experience which includes self-awareness\r\nDCEM is committed to ensuring VET learners graduating from this mobility project gain stable employment at all levels of the game or in the wider industry. Consequently, this mobility project will place a strong emphasis on mobility work programmes which prioritise the acquisition of innovative skills and competences which are relevant to that individual participant. This will be coupled with a strong focus on dissemination of the outcomes through linked vertical and horizontal vocational education programmes, in association with host partners and education providers, to rapidly cascade the project outcomes. \r\nThis project will specifically address a number of key UK objectives by targeting participants facing particular difficulties in the labour market, improving employability and combating gender imbalance and social exclusion.\r\nThe following is a list of definite but not exhaustive outcomes to be acquired/ improved by learners:-\r\n1. Improved success rates in learners securing employment in a professional football club either as a player, coach or in some other capacity within the football or sports industries\r\n2. Showcase the Elite players to prospective employers\r\n3. Vocational educational training - increasing skill base of European best practices, structures, technical & tactical play\r\n4. Enhanced employability opportunities - arising from European mobility, enhanced CV, in the long term", "http://www.davidcampbellsoccer.com", "David Campbell Event Management Limited", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036435_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["3XE", "RQ6", "ABBEY HOSPITALS"]]}}, "outwardCode": "L22"}
