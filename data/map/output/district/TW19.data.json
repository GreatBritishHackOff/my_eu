In spite of the large contribution to air pollution by maritime transport, this sector has remained largely unregulated until now. The adoption of the new restrictive IMO emission regulations requires modification of the entire commercial fleet that has to be retrofitted with innovative solutions.\n\nThe aim of this project is to create a novel, modular, on-board, after-treatment unit that combines different sub-units, each of which is optimized to remove a specific primary pollutant (SOx, NOx, PM \u2013 including BC, VOC, and CO). This new integrated retrofit system will reduce the environmental footprint of existing and new ships well below the limits imposed by the current and envisaged future regulations, while giving EU marine industry a competitive edge.\n\nThe system must be designed to avoid or minimise the use of external chemicals, and promote the use of reliable and robust technologies to allow easy maintenance and fast retrofit. The proposal considers the use of innovative processes for the treatment of each pollutant: i) a new concept of Electrostatic Seawater Scrubbing to capture submicron PM, SO2 and other water soluble compounds and ii) an innovative Non Thermal Plasma Reactor, using Electron Beam and Microwave, to remove NOx, VOC and CO. It is envisaged that these two processes are sufficient to successfully remove all gaseous pollutants from ship exhaust. However, if needed, in the final stage, state-of-the-art Selective Catalytic Reduction or NOx Storage Reduction will be implemented for residual NOx removal. The system will also include innovative processes to purify scrubber wash water before discharging into the sea without harming marine life. The outcome of this work programme will yield a technology demonstrator, which will be validated by an independent organisation.'", 264240.0, 2883480.0, "DEECON", "New device to reduce ship emissions", "Engine exhaust from ships is one of the most pervasive pollutants in the world today. Now, researchers are building a device that can remove gases and particles from diesel exhaust.", "Ships use a type of low-cost diesel that is high in sulphur and other pollutants. In 2010, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) put into place strict regulations on ship emissions to limit this major source of air pollution. \n\nThe EU-funded 'Innovative after-treatment system for marine diesel engine emission control' (http://www.deecon.eu (DEECON)) project is building a modular exhaust scrubbing unit to remove pollutants from diesel exhaust. This device will be retrofitted onto existing ships and will be installed on all newly built vessels.\n\nResearchers started with a full analysis of ship engines to determine the requirements of the system. The envisioned device will be made up of several sub-units: an electrostatic seawater scrubber (ESWS), a plasma reactor, a catalytic reactor and a washwater treatment unit.\n\nThe washwater treatment unit and ESWS have already been designed and built, and tests show that the ESWS can remove up to 93\u00a0% of particulate matter.\n\nModelling of the plasma reactor has been completed, and a prototype that uses microwaves as an energy source could scrub up to 90\u00a0% of gaseous pollutants.\n\nAll of the sub-units have been tested independently, and are now being assembled to form the prototype DEECON exhaust scrubbing system. The system will be trialled on a diesel engine at Gdynia Maritime University in Poland. Successful outcomes will have important implications for the shipping industry and EU economy.", "http://www.deecon.eu", null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112026.jpg", "fp7_100218_965996423"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TW19"}
