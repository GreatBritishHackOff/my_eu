Especially if the tremendous amount of existing organic waste can be used for gasification, these processes become both, ecologically and economically extremely interesting. Gasification processes are performed under elevated or high temperatures and ambient or elevated pressures. A special gasification and evolved gas refinery treatment becomes indispensable if different kind of organic waste will be used. Therefore many new processing treatments have to be developed which will constitute a rising demand for laboratory scale gasification process analyzers as well as in Situ high temperature concentration sensors. The goal of this project is a new laboratory gasification process analyzer including several new in Situ high temperature concentration sensors for process application in a broad temperature and pressure range. The analyzer consists of a gravimetric pyrolyzer to determine the time dependent reaction rates of gasification processes under industry-oriented conditions and a following catalyser unit for gas refinery treatment investigation. For high temperature concentration sensors different optical methods like UV/VIS, NIR, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy will be applied and several electro ceramic and piezo electric sensors for impedance, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, VOS and calorific value will be developed. This project will educe an universal gasification processes analyser allowing an experimental simulation of industrial gasification processes in laboratory scale and providing various kind of high temperature sensors for process use at all scales. It will be an essential step to optimise current processes and develop new ways of combined heat and power generation for all kind of existing organic waste and bio mass.", 104892.0, 1264391.0, "GASPRO-BIO-WASTE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.care.demon.co.uk", null, "fp7_96913_987467955"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3RP", "Kaleidoscope", "Shining Stars Community Group", 48236.0, "Kaleidoscope \u2013 Cultural and Religious Diversity and Digital Media in Youth WorkThis is an innovative training programme for youth workers (Key Action 1 \u2013 mobility of youth workers) combining elements of cultural and religious diversity training with digital media skills (photography, video, editing, social media).

The main aim of the project is to train participants \u2013 64 youth workers from different European countries (four per course to assure a balanced learning environment) \u2013 in the use of digital media tools in youth work, mostly through, photography, video, editing and social media to promote the positive image of cultural and religious diversity. The project will also develop participants\u2019 skills in facilitating intercultural dialogue activities for young people.The project is composed of two courses: the first one in Baku, Azerbaijan (September 2016), will focus on photography and historical cultural heritage, whereas the second one in Almere (December 2016) will look at digital media editing and social media tools, migration and contemporary cultural diversity. Cutting-edge digital media facilities of the Almere College, as well as the expertise of Digg\u2019Out and Azerbaijani Students Union staff (Azerbaijan partner organisation) will be combined in the project. For the Azerbaijan course, we will use the cultural heritage sites of the Azerbaijan\u2019s capital city of Baku. For the Dutch course, we are planning to use Almere\u2019s rich cultural and religious diversity resources including visiting community centres and places of worship, in order for participants to discover the importance of cultural diversity in the Netherlands. Project methods will include: intercultural dialogue activities, exploring the Netherlands\u2019 and Azerbaijan\u2019s cultural diversity through site visits and field work, digital media workshops and Erasmus+ project management and development workshops.

The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other in order to develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and this job shadowing project is part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe consortium consists of the Childcare and education department and five schools: Lagersbergsskolan, H\u00e5llsta skola, Fristadsskolan, Skogstorpsskolan and Djurg\u00e5rdsskolan.  During the years 2017 \u2013 2019 we are planning to send a total of 22 staff members from these schools on job shadowing activities in Birmingham (head teachers, deputy head teachers, leaders of learning, teachers of Swedish as a second language and also special pedagogy teachers).   They will spend a week at one of our partner schools within the BCPP where they will have the opportunity to learn and get valuable experience that will be used in the quality development of their own schools.  \r\n\r\nIn this project the consortium has three objectives:\r\n\u2022 We want to gain knowledge and experience that will lead to a positive development of our schools with the aim to improve the quality of teaching and improve the pupils\u2019 results.   Besides looking at teaching methods, we would like to see how the staff and the teaching are organized in order to make the most optimal use of the resources and also how different schools work with collegial learning.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Through the job shadowing activities we want to gain knowledge and experience which leads to a development of methods in order to take care of and educate pupils who have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  We want to develop their knowledge of Swedish and to maximize their learning and results in the multicultural classroom.  Eskilstuna is a multicultural city where 31% of the pupils have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 We want to improve the quality and results within special pedagogy by educating the staff in finding and developing different teaching methods and tools in the teaching of special needs pupils.  We especially want to focus on methods and tools involving ICT.\r\n\r\nAfter the job shadowing activities the school development will progress at the individual schools, based on the needs of the school, what experience and knowledge that the staff has gained and also based on the reflections of what already works well.  Collegial learning will be a different factor in this work.\r\nThe development will also be driven forward by the Development unit at the Childcare and Education department.  Here there are networks for head teachers, deputy head teachers and leaders of learning where discussions and dissemination activities will take place, in order to share the experiences that have been made during the job shadowing activities with colleagues who are not in the project.  This way, the job shadowing activities can lead to positive development at other schools as well.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the knowledge and experience which we gain from the job shadowing activities will contribute to an improved quality of teaching and better results in general, but also more specifically within the teaching of Swedish as a second language in the multicultural classroom and within special pedagogics.   We hope that this project will help give the pupils a good foundation to stand on so that they can succeed in their future education and working life.", "http://www.stclare.bham.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA101-034303_1"], ["3RP", "Do It Yourself", "Shining Stars Community Group", 24323.0, "Content/ history of the Project:  \r\nIn recent years,the 'maker movement' that aims to gather technology and 'do-it-yourself' culture increases its popularity day by day in the world.Nowadays,people who prefer to buy or consume the ready one instead of to think and create new one, are the population and sample of the movement.\r\nAccording to the researches,in the world,2.5 million people use internet and technological tools actively.A person spends an average of seven hours connecting to internet and spends about two and a half hours of this seven hours using social media.However,another aim of this movement is drawing attention to use technology correctly and effectively.For this reason,the opinion that is defended by this movement is to produce new things by gathering technology and creativity.\r\nExcept that, decreasing the age of using technology also prevents this movement to achive its goal.The development of children who begin playing with technological tools by giving up playing with toys,is damaged at these ages of improving skills and creativities.\r\nAims of the Project:\r\n The general aim of our project is to raise  consciousness of youn people on producing new things and to increase their creativity by associating technology to creativity.\r\nSpecific aims:\r\n1.To raise awareness on young people about maker movement.\r\n2.To increase their hand skill.\r\n3.Showing them that they can make many materials be themselves that they use in their daily life.\r\n4.To infuse produce-consume understanding rather than consume-consume one into youth\r\n5.To prepare awareness-enhancing project drafts about maker movement and creativity\r\n6.Showing them the enjoyment of producing and to be beneficial.\r\n7.
