Especially if the tremendous amount of existing organic waste can be used for gasification, these processes become both, ecologically and economically extremely interesting. Gasification processes are performed under elevated or high temperatures and ambient or elevated pressures. A special gasification and evolved gas refinery treatment becomes indispensable if different kind of organic waste will be used. Therefore many new processing treatments have to be developed which will constitute a rising demand for laboratory scale gasification process analyzers as well as in Situ high temperature concentration sensors. The goal of this project is a new laboratory gasification process analyzer including several new in Situ high temperature concentration sensors for process application in a broad temperature and pressure range. The analyzer consists of a gravimetric pyrolyzer to determine the time dependent reaction rates of gasification processes under industry-oriented conditions and a following catalyser unit for gas refinery treatment investigation. For high temperature concentration sensors different optical methods like UV/VIS, NIR, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy will be applied and several electro ceramic and piezo electric sensors for impedance, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, VOS and calorific value will be developed. This project will educe an universal gasification processes analyser allowing an experimental simulation of industrial gasification processes in laboratory scale and providing various kind of high temperature sensors for process use at all scales. It will be an essential step to optimise current processes and develop new ways of combined heat and power generation for all kind of existing organic waste and bio mass.", 104892.0, 1264391.0, "GASPRO-BIO-WASTE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.care.demon.co.uk", null, "fp7_96913_987467955"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B20"}
