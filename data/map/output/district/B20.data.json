Especially if the tremendous amount of existing organic waste can be used for gasification, these processes become both, ecologically and economically extremely interesting. Gasification processes are performed under elevated or high temperatures and ambient or elevated pressures. A special gasification and evolved gas refinery treatment becomes indispensable if different kind of organic waste will be used. Therefore many new processing treatments have to be developed which will constitute a rising demand for laboratory scale gasification process analyzers as well as in Situ high temperature concentration sensors. The goal of this project is a new laboratory gasification process analyzer including several new in Situ high temperature concentration sensors for process application in a broad temperature and pressure range. The analyzer consists of a gravimetric pyrolyzer to determine the time dependent reaction rates of gasification processes under industry-oriented conditions and a following catalyser unit for gas refinery treatment investigation. For high temperature concentration sensors different optical methods like UV/VIS, NIR, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy will be applied and several electro ceramic and piezo electric sensors for impedance, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, VOS and calorific value will be developed. This project will educe an universal gasification processes analyser allowing an experimental simulation of industrial gasification processes in laboratory scale and providing various kind of high temperature sensors for process use at all scales. It will be an essential step to optimise current processes and develop new ways of combined heat and power generation for all kind of existing organic waste and bio mass.", 104892.0, 1264391.0, "GASPRO-BIO-WASTE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.care.demon.co.uk", null, "fp7_96913_987467955"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3RT", "L\u00e4ra av varandra - \u00f6kad kvalitet genom jobbskuggning 2017-2019", "St Clares Catholic Primary School", 29186.0, "The Childcare and Education department of Eskilstuna Municipality in Sweden has the ambition to continuously develop and improve the quality of teaching, improve the results and give the pupils a good foundation in order for them to succeed with future education and work.    The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other in order to develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and this job shadowing project is part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe consortium consists of the Childcare and education department and five schools: Lagersbergsskolan, H\u00e5llsta skola, Fristadsskolan, Skogstorpsskolan and Djurg\u00e5rdsskolan.  During the years 2017 \u2013 2019 we are planning to send a total of 22 staff members from these schools on job shadowing activities in Birmingham (head teachers, deputy head teachers, leaders of learning, teachers of Swedish as a second language and also special pedagogy teachers).   They will spend a week at one of our partner schools within the BCPP where they will have the opportunity to learn and get valuable experience that will be used in the quality development of their own schools.  \r\n\r\nIn this project the consortium has three objectives:\r\n\u2022 We want to gain knowledge and experience that will lead to a positive development of our schools with the aim to improve the quality of teaching and improve the pupils\u2019 results.   Besides looking at teaching methods, we would like to see how the staff and the teaching are organized in order to make the most optimal use of the resources and also how different schools work with collegial learning.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Through the job shadowing activities we want to gain knowledge and experience which leads to a development of methods in order to take care of and educate pupils who have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  We want to develop their knowledge of Swedish and to maximize their learning and results in the multicultural classroom.  Eskilstuna is a multicultural city where 31% of the pupils have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 We want to improve the quality and results within special pedagogy by educating the staff in finding and developing different teaching methods and tools in the teaching of special needs pupils.  We especially want to focus on methods and tools involving ICT.\r\n\r\nAfter the job shadowing activities the school development will progress at the individual schools, based on the needs of the school, what experience and knowledge that the staff has gained and also based on the reflections of what already works well.  Collegial learning will be a different factor in this work.\r\nThe development will also be driven forward by the Development unit at the Childcare and Education department.  Here there are networks for head teachers, deputy head teachers and leaders of learning where discussions and dissemination activities will take place, in order to share the experiences that have been made during the job shadowing activities with colleagues who are not in the project.  This way, the job shadowing activities can lead to positive development at other schools as well.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the knowledge and experience which we gain from the job shadowing activities will contribute to an improved quality of teaching and better results in general, but also more specifically within the teaching of Swedish as a second language in the multicultural classroom and within special pedagogics.   We hope that this project will help give the pupils a good foundation to stand on so that they can succeed in their future education and working life.", "http://www.stclare.bham.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA101-034303_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B20"}
