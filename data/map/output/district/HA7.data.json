An existing ST CMOS high volume production line, unique in Europe, will serve as the basis of the proposed project. The strategy behind POLIS lies in the development of specific technological modules and to implement them at pilot line level on the existing production line. POLIS will also enable the development of several key demonstrators representative of potential final products serving multiple applications. More specifically, in order to support imaging expansion into new markets (automotive, consumer, medical, security), the project proposes to focus on the following application fields: sensors capturing photons beyond visible wavelength range, focusing on the limits of spectral range (X-ray/Gamma and thermal IR/THz), sensors using Time of Flight (ToF) technology and light emitters based on OLED on silicon technology for micro-displays.", null, 86020761.0, "POLIS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.horiba.com", null, "fp7_201977_950002772"], ["4RY", "Integrated intelligent sensor system for improved security of water supply", "Cniguard Ltd", "'ISIS will provide public security by developing an advanced monitoring system for drinking water networks that instantly detects chemical or biological contamination and gives clear indication of the risk level.\nWater distribution systems are vulnerable to deliberate, accidental or natural contamination, having many potential entry points for rapid and extensive distribution of harmful substances. Recent increased terrorist activity has raised awareness of the threat.\nSurveillance platforms for intruder security are available but can only be adapted to alert for chemical and biological contamination if selective, sensitive and instantaneous detectors are available. However, current methods are limited to off-line laboratory analysis, which are too slow to initiate prompt action, or simple indicators (e.g. pH, conductivity), which are limited in the information that they provide, failing to cover many contaminants and rendering decision-making unreliable..\nThe ISIS project will combine advances in the state-of-the-art in four main areas: sensors; wireless networks; intelligent surveillance strategies and integrated risk analysis software. This combination of technologies is a major advance in security systems, giving a capability for water suppliers that is not currently available. It will enable immediate alert of chemical or biological contaminations and, crucially, indicate not only the location and nature of the hazard, but also the level of risk. This will allow appropriate informed action to be taken and will minimise the chance of false alarms, which not only cost water companies thousands of Euros, but also cause the panic and disruption that are also the aims of terrorist activity\nThe ISIS consortium brings together two water company end-users with security and sensor specialists from the research, academic and SME communities.

BAMOS project particularly addresses the challenges in OA treatment by providing novel cost effective osteochondral scaffold technology for early intervention of OA to delay or avoid the joint replacement operations. This project has the potential to relieve pain in patients with OA improving their quality of life by keeping people active. It fits with the scope of EU Societal Changellenges to encourage the provision of improved clinical care for patients in the field of healthcare, especially for elderly patients.\nIn the course of developing this new treatment for mid- to late stage OA, BAMOS aims to establish and embed a new collaboration between six internationally leading research organisations (four universities, one healthcare provider and one manufacturer with expertise in additive manufacturing). The partners propose an integrated programme of research activities and the development of a collaborative graduate training scheme. The dissemination of research will result in at least 15 high profile joint research publications, and the consortium will organise two international scientific conferences (one in the EU, one in China) and 3 workshops.\nBAMOS will develop new materials and manufacturing technologies for the fabrication of custom-tailored osteochondral scaffolds. Novel biopolymeric composites, processed by additive manufacturing, will be characterized and tested as well as coatings on titanium scaffolds. Also, thermal welding technique will be used to join the cartilage component with the bone component to form an osteochondral unit.  \nThe new technologies will undergo full pre-clinical evaluation in order that the scaffolds are able to enter clinical trial after the project.", 58881.0, 675173.0, "BAMOS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_207034_931802759"], ["1BQ", "Analytical and Characterisation Excellence in nanomaterial risk assessment: A tiered approach", "Horiba Uk Ltd", "An increasing number of nanomaterials (NMs) are entering the market in every day products spanning from health care and leisure to electronics, cosmetics and foodstuff. Nanotechnology is a truly enabling technology, with unlimited potential for innovation. However, the novelty in properties and forms of NMs makes the development of a well-founded and robust legislative framework to ensure safe development of nano-enabled products particularly challenging. At the heart of the challenge lies the difficulty in the reliable and reproducible characterisation of NMs given their extreme diversity and dynamic nature, particularly in complex environments, such as within different biological, environmental and technological compartments. Two key steps can resolve this: 1) the development of a holistic framework for reproducible NM characterisation, spanning from initial needs assessment through method selection to data interpretation and storage; and 2) the embedding of this framework in an operational, linked-up ontological regime to allow identification of causal relationships between NMs properties, be they intrinsic, extrinsic or calculated, and biological, (eco)toxicological and health impacts fully embedded in a mechanistic risk assessment framework.  ACEnano was conceived in response to the NMBP 26 call with the aim to comprehensively address these two steps. More specifically ACEnano will introduce confidence, adaptability and clarity into NM risk assessment by developing a widely implementable and robust tiered approach to NM physico-chemical characterisation that will simplify and facilitate contextual (hazard or exposure) description and its transcription into a reliable NMs grouping framework.  This will be achieved by the creation of a conceptual \u201ctoolbox\u201d that will facilitate decision-making in choice of techniques and SOPs, linked to a characterisation ontology framework for grouping and risk assessment and a supporting data management system.", 351608.0, 9387694.0, "ACEnano", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_206749_923714026"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1BQ", "SPEX CERTIPREP LTD*", 291.0, "Euratom activities of direct research (10.03.01)", "fts_2016_45935", 2016]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["4LP", "RAN", "THE ROYAL NATIONAL ORTHOPAEDIC HOSPITAL (STANMORE)"], ["4LP", "RDE", "ROYAL NATIONAL ORTHOPAEDIC HOSPITAL (STANMORE)"], ["4LP", "RRP", "ROYAL NATIONAL ORTHOPAEDIC HOSPITAL"], ["4LP", "RRU", "PTS RNO HOSPITAL STANMORE"]]}}, "outwardCode": "HA7"}
