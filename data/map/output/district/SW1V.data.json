The OPERAs research will establish whether, how and under what conditions the ES/NC concepts can move beyond the academic domain towards practical implementation in support of sustainable ecosystem management. OPERAs will use a meta-analysis (systematic review) of existing ES/NC practice to identify knowledge gaps and requirements for new policy options and instruments.

These critical assessments will help identifying priority target groups with key responsibilities and interests in the state of our oceans - today and in the future. \n\nWithin a participatory process involving the stakeholders of the knowledge creation &  sharing system from four European marine regions  (Baltic Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Northern Sea and Atlantic _ including in its transatlantic dimension), and building on the scientific knowledge-base established and on project-dedicated IT strucure/platform, the project will then develop and test under real conditions innovative communication tools. Key principles guiding this development will be interactivity, mutual learning, creativity and entertainment. Finally, specific activities will be performed for ensuring proposed communication tools are made accessible and available to their future users in Europe but also elswhere.", 284226.0, 3064325.0, "Respon-SEA-ble", null, null, null, null, "http://www.tve.org", null, "h2020_194803_937753612"], ["1RB", "Interactive Soil Quality Assessment in Europe and China for Agricultural Productivity and Environmental Resilience", "Institute for European Environmental Policy, London", "Knowledge regarding the complex interplay between agricultural land use and management and soil quality and function is fragmented and incomplete, in particular with regard to underlying principles and regulating mechanisms. The main aim of iSQAPER is to develop an interactive soil quality assessment tool (SQAPP) for agricultural land users that integrates newly derived process understanding and accounts for the impact of agricultural land use and management on soil properties and functions, and related ecosystem services. For this purpose, >30 long-term experimental field trials in the EU and China will be analysed to derive regulating principles for integration in SQAPP. SQAPP will be developed using a multi-actor approach aiming at facilitating social innovation and providing options to land users for cost-effective agricultural management activities to enhance soil quality and crop productivity. SQAPP will be tested extensively in 14 dedicated Case Study Sites in the EU and China covering a wide spectrum of farming systems and pedo-climatic zones, and rolled-out across the continents thereafter. Within the Case Study sites a range of alternative agricultural practices will be selected, implemented and evaluated with regard to effects on improving soil quality and crop productivity. Proven practices will be evaluated for their potential applicability at EU and China levels, and to assess the related soil environmental footprint under current and future agricultural trends and various agricultural policy scenarios. How the soil quality tool can be utilized for different policy purposes, e.g. in cross compliance and agro-environmental measures, will also be investigated and demonstrated. A comprehensive dissemination and communication strategy, including a web-based information portal, will ensure that project results are available to a variety of stakeholders at the right time and in appropriate formats to enhance soil quality and productivity in the EU and China.", 300122.0, 5772950.0, "iSQAPER", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ieep.eu", null, "h2020_193347_998734893"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2SA", "Translation of Six Literary Novels into English", "RANDOM HOUSE GROUP LTD", 23783.0, "For this project, we have selected six literary works of excellence that we feel will add real value and contribute to the cultural riches available to European citizens. These works have each been carefully chosen through a rigorous and highly selective editorial process for their outstanding literary merit and their universal qualities, which allow them to transcend local and national interests. We will work with the most reputable and experienced literary translators to ensure that their excellence is upheld in the English-language editions.We believe passionately that these literary works will lead to meaningful inter-cultural dialogue and reach readers and EU citizens. We will ensure that these translated books reach as many readers as possible through expert, award-winning design, production, and publicity, marketing, and sales distribution. In 2012 Harvill Secker was awarded Imprint of the Year by the UK Bookseller Industry Book Awards, attesting to the high levels of success and expertise we bring to our publishing projects. Moreover, our English translations will be used by US publishers and by other European publishers as a springboard for translations into further European languages and will therefore ensure they reach readers in territories beyond the UK. In this way, our project will play a key role in opening up access to literary works for transnational circulation of European works on an international scale.", null, "RANDOM HOUSE GROUP LTD", "creative_552782-CREA-1-2014-1-UK-CULT-LIT1_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1HU", "MINERAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION LBG*MPA", 395.0, "Other management expenditure (07.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_25070", 2016], ["1RB", "INSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, LONDON LBG*IEEP", 236027.0, "Supporting better environmental governance and information at all levels (07.02.03)", "fts_2016_36466", 2016], ["1RB", "INSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, LONDON LBG*IEEP", 221267.0, "Halting and reversing biodiversity loss (07.02.02)", "fts_2016_36919", 2016], ["1RB", "INSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, LONDON LBG*IEEP", 97138.0, "Contributing to a greener and more resource-efficient economy and to the development and implementation of Union environmental policy and legislation (07.02.01)", "fts_2016_47199", 2016], ["1RB", "INSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, LONDON LBG*IEEP", 81144.0, "Supporting better environmental governance and information at all levels (07.02.03)", "fts_2016_49182", 2016], ["1RB", "INSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, LONDON LBG*IEEP", 20248.0, "Contributing to a greener and more resource-efficient economy and to the development and implementation of Union environmental policy and legislation (07.02.01)", "fts_2016_66865", 2016], ["1AE", "THE PRESS ASSOCIATION LIMITED*", 13912.0, "Buildings and related expenditure \u2014 Commission Representations (16.01.03.03)", "fts_2016_70423", 2016], ["1RB", "INSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, LONDON LBG*IEEP", 80413.0, "Securing sufficient supplies of safe, healthy and high quality food and other bio-based products (08.02.03.02)", "fts_2017_6452", 2017], ["1RB", "INSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, LONDON LBG*IEEP", 787.0, "Other management expenditure (05.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_18577", 2017], ["1RB", "INSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, LONDON LBG*IEEP", 478389.0, "Halting and reversing biodiversity loss (07.02.02)", "fts_2017_29561", 2017], ["1RB", "MEDIA DIVERSITY", 81141.0, "Promoting non-discrimination and equality (33.02.02)", "fts_2017_31948", 2017], ["1RB", "YOUTH BUSINESS INTERNATIONAL", 49980.0, "Promoting entrepreneurship and improving the competitiveness and access to markets of Union enterprises (02.02.01)", "fts_2017_34783", 2017], ["1RB", "INSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, LONDON LBG*IEEP", 260782.0, "Halting and reversing biodiversity loss (07.02.02)", "fts_2017_36679", 2017], ["1RB", "INSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, LONDON LBG*IEEP", 237717.0, "Halting and reversing biodiversity loss (07.02.02)", "fts_2017_37418", 2017], ["1RB", "INSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, LONDON LBG*IEEP", 137140.0, "Supporting better environmental governance and information at all levels (07.02.03)", "fts_2017_43640", 2017], ["1RB", "INSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, LONDON LBG*IEEP", 112259.0, "Contributing to a greener and more resource-efficient economy and to the development and implementation of Union environmental policy and legislation (07.02.01)", "fts_2017_46443", 2017], ["1AA", "MITTEL CONSULTING LTD", 86353.0, "Communication of the Commission Representations, Citizens\u2019 Dialogues and \u2018Partnership\u2019 actions (16.03.01.04)", "fts_2017_49553", 2017], ["1RB", "INSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, LONDON LBG*IEEP", 60905.0, "Halting and reversing biodiversity loss (07.02.02)", "fts_2017_53512", 2017], ["1AE", "THE PRESS ASSOCIATION LIMITED*", 15247.0, "Buildings and related expenditure \u2014 Commission Representations (16.01.03.03)", "fts_2017_68114", 2017], ["1RB", "INSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, LONDON LBG*IEEP", 15046.0, "European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) \u2014 Operational technical assistance (13.03.65.01)", "fts_2017_68397", 2017], ["1AA", "MITTEL CONSULTING LTD", 13912.0, "Communication of the Commission Representations, Citizens\u2019 Dialogues and \u2018Partnership\u2019 actions (16.03.01.04)", "fts_2017_68979", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "SW1V"}
