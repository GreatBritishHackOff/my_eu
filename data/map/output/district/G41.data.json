It\u2019s based on a previous detection of the teachers\u2019 training needs in our school and it seeks for the inclusion of training, evaluative and innovative activities. In order to prioritize,  and make sure that the above mentioned needs are taken into account and included in our training programme, our school counts on the help of the Department for National and International Plans and Programmes.\r\n This Department, in an attempt to give an answer to the training needs, seeks for the participation in programmes such as Erasmus+ Ka1 since we think that this kind of programme is a guarantee for us to get the objectives related to the previously detected needs. \r\n\r\nAt IES Chaves Nogales, we are constantly doing our best to improve the quality of teaching since we know well that it affects considerably students\u2019 learning and outcome. As teachers too, we  constantly keep in mind the importance of giving an answer to our students\u2019 needs. They  are very important and valuable for us and in this sense, we usually need to go beyond making reports or using statistics.\r\nOur main goal is that students are able to manage by themselves in their social world. For that reason, we have developed some work strategies which take into consideration the following: collaborative team work, the library as an element for cultural dissemination, the necessary involvement of students\u2019 families in the school library and the use of social networks as a tool for communication within an educational environment.\r\n\r\nConsequently, by taking into account all the strategies mentioned above, we have detected that those activities which are susceptible to some kind of improvement in our school can be divided into three main areas of interest. They are the following:\r\n\r\nWorking collaboratively in the planning,  elaboration and development  of Content Units. Also, the collaborative implementation of projects and activities by students\u2019 families, teachers , pupils, scientific community, social agents, etc.\r\nRevitalising and dynamizing the library by supplying it with new formats and communication systems so that it may be transformed into a MEDIA LIBRARY.        Also carrying out regular activities which contribute to the dissemination of culture and the full  integration of the whole school community members.\r\nFostering social competence and strategies for good and effective communication when using social networks, including the e-twinning platform. In both cases, under the framework of interdisciplinary learning contexts, the efficient use of language as a means of communication achieves a special relevance.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding  teachers\u2019 training needs, the most notorious are those which would allow us to conceive Learning communities as a feasible reality in our educational environment. Last but not least important is the challenge of transforming our Library in a \u201csource of resources\u201d, a real Media library , which would become a central axis for the search of knowledge in our school or a starting point from which any search of knowledge would be carried out. In this sense the library would encourage multidirectional communication among all the members of the school community.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo finish, in the next school year training period, we will keep on pursuing our objectives by sharing the acquired experience and by inviting other colleagues to participate in a seminary dealing with the different areas of interest established in our project. Furthermore, the project could also become extensive to other schools which could be interested in it, including the Primary schools usually assigned to our school.\r\n\r\nIn addition, our school blog and our profile in some social networking services such as Twitter- also linked to the blog- will be constantly updated. This will allow us to disseminate in an open and extensive way our already acquired experience and knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe IES Chaves Nogales has always proved its willingness to internationalize the teaching process as it has successfully demonstrated with the creation of the Department for National and International Plans and Programmes. Thanks to this Department the innovative knowledge and information acquired during the mobility and European cooperation period will also be disseminated through the different didactic programmings. Some relevant and innovative methodological guidelines will be stated in them in order to orientate the teaching and learning process.", "http://www.craigholme.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-036547_2"], ["3TR", "Stadt N\u00fcrnberg - Internationalisierung des Beruflichen Schulwesens", "EAL Service, Education, Glasgow City Council", 171014.0, "The overall goal of the City of Nuremberg is the europeanization and internationalization of its dual system of vocational training. Currently different models exist at each school which are not connected and intertwined with each other. There is much room for synergy effects and improvement. \r\nIn an initial phase schools without experience in Leonardo da Vinci projekts will get the chance to offer their students and graduates the opportunity to spend some time of their training/apprenticeship abroad through BS-NBG-EU. For this proposal we define three relevant target groups: students, graduates and teaching staff. During the project period of two years students and graduates will be sent abraod in small groups. The  students get the chance tomake contact with new cultures and its people. They can experience the differences between worklife in Germany and other countries.\r\nAt a later stage the department for vocational schools helps the EU-coordinators when it comes to submitting their own project proposals. We offer advice and organisational support. \r\nNext to this the vocational education staff (i.e. staff in charge of EU projects or staff from companies responsible for training) will have the opportunity to spend a work stay abroad in a European country. For improving the Europeanization of the Nuremberg vocational training system it is crucial to include this target group in the proposal. They can multiply their gained expereniences within their school/company.\r\nThe objective of each work stay varies, depending on the stage of the partnership between the vocational school in Nuremberg and the foreign partner. Major aims are:\r\n- Study stay to gain job-specific and expert experience .\r\n- Initiation of new contacts and agreements on details for possible new mobility projects. \r\n\r\nThe project implementation is launched by the Department for Vocational schools at the City of Nuremberg.

The result of this first expected edition for the period 2017-2018 and the jointly sending and hosting of young people in Marseille and its partner cities, should implement new relationships which can be expanded during the following years.

The OECD ciphers the unemployment of the youngsters aged 15 to 24 at a rate of more than 20% in the European Union in 2015; the opportunities of mobility aim as well the remobilization of young people, to give or to give back to them confidence into themselves, to make them increase their autonomy, to make them discover a new field of activities as well as a new manner to learn by means of non-formal education. One of the project\u2019s goals is that the majority of the participants take part in a training after their EVS or find a job. In this sense \u201cTwin\u2019Go\u201d integrates itself perfectly into the values and logic of our association. \r\n\r\nIn a political context of a growing defensive identity process within the European Union, specifically in our Region, we wish thanks to Twin\u2019Go to promote the intercultural dialogue, the approach among the people and to fight against discriminations and exclusion. \r\nAs a consequence, by means of this project young people shall be motivated to actively take part, to receive motivation in order to become involved even after having returned, especially on the local level and thus to contribute as actual ambassadors promoting the intercultural dialogue.", "http://www.xchangescotland.org", null, "erasmus_2017-2-FR02-KA105-013316_1"], ["1BA", "Agents of Change", "XCHANGE SCOTLAND", 40714.0, "\u201cAgents of Change\u201d is a project containing series of 2 training courses, held in Doln\u00ed Sokolovec, Czech Republic and Holl\u00f3k\u0151, Hungary, 9 days each, dates Dates: 7-17 June 2018 and 13-23 September 2018 (9 days excluding arrival and departure days).

To reflect the role of leadership and explore participants\u2019 own attitudes, approach and inner motivation of their work with volunteering.\r\n2.  To improve and boost the practical skills of the participants for working with groups and projects in volunteering.\r\n3.  To put participants\u2019 experience into practice and multiply among their colleagues and target groups.\r\n \r\nBoth trainings will consist of 3 parts reflecting the overall objectives. The 1st part will be self-reflective, focused on self-awareness. The participants will be guided by methods of coaching to sensitize their own approach and attitudes regarding leadership, reflect on their behaviour, characteristics and inner motivation. For the purposes of our project, we will closely connect this attitude reflection with leadership in projects (in positions of campleaders, coordinators etc.) and will use it as essential base for the second, practical part of the trainings. The second, practical part of the 1st training will be focused on coaching and mentoring methods in supporting the groups; the 2nd training will focus its second part on team and project management. Third part of both trainings will contain creating action plans for implementing the experience in practice as well as will provide space to share the participants\u2019 ideas and create new international projects with other participants.\r\n \r\nMain target group of both trainings are campleaders (youth leaders of international voluntary projects, so called workcamps), but the trainings are intented also for youth (junior) trainers, experienced volunteers and staff members of partner organisations.\r\n \r\nMethods used during the trainings:\r\n- structured exercises, outdoor, dance, theatre, art,\r\n- debriefings on learning outcomes\r\n- self-directed learning according to participants\u2019\u2019 goals and YouthPass\r\n- daily reflection in groups, journal-keeping, mid-term and final interactive and creative evaluation\r\n- outdoor training\r\n- simulations\r\n- facilitated discussions and group work\r\n- information sessions, interactive presentations\r\n- practical exercises\r\n \r\nMain output of the training is the toolkit, describing both training modules, which are piloted in this project. It will be distributed in the international voluntary networks and among other stakeholders to assure sustainability of both module and to possibly start a strategic development regarding the training of campleaders on international level.", "http://www.xchangescotland.org", null, "erasmus_2017-2-CZ01-KA105-035749_4"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1AQ", "XCHANGE SCOTLAND", 4465.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European youth area and the participation of young people in European democratic life (15.02.01.02)", "fts_2016_44524", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "G41"}
