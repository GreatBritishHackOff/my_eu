The approach is radical and brave and the new vessels can be introduced quickly, cost-efficient and without affecting current infrastructure. The battery powered, low wake wash, fast and efficient air supported craft will deliver a climate friendly waterborne travel choice across Europe. Feasibility will be demonstrated by means of a fully operational research and testing platform, to be trial operated under real life conditions with end users onboard to determine the market- and customers reactions. The new transport system can contribute to reduce traffic congestions and improve traffic flow in and around cities and densely populated areas with water way access. The operational research platform will be a vital tool to accomplish a quick and effective dissemination of project results and pave way for the new, capable zero emission waterborne alternative.\nTo achieve the demanding main goal of demonstrating feasibility and market acceptance for the new solution, a holistic approach taking advantage of new and emerging technologies from the maritime- and other sectors will be used.\nThe proposed project meets all key EU objectives related to greening, CO2 emission, innovation and request for transport solutions able to meet future requirements.", 31159.0, 2581416.0, "BB GREEN", "Ship hulls that ride on a cushion of air", "An EU-funded project is unveiling an innovative and competitive waterborne transport solution with zero emissions, opening up a new world of possibilities for efficient electrically propelled vessels.", "Numerous European cities exploit closed waterways and ferries to move passengers and goods within the local environment. Conventional ferries employ so-called all-wet hulls in which the entire hull is in contact with the water. This creates a large surface area for resistance and reduces efficiency and speed.\n\nScientists initiated the EU-funded project 'Battery powered boats, providing greening, resistance reduction, electric, efficient and novelty' (http://www.bbgreen.info/ (BB GREEN)) to develop the next generation of fast, efficient and emission-free commuter ferries for operation in sheltered waters. ASV hulls designed for more demanding operations are also available. The air-supported vessel (ASV) hull is supporting up to 85 % of full-load displacement on a cushion of pressurised air created with a lift fan system. The new ASV technology can reduce hull water resistance by 40 %.\n\nThe prototype will undergo extensive testing. For the follow up of the project the BB GREEN partners plan a European \u201cdissemination road show\u201d with the prototype vessel.\n\nTo reduce the vessel weight and boost overall efficiency BB GREEN vessels will have a carbon construction. Diesel engines are being replaced with battery electric drivelines for eco-friendly commuting. The lithium-titanate battery capacity will be 400 kilowatt-hours, sufficient to operate at design speeds of 30 knots for about 14 nautical miles between recharging. The zero-emission commuter ferry will be the first-ever 30-knots-fast ASV ferry.\n\nEfficient contra-rotating pod propulsion systems will secure high efficiency, excellent manoeuvrability and on-board safety.\n\nA full-scale ASV is under construction, and once completed it will be thoroughly tested. Battery electric drivelines and the lift fan system are also under construction. The BB GREEN team will then document performance and capabilities under typical operational conditions.\n\nThe new transport system will contribute to reducing traffic congestion in cities with inland waterways, with considerable environmental benefits. Press coverage and several articles disseminated project findings. The team has also participated in numerous conferences and exhibitions.", null, "http://www.amberjac-projects.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/157231.jpg", "fp7_99255_989924092"], ["6SF", "Biocontamination Integrated cOntrol of Wet sYstems for Space Exploration", "Aquisense Technologies (Europe) Limited", "Microbiological contamination can be attenuated, never eliminated. Space exploration requires development of reliable rapid significant and safe methods for preventing, monitoring and control the biocontamination within manned closed environments. These methods have to be automated, simple and conceived to decrease the (re-)supply mass from ground.\nBoth space and terrestrial monitoring and prevention/mitigation methods are currently working separately instead of working in synergy. The proposed BIOWYSE project foresees development and demonstration of an integrated system suitable for future accommodation aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and from a long-term viewpoint, within Moon and Mars habitats. The BIOWYSE consortium will design, build and test single prevention, monitoring and mitigation modules. Thus, they will be integrated in a single system inside a compact breadboard and tested. Critical aspects or gravity-dependent technologies of the breadboard will be designed with the perspective of a future accommodation within a rack of the ISS (e.g.: in EDR-2 of Columbus), as a precursor of elements for long-duration space missions and future planetary outposts (e.g. Mars). In order to validate key technologies for the biocontamination control integrated system in real conditions and with representative features, the BIOWYSE project is based on the following major objectives:\n1. Exploitation of ISS data from recent project related to the system functionalities\n2. Designing single modules taking into account the intent of a demonstration aboard an International Standard Payload Rack \n3. Building a system in order to test integrated key technologies \n4. Developing and demonstrating operational techniques and processes for preventing, monitoring and mitigating the microbiological risk in water loops \n5.
