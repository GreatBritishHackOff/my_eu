The battery powered, low wake wash, fast and efficient air supported craft will deliver a climate friendly waterborne travel choice across Europe. Feasibility will be demonstrated by means of a fully operational research and testing platform, to be trial operated under real life conditions with end users onboard to determine the market- and customers reactions. The new transport system can contribute to reduce traffic congestions and improve traffic flow in and around cities and densely populated areas with water way access. The operational research platform will be a vital tool to accomplish a quick and effective dissemination of project results and pave way for the new, capable zero emission waterborne alternative.\nTo achieve the demanding main goal of demonstrating feasibility and market acceptance for the new solution, a holistic approach taking advantage of new and emerging technologies from the maritime- and other sectors will be used.\nThe proposed project meets all key EU objectives related to greening, CO2 emission, innovation and request for transport solutions able to meet future requirements.", 31159.0, 2581416.0, "BB GREEN", "Ship hulls that ride on a cushion of air", "An EU-funded project is unveiling an innovative and competitive waterborne transport solution with zero emissions, opening up a new world of possibilities for efficient electrically propelled vessels.", "Numerous European cities exploit closed waterways and ferries to move passengers and goods within the local environment. Conventional ferries employ so-called all-wet hulls in which the entire hull is in contact with the water. This creates a large surface area for resistance and reduces efficiency and speed.\n\nScientists initiated the EU-funded project 'Battery powered boats, providing greening, resistance reduction, electric, efficient and novelty' (http://www.bbgreen.info/ (BB GREEN)) to develop the next generation of fast, efficient and emission-free commuter ferries for operation in sheltered waters. ASV hulls designed for more demanding operations are also available. The air-supported vessel (ASV) hull is supporting up to 85 % of full-load displacement on a cushion of pressurised air created with a lift fan system. The new ASV technology can reduce hull water resistance by 40 %.\n\nThe prototype will undergo extensive testing. For the follow up of the project the BB GREEN partners plan a European \u201cdissemination road show\u201d with the prototype vessel.\n\nTo reduce the vessel weight and boost overall efficiency BB GREEN vessels will have a carbon construction. Diesel engines are being replaced with battery electric drivelines for eco-friendly commuting. The lithium-titanate battery capacity will be 400 kilowatt-hours, sufficient to operate at design speeds of 30 knots for about 14 nautical miles between recharging. The zero-emission commuter ferry will be the first-ever 30-knots-fast ASV ferry.\n\nEfficient contra-rotating pod propulsion systems will secure high efficiency, excellent manoeuvrability and on-board safety.\n\nA full-scale ASV is under construction, and once completed it will be thoroughly tested. Battery electric drivelines and the lift fan system are also under construction. The BB GREEN team will then document performance and capabilities under typical operational conditions.\n\nThe new transport system will contribute to reducing traffic congestion in cities with inland waterways, with considerable environmental benefits.

The country that they visit will be dependent on their course of study and supports the curriculum delivery, ensuring that participants have gained the necessary theory and practical experience to be effective within a work experience placement. \r\n\r\nStudents are required to undertake a period of work experience as part of their vocational qualification and these tend to be carried out and assessed in small businesses in the town of Grantham. Participating in this mobility project will provide evidence to contribute to this element of their qualification and meet some of their development needs in terms of widening their knowledge and appreciation of diversity and understanding of different socio-economic backgrounds,promoting an appreciation of European values and a respect for other cultures. It will also add value to their programmes by providing 'real life' work experience & address some of the problems with progression to Level 3 programmes  where skills/theory learnt at Level 2 are not sufficiently embedded  through real work experience therefore students struggle with practical application of knowledge in Level 3. This project will be promoted to apprentices, students and graduates in the identified vocational areas\r\nFor those on apprenticeship programmes, it will provide the opportunity to gain work experience in another country.  As a result of participating in the project students will be better placed within the job market and have increased self confidence & improved soft skills eg motivation, communication and budgeting.

The purpose of the project constitutes practical trial of the professional knowledge that was gained during school studies, acquisition of new abilities in the scope of new techniques and work approaches for hotels and tourism centres.\r\nSustainable development of our region requires better and more developed  work methods, particularly for the sectors of specific developing character as, for instance, creation of modern hotel and tourism base. It also makes considerable possibilities to perfect knowledge of the branch foreign language (English, German, Italian or Spanish), application of modern reservation systems, new approaches to proposals of a guest's free time organization, use of given facilities, quality certification processes investigation in the hotel industry (ISO and HACCP)and to know many different aspects of hotel activities in European Union.\r\nProject will be  launched in 2017-2019. The Partners committed themselves to host and  take care of some multi-personal groups of beneficiaries  in subsequent months of the project implementation, since September 2017 till August 2019.

The main part of the internship will follow cultural, behavioral and professional linguistic training. For the participants will be also organized a sign language course. Beneficiaries attend the training under our school guardian - who is a teacher of our school. 7 guardians are included in this project: 2 for UK, 2 in Spain, 1 for Italy and  2 for Austria, one guardian takes care of one visiting group. Due to specific working conditions in the hotel and tourism industry and restrictions referring to the quantity of the beneficiaries holding simultaneously internship in the hotel, the groups leaving for particular partners will include 6  to 10  persons each.\r\nPermanent development of hotel and tourism services is connected with the requirement to shape practical abilities on the highest level. The states where our partners are headquartered the mentioned services are considerably developed.  It means that the beneficiaries will gain opportunity to improve and upgrade  their skills in the framework of the abilities that are currently more and more searched  on the labour market in connection with upgrading knowledge of professional English, German, Italian and Spanish. Meaningful aspect of the practice constitutes knowledge of new manners and rules of rendering hotel and tourism services in European Union, developing  abilities to apply new reservation systems, creation different possibilities and  ways of client\u2019s free time animation, perfection of professional expressions in foreign languages.

We want to go outside of our comfort zone and to analyse in more detail and acquire added skills and knowledge on how to be more inclusive and combat discrimination. We want our organisation to be more inclusive and we believe that this can be better achieved if we truly understand that is discrimination, take time reflect on how really inclusive are our practices and to take action.\r\n\r\nThus, through this training we aim to reach the following objectives;\r\n- Acquire in-depth understanding of what is discrimination by starting by identifying what are prejudices and how these can turn into discrimination with particular focus on discrimination faced by refugees\r\n- Be able to differentiate between direct and indirect discrimination\r\n- Listen to real-life experiences of refugees; so that we can understand better the ordeal they have to go through and what kind of discrimination they experience\r\n- Share best practices from other local NGOs and also from projects carried out from the other partners\r\n- Reflect on how inclusive are our organisations\r\n- Plan pro-active measures that increase and enhance inclusion and combat discrimination\r\n\r\nPushing Boundaries is a 7 day training course which will take place in Malta from the 22-28 October 2017.

This is because of the so positive results we got in the movilities of the previous years. In fact, the degree of satisfaction of the students who participated in the last call of that project was very high. \r\nIES LA GUANCHA, would participate as a promoter in this project as a promoter partner with eight students who at present are in the learning process of Middle-Level Vocational Studies offered at our school. Also, we would like them to have the possibility to go with an accompanying teacher at least during the first week of their stay in the receiving country. We think this is really necessary since, due to the ultraperipheral situation of the Canary Islands, there are students who have never travelled abroad and, therefore, they have not practice travelling or solving the inconveniences that they could have during the first days of their stay in another country and with the difficulties of English because they are in CFGM. We also apply for 1 teacher place for job-shadowing because we consider that this type of experience has a positive impact  since the teacher can contribute with  new ideas and experiences acquired that favours our educational community.\r\n          We want to develop a three-weeks programme consisting of one flow to the United Kingdom. That mobility would be to the city of Grantham with the possibility of changing the final destination depending on the disponibility of the receiving partner or the possible participation of new partners. In the mobility, there would participate 2 students from Administratitive Management Vocational Studies, 2 students from Commercial Activities Vocational Studies, 2 students from Installation of Systems and Telecommunication Vocational Studies and 2 students from Video Disk Jockey and Sound Vocational Studies although the number of students of each branch of Vocational Studies could vary depending on the number of applications.  The mobility will be held between April and June 2018 depending on a previous agreement between both centres.\r\n          The working plan would be mainly practical since the idea is that the students who are in 2\u00ba year of Vocational Studies can do a part of their practical period of FCT in placements previously selected and related to the areas of competence of their Vocational Studies, in the city of Grantham, United Kingdom.\r\n          Our main objective is to ease the participation of our students in the ERASMUS+ projects. This way, they can have experiences that can provide them with a better access to the labour market. The geographical situation means a disadvantage in relation to other European students.  Living in an ultraperipheral area means and added handicap to travel to other countries in order to look for a job. \r\n          Besides, we want to improve our students\u2019 individual skills and competences. This will be achieved with their placement in companies. By doing that, they will acquire knowledge of new working methods,  the use of new technologies of information and communication technology (ICT) as well as the improvement of our students\u2019 linguistic skills in English. That will allow them a better access to the labour market, both in the Canary Islands and in Europe.\r\n          The experience of IES LA GUANCHA in the promotion and development of the ERASMUS+ project during the last years guarantees the satisfying achievement for next project. Moreover, it means not only an important individual and professional impact on the students and teachers participating in the project, but also on all the members of both centres (IES LA GUANCHA y GRANTHAM COLLEGE). It is very important the spreading of the results of the project. We organized a meeting with the students interested in the project and one of them came to talk to them. Some of those students shot a video where they talk about their experience and we have seen at the centre. This year we have a cultural week at the school when the Erasmus+ project will be widely spread by means of media (posters, leaflets, newspapers, tv, radio, last project\u00b4s experience video...).\r\n          To sum up, we have participated in the ERASMUS+ project with the active collaboration of Grantham College since 2012. For that reason, we would like to continue with that collaboration not only for this project but also for future ones. Our project wants to guarantee, strengthen and have continuity in collaboration with the Grantham College or other partners.  For this purpose, we have joined some european websites to contact new partners and to assure the continuity and expansion of our mobilities. It is important to underline that the aim of the present project is mainly to achieve quality. For this reason, we have kept the number of participants (8 students) and we have applied for 1 accompanying teacher and 1 job-shadowing teacher.", "http://www.grantham.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA116-036477_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NG31"}
