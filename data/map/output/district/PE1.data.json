Fault is defined as any deterioration of the functional profile of informational system, the volumetric profile, and  the security profile<br/>- Support for a reconfiguration as an efficient system<br/>The primary objective of GEMOM is to research, develop and deploy a prototype of a messaging platform that is evolutionary, self-organising, self healing, scalable and secure. GEMOM will be resilient and be able to utilise redundant modules (hot-swap or switchover) instantly without information loss. These resilience features will allow specialist, independent system actors, viz. watch-dogs, security and situation monitors, routers, and other optimisers, to remove or replace compromised nodes from the broader network instantly without compromising higher level functionality.<br/>GEMOM considers the Publish-Subscribe variant of Message Oriented Middleware to be the predominant one and will focus on issues surrounding that kind of messaging. For completeness GEMOM would provide a synchronous Request and Reply overlay as well. <br/>The advances that GEMOM proposes to make to the area of messaging revolve around the notion of a 'fault'.

The new models will account for the effect of extreme pressure and temperature developing instantaneously at the time of bubble collapse.

They have to carry out a four weeks\u2019 work experience in a British firm where they will work on administrative tasks, adapted to their professional and English levels. This training period will be preceded by a time of linguistic, cultural and professional integration in order to help them to feel more secure and to adapt to a new way of living and working in a foreign environment.\r\n\r\nDuring the 7 mobility projects done in partnership with EUROSTAFF, our partner has selected the different firms with much care, keeping in mind the professional abilities and English level of our students. To date we are really satisfied with the fact that the firms are very often the same (small and medium-size firms, schools, charities, administrative organizations...) which is a guarantee of their strong involvement in the training of young foreigners.\r\nOur students have progressively been learning about their future jobs for the last 2 years thanks to theoretical classes and thanks to their different work experiences in France in firms sometimes having a European or international development (Renault, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, Eurolines, EADS, Autoneum, Bilstein Group, Canon ...).\r\n\r\nWe are expecting the following results and impacts for this 10th mobility project to come:\r\n* Concerning the students:\r\n- the development of their professional abilities,\r\n- a fluency in English,\r\n- a cultural opening, a European citizenship,\r\n- the development of their maturity and autonomy,\r\n- personal development,\r\n- a personal satisfaction to have achieved such a project,\r\n- a higher motivation to obtain the BTEC National and the European grade,\r\n- the opportunity to continue higher level education after obtaining the BTEC,\r\n- good, and even, excellent results at the exam and at the \"European English grade\", \r\n- more higher-education perspectives,\r\n- the awareness of the importance of the work experience in England, the \u201cEuropass Mobility\u201d, and the \u201cEuroMobipro qualification) on the work market,\r\n- the awareness of the financial support from the European program Erasmus+ and the interest in the youths\u2019 language and vocational training,\r\nOur results from the first mobility project:\r\n- from 2009 to 2016 (8 groups): 71 candidates = 67 passed their BTEC National (most with a good grade) = 94%,\r\n- from 2009 to 2016 (8 groups): 71 candidates = 52 European mentions = 73.24%.\r\n* In the school:\r\n- an improved status of the vocational section and of the school,\r\n- the mobilization of skills for the success of our students,\r\n- the development of interdisciplinarity,\r\n- the experience and abilities acquired by the teams whose work is enhanced by the project.\r\n* Out of the school:\r\n- an improved status of the perception of the European section in the vocational section and of the school,\r\n- enhancement of the vocational studies and internationalisation of students\u2019 trainings,\r\n- better chances for our students to be hired due to their qualifications,\r\n- our school may help other schools which want to open a European section,\r\n- reinforcement of the cooperation with the LEA and county council.", "http://www.worldschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036269_4"], ["1PX", "Mobilit\u00e9 en Europe : un atout professionnel et personnel", "Venom clothing ltd", 11465.0, "Henri Poincar\u00e9 Vocational high-school for Trade and Social Care careers, located in Palaiseau, Essonne (91), is a public educational institution attended by students who mainly come from junior high school. For some, the option of a vocational career is imposed because of the difficulties they face in general education subjects including foreign languages. Teachers are often faced with the problem of motivation, Through the mobility abroad, this European curriculum is a means of involving these students in a mobilizing project which enables them to acquire skills and autonomy that are necessary for their success.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur project\r\nWe are applying for 20 grants for National BTECH in Retail Management for students who will have internal work experience abroad during the academic years of 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 (10 students in 2017/2018 and 10 students in 2018/2019) Lyc\u00e9e Poincar\u00e9 has been organizing mobilities abroad for the European section \u2018Secr\u00e9tariat\u2019 for several years. Given the positive feedback of this section, we have set up mobility projects in the Retail Management department for the years 2011/2012, 2013/2014, 2014/2015, 2015/2016 and 2016/2017. These projects having been accepted, similarly to our application for the European section, we are applying for a new project for the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 academic years.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Description\r\nThe mobility will take place in Peterborough, England and will be organized in 4 or 5 preparatory days and a 4-week internship. The first days are devoted to a progressive discovery of the environment before joining the host company, in which a tutor will be responsible for the participants.\r\nWe will travel on the Eurostar and students will stay with their host families. The allocation of families and businesses is organized by a local provider who also closely supervises the trainees with the educational team and in accordance to the previously approved specifications. This project involves the various members of staff of our school: the head teacher, the accountant, and the educational teams of the relevant classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe objectives notably involve the professional aspect as the project is primarily a linguistic enhancement in connection with the vocational training, but they also go beyond this aim. They bring a cultural aspect through the discovery of a way of life and a different environment. And finally, building up personal confidence in our students is the underlying objective of our project as it allows them to develop self-confidence, autonomy and thus helps them to mature.\r\n\r\nOur requirements\r\nOur students belong to families who mainly come from disadvantaged or underprivileged backgrounds. The financial aspect of the mobility is therefore important, hence the need to obtain funding from Erasmus+ in correspondence with that of the High School and of the Ile-de-France Region.\r\n\r\nPredicted Outcome\r\nThe internal training period done as part of the mobility will be taken into account for the Baccalaur\u00e9at degree. It is therefore assessed by teachers at the place of mobility. Regarding the foreign language assessment in the exam, the evaluation methods which are now being oriented towards oral practice and the skills acquired through the mobility will provide a concrete basis for the preparation of this exam. Because our students are enrolled in the European section, they will take a specific oral exam (which lasts 20 minutes, preceded by a 20-minute preparation time). According to their results, they can obtain a special European grade in the Baccalaur\u00e9at. In addition, each participant will receive a personalized Europass mobility at the end of their training period. In the perspective of professional integration, the skills acquired by students reflect the European dimension in their training. Finally, the European aspect of the project is an undeniable added value for the participants: our students will be able to \"experience Europe\" explicitly.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036690_1"], ["4DZ", "Adult Education in Europe", "Peterborough Regional College", 15874.0, "ROC de Leijgraaf aspires to provide everyone in north east Brabant with opportunities in the employment market.
