Fault is defined as any deterioration of the functional profile of informational system, the volumetric profile, and  the security profile<br/>- Support for a reconfiguration as an efficient system<br/>The primary objective of GEMOM is to research, develop and deploy a prototype of a messaging platform that is evolutionary, self-organising, self healing, scalable and secure. GEMOM will be resilient and be able to utilise redundant modules (hot-swap or switchover) instantly without information loss. These resilience features will allow specialist, independent system actors, viz. watch-dogs, security and situation monitors, routers, and other optimisers, to remove or replace compromised nodes from the broader network instantly without compromising higher level functionality.<br/>GEMOM considers the Publish-Subscribe variant of Message Oriented Middleware to be the predominant one and will focus on issues surrounding that kind of messaging.

The allocation of families and businesses is organized by a local provider who also closely supervises the trainees with the educational team and in accordance to the previously approved specifications. This project involves the various members of staff of our school: the head teacher, the accountant, and the educational teams of the relevant classes.ObjectivesThe objectives notably involve the professional aspect as the project is primarily a linguistic enhancement in connection with the vocational training, but they also go beyond this aim. They bring a cultural aspect through the discovery of a way of life and a different environment. And finally, building up personal confidence in our students is the underlying objective of our project as it allows them to develop self-confidence, autonomy and thus helps them to mature.Our requirementsOur students belong to families who mainly come from disadvantaged or underprivileged backgrounds. The financial aspect of the mobility is therefore important, hence the need to obtain funding from Erasmus+ in correspondence with that of the High School and of the Ile-de-France Region.Predicted OutcomeThe internal training period done as part of the mobility will be taken into account for the Baccalaur\u00e9at degree. It is therefore assessed by teachers at the place of mobility. Regarding the foreign language assessment in the exam, the evaluation methods which are now being oriented towards oral practice and the skills acquired through the mobility will provide a concrete basis for the preparation of this exam. Because our students are enrolled in the European section, they will take a specific oral exam (which lasts 20 minutes, preceded by a 20-minute preparation time). According to their results, they can obtain a special European grade in the Baccalaur\u00e9at. In addition, each participant will receive a personalized Europass mobility at the end of their training period. In the perspective of professional integration, the skills acquired by students reflect the European dimension in their training. Finally, the European aspect of the project is an undeniable added value for the participants: our students will be able to \"experience Europe\" explicitly.", null, null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA102-022588_1"], ["3TL", "Ideas into action \u2013 entrepreneurship for youth workers", "C24 Education and Development Centre Limited", 14343.0, "Europe is facing a high number of unemployed young people.

The region in which ROC de Leijgraaf is located has large numbers of internationally operating technical, logistic and agricultural businesses that increasingly require young professionals with international experience. ROC de Leijgraaf wants to help fulfill this requirement by offering  its students challenging education, future oriented education.  In order to provide education within this framework we want to offer students the opportunity  to go on international internships and teachers will require supplementary training in an international environment. This is the reason for this application.\r\n\r\nAt ROC de Leijgraaf 4000 young students between the age of 15 and 20 follow vocational education at EQF levels 2, 3 or 4. These young students take full time courses and annually 60 students go on an international work placement (this includes non-subsidized international work placements). ROC de Leijgraaf would like to participate in reaching the goal, that was set by Brussels, of 6% international work placements in 2020. Our target for the next two years is to send 160 students  on an international internship (both subsidized and non-subsidized). We want to achieve this by being a good and transparent organization with clearly identifiable contacts for the students. This means we will not have a collective  international office for the whole organization but rather individual  coordinators in each department who are therefore more recognizable and approachable for the students. In order to achieve this we operate according to a four tier approach. 1. We provide information at the right time; 2. We provide customized supervision in the preparation of the international internship; 3. We provide guidance during the internship and finally 4. We evaluate and process after the internship.\r\nIn addition we adapt our programme to the relevant level of  the student.  We invite higher level students to participate in an individual international work placement whereas lower level students are stimulated to participate in international internships as a group.\r\nIn preparation of the international internships and activities we entered into a partnership with schools in Germany (2), Finland, France and England in September 2016.  A Memorandum of Understanding was signed which included clauses regarding the exchange of students and teachers.\r\n\r\nROC the Leijgraaf has 650 staff members. Annually an average of 20 staff members participate in international supplementary training. However, 50 to 60 staff members are actively involved in international projects. Not only by supervising students during their international work placement but by their involvement in projects in Bosnia, France, USA, Germany, and other countries in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we would like to increase the number of staff members who participate in international supplementary training up to 40. We aim to do so through partnerships. Participating teachers will also have to be prepared to collaborate with colleagues from partner schools in the development of international education.\r\nWith this project we expect to be able to provide students with a more international education and thereby increase their chances on the employment market. Furthermore, we will be able to help regional business fulfil their need for professionals with international experience. Our own staff members will become more flexible in the use of new methodologies and teaching techniques in their lessons and finally we will be contributing towards better relations and understanding in Europe.", "http://www.peterborough.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA102-034958_4"], ["2RA", "La mobilit\u00e9 en Angleterre : un outil essentiel \u00e0 l'insertion professionnelle des \u00e9l\u00e8ves de BAC PRO tertiaire (Gestion Administration).", "Hope into Action: East of England", 16293.0, "This 10th mobility project concerns the 10 European section students in their final year of a BTEC National diploma in Management and Administrative Duties.

A stay abroad promotes foreign language and communication skills of the participants and can therefore also lead to improved academic performance.\r\nIn addition to the professional and language-related skills an increase of the soft skills takes place. In dealing with people from different countries and by staying in a different cultural radius attitudes and behavior can be changed.

Increasing curiosity and change in tolerance behavior have a positive effect on the development of the personality structure.\r\n\r\nAll mobilities have in common that the trainees are performing their internship in private enterprises or public, non-profit organisations.

During the placements, participants gain professional or job-related knowledge and skills taking country-specific characteristics into account.

For the other mobilities the monitoring is being realised by education staff of the respective partner institutions.\r\n\r\nA documentary will be prepared by each trainee afterwards and presented within the respective department.

In practical terms, reinforced assistance will be offered by using specialized structures in supporting the mobility of young people having fewer opportunities through non-formal educational methods. We will work with the Eurocircle association.\r\nWhen they return to France, the participants of the project will pass on their experience, enhancing the project within the school.  They will thus act as spokesmen for European mobility, inspiring the desire and motivation to their peers. Pupils will use European certificates (Europass CV) and will receive a Europass Mobility and Mobility credits.\r\nGIP FCIP, the project initiator, will facilitate administrative and financial procedures in partnership with the schools financial management services. The DAREIC will coordinate the preparation, mentoring, implementation and enhancement of mobility activities of each school working together with the PACA Region. The consortium members will put into effect various activities and will be a source of inspiration via a mentoring scheme and the establishment of a collaborative platform named M@gist\u00e8re.\r\nExperiences and skills gained by expert teams will help mentor new educational teams. This project will facilitate the sharing of knowledge, good practice and collaboration with the aim of improving the quality of international mobility across the consortium partners.\r\nThe DAREIC would also like to create a network of local businesses that would improve the quality of the work placements. The local businesses would work with us to identify businesses in Europe thanks to their subsidiaries or customers. The Region is a stakeholder in the creation of this network with a progressive involvement over the long term. \r\nThe objective of this project is to provide these young people with the opportunity to experiment mobility in order to widen their future employment horizons. This could be achieved through the dissemination of information, personalized pre-departure coaching and by making the most of the experience gained thus creating the conditions for success within schools.\r\nGIP-FCIP, DAREIC and Region will work as a steering committee that will evaluate and measure the impact of the project, in order to develop a strategy to improve practices as well as the quality of mobility and capitalize on acquired experiences. \r\nThe impacts of this project are numerous. This experience will be a structured step in the personal and professional development of these young people and a tool to clarify their professional career plan. Locally, this project will help improve the image of vocational training courses making them more attractive. More broadly, it will have positive impacts in terms of economic development and social cohesion in the region as this multi disciplinary consortium will share, discuss and reflect ideas to tackle the priority educational objective, develop the coordination of participants, and exchange practices in the development of public policies around youth mobility in the PACA region.", "http://www.sueryder.org/shop-with-us/high-street-shopping/specialist-shops/vintage-and-retro", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-046763_4"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1NA", "Business Energy Efficiency Cambridgeshire and Peterborough (BEECP)", "Peterborough Environment City Trust ( formerly NWES)", "BEECP will provide one-to-one tailored and impartial energy efficiency support/facilitation and discretionary grants to catalyse investment in energy efficiency initiatives. \n\nIt immediately builds visible local capacity and tangible results, bringing together experienced organisations and practitioners, expertise and key learning to provide a joined-up business energy efficiency service across the LEP area.
