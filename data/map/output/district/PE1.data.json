Fault is defined as any deterioration of the functional profile of informational system, the volumetric profile, and  the security profile<br/>- Support for a reconfiguration as an efficient system<br/>The primary objective of GEMOM is to research, develop and deploy a prototype of a messaging platform that is evolutionary, self-organising, self healing, scalable and secure. GEMOM will be resilient and be able to utilise redundant modules (hot-swap or switchover) instantly without information loss. These resilience features will allow specialist, independent system actors, viz. watch-dogs, security and situation monitors, routers, and other optimisers, to remove or replace compromised nodes from the broader network instantly without compromising higher level functionality.<br/>GEMOM considers the Publish-Subscribe variant of Message Oriented Middleware to be the predominant one and will focus on issues surrounding that kind of messaging. For completeness GEMOM would provide a synchronous Request and Reply overlay as well. <br/>The advances that GEMOM proposes to make to the area of messaging revolve around the notion of a 'fault'. In addition to the intuitive understanding of what a fault might be, whereby any actor stops being operable, connection is lost etc, GEMOM extends the notion of fault to include compromised security or inadequate bandwidth availability in the first iteration and compromised abstract notion of 'resource' in its final iteration.", 165038.0, 3906660.0, "GEMOM", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_85407_999681419"], ["5DD", "Water Efficiency in European Urban Areas", "Opportunity Peterborough Limited", "WE@EU is a coordination action born from the initiative of a wide range of actors from five different European regions that have a true awareness on problems related to availability of water in sufficient quantities and adequate quality in their regions.

Injection pressure above 2500bar and possibly reaching 3000bar and multiple injection strategy can drastically reduce the NOx/PM trade-off and allow use of cheap after treatment systems for meeting the set legislations. However, such injection strategies inevitably result to formation of cavitation which may have an adverse effect of the durability of the fuel injection system against surface erosion. This proposal will launch a knowledge-transfer programme between industries and Universities for designing durable fuel injection systems through use of existing as well as newly developed CFD models that will build upon those currently used by the industrial partners. These models will include effects not captured so far but believed to be of imperative importance: the prediction of cavitation surface erosion occurring upon collapse of cavitation bubbles. The new models will account for the effect of extreme pressure and temperature developing instantaneously at the time of bubble collapse. In addition, the heat produced during the fast acceleration of the fuel as it flows through the injection holes can result to flow boiling and thus, significantly alter the heat transfer characteristics between the flowing fluid and the metal of the injector. Models for boiling heat transfer will be included to the CFD models predicting the cavitating flow development and surface erosion. By exchanging personnel between the industrial and academic partners, a dedicated group of researchers will be formed that can make connections between engine legislations and operating conditions, availability of experimental data for cavitation erosion and advanced computational approaches that are required to fulfil the objective of this project.
