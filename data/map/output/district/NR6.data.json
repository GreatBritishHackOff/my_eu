Partner schools are two schools educating students with disabilities, the school from Turkey,  Ahmet emine cil okulu z Adiyaman, and the school from the United Kingdom, Hall School in Norwich. The aim of the project is to find organizational innovation, methodological and technological ways of working with children with disabilities, especially using modern Information and Communication Technologies as well as using specialized methods and augmentative and alternative methods of communication. The participants of the project will be teachers and teacher's assistants of Zesp\u00f3\u0142 Szk\u00f3\u0142 Specjalnych nr 10 im. ks. prof. J. Tischnera, including senior management. Participants will be recruited for the project according to the rules, taking into account the clear criteria for recruitment. It is expected  that at least 50% of employees will take part in the project.\r\n\r\nThe project involves the following four visits to each of the partner schools. Each visit has a different theme and it is scheduled to gain some competencies. \r\n\r\nI Visit  - organization of schools at different stages and for each group of students (intellectual disabilities, physical disabilities, autism spectrum).\r\n\r\nII Visit - adapting curriculum and methods of working to the needs and abilities of students with disabilities.\r\n\r\nIII Visit - Information and Communication Technologies in working with students with disabilities\r\n\r\nIV Visit -  Augmentative and Alternative Methods of Communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe applicant institution will set up a coordinating team consisting of headteacher, as a coordinator, English teacher, as deputy coordinator, deputy head, psychologist, speech therapist and guidance counselor. The coordinating team will be involved in planning, implementing of the tasks, monitoring, implementing of innovations at school, evaluation, dissemination of project results, final accounts and final statement. Team members will support all participants by organizing language, culture, organizational and substantive support in the project.\r\n\r\nIn the organizational support  will be included reservations, ticket purchases,  plans of the  visits, etc. Language Support will consist of the organization of language course before the visit and support of a member of coordinating team, speaking English fluently, during the visits.\r\n\r\nWithin cultural support it is planned to organize the meeting with people who know the culture and customs of the country, to explore knowledge and provide a sense of security during staying abroad. Substantive support will be connected with familiarising ourselves with the plans and the aims of each visit, completing documentation during the meeting and the support to implement an innovation at school. During implementation of the project the coordinating team will monitor its progress. Evaluation of the project will be carried out in order to check the degree of achieving assumed objectives. During the implementation of the project the coordinating team will care for promoting, organizing conferences, contacting the media, issuing a leaflet, brochure, publishing a book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is expected to obtain following  results of the project: \r\n\r\n- the acquisition by the participants competence to use on a large scale Information and Communication Technologies working with students with disabilities, innovative ways of working - 90% of activities will be implemented with using new technologies, methods and ways of working,\r\n\r\n-the acquisition by the participants skills to use augmentative and alternative methods of communication - 100% nonverbal students and staff working with them will use augmentative and  alternative communication,\r\n\r\n- the acquisition of knowledge on innovative organizational and methodological arrangements - there will be implemented 10 innovative projects / programs with innovative methodological and organizational arrangements,\r\n\r\n- the acquisition by the participants the knowledge and skills on preparing students for independent adult living \u2013 there will be created three extracurricular activities.\r\n\r\nOur school will develop into modern and European schools thanks to the competence gained by the participants, evidenced by certificates and innovative arrangements implemented at school  As a result, more children and staff wll use school services. \r\n\r\nThe added value of the project: each of the partner schools will implement at least one new method of working adapted from the aplicant school.", "http://www.hallschoolnorfolk.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-PL01-KA101-000508_2"], ["7AD", "Modern teacher and school in modern world - how to use a modern technology to support Special Needs Students across Europe.", "Hall School", 11199.0, "This exciting project is aimed to support the whole school improvement, teaching and learning, within the Complex Needs and Severe Learning Difficulties environment. Hall School, located in Norwich, is a special school with a specialism in Communication and Interaction. There are approximately 80 students on roll, each with severe learning difficulties and complex needs. The students are aged between 3 years and 19 years old. There are approximately 60 staff, most of which are highly experienced and qualified experts in special educational need.\r\nThe project has clearly defined aims and objectives which will strengthen the quality of teaching and learning whilst developing a better understanding of international methods and technologies.  Communication for our students, in both partner schools, is extremely challenging and often provides a real barrier to learning. This project aims to remove all barriers to learning, by sharing expertise, knowledge and understanding. New communication technologies will be explored and fully developped across both environments.\r\nSpecialist staff teams will be deployed to develop tailored objectives around teaching, learning and communication.\r\nStaff mobility is essential to the success of this project. Highly trained staff, who can demonstrate the use of latest technology, will be deployed to travel and share expertise.\r\nThe final result will show a real improvement in student communication skill and measureable improvement in student academic progress.\r\nThe project will, when complete, be sustainable and provide a lasting partnership with all stakeholders.\r\nHall School and our Polish partner have already started to develop highly desirable aims and objectives. Staff mobility has also been initiated with a member of Hall School staff visiting our Polish partner special school. At Hall School we have begun linguistic support for potential participant.\r\nThe Erasmus+ project would make a real difference to the lives of those most vulnerable within our society.", "http://www.hallschoolnorfolk.co.uk", "Hall School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012823_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NR6"}
