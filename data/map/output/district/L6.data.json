In our school there are 360 students and we are qualifying our students for a profession in the social and health field. In addition to a good educational background and language education, personality development and the promotion of social skills of our students are central. Important parts of our education are the various practical trainings. In these practical trainings our students get to know different areas of social work and also acquire social skills. Our students take the A-level exam and acquire practical, social and economic education. The objective of the project is the possibility to support 41 students to do their internship abroad. By participating in this mobility project, the students will expand their own abilities and skills, and hopefully gain financial support. At the time of the participation in this project our students already have at least 200 hours of practical work experience in an Austrian social institution and so they already have a good level of training. This allows the students to broaden their professional and personal horizons and to strengthen their language skills for working life. They also get to know a variety of innovative concepts and methods of social work in other European countries. The activities of the internship are different, depending on the participating organisations and include the following work areas for example: working with people with special needs, working with disadvantaged people, employment with children, rehabilitation of homeless people or administrative activities in a social institution. The duration of stay abroad is between 4 weeks and 7 months. In general, all students of the third and fourth grade have the opportunity to apply for participation in this project. After personal interviews, feedback and agreement by the responsible person for the practical training, the students contact the participating organisation on their own. In the foreground is the self-organization of the students. If necessary they are always supported by teachers. During the internship abroad professional training and personal development are central. Students will improve their professional, social, personal and communication skills and acquire new ones. They will also establish networks for their future working lives and get to know different cultures. Through the internships our students will gain new experiences and impressions which they can use in Austria. They gain self-confidence and can deal with language barriers easily. All acquired skills are a personal gain for their future career. The stay abroad is recognized as an internship. The stories of the students from their internships and the smooth mobility of labor within the European Union will lead to more students planning to study abroad.", "http://www.evertonnurseryschoolandfamilycentre.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA102-034810_12"]]}}, "outwardCode": "L6"}
