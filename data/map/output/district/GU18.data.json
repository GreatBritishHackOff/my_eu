The collection of expertise profiles from more than 1\u00a0\u00a0200 SMEs and 2\u00a0000 academia ensured an international and quality proven pool that perfectly served as platform for presenting the outstanding expertise to the scientific community and assisted in finding appropriate project partners for collaborative projects.\n\n'Partnering Days' for supporting SMEs in researchers in finding suitable project partners for their FP7-Health-projects targeted up to 500 participants that exchanged their ideas in more than 800 bilateral meetings. 'Virtual Brokerage Events' accompanied those on-site events. Those complementing activities provided excellent interaction platforms for SMEs and academia.\n\nSpecial focus was given to a modular set of trainings: target group-specific on-site and virtual trainings for FP7 Newcomers, Applicants and participants of FP7 funded projects were a hallmark of the project. Moreover, some dedicated trainings focused on the exploitation of project results together with specific exploitation Partnering Events encouraged SMEs and researchers in bringing their research results to the market. Strategy meetings targeting 89 companies on an individual basis and 2 strategy trainings supported SMEs and clusters for a strategic, sustainable approach towards FP7.\n\nParticular attention was given to SMEs in an enlarged Europe, Acceding and Candidate countries with the organisation of so called SME-For a. This ensured that via those interactive communication platforms the low participation rate of SMEs in new member states and acceding candidate countries that still exists can be reduced.\n\nThe consortium of 26 partners from 22 countries joined highly experienced FP7 NCPs for 'Health' and \u201cSMEs\u201d with renowned innovation experts and trainers, ensuring excellent coverage of the entire innovation pipeline.", null, "http://www.emtechna.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/147654.jpg", "fp7_96688_989356060"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["5RA", "EUROPEAN REGIONS AIRLINE ASSOCIATION*ASSOCIATION DES COMPAGNIES D'AVIATION DES REGIONS D'EUROPE VERBAND DER FLUGLINIEN EUROPAISCHER REGIONEN", 535.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_18633", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "GU18"}
