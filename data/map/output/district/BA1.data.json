By employing Renewable Energy Sources (RES) to liquefy and store cryogens, CryoHub will balance the power grid, while meeting the cooling demand of a refrigerated food warehouse and recovering the waste heat from its equipment and components.\nThe intermittent supply is a major obstacle to the RES power market. In reality, RES are fickle forces, prone to over-producing when demand is low and failing to meet requirements when demand peaks. Europe is about to generate 20% of its required energy from RES by 2020, so that the proper RES integration poses continent-wide challenges.\nThe Cryogenic Energy Storage (CES), and particularly the Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), is a promising technology enabling on-site storage of RES energy during periods of high generation and its use at peak grid demand. Thus, CES acts as Grid Energy Storage (GES), where cryogen is boiled to drive a turbine and to restore electricity to the grid. To date, CES applications have been rather limited by the poor round trip efficiency (ratio between energies spent for and retrieved from energy storage) due to unrecovered energy losses.\nThe CryoHub project is therefore designed to maximise the CES efficiency by recovering energy from cooling and heating in a perfect RES-driven cycle of cryogen liquefaction, storage, distribution and efficient use. Refrigerated warehouses for chilled and frozen food commodities are large electricity consumers, possess powerful installed capacities for cooling and heating and waste substantial amounts of heat. Such facilities provide the ideal industrial environment to advance and demonstrate the LAES benefits.\nCryoHub will thus resolve most of the above-mentioned problems at one go, thereby paving the way for broader market prospects for CES-based technologies across Europe.", 200368.0, 7186916.0, "CryoHub", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_199618_950431512"], ["2HA", "Commercialisation of a world changing invention for the stabilisation and delivery of vaccines", "Stablepharma Limited", "Vaccination is an indispensable tool in fighting disease, annually saving up tens of millions of lives saved across the globe.

As for the partner companies in France, United Kingdom and Malt, they have worked with the IES Universidad de Toledo previously and they are always available. \r\nThe activity will be carried out through the European Programs Department, consisting of several teachers at the Universidad Laboral,  responsible for the different actions Erasmus +. The tutors of the reference groups of the students involved will provide a favorable report about the students intending to obtain the funds for mobility. The teachers responsible for teaching on-the-job training will give their opinion, as they are more aware of the suitability of the posts offered to the students in the host country.\r\nThere will be a schedule for the Project \u2013 initially (information and selection process, and arranging mobilities), during the mobilities (monitoring of the activity), at the end of the activity (final reports, evaluation, dissemination, certificates)  \r\nThe activity has been proposed to all the students of intermediate level of technical studies who can take part in the program, and which can be provided with posts at destination offered by the intermediary partner schools. The aim is to fulfill a growing need \u2013 to combine training in workplaces, to implement the training acquired at school, to deepen knowledge in languages, to develop communicative skills in real situations related to their studies and interests and promote entrepreneurship. The fact of living in another country for ten weeks will increase their personal autonomy and will enable them to know and appreciate other cultures and ways of life in EU countries, both at personal and professional level. Simultaneously, they will put into practice the knowledge and skills learned at college. \r\nMobilities will take place between April, May and June 2018, as intermediate level technical studies are structured so that the third term is aimed at 400-hour-on-the-job-training (FCT). The period of training at workplaces in other countries will be equivalent to training at workplaces in Spain, and lead to certificate. \r\nThere will be information about the project on a school, Toledo, national and international level. Use of the IES Universidad Laboral de Toledo\u2019s official website, as well as institutional sites  and forums, attendance to official meetings promoted by education institutions, contact with stakeholders and use of EU education sites. The dissemination of experiences by students taking part in the activity will be an important point.  \r\nThere are several important benefits for participants in the activity: improvement of personal, linguistic, professional skills. At school, this activity promotes the contact of technical and language teachers with other schools and colleges and with companies from other counties, which leads to updating teachers\u2019 knowledge, skills and capacities. Mobilities will widen the school scope on a local and regional level. The results of the activity, disseminated by the students who took part in them, will contribute to raise other students\u2019 interest  in participating in mobility activities. As it is a reciprocal activity, and several schools will be involved, it will also contribute to cooperation between education institutions and companies.

As a YMCA we are part of the worldwide movement and understand how important it is to create and maintain positive relationships across borders of all kinds.  \r\n\r\nThe objectives for the project will be:\r\n\r\n\u2022 To bring together a group of volunteers each from different cultures to live together and volunteer on our varied and interesting programme\r\n\u2022 To create an opportunity for learning by focusing the project upon our children\u2019s work and giving the volunteers an extensive and varied experience across our nurseries and out of school clubs (including a better understanding of the Early Years Framework and current playwork practices in the UK)\r\n\u2022 To offer a rich intercultural learning experience for the volunteers and also for the staff, children and families with whom they will be working\r\n\u2022 To encourage creativity and entrepreneurial spirit \u2013 in particular by working on individual and group activities\r\n\u2022 To build positive international relationships\r\n\u2022 To promote tolerance and understanding\r\n\u2022 To enable personal growth of the volunteers \u2013 increasing confidence and developing new skills and promote lifelong learning\r\n\r\nThe project will involve three volunteers, each from different countries, Russia, Italy and Spain.  We have selected volunteers who are all from different cultures and have different home languages so that by coming together and living in the shared flat, working in our varied departments, both the volunteers and the staff, children and families with whom they work will enjoy a positive intercultural learning experience.  This should also be a positive aspect for the volunteers as they will be able to work on their language skills together and will have English as a common language.  \r\n\r\nThe volunteers selected for the project are aged between twenty three and twenty seven years old and all have a strong desire to work with children as well as possessing great enthusiasm for the organisation and to take part in EVS.  The project will be focused on our children\u2019s work and the main part of the timetable will be made up of work in our After School Clubs and the Day Nurseries.  However the volunteers will also have the option to work in our Health & Wellbeing Centre, Hostel Reception and Social Enterprise Caf\u00e9.  \r\n\r\nDuring the project the volunteers will be encouraged to research, design and implement their own activities in the settings both as individuals and also sometimes as a group.  These activities will be a great opportunity for intercultural sharing however also will inspire confidence in the volunteers and will be rewarding as will allow the volunteers to follow the whole process of the activity.  It will also require the volunteers to develop their skills and encourage their creativity.  We will recognise all their achievements in the YouthPass at the end of the project.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers will work alongside trained and experienced staff, most of whom have been involved with the previous EVS projects we have run.  A full induction will be given to each volunteer and both informal training and training courses where available will be provided.  Regular evaluations will be carried out and support supplied.  A local language course will be provided as well as the OLS and the staff teams will help informally.\r\n\r\nWe have developed our project over the years and will hope to have the opportunity to use the skills and systems we have developed to achieve and maybe even surpass our objectives.  The project will be a fantastic intercultural learning opportunity for everyone involved.  Through positive experiences and the building of friendships and strong relationships it will encourage good international co-operation, promoting tolerance and understanding and showing everyone involved how much can be achieved.  For the volunteers we would anticipate huge personal growth from the project as well as the work related skills they will develop and build upon. The project will allow us to forge good relationships with our partner organisations and may contribute towards future collaboration.  \r\n\r\nIn the long term the project will allow the creation of strong friendships, a positive intercultural exchange, inspiration to learn both during the project and for a continued learning for life, sharing of information and ideas and also the positive development of international relationships.", "http://www.bathymca.co.uk", "YMCA BATH GROUP", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-035549_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2HJ", "ALPHAGALILEO FOUNDATION LBG*", 1518.0, "Horizontal activities of Horizon 2020 (08.02.05)", "fts_2016_44978", 2016], ["6JP", "THE ASSOCIATION FOR DANCE MOVEMENTPSYCHOTHERAPY UK LIMITED", 51014.0, "Developing the European dimension in sport (15.02.03)", "fts_2017_35155", 2017], ["1UD", "GREEN RUNNING LIMITED", 43613.0, "Making the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system (32.04.03.01)", "fts_2017_57707", 2017]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["1RL", "RD1", "ROYAL NATIONAL HOSPITAL FOR RHEUMATIC DISEASES"], ["3NG", "RD1", "ROYAL UNITED HOSPITAL"], ["3NG", "RNZ", "ROYAL UNITED HOSPITAL"], ["1RN", "RVJ", "BATH MINERAL HOSPITAL"], ["3NG", "RVN", "ROYAL UNITED HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BA1"}
