By employing Renewable Energy Sources (RES) to liquefy and store cryogens, CryoHub will balance the power grid, while meeting the cooling demand of a refrigerated food warehouse and recovering the waste heat from its equipment and components.\nThe intermittent supply is a major obstacle to the RES power market. In reality, RES are fickle forces, prone to over-producing when demand is low and failing to meet requirements when demand peaks. Europe is about to generate 20% of its required energy from RES by 2020, so that the proper RES integration poses continent-wide challenges.\nThe Cryogenic Energy Storage (CES), and particularly the Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), is a promising technology enabling on-site storage of RES energy during periods of high generation and its use at peak grid demand. Thus, CES acts as Grid Energy Storage (GES), where cryogen is boiled to drive a turbine and to restore electricity to the grid. To date, CES applications have been rather limited by the poor round trip efficiency (ratio between energies spent for and retrieved from energy storage) due to unrecovered energy losses.\nThe CryoHub project is therefore designed to maximise the CES efficiency by recovering energy from cooling and heating in a perfect RES-driven cycle of cryogen liquefaction, storage, distribution and efficient use. Refrigerated warehouses for chilled and frozen food commodities are large electricity consumers, possess powerful installed capacities for cooling and heating and waste substantial amounts of heat. Such facilities provide the ideal industrial environment to advance and demonstrate the LAES benefits.\nCryoHub will thus resolve most of the above-mentioned problems at one go, thereby paving the way for broader market prospects for CES-based technologies across Europe.", 200368.0, 7186916.0, "CryoHub", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_199618_950431512"], ["2HA", "Commercialisation of a world changing invention for the stabilisation and delivery of vaccines", "Stablepharma Limited", "Vaccination is an indispensable tool in fighting disease, annually saving up tens of millions of lives saved across the globe.

It gives us the opportunity to build on the learning we have acquired through participation in the consortium and to develop our international work.The main objective of this project is to provide structured European mobility opportunities to Bath College learners across a range of vocational sectors; Beauty, Business, Catering, Computing, Sport (Football) and Travel & Tourism. We will recruit 104 learners, over a 2 year period, across 6 vocational areas. They will travel in small groups to either Crete (Greece), Zagreb (Croatia), Seville (Spain) or Prague (Czech Republic) depending on their area of study and the placements available, for between 4-6 weeks. We will be working directly with a range of host organisations who will provide structured work placements for our learners across a range of disciplines. All host partners involved have previous experience of working with young people on mobility programmes and are able to provide a high quality work experience opportunity with the appropriate support mechanisms in place.We plan to target participants who have not previously had opportunities to work or study abroad. The mobility enables us to provide a structured and supportive setting for an overseas placement, so that we feel confident to offer this opportunity to those who are less self assured and lacking experience of overseas travel. All groups will be joined by an accompanying person for the first and last week of their placement.We aim to make our students highly employable and enterprising by developing the skills employers want. Our courses provide learners with a theoretical understanding of the sector. Through the addition of structured, sector specific overseas work experience, the participants can apply their learning in a work based setting and develop new skills to provide them with a stronger foundation, both personally and professionally, giving them a competitive advantage in the labour market over their peers.We will support learners to develop the interpersonal skills, confidence and self assurance that are invaluable to any career. The mobility encourages learners to step out of their comfort zone, working in a different culture and equip them with the professional confidence to interact positively in a new environment. We will ensure adequate pre-departure training and engagement is offered to learners to fully prepare them for the experience. The mobility placement will be explicitly linked to their course of study and has been designed so that placement activities correspond to the mandatory units of their course of study, which means that learners can gain transferable course credits whilst on placement. For each vocational area, the college tutor will have identified a specific unit(s) of their course of study, which will be achieved during their mobility.The Learning Outcomes to be achieved will differ between participants and will relate to both the specific qualification that they are working towards in the UK, as well as the daily activities provided by the Host Organisations within each of the available roles. The objectives will be documented in an individual Learning Agreement for each learner.  The work-based learning achieved by each participant and will contribute to several of the units of their UK based qualification. We will use ECVET as a framework to validate their learning. We anticipate that this project will have a positive impact on our learners, on Bath College and on our host partners.For learners, we expect them to gain practical work experience, in a European context, which will be directly transferable to and enhance their course of study. Participants will benefit both personally and professionally, and have the opportunity to develop technical skills as well as personal and language competences. In the long term, we hope the experience will broaden their horizons and raise aspirations and ambitions and impact positively on their job readiness and future employability.For Bath College, are will be able to enhance our course of study, improve our reputation as a course provider and increase our attractiveness to prospective students. It is an opportunity for professional development amongst our staff and to increase our international networks.

The teachers responsible for teaching on-the-job training will give their opinion, as they are more aware of the suitability of the posts offered to the students in the host country.\r\nThere will be a schedule for the Project \u2013 initially (information and selection process, and arranging mobilities), during the mobilities (monitoring of the activity), at the end of the activity (final reports, evaluation, dissemination, certificates)  \r\nThe activity has been proposed to all the students of intermediate level of technical studies who can take part in the program, and which can be provided with posts at destination offered by the intermediary partner schools. The aim is to fulfill a growing need \u2013 to combine training in workplaces, to implement the training acquired at school, to deepen knowledge in languages, to develop communicative skills in real situations related to their studies and interests and promote entrepreneurship. The fact of living in another country for ten weeks will increase their personal autonomy and will enable them to know and appreciate other cultures and ways of life in EU countries, both at personal and professional level. Simultaneously, they will put into practice the knowledge and skills learned at college. \r\nMobilities will take place between April, May and June 2018, as intermediate level technical studies are structured so that the third term is aimed at 400-hour-on-the-job-training (FCT). The period of training at workplaces in other countries will be equivalent to training at workplaces in Spain, and lead to certificate. \r\nThere will be information about the project on a school, Toledo, national and international level. Use of the IES Universidad Laboral de Toledo\u2019s official website, as well as institutional sites  and forums, attendance to official meetings promoted by education institutions, contact with stakeholders and use of EU education sites. The dissemination of experiences by students taking part in the activity will be an important point.  \r\nThere are several important benefits for participants in the activity: improvement of personal, linguistic, professional skills. At school, this activity promotes the contact of technical and language teachers with other schools and colleges and with companies from other counties, which leads to updating teachers\u2019 knowledge, skills and capacities. Mobilities will widen the school scope on a local and regional level. The results of the activity, disseminated by the students who took part in them, will contribute to raise other students\u2019 interest  in participating in mobility activities. As it is a reciprocal activity, and several schools will be involved, it will also contribute to cooperation between education institutions and companies.  On a local basis, mobilities will spread the interest about Toledo, from several points of view \u2013 tourism, culture, business.", "http://www.bathcollege.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037046_6"], ["5LH", "Vielfalt statt Einfalt - interkulturelles Lernen im Jugendwerk", "YMCA BATH GROUP", 7282.0, "\"Diversity beats monotony \u2013 intercultural learning at Jugendwerk\" is a learning project for 12 months in the nonprofit organization Jugendwerk der AWO Wuerttemberg.

As a YMCA we are part of the worldwide movement and understand how important it is to create and maintain positive relationships across borders of all kinds.  \r\n\r\nThe objectives for the project will be:\r\n\r\n\u2022 To bring together a group of volunteers each from different cultures to live together and volunteer on our varied and interesting programme\r\n\u2022 To create an opportunity for learning by focusing the project upon our children\u2019s work and giving the volunteers an extensive and varied experience across our nurseries and out of school clubs (including a better understanding of the Early Years Framework and current playwork practices in the UK)\r\n\u2022 To offer a rich intercultural learning experience for the volunteers and also for the staff, children and families with whom they will be working\r\n\u2022 To encourage creativity and entrepreneurial spirit \u2013 in particular by working on individual and group activities\r\n\u2022 To build positive international relationships\r\n\u2022 To promote tolerance and understanding\r\n\u2022 To enable personal growth of the volunteers \u2013 increasing confidence and developing new skills and promote lifelong learning\r\n\r\nThe project will involve three volunteers, each from different countries, Russia, Italy and Spain.  We have selected volunteers who are all from different cultures and have different home languages so that by coming together and living in the shared flat, working in our varied departments, both the volunteers and the staff, children and families with whom they work will enjoy a positive intercultural learning experience.  This should also be a positive aspect for the volunteers as they will be able to work on their language skills together and will have English as a common language.  \r\n\r\nThe volunteers selected for the project are aged between twenty three and twenty seven years old and all have a strong desire to work with children as well as possessing great enthusiasm for the organisation and to take part in EVS.  The project will be focused on our children\u2019s work and the main part of the timetable will be made up of work in our After School Clubs and the Day Nurseries.

These activities will be a great opportunity for intercultural sharing however also will inspire confidence in the volunteers and will be rewarding as will allow the volunteers to follow the whole process of the activity.  It will also require the volunteers to develop their skills and encourage their creativity.  We will recognise all their achievements in the YouthPass at the end of the project.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers will work alongside trained and experienced staff, most of whom have been involved with the previous EVS projects we have run.  A full induction will be given to each volunteer and both informal training and training courses where available will be provided.  Regular evaluations will be carried out and support supplied.  A local language course will be provided as well as the OLS and the staff teams will help informally.\r\n\r\nWe have developed our project over the years and will hope to have the opportunity to use the skills and systems we have developed to achieve and maybe even surpass our objectives.  The project will be a fantastic intercultural learning opportunity for everyone involved.  Through positive experiences and the building of friendships and strong relationships it will encourage good international co-operation, promoting tolerance and understanding and showing everyone involved how much can be achieved.

Placements will be 3-6 weeks long, with the exact length of stay determined by the lead tutor for each vocational area. We feel this is sufficient time for students to adjust to work and life in another country, meaningfully gain from the experience and achieve tangible learning outcomes. The destination for each student will be determined by their vocational area and the placements available. Students will be selected from the following departments: Business, Beauty, Travel & Tourism, Sport (Football), Catering and Computing. \r\n\r\nOur project objectives are \r\n- to provide European work placement opportunities to students across a range of vocational sectors\r\n- to build on the success of our 2016 mobility project, develop our internal project delivery capacity, and expand our work to offer more students international opportunities\r\n- to enable students to apply the theoretical learning acquired on their course in a structured and sector specific work setting \r\n- to enable students to develop soft skills & professional competences \r\n- to show them different perspectives & practices in a work setting. To promote cross-cultural working and ultimately, broaden their horizons \r\n\r\nWe aim to make our students highly employable and enterprising by developing the skills employers want. The project will enhance our students' learning experience and increase their employability. \r\n\r\nThe placements are framed by a supportive pre, during & post placement structure, with group training and individual support offered in order to fully prepare students for the placement, and provide a debrief and careers guidance on how to maximize their learning on their return.\r\n\r\nThe models of support that we offer our learners will be tailored to their individual needs, recognising that support needs will differ between participants and at different points in the project. Each group will be joined by an accompanying staff member from the College and will have a designated placement supervisor, as well as local partner support. \r\n\r\nThe participants for this mobility will all be students at Bath College, studying  up to Level 3 in one of the following vocational areas: Beauty (Level 3), Business (Level 3), Catering (Level 2), Computing (Level 3), Football (Level 3) Travel & Tourism (Level 3).\r\n\r\nOur tutors have strong existing relationships with learners and a good working knowledge of how best to engage and retain them, and design a project that is responsive to their needs. \r\n\r\nLearner needs are: \r\n\r\n- To gain sector specific practical work experience and apply the technical skills and theoretical knowledge they have acquired through their course in a practical setting\r\n- To develop their soft skills (such as self assurance, adaptability, communication) and their language competences\r\n- To provide participants with international experience, pushing them out of their comfort zone in a supportive environment\r\n\r\nUltimately we hope this will put them in a stronger position to gain employment in the sector on completion of their course. In order to have a competitive edge in the labour market, we know that students need to develop personal competences such as team work, confidence and adaptability. We hope the mobility will increase their aspirations for a career in the sector.\r\n\r\nLearners will develop the confidence to interact in a foreign language setting, an understanding of the sector at European level & insight in to how organisations operate in a different cultural context. In the long term, we hope the mobility will contribute to positive onward progression and raised aspirations amongst our learners. The mobility provides a structured employment experience, with a line manager and a clear set of tasks and guidance, support learners to engage in a 'real' work setting and develop realistic expectations of the working world. \r\n\r\nThe mobility placement will be explicitly linked to learners' course of study.

Hyria operates in the rapidly growing Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Riihim\u00e4ki region which has nearly 90 000 residents, 34 000 jobs, and 5000 companies of which many operate internationally. \r\n \r\nThe development of international operations is very important to Hyria and therefore internationalisation was one of the focus points in its strategy and operations for the period of 2011-2017. In a new strategy internationalisation is not mentioned as a focus point, but it takes in the account of changing needs of workers\u2019 skills and competence due to the e.g. digitalisation, urbanisation, climate change and globalisation. Hyria strategy is not set for the specific timeframe, but it can be modified if necessary due to fast change of the operational environment.\r\n\r\nInternational activities at Hyria are aiming to increase our students, teachers and work life partners\u2019 professional and international skills by offering them a possibility to participate in the international mobility programs. By enabling our students and teachers to acquire new skills and knowledge the quality of education increases as well as student\u2019s employment opportunities. At the same time, Hyria fosters the co-operation with the world of work and serves the needs of the area\u2019s working life by producing a highly skilled workforce. \r\n\r\nObjectives and expected results\r\n\r\nThe most important objective is to increase the students\u2019 professional skills, knowledge and attitudes by emphasizing the acquisition and development of key competencies of lifelong learning.\r\n \r\nThe exchange period comprehensively enables students to develop the key competencies which are needed for personal fulfilment and development, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment. During the exchange period students encounter new situations; they apply already gained knowledge and language skills in practice; learn to use new technological solutions and platforms while communicating with their teachers, friends and family in the home country; and they compare working methods, the acquisition of technical solutions, the level of sustainable development and legislative issues in the host country.\r\n \r\nIn addition, students are able to develop international and personal capabilities such as cultural awareness, language skills, interpersonal skills, individual growth, independence and the ability to work in a multicultural environment. For teachers the project activities give a possibility to update their professional knowledge and understanding of current requirements of a working life.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of this experience the students and teachers\u2019 professional identity gets stronger, and they are able to find out more field-specific professional development possibilities. It enriches the education in many ways, as well as encourages students\u2019 to entrepreneurship and language learning. \r\n\r\nThe second objective is to continue the development of international activities at Hyria. In this time the development activities are focused on the following issues: \r\n\r\n- The evaluation system of international activities will be improved. \r\n- Mobility statistics will be improved. The implemented periods are compared with the estimated ones by departments and target groups.  \r\n- The organisation of international activities at Hyria (better involvement of adult learners).\r\n- Inclusion of international activities into implementation plans of the new curricula.\r\n- Developing an international learning pathway for students.\r\n- Shifting from short-term co-operation agreements to long-term ones (MOU, LOI).\r\n- Creating a centralized mobility process, instructions and orientation to teachers and staff members. \r\n- Updating the programme for international activities. \r\n\r\nAs a result of these activities the mobility periods are implemented according the ECVET procedures, the procedures of international activities are improved, internationalisation at home is expanded, internationalisation is spread into the different departments and students. In addition to that, the transparency of student guidance is improved (blogs as learning diaries) and we have a stronger cooperation with companies. \r\n\r\nMobility\r\n\r\nThis application comprises 61 student mobility periods covering 25 different vocational qualifications. Exchange periods are offered to Hyria\u2019s second or third year students (young), but also to adult students and recent graduates can participate. 5 selected students will receive additional monetary support (exceptional costs) for living and cultural expenses due to the fewer opportunities (economical). \r\n\r\nThe mobility of staff and world of work (22 persons) is connected to teacher/expert exchanges, visiting new partners and work placements for quality reasons. There will be also 4 people invited to teach and guide Hyria\u2019s students of the health care sector.", "http://www.bathcollege.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FI01-KA116-046772_10"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2HJ", "ALPHAGALILEO FOUNDATION LBG*", 1518.0, "Horizontal activities of Horizon 2020 (08.02.05)", "fts_2016_44978", 2016], ["6JP", "THE ASSOCIATION FOR DANCE MOVEMENTPSYCHOTHERAPY UK LIMITED", 51014.0, "Developing the European dimension in sport (15.02.03)", "fts_2017_35155", 2017], ["1UD", "GREEN RUNNING LIMITED", 43613.0, "Making the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system (32.04.03.01)", "fts_2017_57707", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "BA1"}
