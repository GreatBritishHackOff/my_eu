It is based on a 4 years coordinated joint programme of exchange of researchers for periods of 1-12 months, thus providing mobility possibilities to individual researchers and support to research organisations to establish and reinforce long-term research co-operation. An important part of AdvIOT is the early stage researcher training, where early career researchers get a chance for international collaboration and high quality knowledge transfer by well organized and guided international secondments and conference attendances. In addition to active researcher exchange, five workshops will be organized during this project. The project has developed on the basis of active bilateral cooperation plans between individual countries and partners. The IRSES scheme provides a unique opportunity to integrate those collaboration ideas into a coherent programme addressing an issue of high priority on the agenda of EU, China, and Japan.\n\nThe programme of exchange is focused on novel RFID- and WSN-based green IOT devices with renewable materials that will be developed for different applications by using additive manufacturing methods. As a result of the AdvIOT, novel tools for testing, analyzing, and improving the reliability and security of these new devices in various demanding applications and environments, such as in healthcare, disaster prevention, and intelligent transportation, will be achieved. Four topics have been identified as most relevant for all partners involved in the joint programme: Design of novel environmental-friendly RFID and WSN devices, Manufacturing of these new devices, Reliability of these wireless devices, and Security of the wireless communication between these devices.", 112970.0, 440077.0, "AdvIOT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.derby.ac.uk", null, "fp7_109385_999853885"], ["1GB", "The efficiency of bio-self-healing concrete within ground conditions", "University of Derby", "Concrete is the most used construction material worldwide for infrastructure projects. Due to deterioration, regular maintenance works are necessary to seal the concrete cracks and restore durability. In Europe, infrastructures such as tunnels and earth retaining walls alone cost approximately 5 billion EUR per year. Self-healing strategies (particularly bacterial-based self-healing) are regarded as a promising solution to reduce the high maintenance and repair cost of concrete infrastructures. It is believed if self-healing concrete had been used for all these structures, up to 120 million EUR could be saved annually on their maintenance. The research to date has tended to focus on the self-healing process in air or water environment. However, infrastructures (i.e. bridges, buildings, tunnels) are built on or in the ground, where part of their concrete structures are inevitably embedded in soil environment with all sorts of ground conditions such as different types of soil, saturation regimes, and chemical exposures. It is not clear if the process of self-healing is efficient within concrete elements exposed to such complicated ground conditions. \nThe project aims to explore the efficiency of the bacterial-based self-healing (bio-hydrogels) in underground concrete structures. By using a novel interdisciplinary approach, the research combines state-of-the-art technologies applied in materials/concrete, geotechnical engineering, and microbiology to conduct a series of lab-scale experiments on mortar specimens incubated within various soil environments. Purpose-built experimental tools are used to investigate the effect of several factors including the type of soil, saturation regime and class of (chemical) exposures, on the bio-self-healing process. The outcomes of this research are highly relevant to the construction industry and the knowledge produced by the project will have an economic, financial and societal impact in EU and other regions.", 170111.0, 170111.0, "GEOBACTICON", null, null, null, null, "http://www.derby.ac.uk", null, "h2020_215587_999853885"], ["1GB", "Sustainable structural and multifunctional biocomposites from hybrid natural fibres and bio-based polymers", "University of Derby", "The project SSUCHY falls within the framework of the development and optimization of innovative and eco-efficient processes  and constituents for  structural  and  multifunctional  bio-based  composites.

Obesity is a key economic and healthcare challenge for Europe. Effective interventions and commercial programmes for weight loss are widely available, but most people re-gain their lost weight. Currently few comprehensive solutions exist to help Europeans manage weight loss maintenance (WLM).\nCurrent research suggests the most promising evidence-based behaviour change techniques for WLM are self-monitoring, goal setting, action control, building self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation. Recent research also suggests that stress management and emotion regulation skills are key enablers of relapse prevention and weight-regain.\n\nInformation technology offers attractive tools for teaching and supporting these techniques, some of which are currently delivered through resource-intensive face-to-face therapies. ICT-delivery includes networked-wireless tracking technologies, weighing-scales and activity sensors, online tools and smart-phone apps, multi-media resources and internet-based support. A broad choice of tools is most likely to be acceptable to users, who can pick and choose their own preferred technologies. \nThe NoHoW project tests whether ICT-based delivery of the most promising evidence-based behavior change techniques is effective for WLM. We will carry out a large-scale international 3-centre trial of information technology tools that implement the most up-to-date behavioural science research. This trial will establish the effectiveness of these ICT tools in supporting WLM, linked to studies of European consumer needs and behaviour.\n\nImpact: The project will directly feed results into development of new products and services from the UK\u2019s largest commercial weight-loss provider, Slimming World providing immediate benefit to 500,000\\ consumers.
