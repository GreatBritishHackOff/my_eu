These new industries will have significant impacts on deep-sea ecosystems, in some cases extending over hundreds of thousands of square kilometres. Scientific knowledge is needed urgently to develop guidelines for industry ensuring wealth creation and Best Environmental Practice. MIDAS will assess the nature and scales of the potential impacts including 1) physical destruction of the seabed by mining, the creation of mine tailings and the potential for catastrophic slope failures from methane hydrate exploitation, 2) the potential effects of particle-laden plumes in the water column, and 3) the possible toxic chemicals that might be released by the mining process. Knowledge of the impacts will be used to address the key biological unknowns, such as connectivity between populations, impacts of the loss of biological diversity on ecosystem functioning, and how quickly the ecosystems will recover. The information derived will be used to guide recommendations for best practice, iterating with MIDAS industry partners and the wider stakeholder community to ensure that solutions are practical and cost-effective. We will engage with European and international regulatory organisations to take these recommendations forward into legislation in a timely fashion. A major element of MIDAS will be to develop methods and technologies for 1) preparing baseline assessments of biodiversity, and 2) monitoring activities remotely in the deep sea during and after exploitation (including ecosystem recovery).

The financial impact of these infections counteract medical advances and expensive medical treatments by increasing the length of hospital stay by at least 8 days on average per affected patient, hence adding more than 10 millions patient days in hospitals in Europe per year.  The statistics on patient safety in the EU show alarming tendencies : - 1 in 10 patients are affected by hospital-acquired infections  - 3 million deaths are caused by hospital-acquired infections  An active infection control program of patients and personnel and hygiene measures, have proven to significantly reduce both the number of infections and hospitalisation costs .  The SONO project directly addresses the above problems by developing a pilot line for the production of medical antibacterial textiles.  The pilot line will be based on the scale-up of a sonochemical process developed and patented at BIU laboratories. The pilot line will use a sonochemical technique to produce and deposit inorganic, antimicrobial nanoparticles on medical textiles, e.g. hospital sheets, medical coats and bandages. Sonicators are used industrially for heavy and light duty cleaning, for water disinfection and for sewage treatment. It is also used in the food industry for emulsification and drying. The proposed concept based on one step sonochemical process to produce nanoparticles and impregnate them as antibacterial factors on textile is novel and does not exist on an industrial scale.  The concept has already been proven (and patented ) on a lab scale where sonochemistry was applied to impregnate nanoparticles in a single-step process.

The revenue generated by this industry is more than \u20ac400M in Europe. However, the European Union has a net negative trade-balance in bee products, mainly honey, producing only 54% of its demand (the EU imports from cheaper producers, namely Argentina and China). However, despite its importance and the obvious potential for growth, serious problems face the sector. Bee populations and beekeepers numbers in Europe have been falling at an alarming rate. Honey imports to the EU have risen by 20% since 2001. Action to halt the decline in the European beekeeping sector is also urgently needed because bees also play a vital role in agricultural productivity. The role of bees as a pollinator remains the most important economic contribution, far outweighing the collective importance of all hive products. The economic value of pollination worldwide is estimated to be at least \u20ac153 billion, which represented 9.5% of the value of the world agricultural production used for human food in 2005. More than 70% of food crops and 35% of food production still depend on pollinators; 84% of vegetables grown in Europe depend on pollination.\nOur project will develop the first monitoring tool that would detect changes in honey bee activity within the beehive for the effective management of bees. Changes in the activity within the hive will indicate early signs of potential swarming and possible poor health, so the beekeeper can intervene to manage the colony. The tool will allow beekeepers to remotely diagnose colony status without the invasive opening of hives for physical inspection.\nThis will increase the efficiency of beekeeping allowing small and hobby beekeepers to more closely manage their colonies and predict behaviour that requires intervention remotely, and will allow commercial beekeepers to keep more hives over greater geographical distances so increasing their efficiency and profitability.", 158253.0, 1467690.0, "Swarmonitor", "Monitoring honeybee for health and swarming prediction", "New tools for beekeepers to monitor the health and status of bee colonies remotely may benefit agricultural and honey industries by increasing productivity and pollination.", "Although there are 600\u00a0000 beekeepers in Europe, honey production is not keeping up with demand, due partly to an alarming decline in bee populations.

Swarming occurs when the queen leaves the hive with most of the worker bees to establish new colonies, and needs to be managed by beekeepers.\n\nResearchers fitted hives with instruments called accelerometers that measure vibrations, the data for which can be collected remotely. They encouraged swarming in a dedicated apiary with 20 hives fitted with accelerometers and commercial monitoring equipment that records the spectrum of vibrations.\n\nUsing vibrational data, researchers gave vibration patterns statistical scores that allow advance warning of a swarming event about to occur. Researchers are also using these experimental hives to monitor health conditions, including infestations by bee pathogens that can cripple an entire colony.\n\nSWARMONITOR's remote monitoring tools will allow more effective and less labour-intensive apiary management.

It addresses three types of recalcitrant raw materials: lignocellulosic residues from ethanol production, lignins dissolved during pulping process and lignin-like humins formed by sugars conversion. Enzymatic and process engineering will be implemented to design efficient conversion routes and permit technological breakthroughs. A transversal platform for the characterisation of biomolecules will be settled to identify bio-products of commercial interest among lignins and humins multifunctional nanoparticles, phenolic antioxidants, insects-based chitosans and aromatic chemical intermediates. Thanks to this platform, Zelcor will enhance knowledge of the structure-function relationships and the mechanisms involved in recalcitrant raw materials catalytic depolymerisation and bioconversion. Demonstration of the approach feasibility will be performed by process scaling-up, formulation of end-product prototypes and value chain sustainability and safety assessment. The presence of industrial partners all along the value chains, from lignocellulosic feedstock to end products, will facilitate demonstration activities and technological transfers.
