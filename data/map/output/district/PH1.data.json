Furthermore, as unambiguous and extensive information about overall effects of electrified bus systems and related needs for changes on infrastructure do not exist today, UITP sees its objectives and those matching perfectly, and this led UITP to build a consortium of 40 partners, who were already considering their actions along this theme, and to collectively design the 42-months demonstration project ZeEUS \u2013 Zero-Emission Urban Bus Systems.\n\nZeEUS project focus on the today's challenge in the electrification of bus system, the extension of the fully-electric solution to a wider part of the urban network. This goes through the development of electric vehicles of large capacity, and the creation of an infrastructure capable of providing the required charging energy, operated according to non-disruptive and grid-balancing principles.\n\nThe ZeEUS project will cover innovative electric bus solutions with different types of electrical power-train systems.

In consequence certification by the regulation authorities is restrictive.\nIn order to implement robust and reliable quality assurance procedures for adhesive bonding, the main objective of ENCOMB (Extended Non-Destructive Testing for Composite Bonds) is the identification, development and adaptation of methods suitable for the assessment of the adhesive bond quality. Since the performance of adhesive bonds depends on the physico-chemical properties of adherend surfaces and adhesives, testing methods for adhesive and adherend surface characterisation will also be developed.\nThe implementation of reliable adhesive bonding processes by advanced quality assurance will lead to an increased use of light-weight composite materials for highly integrated structures minimising rivet based assembly. The expected weight savings for the fuselage airframe are up to 15 %. These weight savings will have further effects on the size and weight of the engines.

The physicochemical properties are affected by a variety of factors, e.g. the degree of contamination, curing parameters, ageing or the activation after surface pre-treatment.\n\nTherefore, one of the ENCOMB project objectives was the adaptation of methods for characterisation of adhered surfaces before application of the adhesive. The second challenging goal was the development of techniques for evaluating the bonded components. Scientists defined this newly developed quality assurance technology as extended NDT (ENDT).\n\nFirstly, the most representative aeronautic application scenarios were identified. Suitable specimens were developed  and characterised using ENDT methods. The results were compared with those of a variety of conventional analytical methods and mechanical testing to evaluate their suitability for the specific measurement tasks.\n\nAmong others, researchers applied optical methods like laser scanning vibrometry, active thermography and a wetting test to characterise the state of adhered surfaces. Sensor-based techniques such as embedded optical fibre sensors or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were also tested as well as laser-excited and non-linear ultrasonic techniques.\n\nIn total, 31 ENDT technologies were tested for the assessment of adhered surfaces and the evaluation of adhesive bonds.

As a consequence e-education must be part of teacher training as well.\r\nOur project goals:\r\nFostering the knowledge of modern languages and intercultural communication\r\nTeaching staff that keeps improving their own competence in modern languages to act as role models for students\r\nIncrease of ICT in language classes\r\nIncrease of CLIL in primary and lower secondary schools\r\nIncreased use of the potential of collaboration within Europe\r\nFurther development of ICT competences as a basic prerequisite for innovation and collaboration in the field of education\r\nReinforcement of motivation and contentment of teaching staff\r\nIncreasing the number of joint projects in the province of Styria (School to school partnerships, eTwinning, A-Twinning)\r\nInitiatives to set up regional and European networks of teachers\r\nSetting up an online communication helpdesk for pupils operated by native speakers \r\nRaising awareness for the importance of language learning on all levels (teachers, inspectors, school authorities)\r\nExpanding of invitations to informal \"tea time chats\" for all teachers run by native speakers \r\nThe participants in job shadowing are headteachers and teachers who have been using innovative ways of teaching already and who are willing to share their experience with other colleagues within Europe. In addition school inspectors who have to guide schools with their school development as well as education psychologists who contribute their knowledge of learning styles to the implementation of successful inclusive learning environements take part in job shadowing and exchange meetings.\r\nAs far as job shadowing is concerned teachers usually have only limited knowledge of how other teachers of English act in their classes. Observing classes has become more frequent on secondary level, but is still the exception in primary schools for reasons as tight timetabling and English considered a low priority subject. Teachers need time to watch the students' learning process with both struggling and success. Teachers will volunteer to job shadowing and will indicate their interest to the Landesschulrat via their headteachers.\r\nTeachers who want to do intensive training in a course in Ireland or Scotland will come up with a selected course from the Erasmus+ SEG course catalogue. Teachers who choose courses that are in line with the school profile will get priority. Only schools with a school development plan that contains \"Improvement of language competence\" will be nominated. All participants must be willing to share their experience with other colleagues not taking part in the programme. They are to act as disseminators.\r\nThe strong impact of the consortium will help the region and the province to make faster progress aiming at the targets of Europe 2020. \r\nAbove all the project will serve the pupils: better learning performances achieved with the help of innovative and motivated teachers will improve the students career opportunities and will in the end strengthen the economy and as a consequence the province of Styria. Strong regions form the backbone of Europe.\r\nThe consortium consists of 1.300 compulsory school teachers plus  members of the school authority , teaching or being responsible for 7447 students. Out of this 1300 educational professionals 179 will do an European job-shadowing, 76 are intending to do a teacher training course, this means that around 19% of the staff members of the consortium will go for a mobility.  By this our project will have benefit for one-tenth of the compulsory students of our region.  The 51 participating schools consist of 38 primary schools and 13 NMS lower secondary schools.", "http://www.st-johnsacademy.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA101-034957_11"], ["1NA", "French Language Training", "Oakbank Primary School", 1888.0, "This project is to support the delivery of the 1+2 Scottish Government Initiative to introduce two languages beyond their mother tongue by the end of P7.

She has an intermediate level in Spanish, having attended a number of private courses over the past 5 years, and succeeded in obtaining a pass at 'Higher' Level in 2015. She has been teaching beginners classes in Spanish for a number of years. In order to improve her competence in this second language, as well as her knowledge of Hispanic culture, she is currently undertaking a self-funded Certificate of Continued Education course in Spanish at Strathclyde University. This is a two year course which Lisa will complete in May 2017. The participant wishes to participate in a three week language immersion course in Spain run by LFEE in July 2017. The course will provide further training in the target language, as well as language teaching methodology. On a local level, the course will help improve the participant's competence in Spanish language and knowledge of Spanish culture. It will enhance her teaching practice and, in turn, help improve the learning and teaching of the language at her school as it will allow her to gain and share with colleagues new ideas for activities and new resources, including ideas for incorporating ICT in the classroom. Completion of this course will also provide the beneficiary with the required period of 'residency' which will allow her to fully register Spanish as an additional teaching subject with the General Teaching Council of Scotland. This will mean she will be permitted to teach the language at National Certificate Level. The main second foreign language (L3) at Perth High School is Spanish.  It is hoped that the impact of the new curriculum will encourage more students to continue studying at least one foreign language beyond Secondary 3, and also increase the number of those opting to study 2 languages other than English. For this reason, it is desirable that the participant is fully qualified to teach Spanish in addition to French, in order to ensure progression for students in the language beyond a basic level. \r\nA wider impact for cluster schools is that the teacher plans to assist in training primary teaching colleagues at up to 8 feeder schools in basic level Spanish so that they in turn can include some Spanish as part of the 1+2 curriculum (L3). She will share teaching and learning ideas and resources with colleagues both at Perth High School and its feeder primary schools and make visits to these schools to provide taster sessions in the language to pupils. She will also be involved in developing and co-ordinating new resources for existing Spanish courses at Perth High School which she will share with her colleagues in her own school and also throughout other Perth and Kinross council area, generating a possible regional impact. An additional objective of this project will be to develop links for partner schools in Europe and explore ideas for promoting global citizenship (as part of the National Curriculum in Scotland).

In the Netherlands, with its small, open economy, there is a need for more information about various European countries and our position in relation to these countries.

Nimeto Utrecht believes it is important that students are given an opportunity to gain experience abroad. Although internationalization is already embedded in the organization, there is still room for improvement. Nimeto Utrecht is searching for more anchors abroad to connect with. This concerns internships for individual students, as well as collaboration projects or exchange programs with partner schools abroad. The project Internship abroad 1 caters to both students and employees who wish to do an internship abroad for a certain period of time. With Erasmus+ funding, more students and employees will become eligible for internship experiences in Europe, regardless of their financial situations. \r\n\r\nThe project Internship abroad 1 involves 14 students doing a  5-month professional internship at a company in Europe.\r\nThis means that the number of students participating in an internship abroad would double compared to last year. The project also offers 1 employee a chance to gain experience and knowledge at an educational institution in Europe over a period of two weeks or more. \r\nEspecially for the benefit of students and employees participating in European internships, Nimeto Utrecht created an assignment for one employee to coordinate all activities involved in the project Internship abroad 1 and work closely with the department for business contacts and the business coordinators responsible for the internships. \r\n\r\nBy participating in education and/or doing an internship abroad, students and employees of Nimeto Utrecht will become familiar with different cultures, have new experiences and broaden their horizons. An internship abroad will lead to additional challenges as well as motivated students and employees. An internship abroad will also lead to the broadening of knowledge and increased experience within the field of expertise, professional insights and a better understanding of the differences in European cultures, education and work environments.
