However, although technology is not yet fully matured and ready for wide commercialisation,  a large demonstration project will facilitate the market up-take of electric buses in Europe. Furthermore, as unambiguous and extensive information about overall effects of electrified bus systems and related needs for changes on infrastructure do not exist today, UITP sees its objectives and those matching perfectly, and this led UITP to build a consortium of 40 partners, who were already considering their actions along this theme, and to collectively design the 42-months demonstration project ZeEUS \u2013 Zero-Emission Urban Bus Systems.\n\nZeEUS project focus on the today's challenge in the electrification of bus system, the extension of the fully-electric solution to a wider part of the urban network. This goes through the development of electric vehicles of large capacity, and the creation of an infrastructure capable of providing the required charging energy, operated according to non-disruptive and grid-balancing principles.\n\nThe ZeEUS project will cover innovative electric bus solutions with different types of electrical power-train systems.

In consequence certification by the regulation authorities is restrictive.\nIn order to implement robust and reliable quality assurance procedures for adhesive bonding, the main objective of ENCOMB (Extended Non-Destructive Testing for Composite Bonds) is the identification, development and adaptation of methods suitable for the assessment of the adhesive bond quality. Since the performance of adhesive bonds depends on the physico-chemical properties of adherend surfaces and adhesives, testing methods for adhesive and adherend surface characterisation will also be developed.\nThe implementation of reliable adhesive bonding processes by advanced quality assurance will lead to an increased use of light-weight composite materials for highly integrated structures minimising rivet based assembly. The expected weight savings for the fuselage airframe are up to 15 %. These weight savings will have further effects on the size and weight of the engines.

In particular, non-destructive testing (NDT) technology capable of reliably assessing both composite structures' surfaces and adhesive bonds leads to difficulties in certification.\n\nThe strength of an adhesive bond depends among other things on the physicochemical properties of the adhered surfaces, adhesive and the joint. The physicochemical properties are affected by a variety of factors, e.g. the degree of contamination, curing parameters, ageing or the activation after surface pre-treatment.\n\nTherefore, one of the ENCOMB project objectives was the adaptation of methods for characterisation of adhered surfaces before application of the adhesive. The second challenging goal was the development of techniques for evaluating the bonded components. Scientists defined this newly developed quality assurance technology as extended NDT (ENDT).\n\nFirstly, the most representative aeronautic application scenarios were identified. Suitable specimens were developed  and characterised using ENDT methods. The results were compared with those of a variety of conventional analytical methods and mechanical testing to evaluate their suitability for the specific measurement tasks.\n\nAmong others, researchers applied optical methods like laser scanning vibrometry, active thermography and a wetting test to characterise the state of adhered surfaces. Sensor-based techniques such as embedded optical fibre sensors or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were also tested as well as laser-excited and non-linear ultrasonic techniques.\n\nIn total, 31 ENDT technologies were tested for the assessment of adhered surfaces and the evaluation of adhesive bonds.
