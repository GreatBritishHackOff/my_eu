However, those who are either incapacitated or elderly are often unable to take advantage of the opportunities offered by ICT. The dynamic nature and changing demands of the future European society is inevitably going to have socio-economic implications - with social inclusion at the forefront. Home automation is a $1.3bn industry with an estimated market value of $10bn by 2010, however the smart home market is an area with limited flexibility for the changing European society. The current solutions are expensive and require extensive expertise for operation. The market itself is fragmented, with the dominating players residing in the USA and Middle-East, as are the contributing devices/interfaces to the technology with little or no consideration for differing needs and abilities of the end-user. The Digital Smart Home Solution (DSHS) is a home automation system that will act as the \u2018glue\u2019 to integrate third-party devices compliant with the EIB/KNX communication standards. It will do so by providing a low-cost server architecture \u2013 the central intelligence unit (CIU) \u2013 comprising of a physical server (interfacing the devices), a software-based service gateway with underlying artificial intelligence capable of adapting the system to the intended user(s) and environment, and a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).

The purpose was to promote operational and technical collaboration. The 21-member consortium ran between June 2011 and May 2014.\n\nProject partners devised two sustainable means of achieving its objectives. First was the European Maritime Collaboration Portal (EMCP), a website enabling industry members to collaborate. The EMCP offers a searchable database listing innovative services and technologies, their providers and opportunities for collaboration such as tender calls. Users may build partnerships according to their needs and resources.\n\nThe project's second solution was the Technical Collaboration Platform (TCP). This provided an integrating and coordinating environment, supporting design and engineering software tools such as computer-aided design and computational fluid dynamic. The core functionality was the web-based ticket system, enabling automated online computation. Such mechanism is cheaper and more efficient than conventional solutions.\n\nEUROVIP prepared six case studies showing how EMCP and TCP benefit the maritime industry. Two operational-level examples illustrated effective use of the EMCP for finding tender calls and potential collaborators. Further examples illustrated TCP use for novel online computation services and for collaborative design work.\n\nDissemination activities included a project roadshow, and a series of events held across Europe. Such events expanded the participating membership almost 10-fold, and the pool of EMCP users increased from 30 to over 200.

Motorcyclists and cyclists are particularly vulnerable to injury, especially when accidents involve roadside barriers.\n\nSignificant European funding is being directed towards improving these so-called road restraint systems (RRS). The Smart RRS project looked at how technology can be employed to increase road safety.\n\nThe first step involved analysing data from accidents involving RRS, examining what body parts are most often affected, the role that speed and angle of impact play, and so on. This was complemented by an investigation of the current standards governing RRS as well as the latest advances in motorist safety technologies.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, the Smart RRS participants have begun designing and constructing different prototypes. Computer-based models are helping identify which materials and profiles deliver the best performance. Primary and tertiary sensors are also being developed that will, in addition to other functions, alert emergency services to the exact location of accidents in order to reduce response time.\n\nCare is being taken to ensure that the Smart RRS can be easily integrated into existing road infrastructure, that production and maintenance costs are minimised and, above all, that the system is robust and reliable.
