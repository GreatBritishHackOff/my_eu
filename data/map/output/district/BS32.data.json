It shows that the performance and operational flexibility of systems are enhanced  by exploiting the spectral efficiency of filter banks and the independence of sub-channels. Combining with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM), no cyclic prefix is needed, all the radiated power is used and gains in maximum throughput compared to OFDM are achieved. Robustness to Doppler and jammers is obtained and new functionalities are possible. The high resolution spectrum analysis capability is exploited for DASM and cognitive radio and a single device can do spectrum sensing and reception simultaneously.<br/>Research in signal processing is carried out to complete the knowledge in filter banks for transmission and satisfy  requirements of new radio systems: fast initialization, optimum transmit-receive processing for single and multiple antenna (MIMO) systems, scalability. Research in communications concerns dynamic access and cross-layer aspects, and compatibility with OFDM. In cognitive radio, research deals with radio scene analysis and channel identification and the impact of the independence of sub-channels on transmit power control and dynamic spectrum management. A simulation software is developed for a typical WiMAX configuration and scenario and performance comparison with OFDM is carried out. A real time soft/hardware demonstrator is built to complete simulation results and show efficient architectures.<br/>The expected impact of PHYDYAS is the migration of wireless systems to a physical layer that is more efficient and better responds to the needs of dynamic access and cognitive radio.

SAPHYRE will demonstrate how equal-priority resource sharing in wireless networks improves spectral efficiency, enhances coverage, increases user satisfaction, leads to increased revenue for operators, and decreases capital and operating expenditures.SAPHYRE represents a consortium that spans the entire chain from spectrum regulatory aspects, networking, physical layer to hardware implementation. The vision of SAPHYRE is to: (i) show how voluntary sharing of physical and infrastructure resources enables a fundamental, order-of-magnitude-gain in the efficiency of spectrum utilisation; (ii) develop the enabling technology that facilitates such voluntary sharing; (iii) and determine the key features of a regulatory framework that underpins and promotes such voluntary sharing.SAPHYRE's main objectives are conceptually described as:1. SAPHYRE will analyse and develop new self-organising physical layer resource (spectrum, spatial coexistence) sharing models by a generalised cross-layer and cross-disciplinary approach.2. SAPHYRE will propose and analyse efficient co-ordination mechanisms which require only small intervention (to counteract selfish, malicious users). In particular in sharing scenarios, incentive based design is applied in order to reduce regulatory complexity.3. SAPHYRE will develop a framework for infrastructure sharing to support quality of service with sufficiently wide carrier bandwidths and competition between different operators.Therefore, modern and novel physical layer techniques, including network and interference aware modulation/ coding, multi-antenna, spatial scheduling, multi-hop, relay co-operative transmission which lead to high spectral efficiency are developed.", null, 4472754.0, "SAPHYRE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_93262_999805579"], ["4UF", "Antenna Research and Technology for the Intelligent Car", "Alcatel Lucent Telecom Limited", "Antenna Research is a strategic enabling technology for intelligent vehicles and road safety services.

In addition, new applications such as interactive video make new demands on the transport layer, requiring the deployment of new protocols and extensions, the deployment of which is impaired by the proliferation of middleboxes that cause them to fail.

To ensure the applicability of the protocol, we will develop it on a background of middlebox behaviour models, derived from large-scale measurements of middleboxes in the public Internet conducted on top of a FIRE\\ testbed.
