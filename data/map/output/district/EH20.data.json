Neglected zoonoses, such as anthrax, rabies, brucellosis, bovine TB, zoonotic trypanosomiasis, echinococcosis, cysticercosis and leishmaniasis, are major causes of ill-health in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.  Production animals and companion animals of significant societal value act as reservoirs for transmission to man, and the burden of these diseases on affected communities is compounded by the adverse effects many diseases have on the productivity of livestock and hence the livelihoods of the poor. Control of these diseases in animals represents an opportunity to address the constraints they pose to both human health and animal productivity, thereby contributing to poverty reduction and the MDGs.  Effective control in animals will require scientific innovation to identify and (where necessary) develop tools for diagnosis, for quantification of disease burdens, and for control.  Public engagement at all stakeholder levels will be needed to ensure that strategies are appropriate for use in affected communities and are adopted within the policy framework of affected countries.  The project will: (i) map and review research activities at a global level, (ii) survey and assess the burden of zoonoses in communities, (iii) improve or develop disease control tools as appropriate for conditions in affected countries, with private sector inputs where appropriate, (iv) develop cost-effective control and prevention strategies taking into account economic, sociological and cultural factors as well as traditional knowledge, (v) build capacity in ICPCs through technology transfer and training and (vi) empower communities and policy makers to utilise control and prevention strategies appropriately and effectively.", null, 6448262.0, "ICONZ", "Interventions for neglected zoonoses", "Zoonoses, diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans and vice versa, pose a serious threat to human health and animal production. Particularly in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, these deadly diseases continue to affect lives and livelihoods.", "Twenty-one African and European partners have joined forces to develop suitable interventions for eight neglected zoonoses under the EU-funded project http://www.iconzafrica.org (ICONZ) . Their objective is to develop integrated control packages for the diseases anthrax, bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, cystic echinococcus, porcine cysticercosis, leishmaniasis, rabies and zoonotic trypanosomiasis.\n\nPartners have successfully completed baseline sample collection of over 22\u00a0000 animals and most of the data analyses in all 7 African International Co-operation Partner Countries (ICPCs). These were used as input for the field-based case studies along with the sociological research methodologies and epidemiological studies that were developed. As a result, ICONZ is the first multidisciplinary large-scale study undertaken across Africa on neglected zoonoses. \n\nResearchers developed techniques to assess the socioeconomic burden and costs arising from these eight zoonotic diseases. Findings have been published in journals and presented at international conferences and workshops. They are now working on identifying risk factors and creating a knowledge base on best practices to develop cost-effective and appropriate intervention strategies and protocols.\n\nICONZ collaborated with another EU-funded project, DISCONTOOLS, and developed an inventory system for all eight zoonoses. This inventory consists of details like diagnostic tools, treatment and policy recommendations for each of these diseases and data are being updated regularly. Diagnostic and quality assurance tests for these diseases were successfully optimised.  Project members also developed a database cataloguing all relevant research and publications as well as funding sources for the zoonoses-of-interest. \n\nBesides the project website, outcomes were presented at international meetings and conferences and published in six issues of the ICONZ magazine in French and English. ICONZ also participated in high-profile events such as the One Health congresses in Melbourne (2011) and Bangkok (2013). \n\nProject activities should ensure a more accurate picture of the eight neglected zoonoses and their negative socioeconomic impact. Community and stakeholder engagement should also ensure implementation of effective policies and practices on zoonotic diseases. Practical, effective and community-acceptable treatment and control tools such as vaccines and medicines will soon be within reach.", null, "http://www.lab901.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/143621.jpg", "fp7_90293_998260854"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EH20"}
