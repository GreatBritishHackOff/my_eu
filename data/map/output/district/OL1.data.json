However, the take-up of simulation software by SMEs has until now been low due to high barriers of entry that include hardware prices, licensing costs and technical expertise. The CloudSME project will develop a cloud-based, one-stop-shop solution that will significantly lower these barriers, provide a scalable platform for small or larger scale simulations, and enable the wider take-up of simulation technologies in manufacturing and engineering SME's. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will support end user SME's to utilise customised simulation applications in the form of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) based provision. Moreover, simulation software service providers and consulting companies will have access to a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution that enables them to quickly assemble custom simulation solutions in the cloud for their clients. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will be built on existing and proven technologies provided by the project partners and partially developed in previous European projects. Building on existing technology will enable the project to deliver its results quickly. The project consortium includes experienced partners, incorporating 12 SME's, from cloud hardware and platform providers, to simulation software providers, end users and technology integrators. To guarantee greater impact of the developed solution, additional use-cases will be provided by a further 10 partners following an open call after the first year of the project. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will dramatically change the way in which manufacturing/engineering SME's utilise simulation solutions today, and will provide new business opportunities not only to end-user SME's, but also to simulation software and cloud service providers.A typical experimental scenario in the project is based around an insole design simulation program developed by one of the partners, used for designing tailored insoles for sports footwear and for people with foot problems. The end user company in the project has patented a method for scanning feet in 3D and the experiment will involve linking this to a cloud-based version of the simulation software to design insoles and simulate the interaction of feet and insoles. In turn, this design is loaded into a CNC machine to manufacture the insoles. The aim of the cooperation is to establish a portal through which scans can be uploaded to the cloud-based software service which then validates the scanned image to produce the design. The experiment will explore the extent to which the service supporting the lifecycle of tailored insole production can be achieved. This will immediately lead to extensions of the software for checking images within other industries unrelated to the footwear business.", 150591.0, 4193116.0, "CloudSME", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_109223_990877408"], ["3LN", "On-the-cloud environment implementing agile management methods for enabling the set-up, monitoring and follow-up of business innovation processes in industrial SMEs", "Charles Robinson (Cutting Tools) Ltd", "The ExtremeFactories project proposes the conception of a collaborative internet-based platform with semantic capabilities (by means of ontology modeling) that implements a new methodology for the adoption of a systematic innovation process in globally acting networked SMEs. The platform will support SMEs to manage and implement the complex innovation processes arisen in a networked environment, taking into account their internal and external links, by enabling an open multi-agent focused innovation (i.e. a customer/provider/supplier/employee focused innovation). The solution will be specifically focused on the needs of manufacturing companies and will observe both product and process innovation.The construction of the ExtremeFactories methodology will be based on individual practices found in traditional innovation management methods, such as TRIZ, combined with a selected group of practices obtained from different Agile Methodologies (such as Extreme Programming, SCRUM and others). (The project gets its name from the ExtremeProgramming methodology).The platform will be built upon a service oriented architecture, implementing semantic functionalities. This platform will provide the SMEs with services to support them in any step of the innovation life-cycle (problem detection, inception of ideas, priorization of ideas, implementation and follow-up).The project has a strong industrial basis, putting together the efforts of 7 industrial manufacturing SMEs in the way to become virtual networked organizations by the way they handle their relationships to third parties, such as customers, suppliers, distributors, etc. This big effort will result in a methodology and platform that will be validated and assessed in predefined business scenarios at these organizations.The project proposes a solid dissemination plan, offering a community management activity in order to get a wider target, as well as a first version of an exploitation plan to be further detailed.", 124126.0, 2663880.0, "EXTREMEFACTORIES", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_100324_990877408"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1DN", "< 25 // Alternative Routes to Ripen through Theatre", "PESHKAR PRODUCTIONS LIMITED", 165446.0, "Adults have always defined young people.

This piece would be elaborated in various residencies in Spain, Portugal and United Kingdom. Residencies allow protecting the process from external influences. It is a way of living as well. It is a social and an artistic issue. Coexistence produces new materials that should be put into play. The performers could be students or graduated students and the directors would be young as well, although the figure of mature Observer is also present. This mature Observer is meant to detect and make them notice where and when are they using old forms instead of inventing new and original ones.
