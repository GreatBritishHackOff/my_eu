However, the take-up of simulation software by SMEs has until now been low due to high barriers of entry that include hardware prices, licensing costs and technical expertise. The CloudSME project will develop a cloud-based, one-stop-shop solution that will significantly lower these barriers, provide a scalable platform for small or larger scale simulations, and enable the wider take-up of simulation technologies in manufacturing and engineering SME's. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will support end user SME's to utilise customised simulation applications in the form of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) based provision. Moreover, simulation software service providers and consulting companies will have access to a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution that enables them to quickly assemble custom simulation solutions in the cloud for their clients. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will be built on existing and proven technologies provided by the project partners and partially developed in previous European projects. Building on existing technology will enable the project to deliver its results quickly. The project consortium includes experienced partners, incorporating 12 SME's, from cloud hardware and platform providers, to simulation software providers, end users and technology integrators. To guarantee greater impact of the developed solution, additional use-cases will be provided by a further 10 partners following an open call after the first year of the project. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will dramatically change the way in which manufacturing/engineering SME's utilise simulation solutions today, and will provide new business opportunities not only to end-user SME's, but also to simulation software and cloud service providers.A typical experimental scenario in the project is based around an insole design simulation program developed by one of the partners, used for designing tailored insoles for sports footwear and for people with foot problems. The end user company in the project has patented a method for scanning feet in 3D and the experiment will involve linking this to a cloud-based version of the simulation software to design insoles and simulate the interaction of feet and insoles. In turn, this design is loaded into a CNC machine to manufacture the insoles. The aim of the cooperation is to establish a portal through which scans can be uploaded to the cloud-based software service which then validates the scanned image to produce the design. The experiment will explore the extent to which the service supporting the lifecycle of tailored insole production can be achieved. This will immediately lead to extensions of the software for checking images within other industries unrelated to the footwear business.", 150591.0, 4193116.0, "CloudSME", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_109223_990877408"], ["3LN", "On-the-cloud environment implementing agile management methods for enabling the set-up, monitoring and follow-up of business innovation processes in industrial SMEs", "Charles Robinson (Cutting Tools) Ltd", "The ExtremeFactories project proposes the conception of a collaborative internet-based platform with semantic capabilities (by means of ontology modeling) that implements a new methodology for the adoption of a systematic innovation process in globally acting networked SMEs.

The proportion of pupils entitled to free school meals is double the national average. All pupils are of minority ethnic heritage and many are learning English as an Additional Language. A small minority are in the early stages of English language acquisition. The proportion of pupils with special educational needs and/or disabilities is well above average, with an average proportion of statements of special educational needs.\r\n\r\nIn 2014 we submitted a successful application to send 12 participants to Spain to take part in immersion courses there and support language development back at St Hilda's. As a result of this project, we have successfully implemented Spanish across the School, raised awareness of Spanish culture and made a direct and positive impact on the profile of languages at St Hilda's. We would like to capitalise on this success with a view to further developing languages at St Hilda's, and also further enhance our partnership with our link school.\r\n\r\nWe now have more teachers teaching Spanish, but who have not been on the immersion course. We would like them to have the opportunity to develop their skills to be able to teach Spanish at the high quality standard that we see in other classes. Furthermore, we would like the Spanish Coordinators to have the opportunity to develop further ideas and deepen links with our partner school, so we can continue with the success of the previous project.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the goals set out above, we plan for a further group of staff to take part in immersion courses in Spain. We plan to use six mobilities as part of this project. \r\n\r\nBy taking part in these courses, participants will greatly increase their skills and confidence to teach Spanish in their own classes, and embed language learning in other areas of the curriculum.  They will also be confident to support other colleagues within our school and better able to include Spanish learning into our curriculum and in our daily routines. This will make language teaching more sustainable in our school and more effective as languages will be reinforced through the week. \r\n\r\nOur MFL Coordinators will lead the project and ensure that all participants are fully prepared and briefed throughout the project.
