They are therefore  largely unprepared to face the increasing demands for health services arising from the expansion of an older population with specific  medical needs related to multiple chronic disorders. As a consequence, the medical conditions of a large and growing segment of the older European population are not efficiently managed by the available healthcare services. Among these conditions, the geriatric syndrome of frailty has emerged as a significant public health priority. It is defined as a multidimensional condition characterised by decreased reserve and diminished resistance to stressors. Such extreme vulnerability exposes the older individual to an increased risk of morbidity, disability, inappropriate healthcare use, institutionalization, poor quality of life, and death. Early detection and prevention of frailty are thus crucial to impede its progression and the development of its detrimental clinical consequences, while ensuring sustainability of healthcare systems of the Member States. Unfortunately, to date, no healthcare programs or pharmacological treatments are available for frail older people. This is largely due to the lack of a precise, universal definition of frailty, linked in turn to the multidimensional nature of the condition. Eventually, the existing gaps in knowledge are reflected by the absence of effective interventions. Such a barrier may be overcome by developing and validating a robust conceptual framework to achieve a practical operationalisation of frailty. This should precisely define its pathophysiological and clinical foundations, to assist in the design and implementation of specific interventions aimed at restoring robustness and delaying the onset of adverse outcomes. The present \u201cSarcopenia and Physical fRailty IN older people: multi-componenT Treatment strategies\u201d (SPRINTT) project is specifically designed to overcome the existing barriers for an efficient public health intervention against frailty, and promote the implementation of successful aging strategies across Europe. \nTo reach such an ambitious goal, the actions of the SPRINTT Consortium are directed towards the achievement of a consensus among academia, regulators, industry (pharmaceutical and medical devices), and patients\u2019 representatives over \n(1) clear operationalisation of the presently vague concept of frailty; \n(2) identification of a target population with unmet medical needs; \n(3) evaluation and validation of methodologies for implementing preventive and therapeutic strategies among frail elders at risk of disability in the European Union; \n(4) definition of an experimental setting as a template for regulatory purposes and pharmaceutical investigations; \n(5) identification of biomarkers and health technology solutions to be implemented into clinical practice. \nThus, the project is expected to pursue all the research deliverables described in nine work-packages.\nThe SPRINTT project proposes a novel operationalisation of physical frailty recognising sarcopenia as its central biological substrate. This approach is based on the fact that the physical frailty phenotype overlaps substantially  with sarcopenia. Indeed, many of the adverse outcomes of frailty are probably mediated by sarcopenia, which may therefore  represent both the biological substrate for the development of physical frailty and the pathway through which the negative health outcomes of frailty ensue. Although physical frailty encompasses only a part of the frailty spectrum, the identification of a definite biological basis (i.e., skeletal muscle decline and loss of mobility function) opens new venues for the development of interventions to slow or reverse the progression of this condition. It is noteworthy that all of the components characterising the Physical Frailty and Sarcopenia (PF&S) model are measurable and qua", null, 41731203.0, "SPRINTT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.niche.org.uk", null, "fp7_203718_964674313"], ["6QF", "Elimination of NOx, SOx and Particulates in Rail Transportation", "Fluid Technologies (Environmental) Ltd", "Locomotive engines are significant contributors to air pollution in many cities and ports. Although locomotive engines being produced today must meet relatively modest emission requirements set in 1997, they continue to emit large amounts of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter (PM).\nThe 2008 Clean Air Non-road Diesel Rule stipulates new requirements for non-road diesel fuel that will decrease the allowable levels of sulphur in fuel used in locomotives by 99 percent. These fuel improvements will create immediate and significant environmental and public health benefits by reducing PM from existing engines. The rule also establishes long-term, Tier 4, standards for newly-built engines based on the application of high-efficiency catalytic aftertreatment technology, beginning in 2015.\nAlthough established Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) processes appear effective, there remain several problems such as high reaction temperatures, which sometimes require reheating of the flue gas, a large reactor volume, and the need for reductant ammonia. In addition, the process is not applicable to NO in low concentrations and at ambient temperature. As NO2 is easily removed by water, catalytic oxidation of NO to NO2 at a low temperature is a promising way of removing NO in flue gas without using ammonia.\nIn the ENSPIRIT project, the core research work will focus on the production of a pre-production prototype catalytic device for NO oxidation over Activated Carbon at ambient temperature. The catalytic device will be integrated into a system of combined devices for the removal of heat, moisture, Sulphur oxides, ultrafine particulate matter and Nitrogen oxides.

Recent documents stress the necessity of testing the clinical utility (in terms of risk prediction, diagnosis validity and prognostic significance) of the existing definition of frailty by using combinations of clinical criteria (current definition) and lab Biomarkers (BMs).\nWe will measure the levels of blood and urine omic-based BMs in old people selected from eight cohorts, which include up to 75,000 participants, using standardized and innovative technology (WP1). This figure will allow us to test the research questions with a high power and validity. Combining these lab BMs with clinical BMs, we will develop predictive, diagnostic and prognostic models (WP2), with its modulation by nutrition and physical activity, in general old population and in old people showing some characteristics that confer a high risk for developing frailty (selected cardiovascular risk factors and diseases) (WP4).
