Innovative approaches to delivering specialist support services will be explored in two areas:\r\n\r\nTOPIC 1 \"MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR VOCATIONAL EXPERIENCE ABROAD FOR DISADVANTAGED YOUTH\" It is is widely recognized by experts that the international exchange of young people offers significant opportunities for formal and informal learning. The impementation of this for disadvantaged youth will be the subject of partner contact seminars.  The aim is to explore how opportunities could be offered regularly to young  people as part of external vocational training. \r\n\r\nTOPIC 2 \"EXCHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT OF GOOD PRACTICE IN WORK WITH UNACCOMPANIED YOUNG REFUGEES\".  Young unaccompanied refugees face many practical problems linked to both their situation and their personal perspective. Professionals are keen to support young refugees well, but need support to develop good practice.  High workload often prevents reflection and the development of good practice and new ideas. The partner contact seminars  aim to create an opportunity for an exchange of good practice and the development of innovative approaches.", "http://www.hertsdirect.org", null, "erasmus_2014-3-DE04-KA105-001458_1"], ["8DQ", "Boulevard of Dreams", "HERTFORDSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL", 86300.0, "Young adults are permantely in motion regardless whether they are or aren\u2019t actively engaged in their educational or professional career. They are continually confronted with changes that affect their personal situation and learning process. This requires flexibility, a positive attitude, motivation and perseverance. It is necessary that young adults but especially those with fewer opportunities or NEETs learn to anticipate to the changes in the labor market and society. They have to be motivated to gain: new insights and complementary skills acquired. If this motivation is lacking there is a high risk to establish a social destructive identity and exclusion. As mentioned in section C.1.3 MYT is actively involved in creating a better future for this targetgroup. After a meeting  in Brussel november 2014,  we concluded that in  different European countries, the challenges with NEETs are similair. We met these partners  and we feel that they all bring relevant expertise in the field and that we all face the same challenges. Unemployment, the risks of dropping out school etc. To reduce those risks we decided to co-operate to exchange methods of knowledge and competences with the following objectives:\r\n\r\n- to gain a greater understanding of interconnections between formal and non-formal education, training and the labour market respectively; \r\n- to gain a broader understanding of practices, policies and systems in education, training for NEETs across countries; \r\n- to gain a greater understanding and responsiveness to  cultural and social economical aspects that are triggers for NEETs to be discouraged, unmotivated and uninspired;\r\n- to improve foreign language and intercultural competences;\r\n- to better the quality of our work and activities in favour of  NEETs;\r\n-to share best practices, useful methods and to gain innovative ideas.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to create a method that in cooperation will combat the negative consequences of youngsters in the social and economical depraved areas such as  leaving school with no diploma. Many young people that grow up in these areas inherits an outsider identity/position with a lower potential for inclusion in society/labour market and a high risk to establish a social destructive identity. The project  further aims to exchange methods of knowledge and competences \u2013 and for that reason we consider this Erasmus + project to be a perfect complement. We need to improve the knowledge of methods on how to work with NEETs. \r\n\r\nThe project is designed for youthworkers, projectmanagers and trainers, whom represent youth organisations, local authorities, or work in local governments or other public institutions that have experience in project developement, methods and activities for NEETs. The participants for the training and studyvisits must have relevant experiences with the target group, want to learn and co-create, speak english and must be older then 18 and will be selected by the partner organisations. \r\n\r\n - the participant must be a citizen of one of the Erasmus + programme countries (28 European Union countries + Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey);\r\n- the participant must be able to communicate in English;\r\n- the participant must be willing to learn and work with other people at an international level;\r\n- the participant is interested in projects or working with  NEETs or young adults with fewer opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe activities which will be held are  seminars, training and study visits. The objective  of the first seminar is to discuss similarties, setting inventory and making a selection of avaiblable methodologies. The second seminar aims to review execution and exhange of knowledge by experts. The closing seminar aims to present results, methodology and conclusions. The objective of the training is a lifelong learning, co-creating, exchanges of methodologies and experiences. The aim of the study visits is a lifelong learning, experience of methodology, acquiring knowledge and insight in the backgrounds of non- formal educations Neets, improvement of response to the needs of NEETs and set-up of a collective methodolgy. \r\n\r\nThe expected impact on the participants and participating organisations are:\r\n- they have created a sense of awareness concerning NEETs across European countries and de social economical influences;\r\n- they are more inspired to motivate young adults with fewer oportunities with new methodologies;\r\n- they have a more knowledge of interconnections between formal and  non-formal education, training and the labour market respectively; \r\n- they are more inspired to use a  foreign language; \r\n- they have more knowledge of their own entrepenerial and organizational skills;\r\n\r\nThe desired impact of the project at the local, regional, national and European level is:\r\n1. the project has created a sense of awareness concerning NEETs across European countries;\r\n2. the project has influenced policy and workingmethods concerning NEETs and young adults with fewer opportuni", "http://www.hertsdirect.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-NL02-KA105-000929_1"], ["8PQ", "Vzdel\u00e1vanie bez hran\u00edc", "THE INSTITUTE OF THE MOTOR INDUSTRY", 63794.0, "Our school, as the holder of the Charter of mobility has in detail a \"European school  development planl.\" Its main aims are :\r\n- to prepare graduates for the European labor market in the required quality and the needs of employers\r\n- to provide them with opportunities for the development of language skills and social skills.\r\n P roject \"Education Without Borders\" is the second project implemented after the award of accreditation for our school This means, that it continuous  at the same time realized the project and we will continue to implement the ideas of our strategy. Implementation will be focused on the high quality of the educational process within the framework of our partnerships and the fulfillment of the quantitative indicators. \r\n         The main project activities are focused on two target groups: teachers / master of vocational training and   teachers) and students. Pedagogues will be strengthen its key competencies within four mobilities  and gain experience in the field of dual education. This  activity are realized for the first time and we  consider it  as a very important part of the process of transforming our  school into educational institution of a European dimension.\r\n           The second target group are our students from all study and training branches . They   will participate  an internship abroad   in 7 European countries in order  to gain competencies  in the scope pretreated learning outcomes. All learning outcomes are content focused on the professional competencies that we aren`t able to  ensure in the required quality in the domestic environment because of the lack of high-quality technology.

At this level are the major   country  Great Britain and Germany, but we expect improvement in all countries. The most important part of our strategy is the publicity and dissemination of project results. We will provide it to the media and various professional events. Recognition of the project results will be ensured through certificates and Europass Mobility. In some interships abroad  we will use elements of ECVET and  we will try to incorporate them  into the greatest number of mobilities.\r\n           Our strategy is also filled  through the project \"STEP AHEAD\" implemented through the Activity KA2 and strategic partnerships. In this project we have trained teachers and masters  of vocational training  in the creation of interactive educational materials.
