Activities will directly address targets set out in the Europe 2020 strategy to promote youth, employability of young people, lifelong learning, the countering of social exclusion and the promotion of active citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe theme, \u201cOcean Citizens of the Future, has been selected because Plymouth and Brest are both experts in the maritime field and the project focuses on the integration of this environment into the social and economic well-being of both cities, while raising the awareness of their citizens to well qualified jobs and recruitment opportunities within the maritime sector. This fits in well with current major developments to reinvigorate the regions\u2019 marine and advanced manufacturing sectors, significantly increasing job opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe partnership will be coordinated by the two regional education authorities, working closely with eight schools, covering a range of demographic profiles from socially deprived to more economically-advantaged across the whole age range i.e. 3 \u2013 18 years. Teachers in these schools have already been involved in extensive project planning, designed to make the fullest possible use of the outstanding coastal environments, as well as contacts with local businesses and industries accessible to the partner schools in both countries, including tourism, commerce, port industries and military bases. \r\n\r\nThe schools and education authorities will work together with other key organisations with international reach, including Brest'Aim -Oc\u00e9anopolis in Brest and the UK\u2019s National Maritime Aquarium (NMA) in Plymouth. Both have major roles in research and educational provision and will play a strategic part in project support, multiplier events and dissemination of results. Other more local groups and small scale organisations with entrepreneurial approaches likely to appeal to young people will also be involved. Both cities have a vibrant range of major cultural activities and events which draw on the cities\u2019 maritime histories and environments. These will be fully integrated into opportunities for all involved in the project i.e. 5000 +.\r\n\r\nShared collaborative activities will bring an added value to the competences of the partners through meeting clearly identified needs of young people, who need support and encouragement to appreciate and develop the skills needed to succeed in the wider environment of today\u2019s Europe.\r\n\r\nEcological, economic and social challenges for the regions will be explored in ways designed to generate real impact and meaning for students, teachers and the wider communities.  Ocean Citizens of the Future will encourage the young people involved to appreciate and interact with ecological and environmental issues within their shared European environment, through their joint international activities, communication and integrated mobilities. This will encourage them to become more proactive citizens with a heightened development of initiative and increased language skills.\r\n\r\nProject results will include:\r\nYoung Reporters of Arts and Sciences . Activities and events with Oc\u00e9anopolis and the NMA.\r\nExhibition: Compendium of Good Practices. Developed as a continuing resource and online facility throughout the project, to include pedagogical approaches and successful professional practice.\r\nEnhancing the Cities.  Comparison of maritime worlds of Brest and Plymouth.  Audio and video guides by students for students. [Some translation].  A pedestrian circuit / rally will be organized.\r\nPanel of Maritime Jobs.  Exhibition of recorded work, promoted through key events [ STEMFEST etc. ]\r\nFull regional Media Coverage.\r\n\r\nThis work will also provide significant opportunities for the professional development of teachers engaged in creating and delivering the programme. They will gain experience from different pedagogical approaches and create bonds with their pupils and other colleagues by working together in a different environment.  All partners will gain a better knowledge of how to maximise the use of resources, working collaboratively, and building on the effective relationships formed. They will also develop more sophisticated, practical knowledge and expertise of IT skills appropriate for extending international collaborative partnerships.\r\n\r\nThe longer term benefits of the project are that Plymouth and Brest will be able to collaborate more effectively as they will have increased awareness of each other\u2019s backgrounds. By creating bonds between the pupils, teachers and other professionals we hope to raise European consciousness and favour the mixing of social classes and cultural origins as well as fighting prejudice.", "http://www.plymstockschool.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA201-015311_7"]]}}}}
