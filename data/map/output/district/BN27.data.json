The mythos Individual Producer Responsibility will be investigated if it can become the all-healing-solution in electronics industry as well as how this concept can be applied to other industrial sectors. WP2 concentrates on new technological developments, WP3 on waste prevention methodologies and strategies and WP4 will adapt existing software tools supporting waste prevention. All this knowledge will be then formalised into an innovative production model for resource-use optimisation and waste prevention in WP5. This preparatory work will enable the 9 industrial case studies in Work package 6 that forms the core of the ZeroWIN project with more than half of the total budget. These case studies will be used to prove that the ZeroWIN approach can meet at least 2 of the stringent targets of the call. WP7 closely monitors and validates the improvements by quantitative assessment. WP 8 investigates the implications to policy and formulates recommendations. Finally WP9 will disseminate the results of ZeroWIN as broad as possible and WP10 ensures the efficient operation of the ZeroWIN project. By concentrating on industrial networks in the automotive, construction, electronics and photovoltaic industries ZeroWIN will address \u2022 nearly 3 million companies (of which 80% are SMEs) \u2022 with more than 2,8 trillion \u20ac turnover and a value creation of more than 800 billion \u20ac \u2022 with more than 20 million employees \u2022 creating about 40% or more than 400 million tons of industrial waste \u2022 using as much as 50% of all materials extracted from the earth\u00b4s crust \u2022 generating about 40% of all energy use and about 35% of all greenhouse gas emissions.

The consortium worked towards a 30\u00a0% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, 70\u00a0% reuse and recycling of waste, and a 75\u00a0% reduction in freshwater use.\n\nResearchers developed a roadmap for using radio frequency identification tags to manage and track waste. They also investigated a range of other smart technologies for real-time monitoring and identification of waste.\n\nA knowledge management platform similar to Wikipedia was designed, and it is known as http://www.4980.timewarp.at/sat/ZeroWIN/wiki/index.php/Main_Page (Zerowin Wiki). In addition, knowledge gathered and generated throughout ZEROWIN was compiled into a production model for waste prevention and into an online guide to waste entrepreneurship.\n\nFinally, the project used 10 case studies from around Europe to prove that the objectives and technologies developed during ZEROWIN are viable and can inform policymaking.

The United States dominates global supply, providing over 49% of access and support devices sold worldwide. Within Europe, they control 29% of the market, with European suppliers only holding 21% of the European market. Global sales of wheelchairs and access products are increasing at 5% pa, whilst the market share of European access companies fell last year by 2% At the same time the EU is imposing legislation and guidelines to improve the disabled access situation on all forms of public transport. As the number of wheelchair users continues to grow each year, our consortium needs to grow new products to take market share back from the US giants and keep pace with the increasing market. To counter this downward trend, our consortium intends to develop the CarGo concept, to permit greater numbers of wheelchair users to gain access to popular cars by developing a wheelchair and accompanying electrically powered lifting system, capable of lifting the user and wheelchair into a vehicle without physical input from the user or helper. Many current products require permanent modification to the vehicle, or outside assistance to store the wheelchair elsewhere in the vehicle during transport. We will develop an innovative electro-mechanical system to carry the user and their wheelchair into the passenger seat space of a car through a complex, optimised path. Our system will allow wheelchair users to travel in a wider range of popular family cars than is currently available, and will impose no permanent modifications to the vehicle, drastically increasing the resale value of the car.", 124460.0, 1035550.0, "CARGO", "Wheelchair-friendly cars", "An EU team developed an integrated wheelchair and lift system, including special new chairs, adaptable to a range of popular cars.

Currently, the few suitable vehicles that do exist require expensive and irreversible modifications, and a wheelchair-bound person cannot independently operate the lifting equipment.\n\nThe EU Disability Strategy calls for identification and removal of such barriers. Hence, the EU-funded http://www.cargo-fp7.eu (CARGO) project aimed to increase the range of options. The six-member consortium worked to realise its CarGo concept, consisting of new wheelchairs paired with new lifts, permitting access to a range of standard vehicles. The system automatically lifts the wheelchair-plus-occupant together into the passenger space, without requiring manual control or input. The wheelchair is restrained to the same safety standards as any normal car seat. CARGO operated between December 2010 and May 2013.\n\nInitial work involved creating a database of the interior spaces available in the 10 most popular family cars in 3 classes. For each, the project calculated the motion paths necessary to achieve access.\n\nThe consortium designed and validated a new type of wheelchair. The stage included designing or otherwise obtaining, then testing, a variety of sub-systems, including wheel-mounting mechanisms, locks and associated mechanisms. The prototype wheelchair design was manufactured and validated.\n\nTeam members also designed and produced software and hardware control systems to allow autonomous operation. The complete prototype system was installed in the vehicles for which it was designed, successfully demonstrating the concept.\n\nCARGO produced a new and integrated wheelchair/lift system, permitting wheelchair access to the passenger space in a variety of popular vehicles.

PARTICIPANTS: 3 determined groups: September \u2013 October 2017 (Graduating professional BAC chefs and waiters, 7 weeks), Jannuary-February 2018 (Graduating technological BAC hospitality, 5 weeks) and April-May 2018 (Reception, 7 weeks) It is of dire necessity that they gain experience moving around in order to ensure their professional and language proficiency as well as gaining other skills while being true European citizens who can immerse themselves in local cultures as future European workers. It is also essential that the students realize the benefits of gaining work experience abroad. They will be discovering and analysing a new culture through immersion and a quality support program and encountering local young people through European partners which will help them acquire intercultural experience and behaviour essential to their ultimate satisfaction. They need to master behaviour codes and language registers as well gain self-confidence in the work environment. The various beneficial professional, linguistic, cultural, professional, and personal factors make this an enriching experience that reinforces their skills and ensures their professional success. After two successful projects (2013-2014 and 2015/2017), the program would like to lean away from expertise to focus more on exchanges and European mobility in order to portray an attractive and enriching experience while using an international approach in teaching and educational practices. The initiation project depends largely on international openness and the installation of solid partners willing to facilitate students\u2019 mobility in order to foster best practices among European teachers and make the most of the students\u2019 training. Thus language is giving top priority (ETOILE label, Cervantes, Cambridge et Goethe language certifications). We are registered in the touristic development of the Languedoc-Roussillon region where there is an increasing need for highly qualified hospitality professionals to meet growing needs in the tourism industry.\r\nPARTNERSHIPS: The project depends on quality partnerships among secondary schools, a university, various companies, and educational institutions that have experience hosting, training, supporting, and evaluating students. Hosting companies offer high quality service as intermediary establishments assuring connections. These top quality cultural environments allow an exceptional cultural preparation plan (i.e. saffron culture, Le Greco, Cervant\u00e8s, Don Quichote in Toledo, Mir\u00f3 and Barcel\u00f3 in Palma, Dal\u00ed and Picasso in Catalonia, Guiness's distillery in Dublin, William the Conqueror and the hastings's battle...) \r\nDESTINATIONS: Spain: Toledo (Castilla la Mancha), Palma de Mallorca (Balearic Islands) and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Canarian Islands). Poland: Lublin (Lublinie). England: Eastbourne and Hastings (East Sussex). Ireland: Dublin. \r\n EVALUATION: We can ensure that we will achieve our anticipated results using post-mobility assessment meetings, questionnaires to be completed by students and companies, debriefing interviews, oral language exams, and specific exams conducted in european courses.", "http://www.webbesrestaurants.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036137_4"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["4HU", "RX2", "AMBERSTONE HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BN27"}
