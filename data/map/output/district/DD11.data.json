Getting the right information is complex and must consider all alternatives and special factors like time and cost related user preferences, number of hops, and other. Moreover, information about dynamic conditions (delays, traffic, weather) that affect the trip are also necessary for the user on time. Existing systems are providing such services at a single transport level, but the combination of multi-level (urban and interurban) information at wider scale and the delivery of dynamic personalized data has not been addressed. Complexity arises when either city/nation or transport network system boundaries have to be crossed, to form a path that includes destinations, intermediaries, transit points, types of moves and changes of transport mode. This project aims to co-ordinate systems which provide journey planner services to cooperate and form complex answers, produce real-time personalized information and deliver it at crucial points during the trip. The project will: -Design/implement a network of interconnected Journey Planner systems to combine urban and Long-Distance Transport information services. This will be a Wide-Scale Journey Planner that unifies multimodal transport data and provides a one-stop-shop for complex answers combining all involved means. -Define a uniform information delivery service with personalized features via multiple devices for information push and pull. Personalisation will be achieved with rule-based processing of the data based on a trip cycle model and personal editable preferences. -Combine information delivery with transactioning for personalized needs including booking &amp; payment, definition of alert rules and profiles for automated suggestions on selected trips and frequent traveler profiles. -Demonstrate the service. A demonstrator is envisaged to cover at least 3 countries.", 68350.0, 1810116.0, "WISETRIP", "Travel planning gets easier", "New ways to facilitate trip planning across different transport means will lead to more efficiency for travellers and offer a host of advantages.", "An online system that combines all different modes of transport and helps people plan their journeys can help streamline travel and support travellers in unprecedented ways. The EU-funded project WISETRIP aimed to design such a system for international travellers. It worked on a centralised mechanism that connects all participating web-based travel engines together in an effective way, keeping the data simple and minimal.\n\nTo achieve its aims, the project elaborated a core algorithmic interface that dissects trip query components, identifies gateway nodes for each, pinpoints relevant journey planners and responds to travellers. The system works over the internet or through mobile access, creating a tool that filters results, defines preferences regarding transport modes and offers personalised information. It assists users at all trip stages, saving travel responses and time schedules while offering suggestions if required.\n\nThis trip-intelligent information, which cleverly combines real-time data and personal preferences, was tested by experts from various countries and demonstrated to the public on a related project website, available http://www.wisetrip.travel (online). The pilot solution covered countries such as Greece, Finland and the United Kingdom, as well as cities in China and Italy. The system was designed to offer fewer hops within a trip, seek better prices, provide information in different languages and extend frequent traveller information.\n\nOverall, the project is expected to enable business travellers to plan their journeys more efficiently and enhance productivity as a result. It will also stimulate tourists to explore new places, which will have a positive effect on economic growth. Once this technology becomes widely available on smartphones, travelling from one place to another on different types of transport stand to become much easier.", null, "http://www.angustransportforum.org", "/docs/results/images/2013-06/55812.jpg", "fp7_89641_999713526"], ["4UZ", "Transition paths to sustainable legume based systems in Europe", "Arbikie Distilling Limited", "TRUE - (TRansition paths to sUstainable legume based systems in Europe) is a 24 partner consortium covering business and society actors from legume commodity production, processing, and citizens. TRUE is underpinned by science excellence in the natural and social sciences, and humanities. The main aim of TRUE is to identify and enable transition paths to realise successful legume-supported production systems and agri-feed and -food chains. This is achieved via: a true multi-actor approach that balances environmental, economic- and social-securities by minimising environmental impact; optimising diversity and resilience in commercial and environmental terms throughout the supply chain; and delivery of excellent nutrition to ensure the highest possible states of health and wellbeing for people and animals. TRUE will achieve this using a series of 15 farm networks and 7 supply chain focused innovation Case Studies to characterise key mechanisms and associated ecosystem services indicators. This will empower the production of popular and novel legume-based products on the basis of improved market perspectives and capabilities, including short supply chains. Advanced mathematical approaches using Life Cycle Analysis, and socioeconomic and multi-attribute modelling will create unique Decision Support Tools to identify optimal transition paths to ensure legume supported systems are profitable from \u2018the push\u2019, of production, to \u2018the pull\u2019 of upstream supply chains, markets and consumers. Critically, the TRUE approach will also advise and empower policy amendments that promote uptake of new farming, processing, manufacturing and retailing practices, in line with the societal considerations of the Responsible Research and Innovation model: policy decision making with state-of-the-art science-based information.

The immersion course would provide a deep understanding of Spanish culture and language as well as provide practitioners with teaching resources in order to effectively deliver quality Spanish. \r\n\r\nIt would therefore be the hope that we not only meet the Scottish Government's target, but inspire children to enjoy learning a new language, utilising it throughout the school on a daily basis.
