We constantly strive to raise the academic standards in literacy and numeracy and aim to broaden horizons and raise aspirations through a creative language rich curriculum. \r\nA key ares for our School development Plan is to improve the wellbeing and mental health of our pupils so that they have the best possible opportunity to being successful, resilient and happy members of society.\r\nTherefore, our key area of needs are:\r\n1. Enhance the wellbeing and mental health of children in school\r\n2. Enhance the provision for children with Special Education Needs & Disabilities\r\n3. Further strengthen and develop the outdoor provision\r\n4. Strengthen the  European Dimension in school\r\nWe have recognised that poor mental health and wellbeing creates a barrier to learning and success and we are less prepared for dealing with these issues as part of our special needs provision. \r\nWe therefore plan to improve our knowledge and understanding of the challenging issues facing children and young people today through an indepth research plan; working in partnership in centres/countries of excellence, working within joint partnerships between education and health professionals, creating an action plan to ensure improvements and a toolkit for use across school. Once in place positive health and wellbeing will underpin our school ethos and will become an equal partner in our special needs provision alongside physical and educational difficulties. We will have the knowledge and expertise to provide a range of support in school appropriate to the age and difficulties encountered and have a positive working relationship with other professionals. We will create an open and honest dialogue about mental health issues with our children, staff, parents and other members of our school community. \r\nOur project involves attendance at 5 structured training courses in Spain, Netherlands, Sweden and Iceland.\r\nThe participants in our project will be led by three of our senior leadership team; the Deputy Headteacher, The Assistant Headteacher/SENDCo and our Inclusion Manager/Learning Mentor. The other participants will be selected through an open and transparent process and will be open to all teaching and support staff working across school with all age groups.\r\nThe participants will attend courses which provide opportunities to observe a range of different approaches, processes and pedagogies in three different countries, undertake action research projects leading to implementing a whole school approach and improved provision.\r\nThe participation in this project will impact on several targets:\r\nStaff \r\nEnhance pedagogy in teaching creatively both indoor and outdoor\r\nEnhance ability to work collaboratively within a European context\r\nAbility to innovate and lead by example\r\nEnhanced cultural understanding and diversity\r\nRaised staff confidence and motivation\r\nDeveloped methods to address wellbeing \r\nCollaboration at European level\r\nPupils\r\nExposure to new and more creative teaching approaches and new strategies\r\nBenefit from a curriculum that takes into account social and linguistic diversity\r\nConfidence, selfesteem and resilience\r\nReorganisation and enhancement  of teaching and learning which meets their individual needs\r\nMotivated to explore \r\nBetter understanding of the languages and cultures \r\nWider community\r\nAs we work within the cooperative trust and also with the School Development Group within our local authority, the experience and benefit of this project will be shared across other schools impacting on their staff and in turn of their pupils too.\r\nParents and friends of our school will be inspired by the work and development done by the school and there will be an even better engagements with our school.\r\nWe will work closely with schools within our local area to share expertise and develop the skills of others.\r\nUltimately our goal is to create a whole school approach to build resilience that will support disadvantages pupils, it will raise academic attainment and build emotional resilience before issues develop into more serious mental health problems. We will use our outdoor and forest school education as an important contribution to our health and wellbeing approach, providing challenges, play and team building adventures in the fresh air.", "http://shortwoodprimaryschool.co.uk", "Short Wood Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036064_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TF1"}
