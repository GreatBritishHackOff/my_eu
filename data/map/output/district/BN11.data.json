The model focuses on finding and engaging NEET young people (yp) who are furthest from accessing mainstream provision and face multiple barriers, e.g. care leavers, offenders, mental health, anxiety, unstable/chaotic family/home life, from workless households with low aspiration, drug/alcohol users, LDD, travellers, caring responsibilities, poor experience of and/or non-attendance at school, no/low GCSEs, young parents & ESOL yp. Search & seek outreach methods will target engagement in locations where NEETs are known to congregate & will engage their interest with subtlety and sensitivity. Once engaged, interventions will focus on encounters with workplaces, employers and FE provision to help them gain understanding of opportunities & prepare for next steps. Their achievements will be certified for recognition/confidence-building & accredited qualifications will be part of the offer where they are not able to access those through existing mainstream provision. Future Focus has a strong focus from day one on progression & preparation for moving on into EET. All yp receive support from a dedicated Caseworker (CW) to support with holistic & progression needs.", "ESF", 199997.0, 399997.0, "esf_england_866"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1QR", "EMPLOYABILITY TOWN CIC", 37169.0, "Promoting entrepreneurship and improving the competitiveness and access to markets of Union enterprises  (02.02.01)", "fts_2016_30710", 2016], ["1QR", "EMPLOYABILITY TOWN CIC", 53115.0, "Promoting entrepreneurship and improving the competitiveness and access to markets of Union enterprises (02.02.01)", "fts_2017_26538", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "BN11"}
