[Ref. 1] . Based on the extrapolation of data relating to the UK, French and German railways [Ref 1], the 500,000 kms of rail [Ref. 2] on the European rail network has an average estimated 5000 rail breaks annually with about 1500 due to weld failure. Although the number of weld failures is relatively small compared to the estimated 11 million alumino-thermic welds on the European network, it still accounts for about 20% of the total 7000\\ rail failures each year [Ref. 3]. There is no current available NDT method for the economic and reliable volumetric examination of alumino-thermic welds. This proposal describes the development of a rapid ultrasonic method for the safe and reliable NDT examination of the entire volume of in-situ alumino-thermic welds. The proposed ultrasonic system could be quickly deployed on track using a clamp-on device. The inspection scans will be carried out in a pre-determined sequence, and then the results compared with defect acceptance criteria that will be generated in the project. To achieve this objective, a rigorous analysis of the material properties, the defect interaction with the ultrasonic beams and the design of optimum scanning procedures will first be carried out. It is expected that the scans will be implemented by means of electronic scanning using novel phased arrays and multiple probes. The acceptance criteria will be generated by both Engineering Critical Assessment and fatigue tests on rail samples.", 253660.0, 1290171.0, "RAILECT", null, null, null, "http://www.railect.com", "http://www.spreendt.com", null, "fp7_92648_998496952"], ["3RF", "The Development of a Novel Remote Stress Sensing System to Increase Safety, Efficiency and Reduce Environmental Effects in Fishing and Mooring applications", "Wire Belt Company Limited", "The EU fishing industry is a major source of employment and food providing more than 7.5 million tonnes of fish and employing over 526,000 people of which 88% work within the SME community.  The European SMEs in this sector are under increased pressure to increase efficiency due to rising crude oil prices. In addition, there is the EU legislation on Total Allowable Catch or minimum landing sizes and the threat to close areas to fishing and aquaculture  in order to recover stock, due to environmental effects of inefficient fishing which could have socio-economic effects on our community. Our need as representatives of the SME industry is to increase efficiency and safety in fishing and aquaculture as well as reduce the environmental effects. We recognise the need for a technology that will enable fishers to preserve the quality and freshness of fish, reduce trawling times and avoid problems caused by overfull trawls. Trawls are the most commercially used fishing method. It is very large and expensive with typical cost up to \u20ac135,000. A fishing vessel dragging the conical shaped net through water consumes a large amount of energy and with fuel being the most expensive expenditure, fisheries are fast becoming unprofitable.   The proposed project will develop a stress monitoring system that will increase: efficiency in fishing, safety and life of fishing gear and mooring ropes.", 99871.0, 2239169.0, "SMARTCATCH", "Tech innovation in the fishing industry", "The EU is catching up with a newly designed system of nets with sensors designed to notify of their overloading or damage. If there is a break in the net, the operator will be notified immediately, preventing loss and damage.", "The EU is the second largest importer of fish in the world. Plagued by increased costs, inefficiencies in stock management, overfishing, lack of innovation and increased competition, the Europe lingers in the background of this business sector. \n\nAn exciting innovation, the http://smartcatch.pera.com (SMARTCATCH) project,  funded by the EU has revolutionised fishing gear for trawl nets. A non-contact stress sensing system for mooring rope applications and potentially fishing is good news in storms and dangerous currents. \n\nPrevention of loss or damage to farmed fish stocks has economic implications. The fewer fish to sell equals lost revenue to the fish farmer and more imported fish. This new system will reduce the loss of escapees and minimise the negative environmental impact on the genetic diversity and local marine environment.\n\n\nThe researchers used techniques to join the Nitinol wire to form a continuous loop. They also used other methods, the most common being various welding techniques, soldering, mechanical connections and adhesives. For a marine envrironment signal detector, SMARTCATCH identified electromagnetic induction technology design parameters.\n\nThis new technology will also enable fish farmers to preserve the active fishing gear on boats. Trawling is the most commercially used fishing method. These large and expensive nets range from \u20ac1 350 to \u20ac40 000 per net for a boat up to 20m. The Smartcatch system could potentially increase the efficiency of fishing fleets with the developed alternative techniques for integration of the Nitinol wire into rope systems. Extensive research was done to test corrosion, jointing techniques and electrical performance. \n\nThe initial focus solved problems with the more manageable smaller ropes of aquaculture installations and mooring rope applications.  Solutions here can be scaled up to the trawler net ropes and other applications.\n\nSMARTCATCH technology promises to upgrade quality and freshness of the catch and reduce trawling times. Reducing stress and load on fishing gear will cut costs of fuel and increase the lifetime of fishing equipment. The safety record in the industry also stands to improve as a result.", "http://smartcatch.pera.com/", "http://www.wirebelt.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/146637.jpg", "fp7_107622_998605786"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["4DT", "RPA", "SITTINGBOURNE HOSPITAL"], ["4DT", "RVV", "SITTINGBOURNE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL"], ["4DT", "RVV", "SITTINGBOURNE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - MAXILLOFACIAL"], ["4DT", "RVV", "SITTINGBOURNE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - RHEUMATOLOGY"], ["4DT", "RVV", "UROLOGY- SITTINGBOURNE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL"], ["4DT", "RVV", "WHITSTABLE & TANKERTON HOSPITAL - CHILD & ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE"], ["4DT", "RVV", "WHITSTABLE & TANKERTON HOSPITAL - CHILDREN & YOUNG PEOPLES SERVICES"], ["4DT", "RWF", "SITTINGBOURNE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL"], ["4DT", "RYY", "SITTINGBOURNE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "ME10"}
