In order to engage and be part of  the European project, young people need more opportunities and channels to voice their interests and views. Having run projects over a similar nature over recent years we are aware of the ongoing needs of the young people including the real need to assist young people in becoming more included in the democratic process. \r\n\r\nObectives\r\n-  To foster and develop a sense of European identity and feeling in young people and young workers. \r\n-  To introduce European wide key issues through a variety of means (key local youth agencies, politicians and media groups in non-formal education settings\r\n- To encouraging young people to come together from different backgrounds and discover \u2018Europe\u2019 through guided youth led activities, effective information debates and the development of youth media on a variety of topics \r\n- To empower of young  people to take responsibility for sharing in decision-making\r\n\r\nParticipant\r\nMany of the young people are often isolated in the community, have low confidence and self esteem and often not confident enough to participate with mainstream society. young immigrants or refugees or descendants from immigrant or refugee families, young people belonging to a national or ethnic minority, young people with linguistic adaptation and cultural inclusion problems, etc. In addition, much of the young population of  lack a stable home life and there is a dearth of positive role models or positive influences in their lives. Many of the young people are often isolated in the community, have low confidence and self esteem and often not confident enough to participate with mainstream society.\r\n\r\nProject Activities\r\nThe Project will bring together 36 participants + 4 group leaders especially between the ages of 18-30, from 3 countries (UK, Sweden, and Finland ) The project will deliver a series of activities including workshops, debate, role play and presentation which have been designed in order to meet the project aims.

This will give them the opportunity to learn in an environment where their assertions will be challenged in a gentle way while ensuring they can receive information in different channels (debate, one-to-one, presentation) that can suit the informal learning styles of all the young people. There will also be online spaces on social platforms where young people can go to start a discussion with a young people like minded and  youth worker. This will provide another avenue for young people to develop in a personal way that affords them the opportunities. Team building that involve playing games ad  creative tasks where young people from diverse backgrounds can utilise their innovative skills while cooperating.\r\n\r\nThe expected mid/long term impacts \r\nMany disadvantaged and marginalised groups from ethnic and cultural minorities will be given the opportunity to take part in a virtual project which will slowly boost confidence to participate more, improving soft skills in the process that will be transferable to school, work and home life.

Secondly, educational under-achievement most often leads to social exclusion and multi-faceted disadvantage and in a small number of cases young adolescents on the margins of society and economy are being attracted to extremist groups enticed by the false promises of extremist ideologies. The economic, political, technological and cultural transformation of the past decade has undoubtedly influenced and aided the development of these worrying trends. The overall aim of the project is to find ways of fostering and strengthening the understanding of difference and diversity in the youth of our European societies by sharing experiences, ideas and practices of migration issues, discussing and debating the benefits of migration, diversity and multiculturalism.  Project participants will have the opportunity to look critically at the issue of migration by not only focusing on the last wave which is currently happening in Europe but look in a more wider context, at the same time through discussion and debate be able to relate it to multiculturalism and diversity already existing in Europe.\r\n\r\nObjectives are: \r\n1.  Increase youth self-esteem and motivation for an active participation in their organizations and in society valuing their perspectives and enhancing their inner and relational skills \r\n2.
