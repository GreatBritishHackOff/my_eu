It will be held in Germany in June 2016. This play was selected to perform as it takes man\u2019s relationship to the laws of nature as its theme. A series of workshops over eight days will explore the relationship of the human to nature and to each other, and culminate in a performance. The themes of cultural strangeness in the play will be echoed in the cultural differences between the participants that need to be overcome so all can live and work together peacefully. Shakespearian drama is full of powerful archetypes and characters that create opportunities to explore many aspects of humanity. This is particularly relevant for autistic young people that struggle to understand social behaviours and interaction. Undertaking this youth exchange will be a developmental milestone for young people who have poor self-image and lack of aspiration, feel socially isolated, lack confidence and experience in cultural exploration and overseas travel. Taking part will help them develop responsibility towards others, both individuals and the collective group. The project will increase the capacity for international youth work and co-operation between Ruskin Mill Trust and Lebens-und Arbeitsgemeinschaft Lautenbach.

Love in Romeo and Juliet is a brutal, powerful emotion that captures individuals and catapults them against their world, and, at times, against themselves. A series of workshops over seven days will explore the relationship of the human to nature and to each other, and culminate in a performance. The themes of cultural strangeness in the play will be echoed in the cultural differences between the participants; only the death of lovers brings everyone to their senses so their families and friends can live and work together peacefully. Shakespearean drama is full of powerful archetypes and characters that create opportunities to explore many aspects of humanity. This is particularly relevant for autistic young people that struggle to understand social behaviours and interaction. \r\n\r\nCultural themes are also woven through the textiles workshops, with an exploration of colour, pattern, function, tradition and aesthetic through weaving. The two groups of young people have totally different ways of working; this exchange brings then together to share their skills, knowledge and to learn from each other, with trips to cultural institutions in Norway to understand how traditional weaving and other crafts have been influenced by nature and human ingenuity. \r\n\r\nUndertaking this youth exchange will be a developmental milestone for disabled young people who have poor self-image and lack of aspiration, feel socially isolated, lack confidence and experience in cultural exploration and overseas travel.
