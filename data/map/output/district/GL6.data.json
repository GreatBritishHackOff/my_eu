It will be held in Germany in October 2017. \r\n\r\nThis play was selected to perform as it takes man\u2019s relationship to the laws of nature as its theme. A series of workshops over eight days will explore the relationship of the human to nature and to each other, and culminate in a performance. The themes of cultural strangeness in the play will be echoed in the cultural differences between the participants that need to be overcome so all can live and work together peacefully. Shakespearian drama is full of powerful archetypes and characters that create opportunities to explore many aspects of humanity. This is particularly relevant for autistic young people that struggle to understand social behaviours and interaction. \r\n\r\nUndertaking this youth exchange will be a developmental milestone for young people who have poor self-image and lack of aspiration, feel socially isolated, lack confidence and experience in cultural exploration and overseas travel. Taking part will help them develop responsibility towards others, both individuals and the collective group. I\r\n\r\nThis project will build on the very successful Erasmus + Youth Exchange that took place in 2016 between Ruskin Mill Trust and Lebens-und Arbeitsgemeinschaft Lautenbach.  It will increase the capacity for international youth work and co-operation between the two organisations  and strengthen ties which could continue even after the UK has withdrawn from the EU.", "http://www.rmt.org", "Ruskin Mill Trust Ltd.", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-035933_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["7QX", "INFRASTRATA PLC*", 1089019.0, "Contributing to sustainable development and protection of the environment (32.02.01.03)", "fts_2016_20352", 2016], ["7QX", "INFRASTRATA PLC*", 1089018.0, "Further integration of the internal energy market and the interoperability of electricity and gas networks across borders (32.02.01.01)", "fts_2016_20353", 2016], ["7QX", "INFRASTRATA PLC*", 1089018.0, "Enhancing Union security of energy supply (32.02.01.02)", "fts_2016_20354", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "GL6"}
