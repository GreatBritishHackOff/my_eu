Depending on the scope, (e.g. the prevention of, or the response to, security scenarios by European security forces, such as protection of special persons or general security of events) tailored solutions are to be developed, including inflatable ballistic structures for the protection of: - individuals, or of two to five persons, (carried in back-pack, brief case, trolley, or suitcase based mobile security kits) - general security of events, (transported in car boot, or pick-up truck based, inflatable ballistic tents, curtains, fences, or even \u201cred carpet&quot; tunnels).", 586832.0, 2431265.0, "RAPTOR", "Wearable air bag fights crime and terrorism", "Much as a car air bag protects an occupant from impact with the dashboard, a new textile ballistic shield will inflate to protect individuals from the impact of bullets, hand grenades or other explosive devices.", "In a politically volatile world, EU civilian personnel such as aid workers and peacekeepers are continuously subjected to a number of security threats such as criminal acts, terrorist raids and even bomb explosions. This has prompted European governments to search for ways to enhance security for their personnel abroad.\n\nThe EU-funded project http://www.raptor-project.eu/ (RAPTOR) developed inflatable structures made of a multitude of fibrous aramide textile layers to minimise ballistic impact from hand guns, hand grenades and improvised explosive devices.\n\nAramide is a synthetic polymer capable of being extruded into very strong, heat-resistant fibres. Researchers optimised the fibre weaving technique and treatment by lamination to achieve the greatest resistance to impact of the selected ammunition. They then turned their attention to the gas generator to rapidly and safely inflate the folded protective shield. The gas generator is similar in concept to that used to inflate air bags in the case of a car accident. However, since the shield is worn, the team utilised hot gas production for the inflation and cooling for safe deployment.\n\nAll these achievements contributed to the manufacture and testing of a functional prototype. The ballistic shield deployed rapidly and withstood the impact of bullets, fragments and blasts.\n\nThe project delivered three different shield concepts for individuals, for groups of two to five persons, and for the general security of events. Technology will be further developed as a commercially available protection kit for law enforcement and could also be useful in situations such as large-scale sporting or entertainment events.\n\nRAPTOR's innovative security kit is poised to make the world a safer place and hopefully to save lives.

It is, in fact, over 10% of EU GDP (including the linked industries) and employs 9.7 million people and 1.8 million companies. In our country, the industry has, as a whole, about 191.000 businesses and, on 31st  December 2015, 886.000 employees, while in the two regions covered by the project (Sicily and Calabria), between 2015 and the third quarter of 2016, employment in the tourism sector has recorded an average increase compared to 2013-2014, by 3.8% in Sicily and 2.7% in Calabria. The data and projections show, however, on the one hand, the expansion of the sector and the tourist attractiveness of the two regions and, on the other hand, emphasize the need to provide trained young staff, highly qualified and able to respond positively to new and high competence requested by the local labor market.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nIn line with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy and ET 2020, WORK AWAY offers young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their curricular competencies: professionalism in the specific sector of TOURISM, soft skills, cultural knowledge and language skills. These general objectives are pursued through a mobility experience which consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 STUDENTS attending CLASSES IV and of 3 months for 80 newly graduated of the 8 participating VET Schools (Technical Institutes for Tourism and Hotel and Catering Schools). The project also promotes the exchange and transfer of good practices in VET by relating our VET system with the training and employment system to other European countries and contributes to the consolidation of the ECVET System.\r\n\r\nACTIVITY\r\n1. Transversal Activities: management and coordination; Dissemination and exploitation of results; Follow up;\r\n2. Mobility Preparation: Plan of communication and cooperation; Recruitment and selection of participants; preparation of participants; Learning plan definition;\r\n3. Mobility Realization: Internship in the company; Monitoring and tutoring; Project feedback and experience of mobility; Assessment, certification and validation of skills acquired.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY in 4 PHASES\r\n1. MANAGEMENT PLAN AND MONITORING: the project is coordinated by IIS \"Moncada\" in close collaboration with other 16 partners of the Consortium. The Plan is based on the EQAVET quality system and includes specification on: financial arrangements, timing, names of managers / representatives of each organization, responsibilities, roles and tasks, project phases with related milestones, risk management procedures.\r\n2. PLAN OF LEARNING AND EVALUATION: the learning and evaluation plan contains specific references and commitments on transparency and recognition of competences in an ECVET-compatible framework. The documents are: Learning Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The quality of the experience of mobility is controlled through regular evaluation questionnaires filled out by participants, mentors and tutors.\r\n3. PLAN OF COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION: it provides for the involvement of all participants in the partnership with effective tools and rules to maintain a high level of interest on the project.\r\n4. STRATEGIC PLAN FOR DISSEMINATION AND EXPLOITATION: includes phases and methods to be adopted by all partners to disseminate and exploit the project and its results all over the duration and behond.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS\r\na. The development of highly specific and innovative skills in the tourism and catering sector;\r\nb. More competitive and greater employment opportunities in the labor market for the participants;\r\nc. The development and innovation of VET systems.\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\nThe project includes a significant impact on the VET Systems through: learning outcomes achievement of participants to mobility; skills acquired from the staff involved in the project; recognition of skills in an ECVET-compatible framework. It represents also an added value and development opportunity for the participating organizations, which will consolidate a new training segment to complete the technical and vocational education and answer the demand of enterprises of high professional skills.\r\n\r\nLONG-TERM BENEFITS\r\nIn the long term, thanks to the dissemination tools developed and to the size and importance of the consortium, it is expected to have a multiplier effect both regionally, and at national and EU level and the orientation of public policies on the base of the results of the project, using in addition, as a standard model, all procedures and best practices developed within the Project.", "http://www.theeastburyhotel.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005725_17"], ["3BY", "Rete Nazionale Istituti Alberghieri e Macroregione Adriatico-ionica: sfide e obiettivi comuni di un piano integrato di sviluppo territoriale per il Turismo", "The Eastbury Hotel Ltd", 565724.0, "The RENADRION Project is born and implemented in a dual context:\r\n1) the NATIONAL NETWORK OF TOURISM and CATERING SCHOOLS (RENAIA) of which the 15 institutes involved are members, including the Leader, IPSSEOA \"CORNARO\", who also holds the Presidency and that is the reality more representative in Italy, in terms of membership, of the education and training offer in the hospitality and catering industry;\r\n2) the European Strategy EUSAIR (launched by the EU Commission in June 2014) that aims to increase the attractiveness and competitiveness, in terms of tourism, of the ADRIATIC-IONIC REGION, supporting the development of coastal, maritime and inland tourism, through the improvement of the quality tourism services and promoting economic prosperity and social development through the growth of the professions and the creation of new jobs.\r\nIn line with these strategies and objectives, RENADRION proposes, therefore, to offer to 120 STUDENTS (of which 12 are disabled and / or with special needs) in initial vocational training of the fourth year and 90 recent graduates young people of 15 the VET Schools involved, including the Lead School, the opportunity to perform a mobility experience of European level of the duration of, respectively, 4 weeks and 3 months.
