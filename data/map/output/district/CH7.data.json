Accordingly the price of Ir has risen by a factor of 4 in the last five years and by more than a factor of 10 in the last decade. It is expected to soar perhaps by a factor of 100 due to its wider applications.\n\nIt is widely recognised that spin electronic technologies will displace volatile semiconductor memory technology within the next decade. Therefore the lack of availability of one crucial element from within the periodic table is a critical issue to be solved urgently.\n\nWe therefore aim to replace Ir to reduce the cost of an AF film by a factor of 10 as compared with the current IrMn. We will combine our expertise in ab initio calculations and HA film growth techniques to seek a highly anisotropic AF HA films. These films will be characterised both structurally and magnetically using synchrotron beamlines, high-resolution (scanning) transmission electron microscopy and highly sensitive electrical and magnetic measurement facilities available within the consortium. We will demonstrate a device concept with the developed AF HA films at the end of this project, showing an exchange bias greater than 1 kOe in sheet form and a blocking temperature greater than 300K.\n\nTo our knowledge we are the first group to realise the criticality of the position with regard to the supply of Ir. The developed AF HA films will be patented with the royalties shared equally among the partners in the EU-Japan consortium. The innovation within HARFIR is therefore extremely high.", 85768.0, 1833109.0, "HARFIR", null, null, null, "http://harfir.eu/", null, null, "fp7_109609_950614066"], ["4QW", "Integrated European Network for biomass and waste reutilisation for Bioproducts", "North Wales Mouldings Ltd", "AquaTerrE will promote the cooperation between research centres, business and other stakeholders in Europe devoted to the research, development and application of biomass and biofuel production and valorisation. It will aim integration and unification of efforts and the exchange of knowledge and expertise between partners, to promote the creation of a network for improving biomass and waste reutilisation. Mainly, AquaTerrE aims to make an inventory of existing biomass feedstocks in Europe and quantify the potential and identify of the best ones. In addition, to study the best possibilities for implementing different biomass sources in different environments to improve their utilisation. Pursuing this target, literature and data survey and current research review will be carried out. Furthermore, the scope of AquaTerrE consists also in mapping European biomass feedstocks using different tools as Geographical Information Systems (GIS).  Additionally, AquaTerrE expert members will identify economic and environmental impacts schemes to define the optimum Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA is a standardized and structured method for calculating the environmental load of a product, process or activity throughout all its phases. The implementation of a new bio-product/bio-fuel in the market requires the analysis of economical, social and environmental aspects, with the objective of attaining enough information for the decision making progress. The contribution of a LCA study to this project can be framed in the identification of best sources of biomass feedstock as well as other agricultural waste for the sustainable obtaining of bio-fuels and other added value products.", 35809.0, 747315.0, "AQUATERRE", null, null, null, "http://www.aquaterre.info", "http://www.nwmouldings.co.uk", null, "fp7_88211_998627223"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["6GJ", "CADIZ J\u00d3VENES EUROPEOS III", "Elite Help Ltd", 297145.0, "In the city of C\u00e1diz, some main handicaps have been detected: the high youth unemployment, the lack of expectations, the high level of school leaving and the low foreign language achievement, all this restrict the future professional development of our students and determinate a clear need of putting into practice  tools aimed to acquisition of competences that allow them being involved with options of future, inside the labor market.
