The move towards higher bypass ratios can lead to significant reductions in emissions and noise; up to 10% propulsive efficiency enhancement and 2dB noise reductions from UHBR ~15 and above reported.  However, by lowering fan pressure ratios, fan surge problems can emerge with increasingly larger variations in flight performance between sea-level and cruise. To overcome this, the adaptive area nozzle can provide the necessary increases in surge margin at low mass flow conditions at sea-level, but at the expense of additional system weight and complexity.    \nWhile many of the potential benefits of the UHBR configuration have been substantiated for isolated nacelle configurations, there is limited understanding of the installation interference effects that will be induced at these very high/ultra high ratios, or how the incorporation of the AAN may affect the nature of these interference losses.  In the current project, early stage candidate concepts for a nacelle with AAN technology will be studied through complementary experimental and computational simulation to ascertain the interference effects induced and to propose a verified modelling methodology which can be used in advance design studies.  This will be used to inform best practice in the design of installed UHBR nacelles with AAN technology to support a move towards an integrated technology demonstrator within the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking for late 2023.", 1118108.0, 1557780.0, "AvAUNT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ara.co.uk", null, "h2020_208821_997928726"], ["7PF", "Powered, modular Wind-Tunnel model for low and high Reynolds tests", "Aircraft Research Association Limited", "POLITE answers the CfP JTI-CS2-2015-CFP02-REG-02-02, published in the second batch of the JTI-Cleansky 2.

This is clearly in line with Cleansky 2, which includes, among other topics, to deliver innovative technologies that are validated in relevant conditions (in this case flight test). Before such a complex test can be performed a high level of confidence in the technologies developed is necessary. POLITE answers this need, since it enables low and high Reynolds WT-tests that allow to validating technologies to improve performances in low and high speed. Increasing the aircraft performance is supporting not only the CS2-workplan but also the ACARE2020 vision by allowing passengers to travel with reduced fuel burn and there increasing the ecologic efficiency of the aircraft. \nWithin POLITE a consortium build from 4 different partners will tackle all relevant topics.

The percentage of pupils from minority ethnic groups is 41%  and the percentage of pupils whose first language is believed not to be English stands at 19% : this puts the school between the 60th and the 80th percentile for both indicators.   Until recently a middle school and a lower school (within Bedfordshire's three-tier education system), Castle Newnham School is now at the heart of the new Castle Newnham Federation (established in January 2016).   Our vision is to provide all-through education from 4-16 years for children in the local community.  At present our pupils range from Nursery to Year 8 and all students in Key Stages 2 and 3 study French ; however, the Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) team is committed to extending the range of foreign languages on offer to all students up to GCSE level and is currently developing a Year 9 scheme of work, for first teaching in September.   The purpose of this application is to give two members of the MFL team an opportunity to hone their skills at a training establishment in Austria. As the social and cultural diversity of the school develops, the range of language competences of its students evolves.   These areas are particularly relevant given the UK Central Government plan for imminent changes to the GCSE language qualifications and its expectations for the 2018 GCSE student cohort regarding EBac subjects. The primary objective of the project is to extend language learning opportunities to include German and to raise cultural awareness. The school has identified a need to enhance existing language skills within the MFL teaching team. \r\n\r\nThe proposal is that two participants undertake a German language immersion course in Vienna, Austria (July/August 2017).  These activities will provide opportunities for participants to improve their knowledge of the German language, extend their repertoire of teaching strategies and deepen their cultural awareness of the countries and communities where German is spoken. Participants will be expected to share all relevant good practice with colleagues, both at a departmental and whole school level via formal feedback and as part of the school's Professional Development Programme for staff.  The school will embrace these learning experiences and integrate relevant best practices within its Development Plan.\r\n\r\nRuth Wilkes and Rachael Hambley are both currently teachers of French who have taught German in the past, although in recent years have had less opportunity to practice their German language skills. The Department has assessed both teachers\u2019 competences and believes that in order for the team to provide a high standard of teaching in German that will both engage and inspire students, and also meet the requirements of the new GCSE qualification, the opportunity to extend their language skills would be invaluable.\r\n\r\nStudents at Castle Newnham School will have the opportunity to study a wider range of European languages through the introduction of German to the curriculum.  Furthermore, the implementation of newly acquired teaching strategies and approaches will enhance learning experiences and improve performance.  Pupils will be given opportunities to deepen their understanding of cultural diversity and to consider future opportunities for education and employment as members of the European Union (EU).  As a direct consequence of the project we would anticipate that a significant number of students would opt to study German to GCSE level, and that some would study both French and German.  It is hoped that this in turn will foster an interest in foreign languages, and spark at least some students to consider future opportunities for employment within, and as part of, the EU. The MFL department has strong links with the Association for Language Learning (a group of teaching professionals that meet regularly to share new ideas on teaching languages in both primary and secondary schools).  A formal presentation will be made about this project to the local group, and in doing so extend its reach. Participants will also supply a written report to the Headteacher and relevant stakeholders, detailing how activities have impacted on teaching practice, curriculum planning and confidence when using the target language within a classroom context.   Impact will be assessed through ongoing school lesson observation programmes and the Quality of Teaching/ Learning Monitoring Cycle.  New ideas will be cascaded down to colleagues as part of the school's Professional Development Programme, both at a departmental and whole school level. The MFL department will monitor trends in numbers of students opting to study German and/or French in KS4.", "http://www.newnham-middle.org.uk", "Castle Newnham School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035766_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "MK41"}
