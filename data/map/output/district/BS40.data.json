In this proposal we look at short supply chains from the perspective of urban rather than rural development. Short supply chains can play a role in addressing urban problems such as climate change, obesity, storm water control, etc.\nShort food supply chains have been advocated as a means to reduce CO2 impact of the agricultural system. Although a reduction of food miles certainly contributes to reducing climate impact, this proposal takes as premise that to really improve the ecological performance of the food system other flows of goods and services need to be shortened as well (e.g. nutrient, water, and carbon cycles need to be closed). In the current context these aspects are usually treated separately, this proposal argues to treat them more integrated.\nThe research will analyse the way in which several European city regions deal with short supply chains in food, nutrients, water, and carbon. The project will facilitate selected SMEs to further innovate in food production and delivery, nutrient and water management, and multifunctional use of space, and will disseminate the results among a wider audience of SMEs. By doing so, the research will look beyond the state of the art, it will suggest how city regions could look like if they chose to further relocalise their food system.\nFinally the project will also establish links with stakeholders and RTD activities regarding urban and peri-urban agriculture and short chain delivery of food in urban and peri-urban areas in developing countries. This will be organised through a process of dialogue, sharing of experiences, exchanging of best practices and joint learning.", 23684.0, 1489081.0, "SUPURBFOOD", "Planning future food production", "A multidisciplinary network is being established to improve sustainable urban food planning and support the invention and implementation of relevant strategies.", "Improving food supply chains in urban areas can help address numerous urban challenges, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving food quality and safety. Improving supply chains though, and ensuring their sustainability, requires not only shortening them, but shortening the flow of other goods and services as well.\n\nBy addressing chain shortness, water, nutrient and waste management, and multifunctional land use, the project 'Towards sustainable modes of urban and peri-urban food provisioning' (http://www.supurbfood.eu (SUPURBFOOD)) takes a more comprehensive approach to sustainable urban food production. The project is developing innovative approaches to these aspects in Europe and the global south, analysing the way different city regions deal with such issues.\n\nThe first 18 months of the project, the exploration phase, have now been completed and the second experimentation phase has begun. During the exploration phase, data was collected and analysed from different European city regions on each of the three topics. The team discovered that citizens are drivers for making food a local political issue and that support at the regional level would increase its impact. Clear interest was shown in short food supply chains for both production and consumption.\n\nIn terms of waste management, a lot of technological solutions were used and there was little civic participation. The experiences and best practices of developing countries were also studied in this first phase. It became clear that shortening chains requires the strengthening of linkages at the city region level and initiatives based on a balanced mix of government mechanisms. In general, this first phase provided interesting approaches at the thematic level and helped prioritise the needs of participating small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nThis project is a valuable opportunity for science and industry stakeholders to collaborate and exploit new research opportunities to address pressing urban challenges. Collaboration will continue through two city region workshops in all seven city regions and two international seminars. Ultimately, the project will provide policy recommendations for both public policy and business strategies, promoting innovative interdisciplinary solutions for sustainable urban food production.", "http://www.supurbfood.eu/", "http://www.thecommunityfarm.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/156383.jpg", "fp7_105008_953915655"], ["7RG", "GURNEY FLAP ACTUATOR AND MECHANISM FOR A FULL SCALE HELICOPTER ROTOR BLADE", "Microtecnica Actuation Technologies Limited", "'Microtecnica SrL (MT) have brought together industry leading expertise to support the design and\ndevelopment of a full scale Active Gurney Flap (AGF) system.

Scientists are developing a demonstrator of the most promising structural and control technology to take eco-consciousness to new heights.", "Gurney flaps have been implemented on a variety of aerofoils from aeroplane wings to helicopter rotor blades to air turbines and race cars. Active gurney flaps (AGFs) are a key objective of the EU's Clean Sky aerospace research programme. Adding an active component provides the ability to adapt to changing conditions and a system that significantly outperforms its passive analogue. It could provide important vibration damping at less weight than current solutions as a system that addresses vibration at its source, the blades.\n\nThe EU is funding the project 'Gurney flap actuator and mechanism for a full scale helicopter rotor blade' (PT656) to evaluate the capabilities of a helicopter main rotor blade incorporating an AGF. The consortium has extensive experience in both blade actuation technologies and fundamental engineering analysis. The expertise puts the team in the best possible position to evaluate all potential candidate solutions as part of the preliminary development task.\n\nElectromechanical actuation was chosen for its reliability, high power density, high bandwidth capability, and robustness to extreme conditions of temperature, vibration and acceleration. The AGF structural components and actuation system were embedded in a section of the helicopter main rotor blade and successfully evaluated in wind tunnel tests. The test campaign studied performance of the blade held in a fixed position. Stress analyses evaluated performance under various operational loads, whereas thermal analyses investigated heat transfer from the motor and moving parts of the actuator to the blade.\n\nDuring the final months, the AGF system will be evaluated on a ground-based whirl tower subjected to realistic conditions for a flying helicopter's main rotor blade. In preparation, the actuation system will first be tested in a dedicated spin test rig to ensure safety and minimise risk.\n\nBy project-end, PT656 expects to have demonstrated both the technological feasibility and the performance capabilities of a helicopter main rotor blade incorporating an AGF. Benefits include greater lift, lower fuel consumption and fewer emissions.

In spite of the influential role of PAHs in the ISM, their lifecycle, catalytic activity, interaction with interstellar radiation, gas and grains and their role in the organic inventory of solar system bodies is still poorly understood.
