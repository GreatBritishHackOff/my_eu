Presently, the majority of silicon ingots are sliced in thin wafers by LAS (loose abrasive sawing) using slurry of abrasive silicon carbide particles. The silicon carbide is not separable from the silicon dust in an economical way. The newer FAS (fixed abrasive sawing) uses diamond particles fixed to the cutting wire.

PowTech ITN aims to integrate inter-sectoral and multidisciplinary research in particle and powder technology into the training of 15 highly skilled young researchers, to strengthen the competitiveness of food and pharmaceutical industry and to strengthen the European Research Area.   The PowTech ITN has 20 partners (9 industry) and comprises a focused research programme and a graduate school.\n\nThe Focused Research programme will use an engineering design approach applied to powder processing. The understanding and modelling of powder structure from a molecular to a macro disperse scale will be used to understand how powder properties/functionality are formed or modified during processing. This knowledge will be used to select the appropriate process for production of the structure of interest. The long-term aim is to develop innovative products and to provide tools allowing minimal pilot plant trials.\n\nThe PowTech Graduate School is aligned with the research objectives of the project covering relevant S&T and personal skills courses but also an intensive and continuous training in collaboration with industry. In addition to the industrial secondments, the ESRs will have industrial training in different industries. An industrial mentor will be appointed to guide their Career development plan. The ESR will also be trained in Research Methodology through preparing a research plan for their work, and later in their project by developing a research plan, supervising a MSc student, and writing a Grant application.'", 217214.0, 3250444.0, "POWTECH", null, null, null, null, "http://www.gre.ac.uk", null, "fp7_96993_999867756"], ["9LS", "Human behaviour in crisis situations: A cross cultural investigation to tailor security-related communication", "University of Greenwich", "The aim of the proposed project is to investigate cross-cultural and ethnic differences of human behaviour in crisis situations in order to better tailor security related communication, instructions and procedures with a view to improving evacuation and protection.

The aim of a cultural and economic unity in connection with mobility  in the European labour market has to remain our focus.  At the same time, changes due to globalisation are making high demands on the international labour market, qualifications and job requirements. Young people do not only need expert knowledge but also interdisciplinary skills, as well as proficiency in foreign languages and intercultural skills to be sufficiently qualified for the international labour market. \r\nEuro Akademie Oldenburg prepares their students for a role in the global labour market and provides them with the necessary skills and competences to work in an international, multilingual and multicultural environment. This project therefore follows essential objectives of the strategy Europe 2020 and aims at:\r\n\u2022 Reducing unemployment by developing key competences to successfully complete a vocational education or higher education programme, \r\n\u2022 using an educational concept of multimedia learning as a framework for the development of graduate attributes and employability skills, e.g. creativity, openness, co-operation, intellectual flexibility, analysing skills, learner responsibility or coping with complexity\u2026\r\nto enhance the performance and reinforce the attractiveness of vocational education and training and create new opportunities through flexible learning pathways between different education and training sectors and levels.\r\n\r\nEuro Akademie Oldenburg is a member of ESO Education Group and thus benefits from a network of about 100 institutes, including colleges of further and vocational education, nursery schools and universities of applied sciences and many international partners. It is a long established and officially accredited institution with more than thirty years of expertise in developing vocational education programmes meeting the demands of an international labour market. The combination of vocational and higher education degrees enables students to proceed to bachelor top-up programmes, for example in International Management, Marketing Management or Health & Well-being. \r\n\r\nWithin the project, a two-year vocational training and a joint vocational and academic education programme with New College Durham and Dublin Business School are the basis for individual development and different options to obtain further qualifications or find employment. Work placements during and after the vocational qualification programme help students to develop employability skills, search for professional opportunities, but also support the development of academic key competences and  qualify for a bachelor top-up degree. \r\n\r\nAbout 20 vocational education students between 16 and 25 years and 4 teachers benefit from the project through mobility and learning opportunities. Students in programmes that require a university entry qualification aim at a two- or three-semester top-up degree whereas those who left school with o-levels usually look for alternative opportunities and educational concepts that not only qualify for university but also facilitate the entry into the labour market. After a two year foundation degree these students have three options: employment, a higher diploma followed by an international bachelor\u2019s top-up  degree or higher education at a German university. The German system requires between 11 and 12 semesters including the vocational education period whereas the international track in cooperation with foreign university partners takes 8 to 9 semesters in total (depending on individual qualification levels).\r\n\r\nThis concept aims at young people who would like to qualify for university through a vocational education programme and obtain a formal qualification as well. Many school leavers do not have the necessary employability skills to qualify for a vocational training in the German dual system. Though many young people have a university entrance qualification, they do not have the necessary self-confidence and skills to cope with independent and research based learning models. They are afraid not to find a job after a conventional university education that very often does not include any work-based elements. \r\n \r\nMany students at Euro Akademie Oldenburg have a strong and intact multicultural background. They are very interested in foreign languages and would like to use the special interpersonal skills their personal backgrounds give them professionally. This group of young Germans sees a multicultural heritage as an opportunity and has realised that this is an informal qualification many employers and industries look for. They start their careers abroad and usually find good employment in Germany after a period of professional development and orientation. \r\n\r\nThe project therefore\u2026:\r\n\u2022 enhances immediate employment opportunities for graduates of vocational education programmes in Germany \r\n\u2022 creates flexible l", "http://www.twinuk.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-004032_2"], ["9GB", "Nell-Breuning Schule Rottweil: Chancen nutzen - Kompetenzen erwerben", "Twin Training International Ltd", 108730.0, "With the project \u201cNell-Breuning School Rottweil: Good prospects - acquire skills\u201d, the school offers full-time students, trainees and teachers the possibility to stay for four weeks in Great Britain.

Therefore we offer the following activities:\r\n\r\nSending the apprentices for four weeks:\r\nThe apprentices are at the end of the first and/or second year within their three-year or two-year training course. The training focuses, on the one hand, on conveying specialist knowledge in the areas of business administration and economy, and the acquisition and/or consolidation of English as a business language on the other. The project aims at helping apprentices to improve their foreign language skills as well as their intercultural and professional competence, benefitting the companies with their labour.\r\nSince the internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises will increase in the near future, the demands on employees will also increase.

In 2017, more 27 mobility will take place (23 students and 4 teachers). \r\n\r\nThis project includes partnerships with 4 vocational schools, 1 teachers' association and 5 companies that support and organize local internships and it covers 10 destinations: Spain (Ribadeo, Santiago de Compostela, Madrid, Seville and Barcelona); France (Monteils and Romorantin-Lanthenay); United Kingdom (Belfast and London) and in Rauma, Finland.\r\n\r\nIn these mobilities students and graduates of the various vocational courses of the school can participate: Management Technician; Accounting Technician; Dispensing Optician Technician; Computing / Programming Technician; Electronics and Automation Technician;  Mechatronics Technician and Car Mechatronics Technician.\r\nThe students / graduates will carry out internships in companies in the activity sector of their training and should perform tasks that are part of the professional profile of their course.\r\n\r\nRegarding the staff mobilities we intend to observe new teaching strategies and new methodologies to promote success. These will be put into practice in our school, through the action of each teacher involved.\r\n\r\nThis project is integrated in the European Strategic Development Plan of INETE. This plan aims to achieve the development of a European dimension in our students\u2019 education, in their professional qualification and on the development of school\u2019s human resources. Understanding the role of our school in the 21st century, giving students the skills they need to fully integrate society and the labour market makes us, naturally, more open to Europe and to the world. Being a vocational school, we consider that each project to be developed should add value and help improve employment rates and, as a consequence, widen horizons concerning the labour market level. \r\n \r\nThe project is part of the objectives of the school by helping to establish a Vocational School of reference, recognized by companies and families, that qualifies professionals valued by economic agents, and assumes the professional qualification as a personal development path from a Lifelong Learning perspective. \r\n \r\nFinally, the project aims to contribute to valorise of vocational education in Portugal, through the possibility and dissemination of experiences of young people of this education system to carry out international mobility in qualified areas. It is also intended to send a positive message to school community where we highlight that there are different strategies to promote school success (the goal is to deconstruct the idea that success in vocational education is not achieved by making things easier, but rather to work in a different way).", "http://www.twinuk.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PT01-KA102-035543_3"], ["9GB", "Consortium Inter-acad\u00e9mique de Mobilit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne dans l'enseignement professionnel 2017-2019", "Twin Training International Ltd", 766178.0, "80% - Rate of families in the Hauts-de-France Region eligible to social assistance\r\n27.7% - Regional unemployment rate for 15-24 year-olds, 3.5 points higher than the national rate\r\n17% - Regional early-school-leaving rate in vocational high school, 40% of young people moving to vocational high school after lower secondary school.\r\n\r\nThese statistics clearly introduce the social, educational and employment challenges faced by our \"academies\" in Amiens and Lille, and the necessity to set up ambitious projects to help reduce these proportions.\r\n\r\nOur academic projects claim a strong focus on European and international openness.

The content and length of the Mobility Placements has been designed to meet the career development aims of our Level 3 learners in these sectors, the majority of whom will have completed a Level 2 qualification and have some experience in entry level roles but are looking to move into more senior and better paid roles within their chosen field.\r\n\r\nThe EMCD project will also deliver the following complementary objectives that support the overall aim of enhancing the employability of our Level 3 learners within the target sectors:\r\n\r\nSUPPORTING CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC DEVELOPMENT: In addition to developing their vocational and workplace skills, Mobility Placements will offer a transformational life experience for our learners, many of whom will have had limited opportunities to travel abroad and certainly will not have lived and worked in another country.\r\n\r\nENHANCING OUR VOCATIONAL PROVISION: Integration of Mobility Placements within our vocational courses will enhance our provision for the target sectors. In particular, working with employers in Spain and Ireland will help to introduce European dimensions within the curricula of the courses linked to Mobility Placements and will broaden the perspectives of both tutors and learners.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPING OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH EMPLOYERS: Twin already has excellent links with local and regional employers and the work undertaken in developing this application has already enabled us to establish partnerships with employers within the target sectors in Spain and Ireland.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\nProject participants will be VET learners currently undertaking or having recently completed Level 3 vocational qualifications related to the hospitality and language teaching sectors and the specific courses where we propose to offer mobility opportunities to learners are:\r\n\r\n-  ILM Level 3 Certificate in Principles of Leadership and Management\r\n-  City & Guilds Level 3 Award in Principles of Website Creation and Optimisation\r\n-  LRN Level 3 Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\nThe core activities that the EMCD project will deliver will be 90 mobility work placements within the hospitality and language teaching sectors in Spain and Ireland.  We intend to deliver the 90 mobilities in the 3 groups of 30, with each group being broken down as follows: 14 Leadership and Management (8 to Spain, 6 to Ireland), 8 Digital Media to Spain and 8 TEFL to Spain.\r\n\r\nThe project will work with 27 Host Employers, which will facilitate effective matching of mobility work placement opportunities with the learning aims and career development aspirations of our participants. In addition to providing work experience for the participants, Host Employers will contribute to other key functions, including recruitment and selection, preparation and post placement support.  \r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nThe methodologies adopted by the EMCD project will focus on working in partnership with Host Employers in the destination countries that have the experience, expertise, organisational capacity and range of business activities that will support our learners in developing experience-acquired skills for their vocational area by working alongside established professionals in their chosen field.  Working in different sectors and with such a broad range of Host Employers will mean that no two mobilities will be exactly the same but they have been designed to both enable participants to put the skills learned during their VET courses into practice and take on additional responsibility and adapt to more senior roles within the workplace.\r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT\r\nThe project will deliver major impacts for the participants in terms of job outcomes and career development.  We expect that 73% (66 of 90) will enter employment within 3 months of completing their mobility and, of those, 91% (60 of the 66 moving into work) will sustain employment for at least 6 months. We also expect the project to benefit the labour market mobility of participants and expect at least 11% (10 of 90) to take up jobs in other EU countries. \r\n\r\nThe project will also build the capacity of partners to participate in transnational activities in general and the Erasmus+ programme in particular.

They won this award 5 times over a 7 year period, and were shortlisted in the years they didn't win. They work with international organisations from all over the world, and typically work with over 4000 candidates for our programs every year, and have many years of experience with handling and managing European funded programs, ensuring that all paperwork is completed as required as well as ensuring the applicants have an engaging, challenging, and fulfilling experience in London.\r\n\r\nTwin Group receives many groups every year from funded organisations, schools, colleges and universities, offering opportunities for students to gain a professional work experience in the UK, either in London or Eastbourne. They work with a large portfolio of placement companies, and are always happy to explore new areas in which they provide internships for our customers, as the level of vocational education increases across the EU under Erasmus Plus.\r\nThis stay will allow them to validate their diploma, it will be a way (means) for them who already made their internships (training courses) to compare the administration or the English companies with those of their country. \r\nSo for their following studies, they will have a wider choice during their next training course.\r\nThis group consists of 16 young students of the same class, almost all minors. \r\nThey will be accompanied by two of their teachers, from country of origine, that will have the heavy task to be present and guide them and prevent any possible problems but also to manage their regular evaluation in the company.\r\nDuring their stay in England, the students will stay at host families.

The training activities planned aim to consolidate partnerships with the territory for a detailed analysis of needs and to bridge the gap between training and business needs.

The program enable us to give the most number of students an international scope on their education. Our experience is that our students come home with many positive experiences from their mobilities and they are willing to participate in new mobilities. Our experience is that more and more students are asking about the danish PIU (Pratice abroad) programme. \r\nWe have, to optimize our selection of partners and thereby educations, been to a contact seminar in Dublin with the danish NA, where we were able to amke some very good new contacts. these new contacts/partners have been added to this application. We expect that there will be an introduction fase and we are palnning to visit the new partners before sending students. Mercantec has a goal to develop Erasmus+ mobilities which are longer than 3 weeks, and a new partner in Portugal has this oppotunity. the partner has a cooperation with two companies, which would be able to host business students for 7 weeks. We know that we might have a challenge with finding the students but nevertheless  we know that the students would like these longer lasting placements.\r\nWe plan to visit our German partners in February/March. This visit is to improve our relationship and explore possible future areas of cooperation. The participants on this trip is the heads of educations from the individual departments as well as the head of the international department and the international coordinator.

Development and implementation of this project are a continuation of good and fruitful results from nine years of focus on international internships and school attendance for HTX students and are an important part of AATG's overriding Globalization strategy and strategy for interaction with companies and the world around us. The project is part of a broad internationalization effort at AATG. During the period 2017-2019 the focus is in particular on teacher mobility to support the college\u2019s profile as an international upper secondary school, which is part of academic networks both internationally and nationally.    \r\nActivities: \r\nStudent mobility. The target group of the project is students from four study lines in which technology, communications / IT, design or English are majors. In this way, we ensure that the internships will form a natural part of the students\u2019 HTX training in accordance with the legal requirement: BEK nr. 740 af 23/06/2010 \u00a729 which requires some teaching to be provided in a work place context.  These study programmes are GLOBALTECH, MEDIATECH, Experience Design and Emergency Services. The partners in the project will complete a Learning Agreement before the student\u2019s departure. The students participate in three- or four-week internships in London or Barcelona depending on the study line  during 2nd or 3rd Year. London and Barcelona have been chosen because of the opportunities to add to the profile of the study lines a new and innovative approach to the subject\u2019s traditions and teaching environments with communication, IT and Design as well as improving the students\u2019 English language skills. In Barcelona English will also be the work language for most internships. The objectives for the students are:\r\n\u2022 That they develop their professional, intercultural and personal skills in such a way that they can be part of a globalized labor- and educational market later in their education.\r\n\u2022 That students become familiar with and gain an understanding of the requirements for the individual working in a globalized labor market.\r\n\u2022 That students upon their return can provide new and innovative approaches to subjects taught at AATG.\r\nGenerally, we assess the skills of HTX students as being adequate for a course of this character and length, the students are between 17 and 19 years old. We will carry out a three-part assessment to ensure the best implementation and placement in a company and host family. Based on previous experience, we expect to send off about 90-95% of the students in the classes, which are part of the project. \r\nTeacher mobility. The objective for employee/ teacher mobility is:\r\n- That the teachers develop their knowledge and pedagogic approach within their own subject through observation and participation in work placement with companies and job shadowing at education institutions in language teaching, design, technology and communication technical study lines.\r\n- That the teachers develop their own knowledge and understanding of what is required of the students in a globalized labor market.\r\n- That the teachers upon their return may add to the study lines new and innovative approaches to the subjects. \r\nThe participants in this project are students and teachers from study lines, which have an increased focus on both internationalization, the global labor market and interaction with companies.\r\nThe purpose of the mobility project is therefore aimed at several levels: special academic development and fulfillment of targets, practical experience and knowledge of companies, development of personal, linguistic and intercultural skills for student/ teacher and fulfillment of the College\u2019s strategic internationalization strategy.  \r\nIt has been agreed that the distribution of responsibility and roles among the participants in the project is as follows: \r\nAATG: Project management, practical and educational planning. Completing assessment. Organizing stays and transport. TWIN-UK/ Venga Travel: Participate in assessment for internships. Responsible for contracts with companies.
