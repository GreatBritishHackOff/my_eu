Presently, the majority of silicon ingots are sliced in thin wafers by LAS (loose abrasive sawing) using slurry of abrasive silicon carbide particles. The silicon carbide is not separable from the silicon dust in an economical way. The newer FAS (fixed abrasive sawing) uses diamond particles fixed to the cutting wire.

PowTech ITN aims to integrate inter-sectoral and multidisciplinary research in particle and powder technology into the training of 15 highly skilled young researchers, to strengthen the competitiveness of food and pharmaceutical industry and to strengthen the European Research Area.   The PowTech ITN has 20 partners (9 industry) and comprises a focused research programme and a graduate school.\n\nThe Focused Research programme will use an engineering design approach applied to powder processing. The understanding and modelling of powder structure from a molecular to a macro disperse scale will be used to understand how powder properties/functionality are formed or modified during processing. This knowledge will be used to select the appropriate process for production of the structure of interest. The long-term aim is to develop innovative products and to provide tools allowing minimal pilot plant trials.\n\nThe PowTech Graduate School is aligned with the research objectives of the project covering relevant S&T and personal skills courses but also an intensive and continuous training in collaboration with industry. In addition to the industrial secondments, the ESRs will have industrial training in different industries. An industrial mentor will be appointed to guide their Career development plan. The ESR will also be trained in Research Methodology through preparing a research plan for their work, and later in their project by developing a research plan, supervising a MSc student, and writing a Grant application.'", 217214.0, 3250444.0, "POWTECH", null, null, null, null, "http://www.gre.ac.uk", null, "fp7_96993_999867756"], ["9LS", "Human behaviour in crisis situations: A cross cultural investigation to tailor security-related communication", "University of Greenwich", "The aim of the proposed project is to investigate cross-cultural and ethnic differences of human behaviour in crisis situations in order to better tailor security related communication, instructions and procedures with a view to improving evacuation and protection.

As these participants do not work in companies, the program duration will be longer allowing learning outcomes to be consolidated more effectively. The previous project of its kind was awarded the title \u201cBest Practice Project\u201d by the NA-BIBB in 2012. Twenty-four participants will take part in the six-week program in Bournemouth, UK. Alongside preparation in Germany, participants complete a week-long language and intercultural training course in Bournemouth, followed by five weeks work experience. The structure and internship areas are the same as mentioned in project A2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject A3:\r\n\r\nIn this project ten photo design trainees will complete a twelve week internship in the UK which specializes in this field. This high level of specialization and the length of the program mean that the needs of the participants, the school and the receiving company can be more effectively taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject A4:\r\n\r\nThis project is directed at students who, having completed a full-time school-based traineeship, require a longer period of practical training to allow them the opportunity to demonstrate their strengths and to prove that they can apply the theory they have acquired during the traineeship. In the first year, thirty traineeship graduates should complete a three month internship including an introductory course and an accompanying evening class in the UK. The combination of scholastic and practical elements should allow graduates to develop skills which are not able to develop fully in a purely academic environment. This should improve their employment outlook and initiate an interest in international mobility at the beginning of their professional career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject A5:\r\n\r\nThis project is designed for thirty graduates from hotel and catering traineeships. Participants will undertake a four-month learning period abroad consisting of a specialist internship and an introductory course in the UK. The combination of scholastic and practical elements should allow graduates to further develop their skills. This should improve their employment outlook and initiate an interest in international mobility at the beginning of their professional career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject A6:\r\n\r\nThe project \u201eIntercultural Training for Vocational School Teachers\u201d is targeted at teachers from the departments of English and Economics. The aim of the program is to offer vocational teachers the opportunity for professional, linguistic and personal exchange and to encourage the establishment of a Germany-wide network. The target group has prior experience of the execution of learning experiences abroad and should, through taking part, be given a clearer idea of the insights their trainees gain by participating in the project. Over a period of ten days, a group of thirty teachers will receive inter-cultural and linguistic training in Torquay, UK; pay visits to educational institutions in the area; and take part in cultural activities. As a result of this experience, teachers should be able to strengthen the understanding of the importance of inter-cultural competence in vocational training on a regional level, and function as experts in the execution of learning experiences abroad. Teachers should also develop a concept to prepare the trainees\u2019 for their stay abroad, which is integrated into the traineeship itself.", "http://www.twinuk.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000161_5"], ["9GB", "EPAMG - Looking for the Future", "Twin Training International Ltd", 61647.0, "This proposal aims to give an excellence experience to the chosen students, in order to contribute definitely and positively to their academic, personal and professional.

Young people do not only need to have expert knowledge but also interdisciplinary skills, as well as proficiency in foreign languages and intercultural skills to be qualified for an international labour market. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEuro Akademie Hannover prepares their students for a role in the global labour market and provides them with the necessary skills and competences to work in an international, multilingual and multicultural environment. This project therefore follows essential objectives of the strategy Europe 2020 and aims at:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Reducing unemployment by developing key competences to successfully complete a vocational education or higher education programme, \r\n\r\n\u2022 and using an educational concept of multimedia learning as a framework for the development of graduate attributes and employability skills, e.g. creativity, openness, co-operation, intellectual flexibility, analysing skills, learner responsibility or coping with complexity\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2022 to enhance the performance and reinforce the attractiveness of vocational education and training\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2022 and create new opportunities through flexible learning pathways between different education and training sectors and levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEuro Akademie Hannover is a member of ESO \u2013 Euro-Schulen- Organisation and thus benefits from a network of about 100 institutes, including colleges of further and vocational education, nursery schools and universities of applied sciences and many international partners. It is a long established and officially accredited institution with more than thirty years of expertise in developing vocational education programmes meeting the demands of an international labour market. The combination of vocational and higher education degrees enables students to proceed to bachelor top-up programmes, for example in management or business administration. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the project, a two-year vocational training and a joint vocational and academic education programme with New College Durham are the basis for individual development and different options to obtain further qualifications or find employment. Work placements during and after the vocational qualification programme help students to develop employability skills, search for professional opportunities, but also support the development of academic key competences and  qualify for a bachelor top-up degree. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout 62 vocational education students between 16 and 25 years and 8 teachers benefit from the project through mobility and learning opportunities. Students in programmes that require a university entry qualification aim at a two- or three-semester top-up degree whereas those who left school with o-levels usually look for alternative opportunities and educational concepts that not only qualify for university but also facilitate the entry into the labour market. After a two year foundation degree these students have three options: employment, a higher diploma followed by an international bachelor\u2019s top-up  degree or higher education at a German university. The German system requires between 11 and 12 semesters including the vocational education period whereas the international track in cooperation with foreign university partners takes 8 to 9 semesters in total.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concept aims at young people who would like to qualify for university through a vocational education programme and obtain a formal qualification as well. Many school leavers do not have the necessary employability skills to qualify for a vocational training in the German dual system. Though many young people have a university entrance qualification, they do not have the necessary self-confidence and skills to cope with independent and research based learning models. They are afraid not to find a job after a conventional university education that very often does not include any work-based elements. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMany students at Euro Akademie Hannover have a strong and intact multicultural background. They are very interested in foreign languages and would like to use the special interpersonal skills their personal backgrounds give them professionally. This group of young Germans sees a multicultural heritage as an opportunity and has realised that this is an informal qualification many employers and industries look for. They start their careers abroad and usually find good employment in Germany after a period of professional development and orientation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project therefore\u2026:\r\n\r\n\u2022 enhances immediate employment opportunities for graduates of vocational education programmes in Germany \r\n\r\n\u2022 creates flexible learning pathways between vocational and higher education\r\n\r\n\u2022 uses European key competences as the basis for the establishment of professional competences and the development of employability skills maps within ESCO", "http://www.twinuk.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000440_2"], ["9GB", "Leinen Los!", "Twin Training International Ltd", 23923.0, "Main focus of the \"Leinen Los!\" project is the promotion of  vocational integration for young, socio-economically disadvantaged individuals into the german and european labor market.

This is especially true for the service sector and skilled craft and trade related sector as well - which are the occupations of our target group. But in cause of the socio-economic situation of our target group  those young people do face considerable obstacles when it comes to the acquisition of work experience abroad.

For some of the beneficiaries participating in an internship abroad is mandatory because of the curricula of their vocational training. In addition, interested students from other classes with lessons in foreign languages internships abroad are made possible after a successful application. The number of these international activities shall be expanded. This affects both the number of participants and the partner institutions and host countries.\r\n\r\nThe learning of international skills and the improvement of personal skills are the main goals for the students of Humpis-Schule. The Humpis-Schule itself wants to be perceived as a competent partner for companies in the field of international commitments and improve its attractiveness accordingly. The participating training companies aim to get more competent and mature employees. The students should be strengthened in their attitudes to European society and should be prepared to be mature and responsible citizens. Overall, the stay of young people in other European countries should give insights into all areas of life and thus advance the European integration and, in particular, to ensure peace in the long term.\r\n\r\nA total of 108 participants are planned. 90 participants go to England (45 to Guildford, 30 London, 15 Chichester ) and 10 participants to Denmark.

On a different date an additional 7 participants should undergo an appropriate placement for 16 days in France.\r\n\r\nThere are two groups:\r\n\r\nApprox. 50 people take part in the training programme \"AusbildungPlus\" as assistants in industry, wholesale and foreign trade, office or a forwarding agent or specialist for warehouse logistics with the additional qualifications \"foreign trade, logistics, controlling and foreign languages\". At the time of the stay, the trainees are in their second year. These beneficiaries are of legal age and have University or College Entrance degree.\r\n\r\nThe second group was recruited from other trainees from different and some other professions. The prerequisite is that the necessary language skills are proven and that the personal suitability is given.\r\n\r\nThe vast number of beneficiaries has not had any practical experience with foreign languages in other European countries.\r\n\r\nThe training companies of the beneficiaries are almost exclusively small or medium-sized Upper Swabian companies whose trade relations are characterized by increasing international interdependence.\r\n\r\nThe activity consists largely of an internship in a company abroad. The participants in England get lessons in English one day a week. On at least two weekends day trips will take place each one organized by the students themselves.

Even the most perfect training with native teachers cannot be as good as real life experience in a foreign country. Work experience is required in most job advertisements \u2013 and if this experience was even gained abroad future employers will appreciate it. \r\nOne of our main targets is to expand our BFS students\u2019 professional and intercultural horizon by living abroad for a certain time. Not only will they become more self-confident but also improve their professional prospects, both in Germany and internationally. \r\nIn terms of language, the idea is to improve pronunciation, understanding, oral expression and expand the vocabulary they learned at IFA. Moreover, they have the opportunity to understand what word processing is used for in a real working environment.  Basically the internship is about working as a secretary or team assistant in an international situation. The students meet people who might be useful in their future professional lives and get an idea what tasks are included in the profession of a multilingual secretary.\r\nFor this purpose every year 10 students are to go to England, France and Spain for four weeks during their final IFA year, the country depending on the language they are most interested in.  The stays in the spring of 2015 and 2016 will include the Bavarian Easter holidays so that the students miss as few lessons as possible.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the school year, teachers tell students about this option and lots of questions are answered in individual conversations. In October, all interested students meet and are provided with any information required. The participants are selected according to their applications and their general suitability. Intercultural training is an essential part of our curriculum so all students are trained throughout their time at IFA. The participants, however, are granted an extra Saturday for their specific preparations. Flight and insurances are booked by IFA. Our partners inform us about the planned work placements.\r\nUpon arrival, the students are picked up by the host organization, and provided with any important information and taken to their host families/residences.\r\nIn the first week they attend a language and introductory course. After thorough consideration we decided to start the stay with this course because most of the students are quite young and not used to living abroad, let alone working. This week is provided for participants to adapt and to meet people, get to know the place and the language.  At the end of the first week, the students are interviewed by their future employers, where they are going to work for three weeks according to the learning agreements agreed upon between the partners.\r\nAs long as the students are abroad, our partners also take care of tutoring, some social activities and monitoring, always in alignment with IFA. As soon as the students are back we meet again and discuss their new experience. The participants\u2019 reports, certificates and our feedback sheets are evaluated as well as our individual conversations. Once the evaluation is finished, we concentrate on the distribution of the acquired knowledge and information so that even more people get to know Erasmus+ and benefit from our experience.\r\nAs this is already the second project we are applying for, a number of organizational problems have already been solved and we can put stronger emphasis on further optimizing our new Erasmus+ project.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the participants will function as messengers for international cooperation by developing as a person, in their field, in terms of language and intercultural competence. They\u2019ll build bridges between people they meet privately or at work. As a direct and immediate personal result we expect their oral marks in their final state exam to be better after being so used to talking in a foreign language.\r\nIFA teachers face new challenges by this absolutely new task of applying for EU funding and developing a project.

As soon as the participants for a particular flow have been secured the partner organization in the host country is commissioned with carrying out the preparations for the flow. The quality of each flow is ensured by a number of measures, e. g. mid-term reports, evaluation meetings, accompanying visits and/or a preparatory visit. \r\n\r\nThe desired outcome of the stay abroad is always to improve the participants' employability (roughly 10 % of our participants even receive a job offer abroad), improved social integration of participants who are young parents, have a migration background or learning disabilities, improved proficiency in foreign languages as well as personality development.

As soon as the participants for a particular flow have been secured the partner organization in the host country is commissioned with carrying out the preparations for the flow. The quality of each flow is ensured by a number of measures, e. g. mid-term reports, evaluation meetings, accompanying visits and/or a preparatory visit. \r\nThe most highly desired outcome of the stay abroad is always to improve the participants' employability (roughly 10 % of our participants even receive a job offer abroad), improved social integration of participants who are young parents, have a migration background or learning disabilities, improved proficiency in foreign languages as well as personality development. Furthermore, we intend to create excitement for the European Union in general amongst satisfied participants! All of them can be instrumental in internationalizing their educational institutions. Particularly by helping to create a functional network between the body responsible for the project and local partner organizations. \r\nOur network has been growing for nine years now and the long-term effects of our steady growth in terms of quality and numbers of participants are becoming ever more evident.

Important parts of this are international experiences of the students. Therefore, the Vocational School Department has offered various trainees the possibility of an internship in other European countries for years. For some of the beneficiaries participating in an internship abroad is mandatory because of the curricula of their vocational training. In addition, interested students from other classes with lessons in foreign languages internships abroad are made possible after a successful application. \r\nThe learning of international skills and the improvement of personal skills are the main goals for the students of Humpis-Schule. The Humpis-Schule itself wants to be perceived as a competent partner for companies in the field of international commitments and improve its attractiveness accordingly. The participating training companies aim to get more competent and mature employees. The students should be strengthened in their attitudes to European society and should be prepared to be mature and responsible citizens. Overall, the stay of young people in other European countries should give insights into all areas of life and thus advance the European integration and, in particular, to ensure peace in the long term.\r\nA total of 108 participants are planned. 90 participants go to England (45 to Guildford, 30 London, 15 Chichester ) and 10 participants to Denmark. Each one goes for 24 days to do an internship in companies. On a different date an additional 8 participants should undergo an appropriate placement for 16 days in France.\r\nThere are two groups:\r\nApprox. 50 people take part in the training programme \"AusbildungPlus\" as assistants in industry, wholesale and foreign trade, office or a forwarding agent or specialist for warehouse logistics with the additional qualifications \"foreign trade, logistics, controlling and foreign languages\". At the time of the stay, the trainees are in their second year. These beneficiaries are of legal age and have University or College Entrance degree.\r\nThe second group was recruited from other trainees from different and some other professions. The prerequisite is that the necessary language skills are proven and that the personal suitability is given.\r\nThe vast number of beneficiaries has not had any practical experience with foreign languages in other European countries.\r\nThe training companies of the beneficiaries are almost exclusively small or medium-sized Upper Swabian companies whose trade relations are characterized by increasing international interdependence.\r\nThe activity consists largely of an internship in a company abroad. The participants in England get lessons in English one day a week. On at least two weekends day trips will take place each one organized by the students themselves. Except for the 7 beneficiaries who participate in the internship in France, all students will be staying with host families to support a closest possible relationship and to encourage them to speak as much English as possible.\r\nIn addition, two participants are scheduled for a three-month internship in England.\r\n17 teachers of the Humpis-Schule will have a short stay in London including a company visit and co-operation with local teachers to bring international aspects into their lessons and make them available as multipliers to other teachers.\r\nThere is extensive organizational work necessary. The Humpis School is responsible for the application, the linguistic and intercultural preparation of the participants, documentation and travel planning. The partner institutions organize the internships and accommodation. Students are required to participate and to comply with a Code of Conduct and edit some projects whose results will be documented in their school-leaving certificate.\r\nAs further results positive developments in the personal and linguistic skills of the beneficiaries are expected. The motivation, to see the process of European convergence positively will increase as well as and the international mobility. The attractiveness and quality of vocational education at the Humpis School will continue to improve steadily, and the collaboration with companies will be more intensive and more productive. In the long term the entire region will benefit, because more competent employees have better results and solution strategies.

The first group are the students, i.e. trainees in different administrative and commercial jobs as well as future graduates in business administration,  who will be enabled by the project to take part in a 2-week or 6-month work experience  programme in a placement relevant to their apprenticeship or chosen focus of studies. The second group of beneficiaries are the teaching staff of THS, who will be enabled to take part in a training programme to enhance their theoretical and practical skills in teaching. Participants are the beneficiaries, their employing companies in Germany and the companies providing the internship in Great Britain. Moreover there is the Theodor-Heuss-School as sending and TWIN and the Totnes European School as receiving organisation. Additionally, there is the IHK (=Chamber of Commerce) in Reutlingen which supervises and certifies the students' professional training. The increasing internationalisation of the companies and universities in the Neckar-Alb-Region leads to the fact, that even smaller and middle-sized businesses have to adapt to a growing number of international clients. It is therefore more and more important for our trainees and prospective junior executives and managers as well as for the staff teaching them to enhance their foreign language skills, practical skills and intercultural competence. The aims of the project for the students comprise the following aspects: Deepening and expanding practical and theoretical skills gained in the apprenticeships and at vocational school / professional school by applying them in an English company. Acquiring knowledge about British economy and in particular about the sector of the internship company. Getting to know the English culture and way of life. Gaining an insight into regional economic developments and their history in the London area or the Devon region, respectively. Last but not least the development of their oral and written communication skills in a foreign language.After returning to Germany the participants will recognize similarities and differences in the work routines in German and Britishcompanies. During their further education and personal development they will benefit from their participation in the project because of their enhanced theoretical and practical competences. The aims of the project for the teaching staff comprise the following aspects: In compliance with the individual needs of our staff in terms of further developing their skills in the foreign language and intercultural competence, the realization of custom-made training programmes is supposed to provide the teaching staff with the means to enhance these skills. Moreover, this project part is supposed to enable the staff to successfully prepare and support the students who take part in the other mobility options of the project. Thus, visiting companies who provide our students with internships is a crucial aspect of the programme, as it serves to highlight the necessity of adequately preparing these students. At the same time the training programm is designed to provide the teachers with the appropriate tools to do so.Furthermore, all participants will be ambassadors for a united Europe, as they will have personally experienced the benefit of the European Union for their own lives.

We want to reach this goal by offering the target group customized high-quality learning settings abroad. To achieve this we will continue cooperating with the vocational schools, the apprentices\u2019 companies, the Chamber of Commerce as well as with the trade unions and professionals\u2019 organisations. To flank the achievement of these goals we aim to strengthen the competences of the professionals working in schools (particularly at the management level), so they can better aid the young learners to enter the European employment more successfully.An overriding objective of the project is to increase the integration of participants with a migrational background, who are young parents or who are disadvantaged learners into the work force.The following are the main activities we will offer the youths mentioned above:- internships abroad for the youths in their fields- project work abroad for the youths on topics related to participants' vocational fields A majority of the participating youths will be from the following fields: clerical occupations, media, hotel, gastronomy, carpenters/joiners.These main activities will supported by the following flanking activities offered to professionals and student teachers in vocational training centers in Berlin: - Advanced and further training abroad with the topic \u201cprofessionalizing the teacher\u2019s acting in the classroom on the European level aiming to better prepare students for the European job market\u201d.- Professional development training for school management staff regarding \u201cstudents with special needs\u201d.- Training for student teachers with the focus on \u201eLearning from the Best in Europe \u2013 enhancing methodical expertise!\u201d- Training for future school management staff: \u201cHow to successfully develop a vocational training school/institution\u201dOur GoEurope mobility network encompasses 30 different partner organizations in 10 EU countries plus Turkey.

The majority of our partners can tap into a network of a several hundred or even a several thousand potential internship companies. They are well connected with the vocational training centers and political institutions in their respective regions. As soon as the decisive parameters of a mobility flow have been defined with our local training institutions the project is actively promoted to the target group and participants are selected from the applicants. As soon as the participants for a particular flow have been secured the partner organization in the host country is commissioned with carrying out the preparations for the flow. The quality of each flow is ensured by a number of measures, e. g. mid-term reports, evaluation meetings, accompanying visits and/or a preparatory visit. The most desired outcome of the stay abroad is always to improve the participants' employability (roughly 10 % of our participants even receive a job offer abroad), improved social integration of participants who are young parents, have a migrational background or learning disabilities, improved proficiency in foreign languages as well as personality development. Furthermore, we intend to create excitement for the European Union in general amongst satisfied participants! All of them can be instrumental in internationalizing their educational institutions. Particularly by helping to create a functional network including the body responsible for the project and local partner organizations.Our network has been growing for ten years now and the long-term effects of our steady growth in terms of quality and numbers of participants are becoming ever more evident.

Important parts of this are international experiences of the students. Therefore, the Vocational School Department has offered various trainees the possibility of an internship in other European countries for years. For some of the beneficiaries participating in an internship abroad is mandatory because of the curricula of their vocational training. In addition, interested students from other classes with lessons in foreign languages internships abroad are made possible after a successful application. The learning of international skills and the improvement of personal skills are the main goals for the students of Humpis-Schule. The Humpis-Schule itself wants to be perceived as a competent partner for companies in the field of international commitments and improve its attractiveness accordingly. The participating training companies aim to get more competent and mature employees. The students should be strengthened in their attitudes to European society and should be prepared to be mature and responsible citizens. Overall, the stay of young people in other European countries should give insights into all areas of life and thus advance the European integration and, in particular, to ensure peace in the long term.A total of 65 participants are planned. 62 participants go to England (40 to London, 20 to Chichester, 2 to Guildford). Each one goes for 23 days to do an internship in companies. On a different date an additional 3 participants should undergo an appropriate placement for 16 days in France.There are two groups:Approx. 40 people take part in the training programme \"AusbildungPlus\" as assistants in industry, wholesale and foreign trade, office or a forwarding agent or specialist for warehouse logistics with the additional qualifications \"foreign trade, logistics, controlling and foreign languages\". At the time of the stay, the trainees are in their second year. These beneficiaries are of legal age and have University or College Entrance degree.The second group was recruited from other trainees from different and some other professions. The prerequisite is that the necessary language skills are proven and that the personal suitability is given.The vast number of beneficiaries has not had any practical experience with foreign languages in other European countries.The training companies of the beneficiaries are almost exclusively small or medium-sized Upper Swabian companies whose trade relations are characterized by increasing international interdependence.The activity consists largely of an internship in a company abroad. The participants in England get lessons in English one day a week. On at least two weekends day trips will take place each one organized by the students themselves. Except for the 3 beneficiaries who participate in the internship in France, all students will be staying with host families to support a closest possible relationship and to encourage them to speak as much English as possible.In addition, two participants are scheduled for a two-months internship in England.There is extensive organizational work necessary. The Humpis School is responsible for the application, the linguistic and intercultural preparation of the participants, documentation and travel planning. The partner institutions organize the internships and accommodation. Students are required to participate and to comply with a Code of Conduct and edit some projects whose results will be documented in their school-leaving certificate.As further results positive developments in the personal and linguistic skills of the beneficiaries are expected. The motivation, to see the process of European convergence positively will increase as well as and the international mobility. The attractiveness and quality of vocational education at the Humpis School will continue to improve steadily, and the collaboration with companies will be more intensive and more productive. In the long term the entire region will benefit, because more competent employees have better results and solution strategies. This will have positive effects on international business as well, so the benefits go far beyond the region.In addition, the training is designed to provide an attractive alternative to University training and to strengthen the dual system of vocational education.", "http://www.twinuk.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002837_1"], ["9GB", "Kompetenzentwicklung fachlich, sprachlich, interkulturell -  Praktikum mit Sprachkurs im Ausland", "Twin Training International Ltd", 21589.0, "When you are studying at IFA to become a multilingual correspondent you have to get used to communicating with companies abroad. Even the most perfect training with native teachers cannot be as good as real life experience in a foreign country. Work experience is required in most job advertisements \u2013 and if this experience was even gained abroad future employers will appreciate it. One of our main targets is to expand our BFS students\u2019 professional and intercultural horizon by living abroad for a certain time. Not only will they become more self-confident but also improve their professional prospects, both in Germany and internationally. In terms of language, the idea is to improve pronunciation, understanding, oral expression and expand the vocabulary they learned at IFA. Moreover, they have the opportunity to understand what word processing is used for in a real working environment.  Basically the internship is about working as a secretary or team assistant in an international situation. The students meet people who might be useful in their future professional lives and get an idea what tasks are included in the profession of a multilingual secretary.For this purpose in the next two years 9 students each are to go to England, France and Spain for four weeks during their final IFA year, the country depending on the language they are most interested in.  The stays in the spring of 2017 and 2018 will include the Bavarian Easter holidays so that the students miss as few lessons as possible.At the beginning of the school year, teachers tell students about this option and lots of questions are answered in individual conversations. In October, all interested students meet and are provided with any information required. The participants are selected according to their applications and their general suitability. Intercultural training is an essential part of our curriculum so all students are trained throughout their time at IFA. The participants, however, are granted an extra Saturday for their specific preparations. Travel and insurances are booked by IFA. Our partners inform us about the planned work placements.Upon arrival, the students are picked up by the host organization, and provided with any important information and taken to their host families.In the first week they attend a language and introductory course. After thorough consideration we decided to start the stay with this course because most of the students are quite young and not used to living abroad, let alone working. This week is provided for participants to adapt and to meet people, get to know the place and the language.  At the end of the first week, the students are interviewed by their future employers, where they are going to work for three weeks according to the learning agreements agreed upon between the partners.As long as the students are abroad, our partners also take care of tutoring, some social activities and monitoring, always in alignment with IFA. As soon as the students are back we meet again and discuss their new experience. The participants\u2019 reports, certificates and our feedback sheets are evaluated as well as our individual conversations. Once the evaluation is finished, we concentrate on the distribution of the acquired knowledge and information so that even more people get to know Erasmus+ and benefit from our experience.As this is already the third project we are applying for, a number of organizational problems have already been solved and we can put stronger emphasis on further optimizing our new Erasmus+ project.As a result, the participants will function as messengers for international cooperation by developing as a person, in their field, in terms of language and intercultural competence. They\u2019ll build bridges between people they meet privately or at work. As a direct and immediate personal result we expect their oral marks in their final state exam to be better after being so used to talking in a foreign language.IFA teachers have faced new challenges by this absolutely new task of applying for EU funding and developing a project. At EU meetings they consult other teachers or educational experts as well as business people  We have come into contact with foreign organisations giving us new impulses, thus supporting our international orientation and profile.This kind of projects helps our students to make their CV stand out by proving how proactive they have already been.

There is considerable danger for them that this lack of opportunity and hence experience and key skills will result in a life defining disadvantage and / or exclusion regarding future job chances.In most cases, a stay abroad holds especially for young people with precarious socio-economic background the first opportunity to try and develop an indipendent lifestyle out of the framework of their family and social structures. Following the feedback of those who benefit from work related international exchange programmes, those youg people experience considerable personal growth, feel more empowered and more purposeful in regard of their vocational perspective than they felt before their departure.

This project therefore follows essential objectives of the strategy Europe 2020 and aims at:\u2022 Reducing unemployment by developing key competences to successfully complete a vocational education or higher education programme, \u2022 and using an educational concept of multimedia learning as a framework for the development of graduate attributes and employability skills, e.g. creativity, openness, co-operation, intellectual flexibility, analysing skills, learner responsibility or coping with complexity\u2026\u2022 to enhance the performance and reinforce the attractiveness of vocational education and training\u2026\u2022 and create new opportunities through flexible learning pathways between different education and training sectors and levels.Euro Akademie Erfurt is a member of ESO \u2013 Euro-Schulen- Organisation and thus benefits from a network of about 100 institutes, including colleges of further and vocational education, nursery schools and universities of applied sciences and many international partners. It is a long established and officially accredited institution with more than thirty years of expertise in developing vocational education programmes meeting the demands of an international labour market. The combination of vocational and higher education degrees enables students to proceed to bachelor top-up programmes, for example in management or business administration. Within the project, a two-year vocational training and a joint vocational and academic education programme with New College Durham are the basis for individual development and different options to obtain further qualifications or find employment. Work placements during and after the vocational qualification programme help students to develop employability skills, search for professional opportunities, but also support the development of academic key competences and  qualify for a bachelor top-up degree. This concept aims at young people who would like to qualify for university through a vocational education programme and obtain a formal qualification as well. Unite school leavers do not have the necessary employability skills to qualify for a vocational training in the German dual system. Though many young people have a university entrance qualification, they do not have the necessary self-confidence and skills to cope with independent and research based learning models. They are afraid not to find a job after a conventional university education that very often does not include any work-based elements. students at Euro Akademie Hannover have a strong and intact multicultural background. They are very interested in foreign languages and would like to use the special interpersonal skills their personal backgrounds give them professionally.

As a backdrop to the project, in recent years Europe has had to come to terms with high rates of unemployment in all age groups, but most particularly among young people and among adults with low levels of qualification. To coincide with this, the European labour market shows ever-increasing competitiveness related to specialised competence and knowledge and to the involvement of new technologies. In social terms, recent months have been characterised by a negative economic impact on inclusion and on social justice, exacerbated by the refugee crisis and the simultaneous increase in the threat of terrorism, often originating from inside the EU itself. European values and principles appear to be at a crossroads as cohesion weakens. It is within this kind of context that projects such as this one can make a difference, by contributing at grass-roots level towards an upturn in growth, based on the principles of equal opportunities and inclusion, gradually leading to a new increase in prosperity and wellbeing. This will be achieved through local and transnational co-operation and by means of the mobilities we intend to promote, which together will provide important added value to all involved and will represent another step forward in achieving these goals. At the level of the organisations involved (the members of the consortium, the intermediary and the receiving organisations), there is a valuable opportunity to become more competitive though the processes of innovation, of co-operation and of internationalisation implicit in the execution of the project, which will also include the application of several elements of the ECVET system. This will permit the full integration of these elements into the curricula of some of the courses offered by the organisations involved, and the integration of mobility into the training plans of these courses.In practical terms, the project will provide 2-month mobility experiences for 55 participants who will have completed vocational training related to sectors which reflect the training offered by the members of the consortium, with a emphasis on those from economically, financially and socially underprivileged backgrounds. The mobility opportunities will be distributed according to the needs of each organisation and will take into account the number of trainees completing courses each year. The co-ordinator, CEL, will attribute 16 mobilities to students completing vocational training in translation and interpreting, and in language teacher training, given the average total of 50 per year. The CML training department will benefit from 10 mobilities given their average annual total of 30 trainees who complete courses in gardening and paving. The Education and Development Centres at CPL will benefit from 29 mobilities distributed among 16 training areas, which include a variety of sectors, such as management, fashion design, tourism, IT, electricians, arts and audiovisuals. Every year, more than 500 trainees complete training at CPL. As a result of their mobilities, the participants will gain the knowledge, skills and competence which are fundamental to obtaining enhanced employability, both on a personal and on a professional level, in terms of both language skills and cultural awareness, and in terms of both social and civic skills. The project will also provide 12 2-week mobilities for staff (professionals working at the organisations of the consortium), in areas related to vocational education, training and integration, with a view to improving their skills so that they may better contribute towards the common strategy of international co-operation.With the aim of ensuring that these goals are achieved with high levels of quality, the project will include 29 partner organisations (intermediary and receiving organisations). The considerable quantity of PIC numbers belonging to receiving organisations demonstrates the commitment already consolidated between them and the intermediary partners, a clear indication of commitment to the aims of the project.

It's important to mention that these partners are all already known by the members of this consortium or by the coordinating team, and the quality of exchanges/partnerships with them is already proved.This MOPAAM 16 project will go further with the networking of vocational institutions in the region and will promote exchange of good practices, all of this around a common main objective: giving to the teachings received by most of our students, a capital added value when reaching the labour market, an increased employability.This added value will have a significant impact on:- the development of their propensity to mobility, transnational labour mobility during the studies becoming a reality for many of them,- the reinforcement of their skills, whether professional, entrepreneurial, interpersonal, intercultural, linguistic or social,- their independence/autonomy, ambition and motivation.This will help reverse the obstacles, insurmountable for some of them, of national or European professional mobility.Improved propensity to mobility, increased skills, strengthened ambition and motivation, represent key assets that will enhance employability and openness of the beneficiaries.The impact will also be significant for concerned institutions: contribution to achieving the objectives of their school project in terms of openness to Europe and to the world.And this will be done in the framework of an academic consortium supported by an experienced team: a structuring, reassuring, simplifying framework which enable exchanges of experiences and expertises.Their local and regional reputation will also be greatly impacted, it will contribute to the qualitative and quantitative improvement of the guidance of lower-secondary-school students towards these member schools.Finally, the project coordinating teams in these institutions will have the opportunity to develop their professional skills, particularly in terms of project management and knowledge of a school's overall operation. These teams, members of the MOPAAM16 project steering committee, will be involved in all the project phases: distribution & preparation of the mobilities, implementation of the mobilities, valorization & dissemination of the project results, project assessment.The MOPAAM16 project is a necessary and ambitious project in an region where challenges are significant.", "http://www.twinuk.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA102-023196_5"], ["9GB", "FLY ME TO THE MOON", "Twin Training International Ltd", 2054.0, "Thanks to a good communication between English coach and trainers, one of our students gave us the email address of her aunt, Executive Housekeeper at Melia White House Hotel in London.

A team of teachers, consisting of five teachers and one head of department, was formed to organize the project.\r\nThe current project consists of several parts: a group of 70 students take part in an internship in England. For some of the beneficiaries participating in an internship abroad is mandatory because of the curricula of their vocational training. In addition, interested students from other classes with lessons in foreign languages internships abroad are made possible after a successful application. 45 persons will complete their international internship with the project partner Twin Training International in London with a weekly five-day internship and two evening events per week with English-language classes. The students will live in English families. At the same time, 25 people in Chichester will go through a similar program organized by the Chichester College. On two weekends a cultural program organized by the participants will take place. Further projects of the participants are about documentation, evaluation or public relations.\r\nApproximately 45 of the participating trainees complete an apprenticeship with additional qualification. They have A-levels. The remaining 25 places will be given to other trainees, who have intermediate school certificates.\r\nTen students will take part in an internship in Spain for two weeks.

The learning of international skills and the improvement of personal skills are the main goals for the students of Humpis-Schule. The Humpis-Schule itself wants to be perceived as a competent partner for companies in the field of international commitments and improve its attractiveness accordingly. The participating training companies aim to get more competent and mature employees. The students should be strengthened in their attitudes to European society and should be prepared to be mature and responsible citizens.

The aim of a cultural and economic unity in connection with mobility  in the European labour market has to remain our focus.  At the same time, changes due to globalisation are making high demands on the international labour market, qualifications and job requirements. Young people do not only need expert knowledge but also interdisciplinary skills, as well as proficiency in foreign languages and intercultural skills to be sufficiently qualified for the international labour market. \r\nEuro Akademie Oldenburg prepares their students for a role in the global labour market and provides them with the necessary skills and competences to work in an international, multilingual and multicultural environment. This project therefore follows essential objectives of the strategy Europe 2020 and aims at:\r\n\u2022 Reducing unemployment by developing key competences to successfully complete a vocational education or higher education programme, \r\n\u2022 using an educational concept of multimedia learning as a framework for the development of graduate attributes and employability skills, e.g. creativity, openness, co-operation, intellectual flexibility, analysing skills, learner responsibility or coping with complexity\u2026\r\nto enhance the performance and reinforce the attractiveness of vocational education and training and create new opportunities through flexible learning pathways between different education and training sectors and levels.\r\n\r\nEuro Akademie Oldenburg is a member of ESO Education Group and thus benefits from a network of about 100 institutes, including colleges of further and vocational education, nursery schools and universities of applied sciences and many international partners. It is a long established and officially accredited institution with more than thirty years of expertise in developing vocational education programmes meeting the demands of an international labour market. The combination of vocational and higher education degrees enables students to proceed to bachelor top-up programmes, for example in International Management, Marketing Management or Health & Well-being. \r\n\r\nWithin the project, a two-year vocational training and a joint vocational and academic education programme with New College Durham and Dublin Business School are the basis for individual development and different options to obtain further qualifications or find employment. Work placements during and after the vocational qualification programme help students to develop employability skills, search for professional opportunities, but also support the development of academic key competences and  qualify for a bachelor top-up degree. \r\n\r\nAbout 20 vocational education students between 16 and 25 years and 4 teachers benefit from the project through mobility and learning opportunities. Students in programmes that require a university entry qualification aim at a two- or three-semester top-up degree whereas those who left school with o-levels usually look for alternative opportunities and educational concepts that not only qualify for university but also facilitate the entry into the labour market. After a two year foundation degree these students have three options: employment, a higher diploma followed by an international bachelor\u2019s top-up  degree or higher education at a German university. The German system requires between 11 and 12 semesters including the vocational education period whereas the international track in cooperation with foreign university partners takes 8 to 9 semesters in total (depending on individual qualification levels).\r\n\r\nThis concept aims at young people who would like to qualify for university through a vocational education programme and obtain a formal qualification as well. Many school leavers do not have the necessary employability skills to qualify for a vocational training in the German dual system. Though many young people have a university entrance qualification, they do not have the necessary self-confidence and skills to cope with independent and research based learning models. They are afraid not to find a job after a conventional university education that very often does not include any work-based elements. \r\n \r\nMany students at Euro Akademie Oldenburg have a strong and intact multicultural background. They are very interested in foreign languages and would like to use the special interpersonal skills their personal backgrounds give them professionally. This group of young Germans sees a multicultural heritage as an opportunity and has realised that this is an informal qualification many employers and industries look for. They start their careers abroad and usually find good employment in Germany after a period of professional development and orientation. \r\n\r\nThe project therefore\u2026:\r\n\u2022 enhances immediate employment opportunities for graduates of vocational education programmes in Germany \r\n\u2022 creates flexible l", "http://www.twinuk.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-004032_2"], ["9GB", "Nell-Breuning Schule Rottweil: Chancen nutzen - Kompetenzen erwerben", "Twin Training International Ltd", 108730.0, "With the project \u201cNell-Breuning School Rottweil: Good prospects - acquire skills\u201d, the school offers full-time students, trainees and teachers the possibility to stay for four weeks in Great Britain.

Participants complete industrial internships in small and medium-sized enterprises in the destination country, gaining an insight into the following areas: Marketing, PR and publicity, administration, accounting, logistics and warehouse organization. In all internships, participants are given the opportunity to interact with customers allowing for targeted use and improvement of their language skills. Participants also have the chance to take part in cultural activities outside of the internship. The project will be supervised and coordinated by both the sending organization in Germany and the receiving organization in the destination country. Additionally a vocational school teacher assists in selecting the participants, preparing them, providing support during their stay abroad and for post-processing the experience. An understanding and a willingness to support such learning experiences abroad during traineeships should be encouraged and promoted on a national level.\r\n\r\nProject A1.2. - A2.1.:\r\nThe Project \u201eEuropean Internship for Trainees in Bournemouth\u201c is directed at students completing a full-time school-based traineeship to become commercial assistants. The aim of the project is to strengthen the key competences. The project also focuses on giving trainees the opportunity to gain an insight into international working structures and to acquire practical work experience. As a result of globalization, such skills have become essential for future employees to be able to compete on the European market. Twenty participants will take part in the four-week or six-week program in Bournemouth, UK. Alongside pedagogical and cultural preparation in Germany, participants complete a week-long language and intercultural training course in Bournemouth, followed by the work experience. Internships take place in small and medium-sized enterprises in England, giving participants the chance to gain experience in the following fields: Marketing, PR and publicity, administration, accounting, logistics and warehouse organization. In all internships, participants can interact with customers allowing for targeted use and improvement of their language skills.

The content and length of the Mobility Placements has been designed to meet the career development aims of our Level 3 learners in these sectors, the majority of whom will have completed a Level 2 qualification and have some experience in entry level roles but are looking to move into more senior and better paid roles within their chosen field.\r\n\r\nThe EMCD project will also deliver the following complementary objectives that support the overall aim of enhancing the employability of our Level 3 learners within the target sectors:\r\n\r\nSUPPORTING CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC DEVELOPMENT: In addition to developing their vocational and workplace skills, Mobility Placements will offer a transformational life experience for our learners, many of whom will have had limited opportunities to travel abroad and certainly will not have lived and worked in another country.\r\n\r\nENHANCING OUR VOCATIONAL PROVISION: Integration of Mobility Placements within our vocational courses will enhance our provision for the target sectors. In particular, working with employers in Spain and Ireland will help to introduce European dimensions within the curricula of the courses linked to Mobility Placements and will broaden the perspectives of both tutors and learners.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPING OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH EMPLOYERS: Twin already has excellent links with local and regional employers and the work undertaken in developing this application has already enabled us to establish partnerships with employers within the target sectors in Spain and Ireland.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\nProject participants will be VET learners currently undertaking or having recently completed Level 3 vocational qualifications related to the hospitality and language teaching sectors and the specific courses where we propose to offer mobility opportunities to learners are:\r\n\r\n-  ILM Level 3 Certificate in Principles of Leadership and Management\r\n-  City & Guilds Level 3 Award in Principles of Website Creation and Optimisation\r\n-  LRN Level 3 Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\nThe core activities that the EMCD project will deliver will be 90 mobility work placements within the hospitality and language teaching sectors in Spain and Ireland.  We intend to deliver the 90 mobilities in the 3 groups of 30, with each group being broken down as follows: 14 Leadership and Management (8 to Spain, 6 to Ireland), 8 Digital Media to Spain and 8 TEFL to Spain.\r\n\r\nThe project will work with 27 Host Employers, which will facilitate effective matching of mobility work placement opportunities with the learning aims and career development aspirations of our participants. In addition to providing work experience for the participants, Host Employers will contribute to other key functions, including recruitment and selection, preparation and post placement support.  \r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nThe methodologies adopted by the EMCD project will focus on working in partnership with Host Employers in the destination countries that have the experience, expertise, organisational capacity and range of business activities that will support our learners in developing experience-acquired skills for their vocational area by working alongside established professionals in their chosen field.  Working in different sectors and with such a broad range of Host Employers will mean that no two mobilities will be exactly the same but they have been designed to both enable participants to put the skills learned during their VET courses into practice and take on additional responsibility and adapt to more senior roles within the workplace.\r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT\r\nThe project will deliver major impacts for the participants in terms of job outcomes and career development.

The training activities planned aim to consolidate partnerships with the territory for a detailed analysis of needs and to bridge the gap between training and business needs.

The active collaboration with the Polish branch of Leonardo Company Finmeccanica Group has created awareness and interest in the Polish language. The participants in placements  in Poland will attend a literacy course to Polish in order to use the national language as the language  during the internship.\r\n\r\nThe 10 internship experiences  lasting one week will enable teachers/staff  to:\r\n- Analyze the soft skills required by the companies appearing on the target markets of local companies\r\n- Receive incentive for educational innovation and test new forms of cooperation in the education sector;\r\n- Plan work placements in an  international context;\r\n- Promoting the comparison in the field of certification of skills in formal and non-formal learning\r\n- Improve language skills;\r\n- Promote the transfer of new organizational methods based on collaboration and teamwork;\r\n- Promote the acquisition of  skills and attitudes that favor the management of change in the workplace.\r\n\r\n3) accompanying Teachers\r\nAs provided by the guidelines of Erasmus + each stream of trainee students will be accompanied by a sending school official for a short period of time, 5 days + two journeyl, to optimize the cost / benefits, but enough to :\r\n- To verify the insertion of the trainee in the new reality\r\n- Check the quality of  accommodation\r\n- Make arrangements with the host institution's tutor and the company\u2019s  tutor\r\n- Ensure the integration in the company and subscription stages of Learning and Training agreements.", "http://www.twinuk.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005851_1"], ["9GB", "From education to the labour market 3", "Twin Training International Ltd", 182988.0, "It is the declared goal for Mercantec to give as many students as possible an international experience in the course of their edcation.

Among these new partner there is an Irish school for our Higher technical Gymnasium who has a very interesting game design education. This new partner has been added with the intent to exchange teachers and in the future to develop the working relationship to include student mobilities as well.

The program enable us to give the most number of students an international scope on their education. Our experience is that our students come home with many positive experiences from their mobilities and they are willing to participate in new mobilities. Our experience is that more and more students are asking about the danish PIU (Pratice abroad) programme. \r\nWe have, to optimize our selection of partners and thereby educations, been to a contact seminar in Dublin with the danish NA, where we were able to amke some very good new contacts. these new contacts/partners have been added to this application. We expect that there will be an introduction fase and we are palnning to visit the new partners before sending students. Mercantec has a goal to develop Erasmus+ mobilities which are longer than 3 weeks, and a new partner in Portugal has this oppotunity. the partner has a cooperation with two companies, which would be able to host business students for 7 weeks. We know that we might have a challenge with finding the students but nevertheless  we know that the students would like these longer lasting placements.\r\nWe plan to visit our German partners in February/March. This visit is to improve our relationship and explore possible future areas of cooperation. The participants on this trip is the heads of educations from the individual departments as well as the head of the international department and the international coordinator.

Development and implementation of this project are a continuation of good and fruitful results from nine years of focus on international internships and school attendance for HTX students and are an important part of AATG's overriding Globalization strategy and strategy for interaction with companies and the world around us. The project is part of a broad internationalization effort at AATG. During the period 2017-2019 the focus is in particular on teacher mobility to support the college\u2019s profile as an international upper secondary school, which is part of academic networks both internationally and nationally.    \r\nActivities: \r\nStudent mobility. The target group of the project is students from four study lines in which technology, communications / IT, design or English are majors. In this way, we ensure that the internships will form a natural part of the students\u2019 HTX training in accordance with the legal requirement: BEK nr. 740 af 23/06/2010 \u00a729 which requires some teaching to be provided in a work place context.  These study programmes are GLOBALTECH, MEDIATECH, Experience Design and Emergency Services. The partners in the project will complete a Learning Agreement before the student\u2019s departure. The students participate in three- or four-week internships in London or Barcelona depending on the study line  during 2nd or 3rd Year. London and Barcelona have been chosen because of the opportunities to add to the profile of the study lines a new and innovative approach to the subject\u2019s traditions and teaching environments with communication, IT and Design as well as improving the students\u2019 English language skills. In Barcelona English will also be the work language for most internships. The objectives for the students are:\r\n\u2022 That they develop their professional, intercultural and personal skills in such a way that they can be part of a globalized labor- and educational market later in their education.\r\n\u2022 That students become familiar with and gain an understanding of the requirements for the individual working in a globalized labor market.\r\n\u2022 That students upon their return can provide new and innovative approaches to subjects taught at AATG.\r\nGenerally, we assess the skills of HTX students as being adequate for a course of this character and length, the students are between 17 and 19 years old.

There is considerable danger for them that this lack of opportunity and hence experience and key skills will result in a life defining disadvantage and / or exclusion regarding future job chances.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, a stay abroad holds especially for young people with precarious socio-economic background the first opportunity to try and develop an indipendent lifestyle out of the framework of their family and social structures. Following the feedback of those who benefit from work related international exchange programmes, those youg people experience considerable personal growth, feel more empowered and more purposeful in regard of their vocational perspective than they felt before their departure. At the same time they felt more intercultural tolerant and more affirmative towards the European Project. In respect thereof the \"Leinen los!\" project is making an important contribution to the fight against ethnic, social and gender related discrimmination and towards the promotion of a european citizenship.\r\n\r\nIn the context of the project 30 students of vocational schools  (age 18 - 29) who are in training for a cereer in skilled craft and trade or servcie jobs (i.e. baker, salesmen, confectioner, stylists, hairdresser, childcare worker) will be offered the opportunity for a month-long internship and work experience in Spain, Great Britain, Austria or Ireland. This is meant to give those young people the chance to acquire work related international and intercultural skills to facilitate an easier transfer into the domestic and european labor market. This constitutes one important goal of the project: To present affordable oppotunities for qualification and continuing education and professional development to our participants and to boost their chances for the german and european labor market considerably in the process.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of participants, the the intercultural training and the organizational preparation will be the reponsibility of ARBEIT UND LEBEN Saxony-Anhalt. The care and support of our delegated participants lies within the responsibility of our partners on-site. During the deployment-phase will ARBEIT UND LEBEN still function as a contact for our participants and will monitor and ensure the successful implementation of the project.\r\n\r\nARBEIT UND LEBEN as deployin organisation is responsible for the information, selection, preparation, post-processing and mentoring of all participants. Recieving organizations are: Twin UK  and Light on the Path (United Kingdom, Partnership International (Ireland) , ESMOVIA (Spain) and Paragon (Malta). These partners have have great experience and expertise in regards to the work with foreign internship participants.\r\n\r\nThe long-term benefits of the impulses and developments described above will be evident on a individual and societal level as well. For the participants the benefits of the program will manifest themselves in  increased social and professional skill with an positiv and progressiv impact on their proffessional opportunities, their mobility and their life planning. In addition to the participants increased intercultural skills and their expectable affirmative stance towards the european principle of freedom of movement and european values this will accumulate to an iportant societal benefit as well.", "http://www.twinuk.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004613_1"], ["9GB", "Mit Auslandserfahrung punkten - man lernt mehr als man denkt", "Twin Training International Ltd", 49818.0, "The project \u201aGet ahead with un internship abroad\u2014you learn more than you think\u2019 builds on the previous projects carried out by the N\u00fcrnberger Fremdprachenschule, a college which trains students to qualify as state certified multilingual office assistants. The objective of all our projects is to enable our students to gain practical experience working in companies in Europe, as the training offered by our college is purely academic and has no practical component.\r\nThe specific aim of this project is to make it possible for our students to gain an insight into how international companies operate and thus improve their chances on the European/international job market. By improving their work-relevant language skills, especially their oral proficiency, and their intercultural competence, participants in the scheme can devolop both at a personal and a professional level, sharpen their individual profile and embark on their working life with a high degree of competence and self-confidence. In addition, the objective of the project is to raise their awareness of European issues.\r\nTwenty-two students and one teacher will take part in the project. The students are all young adults aged 18 and above. For most, the training course at our college is the first training they do after leaving school.\r\nCompleting an internship in an international company, be it in tourism, administration, trade and industry or imports/exports, enables the participants to put what they have learnt at our college into practice and helps them to see how versatile the profession which they have trained for is. They can work in trade and industry, gain experience in dealing with customers, learn to work in a team, translate documents and much more. The school works closely together with agencies in each country. Learning targets are set out and the students are supervised by mentors: they have to complete a learning diary and have regular meetings with the mentors.\r\nThis project aims to sharpen the students\u2019 understanding that taking part in a European internship not only improves their language proficiency but also enhances other skills. The students are expected to document what they have learnt and become aware that in addition to business skills, the internship gives them an insight into other aspects of life abroad which they may not be aware of at first sight. They are encouraged to reflect on aspects such as cultural differences, traditions, eating culture, body \r\nAt the end of the project, the participants will have a clearer view of their professional future and as a result find it easier to find employment. In addition, they should become more willing to travel and develop more tolerance and openness towards other cultures.\r\nThe participants are expected to pass on their experiences to other young people in our school, at education fairs and other information events and thus act as multiplicators, motivating them to take part in similar mobility projects. A further, long-term effect that is not to be underestimated is the improvement of teaching, as the experiences the participants have had are evaluated by the teachers and are integrated into their lessons. In this way, the quality of our training is always under scrutiny and is continually being optimised. The mobility of teachers who visit companies and the agencies we work with to observe the working practices there also contributes towards improving the teaching quality at our school.

It is therefore more and more important for our trainees and prospective junior executives and managers to enhance their foreign language skills and intercultural competence on top of the traditionally taught occupational competencies.\r\nThe aims of the project for the students comprise the following aspects: Deepening and expanding practical and theoretical skills gained in the apprenticeships and at vocational school / professional school by applying them in a company abroad, acquiring knowledge about the foreign economy and in particular about the sector of the internship company, getting to know the respective culture and way of life, gaining an insight into regional economic developments and their history in the respective areas in the UK, Spain, Ireland, Iceland or France and last but not least the development of their oral and written communication skills in a foreign language.\r\nAfter returning to Germany the participants will recognize similarities and differences in the work routines in German and foreign companies.

The Humpis-Schule has a large Vocational School Department which has offered various trainees the possibility of an internship in other European countries for years. Since 2006, about three weeks of internships abroad have been held annually for a group of students, funded by the European Union. In addition, a number of other internships were organized to various European countries. For the organization of the project a team was formed, so that all necessary activities can be done safely and qualified.\r\n\r\nThe current project consists of several parts:\r\nThe largest part involves sending a group of 70 people to an internship in Ireland and England. 30 people will go through the project partner Internships Ireland in Dublin, 20 each through Twin Training International in London and through Chichester College in Chichester. Key elements here are accommodation in English-speaking host families, an internship in companies and accompanying language training in English. There will be a cultural programme organized by the participants at two weekends. Further projects of the participants are about documentation, evaluation or public relations.\r\n\r\nTwelve students will take part in an internship in Spain for two weeks. The accommodation should also take place in host families and the working hours should take place in Spanish companies.\r\n\r\nThe beneficiaries are apprentices from medium-sized companies in the region of Lake Constance-Upper Swabia. The international orientation of many companies and the increasing demands on employees characterize this environment.\r\n\r\nThe aim is for the participants to make significant progress in speaking English or Spanish, as well as to improve other personal skills and their international competences. Experience has shown that participants are sustainably strengthened in their personal development through more self-confidence and better competences in problem solving, tolerance and creativity. It also promotes professional mobility across Europe and, among other things, provides participants with practically usable career support through the use of the Europass Mobility. Both the participants and companies should gain an advantage through the improved competences.\r\n\r\nThe planning, participant preparation, implementation, evaluation, documentation and monitoring of the project are carried out by the Team International of the Humpis-Schule Ravensburg in cooperation with experienced partner institutions. Therefore a comprehensive concept has been set up from the participant preparation to the evaluation of the results, which is subject to a continuous adjustment and improvement process.\r\n\r\nIn addition 22 teachers of the Humpis-Schule will have a short stay in Ireland, including company visits and exchange opportunities. They are expected to bring more international aspects to their teaching, as multipliers also to make these findings available to other teachers, to assist in the formulation of learning outcomes (ECVET) and to improve their own language skills.\r\nAnother 18 teachers will complete a similar programme in Spain.\r\n\r\nIn another short stay a further eight teachers cooperate in the field of IT with a school in Denmark, which has already gained considerable experience in this topic.\r\n\r\nThrough the information strategy of the Humpis-Schule, the interested public as well as partners of the school like companies, the Chamber of Commerce, parents of the participants etc. will be informed about the activities. This should increase awareness, acceptance and image of different institutions. Among other things, the Humpis-Schule is to be perceived as a competent and future-oriented partner in training issues. In addition to the directly involved institutions, Erasmus+ as well as the European Union and the National Agency are also positively represented. In the long term, through the improvement of important competences of individuals, the activities should give positive impulses to companies and to the entire region, supporting European values such as freedom, tolerance, solidarity and peace.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the dual system of vocational training should be strengthened, because internships abroad strengthen the attractiveness of the training, which is thus more of an alternative to studying.", "http://www.twinuk.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004699_1"], ["9GB", "Explore Europe 2018-2019", "Twin Training International Ltd", 116607.0, "The project \"Explore Europe 2018- 2019\" enables young people during or immediately after the end of their training to do an internship.

(Unfortunately, on-ly two students grabbed this chance.?) Due to the project-evaluation of the last year we decided not to extend to Spain/France but to improve our current English partner-network. We organized a new group-offer for financially disadvantaged families and we tried to find a new partner in Malta (at the stu-dents\u2019 request). Furthermore we would like to offer an traineeship for a disabled student. The project contains the following central steps:\r\n\r\nConsequently, there are now 32 participants. In order to reach this goal, the following activities have been conducted:\r\n\r\n1. Interviews with students and partners in order to evaluate the previous project\r\n2. Revision of the organisation and implementation of the intern-ship-project\r\n3. Extension of the group offer and first-time internship-placement for disabeld students\r\n4. Systematic information and preparation of the students and parents\r\n5. Integration of the project into the course design and pedagogic concept of the school in order to increase its significance\r\n6. Improvement of the partner-contact through personal meetings and on-site support. \r\n7. Improvement of the involvement of English teachers\r\n8.

To contact with other cultures, promoting European citizenship based on the use of technical and multi-language skills;\r\n6. Make mobility a motivating element in relation to school and learning.\r\n\r\nThus, this project proposal tries to answer the needs felt by these youngsters to broaden their horizons, to get to know other ways of life, to try new work procedures and methodologies, to improve on their vocational aptitude projects, to develop the domain of other languages, to contact with other cultures, to comply with our entrepreneurial educational approach and to provide evidence that the European Community can offer important labour market possibilities.\r\n\r\nMobility will take place in Seville (ES), London (UK) and in Turin (IT) in two periods of six weeks each: between May and June 2019 and between April and May 2020.

The content and length of the Mobility Placements has been designed to meet the career development aims of our Level 3 learners in these sectors, the majority of whom will have completed a Level 2 qualification and have some experience in entry level roles but are looking to move into more senior and better paid roles within their chosen field.\r\n\r\nThe ERASMUS+ project will also deliver the following complementary objectives that support the overall aim of enhancing the employability of our Level 3 learners within the target sectors:\r\n\r\nSUPPORTING CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC DEVELOPMENT: In addition to developing their vocational and workplace skills, Mobility Placements offer a transformational life experience for our learners, many of whom will have had limited opportunities to travel abroad and may not have had the experience of living and working in another country. Learners placed in Spain and Portugal will benefit from supported language development in these placements.\r\n\r\nENHANCING OUR VOCATIONAL PROVISION: Integration of Mobility Placements within our vocational courses will enhance our provision for the target sectors. In particular, working with employers in Spain, Portugal and Ireland will help to introduce European dimensions within the curricula of the courses linked to Mobility Placements and will broaden the perspectives of both tutors and learners.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPING OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH EMPLOYERS: Twin already has excellent links with local and regional employers and the work undertaken in developing this application has already enabled us to establish partnerships with employers within the hospitality industry in Spain, Portugal and Ireland.\r\n\r\nLEARNERS\r\nProject learners will be VET learners currently undertaking, or having recently completed, Level 3 vocational qualifications related to the hospitality sector and the specific courses where we propose to offer mobility opportunities to learners are:\r\n\r\n- ILM Level 3 Certificate in Principles of Leadership and Management\r\n- City & Guilds Level 3 Award in Principles of Website Creation and Optimisation\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\nThe core activities that the ERASMUS+ project will deliver will be 105 mobility work placements within the hospitality sector in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. The 105 placements will be split with 48 travelling to Spain, 12 to Portugal and 45 to Ireland. \r\n\r\nThe project will work with 36 Host Employers, which will facilitate effective matching of mobility work placement opportunities with the learning aims and career development aspirations of our learners. In addition to providing work experience for the learners, Host Employers will contribute to other key functions, including recruitment and selection, preparation and post placement support. \r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nThe methodologies adopted by the ERASMUS+ project will focus on working in partnership with Host Employers in the destination countries that have the experience, expertise, organisational capacity and range of business activities that will support our learners in developing experience-acquired skills for their vocational area by working alongside established professionals in their chosen field. Working with such a broad range of Host Employers will mean that no two placements will be exactly the same but they have been designed to both enable learners to put the skills learned during their VET courses into practice and to take on additional responsibility and adapt to more senior roles within the workplace.\r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT\r\nThe project will deliver major impacts for the learners in terms of job outcomes and career development. We expect that 73% will enter employment within 3 months of completing their mobility and, of those, 81% will sustain employment for at least 6 months. We also expect the project to benefit the labour market mobility of learners and expect at least 11% to take up jobs in other EU countries. \r\n\r\nThe project will build the capacity of partners to participate in transnational activities in general and the Erasmus+ programme in particular.

This visit is to improve our relationship and explore possible future areas of cooperation. The participants on this trip is the heads of educations from the individual departments as well as the head of the international department and the international coordinator. Another goal for the trip is to explore the possiblity of finding PIU placemnts for Danish students in Germany. The focus is on VET and EUX students.

They are an opportunity both for the public sector and for the markets, so that the products and services better satisfy individual but also collective aspirations. But this inventiveness needs to be directed and guided towards market-relevant initiatives, to become social businesses, i.e. enterprises with a positive social impact.\r\nWho ca offer this guidance and facilitation service? \r\nThe European ESII, a professional in virtual incubation, that provides expert consulting and tailored workshops to help social entrepreneurs and innovators build the skills, strategies and networks they need to succeed. \r\nIn different contexts in Europe, there are some consultants dealing with social innovation incubation, although a common training path is missing and the profession of ESII is not recognized. This hinders the transparency of competences and creates barriers in the mobility of individuals within the European labour market. In addition, the lack of a recognised profession in this field, means a shortage of competent and qualified experts able to unleash the potential of emerging ideas and initiatives, allowing the creation of social changes and social businesses.\r\nOrganisations working as consultants, training providers, incubators for traditional business, should get prepared to also support social entrepreneurship and scale up social innovation initiatives, in light of the primary role that social business plays in the economy and in society.\r\nHence, in order to favour mutual recognition and transparency of competences, the project will develop:\r\n1. The ECVET competence profile of the European ESII\r\n2. The curriculum of a training course for ESII\r\n3. A procedure for the recognition of competences \r\n4. Guidelines for the accreditation of organizations carrying out training addressed to ESII\r\n5. A comprehensive training course to become ESII, accessible online as Open Educational Resource\r\n\r\nThe direct target group includes all existing incubators, chambers of commerce, consultants and business support service providers, as well as students in business and economics, that will benefit from a free training course to help them acquire skills and competences recognised at European level for the experts in social innovation incubation. \r\nIndirect target groups are all the stakeholders that may exploit the outcomes for training activities and internal staff professional development: VET providers, universities, local authorities, traditional businesses (that may be interested in creating links and synergies with social enterprises).\r\nThe direct target groups and organisations will be involved in various phases of project activities: the initial in depth-research to design and implement the ECVET profile, the training delivery and pilot test activities, the events and dissemination activities.\r\nIt is intended to directly involve at least 300 people and 20 organisations per country, for a total of 1500 beneficiaries.\r\nThanks to dissemination and exploitation activities, the consortium aims to reach about 5000 people in Europe, counting also on the European networks the partners belong to, such as the European Business Network, which has a direct interest in exploiting the results within its members (more than 150 business innovation centres). \r\n\r\nThe main tangible results will be:\r\n1. the implementation of the ECVET system to the field of social innovation incubation, a growing sector in Europe lacking a common framework for transparency of competences. \r\n2. An innovative learning environment to train ESIIs, through an interactive platform offering educational materials and simulation tools\r\nThe expected result is to favour the acquisition of new competences in terms of social innovation incubation and facilitation by the actors offering support to business and local development. \r\n\r\nLocally, this will result in the creation of additional new local enterprises.\r\nRegionally, the project will provide new opportunities for economic growth as the partners\u2019 networks of business support services acquire the new knowledge and skills delivered through the project to help social enterprises evolve and grow. \r\nOn a national, European and international level the project will influence policy and help to shape the future of social entrepreneurship.

It will do so by collecting expertise at the European and international level to create a foundation for teaching Augmented Reality in formal education, preparing professionals for the industries of tomorrow and contributing to making European economies more research-driven, knowledge-based, and competitive.\r\nAugmented Reality is a rapidly growing market amongst the information and communication technologies. It provides an enriched view onto the physical world, adding layers with contextually useful information, delivered visually or by stimulating other senses using wearable and hand-held devices. Manifold industrial use cases of Augmented Reality in, for example, manufacturing, construction, health, the service sector, or in trade & sales can be found. The technology is currently being introduced in front-runner organisations at large, leading to an increasing demand for qualified specialists.\r\nWhile the Augmented Reality research and development community is growing stronger in Europe, the teaching competence and exchange of good practices in this field are still very fragmented. Educational offers for this topic in Europe are falling behind, failing to produce the graduates (and numbers) required.\r\nIn order to achieve this goal, AR-FOR-EU sets its objectives as (1) to support capacity building of new and emerging digital skills for Augmented Reality, (2) produce two innovative courses on this topic, (3) create a strategic partnership to promote excellence in teaching, and (4) design technology-based and pedagogically sound digital Open Educational Resources and online courses for a Massive Online Open Course platform aimed at opening up and fostering uptake across Europe.\r\nAR-FOR-EU focuses on producing IOs, and therefore applies a common development methodology to the majority of activities, consisting of a pre-study, first iteration of development, pilots, and the second iteration of development. This process is supported by management, quality control, dissemination and communication activities throughout the project.\r\nThe survey of teaching practices and industry needs will inform policymakers and guide partnerships' selection of learning methods, learning objectives, assessment criteria, and required knowledge, skills, and competences, filling the gap between formal education and the workplace.

However, in order for aquaponics to develop its potential in Europe, it needs an appropriately trained workforce. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES: AQU@TEACH will develop and implement a unique multidisciplinary blended learning curriculum for HE education.  The curriculum will enable students to acquire expert knowledge and skills, as well as entrepreneurial and transversal skills highly valued by employers, thereby providing them with a competitive advantage on the labour market. The curriculum will be implemented using innovative didactic techniques, which will improve the teaching skills of the HE teachers.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS: The AQU@TEACH consortium comprises five partners from four countries (SI, CH, ES, UK). High international quality and a proven track record of successful cooperation between the partners will ensure the quality and sustainability of the project results. \r\n\r\nACTIVITIES: In line with the trend of integrating economics into study programmes, the students will attend a summer school combining aquaponics expertise with entrepreneurial skills.

This requires the implementation of instructional scaffolding and innovative didactic methods embedded into blended learning with interactive didactic tools. AQU@TEACH will provide comprehensive didactic guidelines and recommendations for the teaching process. The quality of the curriculum and its implementation will be validated through internal and external evaluation.
