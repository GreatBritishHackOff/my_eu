Presently, the majority of silicon ingots are sliced in thin wafers by LAS (loose abrasive sawing) using slurry of abrasive silicon carbide particles. The silicon carbide is not separable from the silicon dust in an economical way. The newer FAS (fixed abrasive sawing) uses diamond particles fixed to the cutting wire.

Alongside with this challenge, the number of researchers active in powder technology is limited and only a few universities, public and private institutes are educating specialists in this field. PowTech ITN aims to integrate inter-sectoral and multidisciplinary research in particle and powder technology into the training of 15 highly skilled young researchers, to strengthen the competitiveness of food and pharmaceutical industry and to strengthen the European Research Area.   The PowTech ITN has 20 partners (9 industry) and comprises a focused research programme and a graduate school.\n\nThe Focused Research programme will use an engineering design approach applied to powder processing. The understanding and modelling of powder structure from a molecular to a macro disperse scale will be used to understand how powder properties/functionality are formed or modified during processing. This knowledge will be used to select the appropriate process for production of the structure of interest. The long-term aim is to develop innovative products and to provide tools allowing minimal pilot plant trials.\n\nThe PowTech Graduate School is aligned with the research objectives of the project covering relevant S&T and personal skills courses but also an intensive and continuous training in collaboration with industry. In addition to the industrial secondments, the ESRs will have industrial training in different industries. An industrial mentor will be appointed to guide their Career development plan. The ESR will also be trained in Research Methodology through preparing a research plan for their work, and later in their project by developing a research plan, supervising a MSc student, and writing a Grant application.'", 217214.0, 3250444.0, "POWTECH", null, null, null, null, "http://www.gre.ac.uk", null, "fp7_96993_999867756"], ["9LS", "Human behaviour in crisis situations: A cross cultural investigation to tailor security-related communication", "University of Greenwich", "The aim of the proposed project is to investigate cross-cultural and ethnic differences of human behaviour in crisis situations in order to better tailor security related communication, instructions and procedures with a view to improving evacuation and protection.

Frequently speed and efficacy do not stem from the ignorance of procedures, but from the difficulty to operate in contexts where consistent damages are occurring, for the difficulty of managing emotional aspects. Training plays an important function to the preparation of the crisis manager. Currently two main modalities for training purpose are two: table top exercise and real world simulation exercise.

We recognize three challenges that need urgent attention. First, member states need to develop shared response planning. Second, countries need to share information in real time. This sense-making challenge requires a way to have multiple countries and agencies create a shared picture of an emerging crisis based on multiple sources (different countries, many agencies). Third, countries need to coordinate the use of critical resources to ensure a timely response and to avoid waste and misspending. These challenges are hard to meet in any type of crisis or disaster, but especially in a transboundary context that lacks a dominant actor.
