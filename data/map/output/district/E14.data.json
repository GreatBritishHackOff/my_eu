While the ADVANCE Forum concept engages all stakeholder groups in a parliament-like structure, specific representative committees drive the innovative progress. Specific attention will be given to workflows depending on the level of urgency and on who is requesting utilization of the framework: regulatory authorities, vaccine manufacturers, public health organizations.\n\nADVANCE partners leverage their recent pioneering achievements in establishing operative technological platforms, developing pharmaco-epidemiological methods for burden of disease, coverage, effectiveness and risk. ADVANCE partners also build on a track record of delivering results of ground breaking international collaborative studies of unprecedented population size. ADVANCE capitalizes on these achievements and tailors structures and processes to the needs of collaborative public-private vaccine benefit-risk assessment. ADVANCE partners will provide access to data on more than 40 million subjects for testing of methods and immediate studies.  \n\nThe existing technical platform boosted by the strong connection to the IMI EMIF project and many other synergistic initiatives will allow ADVANCE to focus on creating access modalities and accelerating exploitation of both underutilized and established rich data sources, to test innovative methods for integrated and vaccine specific benefit risk assessment, and to undertake real life studies from the outset of the project. \n\nConsortium: The ADVANCE Consortium is designed to engage all stakeholders in Europe, while ensuring project feasibility by careful selection of a small group of 15 partners driving progress..

Influenza infections affect all age groups but children and adults over the age of 65 are at most risk of developing severe disease.\nVaccination is the most effective approach to reduce the impact of annual influenza outbreaks and potential pandemics, however, the currently criteria of correlates of protection(CoP) show limitations in predicting protection for seasonal and pandemic vaccines. \nThe Haemagglutinin Inhibition(HAI) antibody titre is the most widely used CoP for seasonal influenza vaccine even if there is a lack of standardisation for conducting HAI and other serological assays and therefore  results obtained from different laboratories are not comparable. This leads to the urgent need of  improving international standardisation of serological assays to reduce inter laboratory variability and to generate supportive immunological assays to be used in studies aimed at developing clinically relevant surrogate markers of protection of influenza vaccines.\nObjectives: The main long-term aim of the FLUCOP project is to improve and standardize the existing immunological assays and to develop new assays for the better evaluation of the CoP of influenza vaccines.\nMain specific FLUCOP objectives include:\n-\tachieve standardization of HAI and Virus Neutralization(VN) assays;\n-\tpromote the understanding and application of Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI) and Neuraminidase (NA) assays as tools for the evaluation of influenza vaccines; \n-\tdevelop selective new assays which might potentially used for future clinical trials for influenza seasonal vaccine evaluation\nFLUCOP Consortium and Project Impact: The FLUCOP consortium brings together 26 groups from 7 European countries, and includes contributors from the academic, governmental, non-for-profit and pharmaceutical sectors. As a whole, the consortium has a balanced array of expertise and each group has been carefully selected to avoid overlaps in research activities and to collectively address the planned objectives. FLUCOP is expected to have a significant impact to improve and standardize the existing immunological assays and develop new assays to better evaluate influenza vaccines. This will contribute to the future clinical trial evaluation and possible establishment of correlates of protection Through a public-private collaboration FLUCOP will reach a common agreement on assays and methods to be used by all groups both from the public and private sector for testing influenza vaccines in humans. These efforts are expected to aid evolution of the regulatory guidelines and the practice of the pharmaceutical industry following the application of the methods to efficacy studies.\nProject plan: To reach the proposed objectives, the FLUCOP project is composed of five focused interconnected work packages(WP).\nWP1:Standardization of HAI and VN assays.\nObjective: HAI and VN assays are commonly used to quantify influenza specific antibodies but they show to be highly variable between laboratories. Moreover different protocols are in use in different laboratories, which may contribute to the variability of the assays. This WP aims to improve the standardization and harmonization of these assays and also preparation and qualification of critical reagents.\nMethodology: Adult and paediatric pre and post influenza vaccination serum samples will be available to consortium partners who are recognized as leading experts in serological analysis of influenza vaccine responses.

Together with EFPIA partners our aims will be to set policy & guidance and deliver robust information technology tools to address the potential for the reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through mobile applications and the recognition of drug safety signals from user comments in social media and the internet. The policies, guidance and tools delivered through WEB-RADR will be underpinned by extensive academic research and user testing to ensure the project meets the needs of all stakeholders, including patients.\n\nBackground\nReporting by healthcare professionals and patients by means of mobile devices and social media platforms to National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and marketing authorisation holders with subsequent transmission to EudraVigilance is a new, unexplored concept. The amount of information generated through social media requires a structured, scientific approach for monitoring, reporting, analysing and evaluation of ADRs. Whilst there are numerous benefits of the use of social media, the impact on healthcare professionals and patients and their behaviour towards the use of medicines needs to be further analysed. WEB-RADR will address these areas.\n\nLeadership\nWEB-RADR will be managed by the MHRA\u2019s project management team that are also leading the EC Joint Action (Strengthening Collaborations for Operating Pharmacovigilance in Europe, SCOPE). This will enable the alignment and consistency of the two projects. The MHRA has extensive experience in managing successful pharmacovigilance and IT projects (E2B compliant web-forms for ADR reporting; integration with EudraVigilance; drug and medical dictionary mapping; integration with NHS electronic health records) as well as being a leading regulatory agency, helping to shape the current legislative framework.\nEstablishing clear policies and guidance for stakeholders in the use of these technologies, in line with legislative requirements, is of paramount importance to regulators and industry. The EMA will provide leadership in this area, supported by colleagues from MHRA, HALMED & LAREB. As the central regulatory agency for medicines policy in the EU it is natural for the EMA lead in this area as the outputs of WEB-RADR will have a direct bearing on future operations affecting EudraVigilance, Good Vigilance Practice (GVP) guidance, signal detection and risk communication. Expertise from a national perspective together with EFPIA input will also be essential.\n\nTechnical Platform\nThe development of technical platforms for both the reporting of ADRs via a mobile application and recognising drug safety issues from social media will be led by Epidemico who already offer a number of products through an ongoing partnership with the FDA. Working with SRDC and EFPIA sponsors, WEB-RADR will produce an online dashboard and data feed of data identifying ADRs from social media in multiple languages. A mobile app for direct reporting of ADRs to national authorities in E2B(R2) Individual Case Safety Report compatible format will be developed. To achieve this we propose to expand the prototype MedWatcher Social platform to include social media monitoring in the EU and the MedWatcher App for reporting ADRs.\n\nAnalysis\nLed by UMC and working with SRDC, WEB-RADR will ensure the technical platform for gathering drug safety data from social media delivers meaningful and useable data in the EU pharmacovigilance setting. It is essential that data collected use standardised drug, product and medical terms. Mapping of the terms to ensure compatibility with EudraVigilance and NCA databases will be carried out so that terms in the Article 57 database and MedDRA are the basis for analysis. It is essential to detect and manage duplicate reports. A major effort in WEB-RADR will be the advancement of new methodologies to meet this challenge.

However, assessing the expected future value of the medicines when used in \u201creal world\u201d clinical practice requires additional information next to traditional (pre-authorisation) clinical trials.  Regulatory, HTA agencies and other healthcare decision makers have to make decisions on authorisation and access under conditions of uncertainty.  Currently, data packages which aim to minimise uncertainty on safety and efficacy may leave significant uncertainty in assessments of real world effectiveness of new medicines.  This results in further research commitments required post-authorisation (PASS, PAES, Reimbursement with Evidence Generation), and wide variability in access to medicines between countries. \nThe subsequent uncertainty relating to the reimbursement, and thus market implementation of new medication once approved by regulatory authorities, is negatively affecting the value of the drug development pipeline. The costly clinical developments to get to market approval, no longer seem to be a guarantee for market entry. This new risk presents a serious additional hurdle for drug developers that already face pipeline attrition. It also affects the speed and level of patient access, and therefore the extent to which patients and society might benefit from new medicines. \nIn recent years there has been considerable attention paid to the post-authorisation evaluation of treatments in real world clinical practice: study design and analytical methodology for assessing relative effectiveness; and use of registries and electronic healthcare data.  It may be possible to improve the value of information available at initial market authorisation by incorporating these techniques into pre-authorisation drug development.  HTA bodies, regulators, will become able to make better-informed decisions, and developers of new medicines will be able to direct development efforts to areas where value is most likely to be delivered to patients and health care systems, improving the efficiency of the whole medicine development chain. \nHowever, the adoption of real world / relative effectiveness objectives in a pre-authorisation development strategy has many operational, methodological, regulatory, and ethical issues and Pharmaceutical R&D organisations need more certainty as to: the impact of development choices on the regulatory review process; the value of different programmes to HTA bodies and other decision makers; the best balance of pre-launch and post-launch effectiveness research and the coordination of various post-authorisation commitments.

It is known that successful laser based refractive eye surgery can reduce or even cure common vision refractive errors, as well as, degenerative disorders like keratoconus, which is due to a corneal disorder. But while refractive surgery is becoming more affordable and safer, results are not as successful as they should be. As a consequence, this technique might not be recommendable for everybody, thus a detailed patient evaluation of his or her cornea should be made before deciding whether a refractive laser based surgery is adequate or not.\n\nBased on this fact, the main objective of the POPCORN project is to develop a non-invasive and accurate corneal prediction system. This system will be based on a new imaging technology that will generate a personalised and in-vivo biomechanical model of the patient's cornea. This model will be used to predict the biomechanical behaviour and status of the cornea after surgery. This will allow detecting and avoiding possible risks and negative side effects that could lead to the need of further additional treatments or even, long-term consequences in the visual health of the patients.\n\nThis technology development will be possible thanks to the introduction of plenoptic imaging techniques that will allow generating the specific in-vivo patient model without any invasive technique.

QUEST partners pioneered methodologies for using much more of the information in seismograms recording seismic vibrations of quakes.\n\nData from seismograms for many earthquakes were fed into a computer model that simulates each wave as it rumbles away from the earthquake's epicentre. The resulting 'synthetic' seismograms were compared to real seismograms and identified differences were then fed back into the model to improve it.\n\nTo map the Earth's internal structure in sufficient detail required highly complex calculations that can only be carried out by powerful supercomputers.

Of great benefit also is the experience gained in the context of CEDRE.S first presented for Leonardo 2013. This allowed us to develop programmes specifically for a post-student public, coming out higher education, not a priority group in our previous programmes. It has also inspired the title given to this 2014 project, which seems to fit our target group.\r\n\r\nWhilst CEDRE.S is clearly structured in terms of phases and apprenticeship units, its overriding purpose is to encompass and improve the professional capacities of  participants of level V to I, who have left either secondary education, higher education or full-time training of any sort within the past year. It would offer them an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d programme of qualification, embracing different job skills, technical linguistic capacities and intercultural exposure, all designed to meet the individual\u2019s specific needs at the time.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal advantages of the teaching programme resides in the cross-fertilisation between these 3 aspects which make up the whole experience. To help the students attain this goal, we have devised two mobility \u201croad-maps\u201d: the first lasting 6 weeks, particularly geared to young people in integration from level V to II, the second of 12 weeks targeted at participants of a higher level, either older or with longer professional experience. Whilst the periods of mobility can vary, the teaching plan contains the same stages and objectives:\r\n\r\n1. Pre-departure: collective socioprofessional guidance sessions accompanied by individual assessments. Intercultural and language preparation.\r\n\r\n2. Abroad (outside France): practical internship in a company meeting the profile or personal project of each participant, with constant monitoring to measure linguistic and professional progress, certified by Europass and level tests.\r\n\r\n3. On return to France: session to assess what has been learnt from this experience, followed by accompaniment during 3 to 6 months to allow the participants to:\r\n\r\n- Develop their capacity to summarise and explain in their own words the key skills acquired in relation to the specific professional context they have chosen.\r\n\r\n- Learn to identify what experience and training is most relevant to maintaining a competitive professional profile on the job market, this in a logic of \u201cLong Life Learning\u201d.\r\n\r\n- Acquire a continuous ability to judge their own progress, their technical, linguistic and intercultural skills, hence enabling them to position themselves to advantage vis-\u00e0-vis European or international recruiters.\r\n\r\n- Identify concrete employment opportunities: a major indicator of the impact of our project is integration in the job market within 6 months.\r\n\r\nWe have built a partnership network with 9 experienced intermediate organizations in 8 different countries to ensure optimum welcome and logistics for participants. Clear specifications are drawn up with appropriate norms against which performance is measured, supervised by the IERF and a Piloting committee. Choice of the partners reflects level of demand by country; English and Spanish-speaking destinations tend to dominate language-based requests, but other countries are selected as a function of specific sectors.\r\n\r\nTo encourage initiative, evaluate results and publish them, we have created a federation of 25 centres located throughout the Ile de France region, which in turn embraces 150 organisations, whose vocation it is to assist this public in obtaining employment. The Region itself is also an active partner in the project: its involvement since our foundation, \u201cguarantees\u201d the quality of our services and will help us to enlarge still further our partnership networks to other teaching organizations or local authorities. It will accompany us in the renewal of our request for certification of the project in May.

The institute hosts 854 students (633 in the Technical institute and 221 in the linguistic high school) coming from several municipalities of the Bari hinterland. Although the institute has been fighting for students to impose themselves within the labour market through training and cultural activities, high rates of school transfers and repetitions were registered in recent years and this calls for a deeper reflection and the implementation of specific activities in order to reduce early school drop-out levels. The school staff has been wondering on the actions that could be implemented to further motivate students and prevent their school drop-out; after a questionnaire, it was highlighted the necessity to integrate new didactic technologies and value them at their best through the use of proper methodological systems able to reduce early school leaving  (39%), to improve linguistic skills and competencies related to specific disciplines such as technical subjects, informatics, mechanics, graphics and telecommunications (27%) , as well as understand different foreign mentalities in all of their aspects so that they can be brought to students together with concrete knowledge and import the adequate tools to strengthen students\u2019 international placement.\r\nHence, it is necessary to train 24 participants through a 15 day mobility period abroad, during which they will carry out job shadowing activities and structured courses in different countries. In details, the project plan foresees the mobility of 7 professors teaching linguistic disciplines in Finland for job showing activities at the school \u201cEnglish Matters\u201d so that they can perfect their linguistic competencies and update themselves as regards new applications in international working scenarios ; other 7 teachers of different disciplines will be engaged in structured courses at the partner institute \u201cBohemia\u201d in Belgium in order to learn new didactic methods to counteract early school leaving. \r\nAfter their mobility, it is estimated that the participants will integrate within their daily teaching, the innovative methodologies they learnt abroad; the mobility of the institute\u2019s Headmaster in Finland will allow the comparison between the Italian school system with the Finnish one as well as the valorization of the project\u2019s purposes; mobility of 2 ATA members who will discover Finnish educational institutes and experiment a powerful school culture; the other 7 teachers of non-linguistic disciplines showing great interest towards Clil methodologies will attend structured courses provided by the partner \u201cCome2England\u201d so that they can improve students\u2019 learning outcomes by offering a more international perspective and transmitting a more participative and open attitude. \r\nAfter their mobility period, teachers will integrate an entire didactic unit in CLIL mode.
