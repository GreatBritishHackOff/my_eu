The consortium members will scale-up the production of rhBMP6 from an already developed working cell bank to enter clinical trials on bone regeneration.\n\nThe bone diseases we will treat locally with OSTEOGROW are acute radius fractures and healing of distraction gap in high tibial osteotomy (HTO). These conditions are widespread and highly debilitating diseases for which such therapy holds great promise.\n\nWorkflow: Preliminary pre-clinical data are already available, and clinical grade (GMP) rhBMP6 will be available before the beginning of the project to perform toxicology studies and to determine the final formulation of OSTEOGROW. Clinical trials will start within 18 months from the start of the project funding.\n\nBusiness strategy: SMEs Genera Research, Vitrology Limited and Meditox will test and validate the rhBMP6 production in their facilities. Consortium members from Medical University of Vienna, Sarajevo University Clinical Centre, Linkoping University Faculty of Health Sciences, Zagreb University Trauma Clinic, SMART Medico and Paul Regulatory Services will perform, monitor and coordinate clinical trials.

To avoid treatment failures and undesirable side-effects, new therapies are needed. Recently, a therapeutic product called OSTEOGROW demonstrated good healing potential in pre-clinical animal testing. \n\nThe EU-funded project 'Novel bone morphogenetic protein-6 biocompatible carrier device for bone regeneration' (http://osteogrow.eu/ (OSTEOGROW)) evaluated therapeutic potential in pre-clinical models and clinical settings. Clinical trials will include patients with acute radius fractures and those requiring surgical correction of various deformities of the lower leg to prevent osteoarthritis of the knee.\n\nThe OSTEOGROW therapeutic product has a carrier made from the patient's peripheral blood, called whole blood coagulum derivative (WBCD) to ensure biocompatibility. Recombinant human BMP-6 (rhBMP-6) is the bioactive molecule that binds to WBCD components and stimulates bone formation.\n\nThe OSTEOGROW team focused on improving rhBMP-6 production by using a genetically stable cell line suitable for commercial manufacturing. A new rhBMP-6 production and purification processes are efficient, robust, and inexpensive. The purified rhBMP-6 protein is bioactive, contaminant-free and stable in freeze-dried form. \n\nQuality and performance tests on rhBMP-6 revealed no biocompatibility or other issues. As a result, scientists finalised the formulation of OSTEOGROW with in\u00a0vivo testing showing highly promising results in mice, rats and rabbits.  \n\nClinical protocol design for Phase\u00a0I and II studies has also been completed. Currently, project partners are working on selecting the manufacturers for the now-patented kit components and are preparing the Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier and Investigator\u2019s Brochure. \n\nProject activities will ensure that the commercialisation of this therapeutic product is a step closer to reality for wide-ranging orthopaedic applications in humans and animals.

Approximately 70-80% of these patients present with multivessel disease defined as coronary lesions in more than one vessel. The clinician is faced with the decision to either 1) intervene only on the culprit lesion acutely responsible for the initiation of cardiogenic shock, or 2) treat additional lesions considered hemodynamically significant but not acutely triggering the CS cascade as well. Current guidelines recommend percutaneous coronary intervention of all critical lesions. However, due to a lack of randomized trials, these recommendations are solely based on registry data and pathophysiological considerations. Aim of the randomized CULPRIT-SHOCK trial is therefore to compare a) immediate multivessel PCI versus b) culprit lesion only PCI in patients with AMI complicated by CS. A total of 706 CS patients will be randomized in several European countries. The primary endpoint will be 30-day all-cause mortality and/or severe renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy.

Where other modes of transport benefit from the economy of series production, this is not the case for maritime products which are typically designed to refined customer requirements increasingly determined by the need for high efficiency, flexibility and low environmental impact at a competitive price. Product design is thus subject to global trade-offs among traditional constraints (customer needs, technical requirements, cost) and new requirements (life-cycle, environmental impact, rules).\nOne of the most important design objectives is to minimise total cost over the economic life cycle of the product, taking into account maintenance, refitting, renewal, manning, recycling, environmental footprint, etc. The trade-off among all these requirements must be assessed and evaluated in the first steps of the design process on the basis of customer / owner specifications. \nAdvanced product design needs to adapt to profound, sometimes contradicting requirements and assure a flexible and optimised performance over the entire life-cycle for varying operational conditions. This calls for greatly improved design tools including multi-objective optimisation and finally virtual testing of the overall design and its components.\nHOLISHIP (HOLIstic optimisation of SHIP design and operation for life-cycle) addresses these urgent industry needs by the development of innovative design methodologies, integrating design requirements (technical constraints, performance indicators, life-cycle cost, environmental impact) at an early design stage and for the entire life-cycle in an integrated design environment.

Implementation of the reform of the vocational system, a restructure of the organization and a cut back of 10% of staff. This could easily have had a negative influence on the international opportunities for our students. This is not the case. In 2015 a first version of the international strategy was developed and different implementation strategies tested. In 2016 the strategy was approved and the college is now in the implementation phase focusing on embedding internationalisation through 4 focal activity areas: Internationalisation at home, International mobilities, development activities and network and competence development. The international strategy is attached together with description of procedures to support embedment of administration of mobilities, receiving and sending students. \r\n\r\nThe majority of our students going abroad will replace part of a main course with an international module. The modules are being implemented in our yearly schedule, which means students can plan ahead and select modules according to their interested and the interest of their employer. Mobilities in this project will support students from ICT, painters, Industrial technicians, blacksmith, auto mechanics, civil construction, carpenters, electricians and gastronomy to attend international and fully accredited modules in Netherlands, England, Scotland, Finland, Spain and France. Many of the modules are offered through a college Network www.EM-EU.EU which is developed through a KA2 Strategic partnership (participating partners: JAO, Finland; Horizon College, Netherlands; XABEC and Bizkaia, Spain; Bridgwater & Taunton, UK). In the EMEU network, we focus on implementation of ECVET and quality assurance of modules. Cooperation with Lycee Professionel Monge (F), Da Vinci College (NL) and West College Scotland (UK) is following the same concept and guidelines although the colleges are not yet a part of the EMEU network. \r\n170 students and 25 teachers are to benefit from this mobility project, which follows the development plan of the international strategy of AARHUS TECH. \r\n\r\nPreviously the main international activities for students were integrated in a prolonged the basic course. With the new reform, we had to rethink this. The spring of 2016 a test of an optional course \u2018Go Global\u2019, which includes an ECVET accredited mobility experience UK, was tested. The optional course are for basic Year students who has the needed levels of Math, English, Physics and Danish and thereby have the possibility to choose extra curricula courses. Go Global was tested with ICT and Auto Mechanic students. Go Global a course for the students on cultural intelligence. This part of the course is now being further developed and embedded across the college. Another learning from the test course was that a 3 week mobility was too long for a large group of students to be able to pass the basic course. 3 out of 19 students did not pass the exam. We have decided to continue to run the optional course but reduce the mobility to two weeks.\r\n\r\nA total of 25 teachers and supporting staff is expected to benefit from this mobility project. The job shadowing will focus on: quality assurance and administration of international mobility, internationalisation at home, embedment of ECVET and of course specialised educational areas as advanced testing of materials (Lycee Monge), decorative painting (Bizkaia) and racing (Bridgwater&Taunton). Furthermore 3 teachers will have teaching assignments with partners on areas where we have expertise (accuracy in CNC), specialised welding.\r\n\r\nOur Charter application got a very positive feed back. There are 3 points we would like to reflect.\r\nImplementation of ECVET is improving rapidly. Being part of the strategic partnership EMEU has fuelled the process. The use of ECVET for international mobility is now a standard in the majority of educations involved in international cooperation and an increasing number of teachers are competent and can assist their peers in developing and describing ECVET modules. The transfer is both within each department and across department \u2013 for instance between ICT and painters who are now also included in the EMEU Network. \r\n\r\nThe Value of having both in-coming and out-going students is being strengthened. Using the Module concept across educations makes it realistic that all students at some point in their education will attend a module either abroad or together with international students at AARHUS TECH being taught in English.\r\n\r\nDissemination of project results needs continuous attention. This is definite an aspect which can still be improved. Therefore, the communication department is also involved in this project as active participants.

The aim is to provide the growing Vaasa region with a competent labour force that will thrive in the international, multicultural and multilingual working life and society. The objective of the project Professional Skills through Mobilities@vamia.fi is to implement the priorities of Vamia\u2019s internationalization strategy.\r\nAll international mobilities are based on the ECVET system. The methods for identifying and recognizing skills achieved abroad will be further developed for all students. The students\u2019 personal digital portfolio  will be further developed, and the students and staff will be more deeply familiarized with the utilization of it. In addition to this, all the practices regarding adult education students will be developed in order to create a high-quality process for international mobilities.\r\nThe project will enable all staff members and students to participate in international mobilities.The project will pilot and in the future intends to expand the mobilities of newly-graduated students.  The project will enable shorter mobilities for students with special needs.  Multilingualism will be promoted by developing Vamia\u2019s English-language export mechanical fitter education and training (starting in autumn 2017) as well as developing CLIL in all vocational education and training programs.\r\nIn the project new partnerships will be created. New partners will be given the opportunity to job shadow or do on-the-job learning in Vaasa. This will allow the staff and students of Vamia to get internationalized at home, make new contacts and together develop the quality of student mobilities.\r\nDuring this project we strive to further develop genuine and high-quality partnerships and networking while supporting Vamia\u2019s strategy and benefiting all stakeholders as well as contributing to quality assurance and safety of student mobilities. The aim is continuous improvement of the quality of international activities and mobilities by applying and developing LEAN tools such as continuous development boards, and by simplifying and standardizing practices. This applies to preparatory courses for students, on-the-job learning and assessment, the administration of international activities and the uniformity of practices across Vamia.  This also includes continuous training of the staff on the areas of responsibility and the phases of the international guidance plan as well as the continuous development of the students\u2019 use of the personal digital portfolio.\r\nThe aim is also to provide everyone with the opportunity to go abroad regardless of their study program, age, sex, and language or cultural background. The aim of the project is also to develop and increase the mobilities of adult students. Short mobilities for special needs students with an accompanying teacher (2 weeks in Glasgow), and a system for financially supporting students from poor socioeconomic backgrounds will be developed. A framework and a transparent application process will be developed for this.\r\nIn the project one of the objectives is to develop the competence of the management and staff through job shadowing. Vamia\u2019s management group of 15 persons (principal, vice principals, heads of department, development manager, financial director, manager of international affairs, and the people in charge of LEAN development) aim to do job shadowing in a vocational school in Tilburg, Holland, and learn about their LEAN and Oppiscrum system. The school has been developing their management system according to LEAN principles while Vamia has been using LEAN in teaching and learning environments. The two schools will learn from each other through mutual exchanges. Furthermore, we aim to send three teachers from the department of business and administration to Kunskapsk\u00e4llan in Sweden, where they can deepen their knowledge of e-commerce. Kunskapsk\u00e4llan is situated close to Bor\u00e5s, which is a center for e-commerce in Sweden. Vamia, together with local companies, will start export mechanical fitter education in English. Four members of the staff will be going to Elgoibar, Spain, to get acquainted with their English-speaking programs for fitters. The aim is to create job shadowing and cooperation between the two schools as well as to together create and share teaching material and develop cooperation with companies.
