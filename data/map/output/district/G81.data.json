The consortium members will scale-up the production of rhBMP6 from an already developed working cell bank to enter clinical trials on bone regeneration.\n\nThe bone diseases we will treat locally with OSTEOGROW are acute radius fractures and healing of distraction gap in high tibial osteotomy (HTO). These conditions are widespread and highly debilitating diseases for which such therapy holds great promise.\n\nWorkflow: Preliminary pre-clinical data are already available, and clinical grade (GMP) rhBMP6 will be available before the beginning of the project to perform toxicology studies and to determine the final formulation of OSTEOGROW. Clinical trials will start within 18 months from the start of the project funding.\n\nBusiness strategy: SMEs Genera Research, Vitrology Limited and Meditox will test and validate the rhBMP6 production in their facilities. Consortium members from Medical University of Vienna, Sarajevo University Clinical Centre, Linkoping University Faculty of Health Sciences, Zagreb University Trauma Clinic, SMART Medico and Paul Regulatory Services will perform, monitor and coordinate clinical trials. OSTEOGROW will find a wide use in human and veterinary medicine.", 287332.0, 5992031.0, "OSTEOGROW", "Biocompatible bone regenerator", "Bone fractures provoke a particularly painful and lengthy healing process, which applies mainly to elderly patients. Current treatment options are associated with inflammation and other undesirable side-effects.", "Plaster, plates or biological signalling molecules (e.g. bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2) are currently used in the treatment of bone defects. To avoid treatment failures and undesirable side-effects, new therapies are needed. Recently, a therapeutic product called OSTEOGROW demonstrated good healing potential in pre-clinical animal testing. \n\nThe EU-funded project 'Novel bone morphogenetic protein-6 biocompatible carrier device for bone regeneration' (http://osteogrow.eu/ (OSTEOGROW)) evaluated therapeutic potential in pre-clinical models and clinical settings. Clinical trials will include patients with acute radius fractures and those requiring surgical correction of various deformities of the lower leg to prevent osteoarthritis of the knee.\n\nThe OSTEOGROW therapeutic product has a carrier made from the patient's peripheral blood, called whole blood coagulum derivative (WBCD) to ensure biocompatibility. Recombinant human BMP-6 (rhBMP-6) is the bioactive molecule that binds to WBCD components and stimulates bone formation.\n\nThe OSTEOGROW team focused on improving rhBMP-6 production by using a genetically stable cell line suitable for commercial manufacturing. A new rhBMP-6 production and purification processes are efficient, robust, and inexpensive. The purified rhBMP-6 protein is bioactive, contaminant-free and stable in freeze-dried form. \n\nQuality and performance tests on rhBMP-6 revealed no biocompatibility or other issues. As a result, scientists finalised the formulation of OSTEOGROW with in\u00a0vivo testing showing highly promising results in mice, rats and rabbits.  \n\nClinical protocol design for Phase\u00a0I and II studies has also been completed. Currently, project partners are working on selecting the manufacturers for the now-patented kit components and are preparing the Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier and Investigator\u2019s Brochure. \n\nProject activities will ensure that the commercialisation of this therapeutic product is a step closer to reality for wide-ranging orthopaedic applications in humans and animals. This potentially safe, affordable and non-toxic therapeutic product will hopefully promote faster bone healing and reduce the need for secondary interventions.", "http://osteogrow.eu/", "http://www.vitrologybiotech.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140725507.jpg", "fp7_101812_968232370"], ["4HX", "Multivessel versus culprit lesion only percutaneous revascularization in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock", "National Waiting Times Centre Board", "Cardiogenic shock (CS) complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) represents a major European health care concern with mortality rates between 40-70%. Approximately 70-80% of these patients present with multivessel disease defined as coronary lesions in more than one vessel. The clinician is faced with the decision to either 1) intervene only on the culprit lesion acutely responsible for the initiation of cardiogenic shock, or 2) treat additional lesions considered hemodynamically significant but not acutely triggering the CS cascade as well. Current guidelines recommend percutaneous coronary intervention of all critical lesions. However, due to a lack of randomized trials, these recommendations are solely based on registry data and pathophysiological considerations. Aim of the randomized CULPRIT-SHOCK trial is therefore to compare a) immediate multivessel PCI versus b) culprit lesion only PCI in patients with AMI complicated by CS. A total of 706 CS patients will be randomized in several European countries. The primary endpoint will be 30-day all-cause mortality and/or severe renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy. CULPRIT-SHOCK will therefore determine the optimal percutaneous revascularization strategy in patients with AMI and multivessel disease complicated by CS. In addition, a comprehensive array of efficacy, safety and socio-economic parameters for the chosen population will be assessed. Multiple secondary endpoints and several substudies (microcirculation, biomarkers, angiography) will serve to further understand the presumed differential effects of the 2 treatment arms and to understand the underlying pathophysiology and prognostic markers. From these parameters a multivariable regression model and a risk score for the prediction of clinical prognosis and a cost-effectiveness model in AMI and CS will be developed. Furthermore, CULPRIT-SHOCK will obtain data on CS patients not meeting inclusion criteria by instituting a separate registry.", 155039.0, 6462705.0, "CULPRIT-SHOCK", null, null, null, "http://www.culprit-shock.eu", "http://www.nhsgoldenjubilee.co.uk", null, "fp7_110170_950365552"], ["2QR", "HOLIstic optimisation of SHIP design and operation for life cycle", "Tritec Marine Ltd", "Most maritime products are typically associated with large investments and are seldom built in large series. Where other modes of transport benefit from the economy of series production, this is not the case for maritime products which are typically designed to refined customer requirements increasingly determined by the need for high efficiency, flexibility and low environmental impact at a competitive price. Product design is thus subject to global trade-offs among traditional constraints (customer needs, technical requirements, cost) and new requirements (life-cycle, environmental impact, rules).\nOne of the most important design objectives is to minimise total cost over the economic life cycle of the product, taking into account maintenance, refitting, renewal, manning, recycling, environmental footprint, etc. The trade-off among all these requirements must be assessed and evaluated in the first steps of the design process on the basis of customer / owner specifications. \nAdvanced product design needs to adapt to profound, sometimes contradicting requirements and assure a flexible and optimised performance over the entire life-cycle for varying operational conditions. This calls for greatly improved design tools including multi-objective optimisation and finally virtual testing of the overall design and its components.\nHOLISHIP (HOLIstic optimisation of SHIP design and operation for life-cycle) addresses these urgent industry needs by the development of innovative design methodologies, integrating design requirements (technical constraints, performance indicators, life-cycle cost, environmental impact) at an early design stage and for the entire life-cycle in an integrated design environment. Design integration will be implemented in practice by the development of integrated design s/w platforms and demonstrated by digital mock-ups and industry led application studies on the design and performance of ships, marine equipment and maritime assets in general.", 73535.0, 9966903.0, "HOLISHIP", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_204765_926266678"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["4XJ", "THE LENNOX PARTNERSHIP LIMITED", 91418.0, "Supporting legal migration to the Union and promoting the effective integration of third-country nationals and enhancing fair and effective return strategies (18.03.01.02)", "fts_2017_28893", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "G81"}
