In available cohorts, we will identify the most promising \u2018omics-based BM profiles for the pre-symptomatic diagnosis and future prediction of HF in patients at risk. The predictive value of the BMs for other co-morbidities commonly associated with HF and ageing will also be investigated.

Factors such as hypertension (i.e. increased blood pressure) and high cholesterol levels have been linked to increased cardiovascular disease risk.

These biomarkers would provide an estimate of the patient status in terms of cardiovascular health.\n\nTo this end, project partners have analysed blood and urine samples from 350 patients with and without hypertension to select small molecules with differential expression. Additionally, they have utilised metabolomics and proteomics data from another cohort of 800 patients to identify biomarkers. To validate the association of emerging biomarkers with cardiovascular phenotypes, patients are being monitored for cardiac function. Special focus is being given to renal disease as a high risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\n\nGenetic markers and factors related to cardiac structure, function and inflammation will also be investigated for their predictive potential. The long-term goal is to identify biomarkers for risk prediction and cardiovascular disease development.\n\nThe consortium will eventually combine established and new biomarkers with different aspects of disease pathophysiology in a predictive model.
