Analysis and hypothesis generation for drug-discovery projects requires assembly, overlay and comparison of data from many sources, requiring shared identifiers and common semantics. Expression profiles need to be overlaid with gene or pathway identifiers and reports on compound pharmacology. Alignment and integration of internal and public data and information sources is a significant effort and the process is repeated across companies, institutes and academic laboratories. This represents a significant waste and an opportunity cost.\n \nTo address these challenges, the Open PHACTS project will develop an open access innovation platform, Open Pharmacological Space (OPS), via a semantic web approach. OPS will comprise data, vocabularies and infrastructure needed to accelerate drug-oriented research. This semantic integration hub will remove key bottlenecks in small molecule drug discovery: disparate information sources, lack of standards and common identifiers, guided by well defined research questions from drug discovery. \n\nWorkflows for data capture, processing, interoperability, visualization, and chemogenomics will be developed creating a comprehensive Systems Chemical Biology Analysis Network. Security issues around proprietary data, shared via the Open PHACTS Discovery Platform and accessible for safe querying and reasoning will be properly addressed with expert trusted parties.\n\nThe Open PHACTS consortium comprises 20 European academic and SME partners, with leading experts in the fields of data mining, annotation, small molecule data storage and manipulation, target bioinformatics, RDF information handling, massive in silico reasoning and chemical biology. The 10 EFPIA members of Open PHACTS will contribute drug discovery expertise, data sets, software engineering and programming capacity to the project.", 312850.0, 16313907.0, "OPEN PHACTS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.connecteddiscovery.com", null, "fp7_203694_960556081"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9QT", "Don't get stuck, stack the cup", "Sport Stacking GB", 13173.0, "Natura Hungarica Public Foundation('2001) works for the protection of environment and promotion of sustainable behaviour patterns. We the volunteers of the foundation participate in youth work. We run project focused on the youth, aged 13-19, to give the support to become mentally and physically healthy adults, representing their interests. The Foundation supports sport activities and tools, like sport stacking, a sport, which also serves as creative educational tool, especially by children with disabilities and fewer opportunities.\r\nWe also organise gratis life-skill trainings and training for school groups how to react on cyber bullying, and other harassment.\r\nIn line with these, the goal of our project is to give the children, participating at Youth Exchange, possibility and support to become globally thinking, locally active and effectively communicating citizens.\r\nOn first 3 days participants explore their own persona, participating in a basic life-skill training. We promote the development of the young personality based on long prven theories, implementing non-formal learning scenarios, creating spectacular actions using an innovative sport and educational tool. Here they face their needs and competences, strength and weakness. This experience contributes to the achievement of their mental health, help them to decide properly, and find their role.\r\nIn the second part of the week, participants will learn basic management skills to be able to plan and realise and evaluate a project, and manage their resources.\r\nGood communication skills are vital. We show positive verbal and non-verbal communication patterns to succeed in their private life, at school and later at work.\r\nThey also accomplish their own mini-project to represent their Erasmus mini-group and Smart Stacks Programme to a spontaneous audience anywhere in Szeged (Hungary)\r\nTo achieve above mentioned goals we use in the first line sport cups. Speed Stacks Hungary representatives invented a new, more complex way to use sport cups. It is called Smart Stacks Programme. Different  learnt and new skills (i.e. oral tasks, physical exercises) are to be done, while placing the cups in different formations, specific sequences to assist learnt skills to become applied skills with sensor-motor learning and improvement of seriaslity.\r\nDuring the week the participants will also contribute to the development of Smart Programme as creative educational and recreational tool, and find the way to implement this tool and therapy in the education of persons with learning and social difficulties.\r\nWe enhance the usage of other creative methods (music, poem, photography) to express their creativitiy and feelings.\r\n55 participants will represent 7 organisaition from 6 countries. 10 participants with fewer opportunities and one disabled will also be in the team. The cooperation wiht them will contribute to the social sensibility of healthy person and they will ralise the importance of equal opportunities.\r\nThe main impacts of the project will be:\r\nParticipants meet persons from different social and cultural background and realise their strength and competence, so they will appreciate and tolerate each an other, and demolish prejudices.\r\nTheir willingness and ability to communicate and cooperate will improve at school and in private life, an later at job.\r\nThey will learn basic terminology like the numbers till 12, left and right, up and down, a national poem and a song, in min. 3-4 languages.\r\nParticipants will dream of new projects, new challenges. Since they got the ability and learned about the methods to plan, organise and manage resources, they will realise, what they were dreaming of.\r\nAnd last, but not least we will have fun and adventure with young people with similar interests. \r\nThe Smart Stacks Programme , an innovative education tool will be presented to at least 55 teachers, trainers and interested pupils from 6 countries followed by many promotional and awareness activities of the program in these European countries and more in the future.\r\nSmart Stack Programme will get feedback, new ideas on how to exploit and make use of it.\r\nThe new creative learning method will be introduced and implemented in various schools and other institutions in the participating countries and hopefully other neighbouring countries as well.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-1-HU02-KA105-000816_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CT14"}
