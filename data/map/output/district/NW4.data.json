We assume that vulnerable urban agglomerations will be more resilient if multiple FRSs are applied simultaneously, linked together and aligned. At the same time, the application of a diverse cluster of FRSs has to be appropriate, i.e. attuned to the physical and social context. The latter asks for innovative Flood Risk Governance Arrangements (FRGAs). In the proposed program, insights from governance and legal scholars will be integrated and combined, leading to policy design principles for FRGAs as well as concrete recommendations for policy and law at the level of the EU, its member states, regional authorities, and public-private partnerships.\nAcross different EU countries and regions, we expect to identify different mixes of FRSs. We will analyze, explain and evaluate the emergence and dominance of the FRGAs through which these FRSs are institutionally embedded. For this, a comparative analysis of FRGAs in six EU member states will be carried out. This analysis will reveal good practices, provide understanding of the resilience of FRSs as well as their appropriateness in different physical, social and legal contexts.

Current approaches for coastal management and defence based on present conditions therefore need to be re-examined.\n\nThe 'Innovative technologies for safer European coasts in a changing climate' (http://www.theseusproject.eu (THESEUS)) project was established to meet this challenge. It developed a holistic, participatory and interdisciplinary approach to understanding the physical, ecological, economic and social components of the coastal system.\n\nResearchers improved the design of coastal defence structures and delivered advanced technologies and best practices based on the lessons learnt at study sites. They tested the performance of both innovative and traditional defences, such as floating energy converters, submerged reefs, dikes and breakwaters, and nourishment operations in the context of increasing sea-level rise and extreme weather events. To increase coastal resilience THESEUS also examined a wide range of ecologically based strategies, such as maintenance and reinforcement of wetlands, dunes and biogenic reefs, and cost-effective non-technological solutions, such as insurance, land-use plans, business recovery actions and promotion of risk awareness.\n\nProject outcomes were synthesised in a book of guidelines and in a GIS-based decision support system (DSS). The guidelines detail the best practices and advances of engineering, ecologically based, social and economic strategies for sustainable defence planning.  The DSS is an exploratory tool allowing the users to perform an integrated coastal risk assessment and to scope different combinations of adaptation options, across short, medium and long-term scenarios, taking into account physical and non-physical drivers such as climate change, subsidence, population and economic growth.\n\nTHESEUS has developed a systematic approach in assessing and managing European coasts that have become growing erosion and flood risks, as well as in delivering safer coastal habitats.", "http://www.theseusproject.eu/", "http://www.mdx.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/149719.jpg", "fp7_92871_999883470"], ["4BT", "WeSenseIT: Citizen Observatory of Water", "Middlesex University Higher Education Corporation", "WeSenseIt will develop a citizen-based observatory of water, which will allow citizens and communities to become active stakeholders in information capturing, evaluation and communication.\nWe propose:\n(i) data collection: (a) a first \u201chard\u201d layer consisting of low-cost, static and portable devices that sense and transfer water information when automatically monitored or when initiated by citizens from their mobile devices; (b) a second \u201csoft\u201d layer consisting of techniques to harness citizens\u2019 Collective Intelligence, i.e. the information, experience and knowledge embodied within individuals and communities, both in terms of enabling direct messages to the authorities (with mobile-phone pictures, messages, etc.) and in terms of crowd-sourcing (e.g. by mining social networks like Twitter and Facebook, as well as bulletin boards, RSS feeds, etc.).\n(ii) the development of descriptive and predictive models and decision-making tools integrating sensor and citizen-based data; the data suppliers (physical sensors or people) are seen as nodes of an integrated heterogeneous data collection network which undergoes progressive multi-objective optimization and tuning.\n(iii) two-way feedback and exchange of environmental knowledge/experience between citizens and authorities for decision-making and governance within an e-collaboration framework ,enabling improved transparency, knowledge management, accountability and responsiveness, as well as facilitating participation in water management.\nWe will test, experiment and demonstrate the citizen observatory of water in three different case studies in water management with civil protection agencies in UK, NL and Italy.

CRADL will show how EIT can provide new cost effective, easy to use, respiratory management tools and clinical protocols that can be universally adopted to reduce deaths and disability in preterm babies by delivering a tool that provides continuous, non-invasive, radiation free, bedside information on regional lung aeration and ventilation during daily clinical care of (preterm) infants and children with respiratory failure. CRADL will also assess the effectiveness, efficacy and safety of such a system in guiding respiratory management and supportive care of the most common causes of paediatric respiratory failure (respiratory distress syndrome, bronchiolitis and acute respiratory distress syndrome), with the final goal of reducing short and long term adverse effects of disease and its treatment in this population.", 851308.0, 4725626.0, "CRADL", null, null, null, null, "http://www.mdx.ac.uk", null, "h2020_200029_999883470"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["4BT", "INSTANT MIX THEATER LAB FOUNDING PROJECT", "MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", 48014.0, "This project takes place at a turning point in our development of innovative bilingual or multilingual forms of theater, where translation (from author's language to audience's language) in incorporated in the performance and performed by the actors themselves.

We are extremely proud of our diverse School community and celebrate our pupils differences as well as explicitly identifying ways in which we are similar.    \r\nThis project fits with our EDP, which also feeds into our SIP.  We have identified that we need to improve the provision for new arrivals to make sure they settle in to School quickly, work at an appropriate level and make rapid progress. \r\nWe identified in our European Development Plan 4 areas of need which we will address through this project.We expect improvements will be made in all of these areas.\r\n\r\n1. Developing knowledge and understanding of the CLIL approach which all the bilingual schools in Madrid use.\r\nWe want to learn from our Spanish link school as they use the CLIL approach, using English as a second language to teach.Through structured training courses, we will learn the theory behind language acquisition, how pupils are supported to develop their language skills using CLIL as well as observe practical demonstrations in lessons. As a significant percentage of pupils speak English as an additional language in our School, CLIL would be an approach which we could adopt to promote rapid progress for pupils who are using English as a second language to learn.\r\n\r\n2.  Enhancing the language skills of staff and their cultural awareness through immersion in the mobilities. \r\nAll staff involved in the mobilities will improve their language competence, measured by the use of the Europass Language Passport as a baseline, end of year 1 and an end-of-project assessment. The enhanced cultural awareness will be measured through the completion of the course tasks/project assessments monitored by the IWP.The outcomes in terms of attainment for pupils will be measured through the twice-yearly assessments against our Key Performance Indicators and through pupil surveys to assess attitude and motivation.  This should up-skill our staffs language skills and enrich curriculum delivery.   \r\n\r\n3. Providing a Culturally Inclusive Curriculum, Celebrating Diversity\r\n- Using the link with a partner school to enhance the learning about the Spanish language, culture and history.  \r\nWe will have embedded the partnership into the life of the school so the link will be sustainable. We will have a planned programme of exchanging project work both physically and electronically.This will necessitate a development of our ICT skills -we will use Skype to exchange ideas and materials with our link school. In addition,we plan to produce podcasts and experiment with the use of twitter. We will use the eTwinning platform as our secure space to post and share work and discussions. Records will be kept of all these activities and the quality of the early examples will be compared with the later ones to assess progress. \r\nCross curricular implementation-we will explore the Islamic tradition and history of Spain as part of our inclusive curriculum. Subject Leads who participate in the mobilities will be required to produce Units of Work in their curriculum area which integrate elements of Spanish Art, History & Geography.This will be monitored by the Working Party.\r\n\r\n4. European and International Dimension - by the end of the two year project our school will have achieved the Full Accreditation of the International School Award. This will follow a complete audit of the curriculum and the introduction of elements into each curriculum area. The link with our partner school in Spain will be an source of knowledge and inspiration as to new ways of thinking.\r\n\r\nWe know that our objectives are ambitious but we have a clear view of what we want the outcomes of the project to be.\r\nSome of the outcomes, such as the development of management competences, will be developed through the project and monitored by the SLT through our evaluative process.\r\nWe wish as many of our staff as possible to use this CPD opportunity. We have,therefore,requested a two year project during which 12 members of staff (teachers and teaching assistants)have the opportunity to take part in mobilities. We know that in order to have a major impact on the life of the school, we need to have a whole school approach and all staff need to share this vision and understand the role they play. However, in order to maximise the participants' ability to reflect on practice observed whilst on the course, we are suggesting that just 3 at a time take part in the mobility so that staff are able to focus on the strategies used by the Spanish teachers.\r\nWe consider that these elements of the curriculum which teach pupils to be open minded and curious about places and people across Europe and Internationally are life skills that are essential for our pupils to develop in order to for them to be considerate, tolerant and good citizens.", "http://www.parkfieldschool.com", "Parkfield Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036286_coordinator"], ["4BT", "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", 330843.0, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

This will comprise matters of organising, travelling, coordination with partners, personal mentoring, application, documentation and evaluation. Besides an overall elevation towards a European perspective, we expect all participants to amplify their social, technical, educational, verbal und intercultural competences through such an international exchange.
