Potholes also hold the distinction of being the most aggravating road distress to the traveling public in general.\n\nPothole repair generally accounts for a significant portion of transportation departments\u2019 operating budget, with more than \u20ac1,2 billion being directly attributed to fill nearly 20 million potholes in Europe during 2011, but only half of Europe's potholes were treated. This can be attributed to the high initial costs associated with maintenance activities, the historically poor performance of patching which often necessitates additional maintenance work, and the exorbitant safety and legal costs associated with the need for traffic control of these activities. As such, any improvements or advancements in this area could result in substantial cost savings.\n\nAs a response to this need, a potholer repair method that will significantly reduce the direct costs (cost of repair) and indirect costs (cost of user compensation, traffic disrupts, etc.) associated with road maintenance activities is required.

The low cost technology will be sufficiently high torque to drive the wheels at a high speed, without requiring an intermediate gearbox. To further drive down cost we will use the housing of the liquid cooled drive motor, as a heat sink for a high current power convertor.

The Convention requires ships to have Ballast Water Treatment (BWT) system installed by 2016. BWT is an evolving technology. However, it is generally accepted across industry that viable BWT consist of at least 2 stages targeting both macro and micro IS separately. Filtration is generally as the 1st stage and according to a Lloyd register survey and one we conducted ourselves, UV seem to be relatively the most preferred 2nd stage treatment as the water treated by UV seems to have the least effect on the environment and the ship. UV treated water is less likely to cause corrosion of the ballast tanks compared to other commonly used treatment such as Electrolysis. However, they have the highest operation cost/m3 and their performance can be affected by water turbidity and frigidity. Hence, as UV is the most preferred and with the highest cost of ownership, the rest of the market will migrate towards UV systems if effort can be made to reduce the ownership cost and overall performance issues for a given water turbidity and frigidity level. The highest cost for UV is energy needed for a given dose, maintenance and replacement of UV lamps.

Fulfilling these new requirements is therefore urgent and it will be a major challenge for the water supply companies, as existing technologies are partly meeting these needs. The major issue in the new Arsenic limit is the associated costs to the water treatment facilities. The common methods have been found to be cost effective only at a large scale, where labor costs are spread over a larger amount of treated water produced. The water treatment cost using conventional adsorbents ranges from 6.7-40 \u20ac/100m3 (assuming adsorption capacity 1-3gAs/kg and adsorbent cost 5-10\u20ac/kg). Consequently, the main disadvantage of the available conventional adsorbent treatment technologies for arsenic removal seems to be the high cost of adsorbents.

Based on results and characterisation of the physicochemical properties of the final adsorbent, the optimum reactor design and configuration was determined for pilot-scale studies.

Instead, using an interactive games paradigm, the trainees will be able to practice situation and cue assessment, problem diagnosis, decision making and action coordination, proactive response to a critical incident. The realistic 3D virtual replica would enable trainees to act, see, issue commands, cooperate and communicate as if they were physically onsite. The proposed training platform will increase the proper emergency preparedness of the ship crew and will create a highly increased level of safety consciousness. The system will provide maritime training centres with the opportunity to train more efficiently seafarers from the various maritime sectors, thus enabling various stakeholders, i.e. European Shipowners, to meet the strict legislative requirements adopted by EU in regards to maritime safety e.g. the ISM Code. Developing advanced skills and competences among seafarers in relation to emergency responses will enable them to prevent unsafe situations, and prepare for effective actions when incidents occur. This will not only minimize the possibility of business interruption and loss of property, thus reducing the economic loss, but will also have a massive impact on preserving the European marine environment by reducing the oil spills in the sea and most importantly decreasing significantly the chances of sustaining injuries and loss of human life.", 17453.0, 2446848.0, "TEAMSAFETY", null, null, null, null, "http://www.uk-isri.org", null, "fp7_96634_998923849"], ["0PB", "Development of novel sintered sphere filtering technique for moulding opaper pulp to reduce energy consumption and environmental effects of plastic", "The Uk Health & Environment Research Institute", "China poses a major competitive threat to the European market for the manufacture of products for packaging.

A major portion of recovered fibre is sourced from local SMEs such as waste paper merchants, waste management companies and corrugated case manufacturers. The recovered paper market will be directly impacted through potentially higher demand. Demand from China for recovered fibre has pushed prices high. Exports globally estimated at over 13 million tonnes per annum (expected to increase by around 18 million by 2009) are used mainly for MPP manufacturing, which are subsequently exported back to Europe. Estimated growth volumes for existing and new markets, show that increasing usage of recovered fibre will be restrained, unless the industry can move forward on the following key issues: \u2022 Improvement in the ability to produce cost competitive products \u2022 Step change in the aesthetic characteristics of products, at competitive prices \u2022 Migration towards utilisation of post- consumer recovered fibre The Solution.

The most commonly used concrete piles are the pre-cast concrete piles and the cast in-situ concrete piles. Cast in-situ concrete piles are limited in the length or depth at which it could be cast unlike pre-cast piles (it can be extended to greater depths using mechanical joints). Apart from its advantage in installation depth, pre-cast concrete piles are becoming more preferred because of the decreasing length of the individual pile sections before installation. There are equipments and method available for concrete pile integrity testing that is time and cost effective (e.g. ultrasonic testing), but they have limitations especially when testing pre-cast piles. Therefore, our idea is to produce an innovative quality assurance system to enable a cost effective, efficient and reliable means of monitoring the integrity of pre-cast concrete piles through out its supply chain from manufacturing up until after its installation. The proposed project would involve the development of: \u00b7 A means of recording and accessing pile information (pile number, batch number, pile location, periodic integrity check results etc) using an embedded ID tag on each pile; \u00b7 A means of verifying a number of piles used to form a segmented pile has been properly driven (installed) into the ground and can hold a given amount of weight. This would be done by developing an innovative concrete pile manufacturing process to slightly embed a conductive circuit path through the pile common failure areas to allow current passage through the pile, which would allow for the detection of changes in resistivity due to cracks or strain to the concrete pile using an intelligent monitoring technique.

Out of all the causes, most of them are minimised or preventable by better maintenance except the overloading of the electricity main (Power Grids), which can\u2019t be completely predicted. Across Europe, overloading of the mains occurs more frequently and this in impacted by the fact that energy consumption in the EU is growing and this has significant environmental impacts. There are various measures taken to tackle the overloading of the mains, including predicting when these overloads occur and preparing back up power to cater for it, however, this solution would only help in minimising it. There will still be some cases of overloading especially due to the fluctuations of the demand on the mains. All the time, Power Grids must ensure that electricity supply precisely matches the continually changing demand from the vast amount of customers. Although most of the large changes in demand are predictable there are continuous smaller fluctuations which are essentially random. And there is also always the possibility that a sudden large fluctuation could occur at any time and the sudden increased demand can cause a power line or generating station to fail. Trying to control this issue costs the Grids hundreds millions of euros, and in some cases there have been the occurrence of blackouts in some countries. There is a need for an innovative approach to reduce the pressure being put on the Grids by effectively managing the energy consumption and demand on the Grid with the incorporation of Dynamic Demand technology.
