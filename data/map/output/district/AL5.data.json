Insects have been shown to evolve resistance through quantitative changes in P450 expression or via qualitative changes in P450s that alter metabolic activity. Despite their importance in conferring resistance the variety of regulatory changes that modulate P450 expression in resistant insects and their relative frequency/impact is not fully understood. Furthermore, although qualitative changes in insect P450s associated with resistance are relatively rare they represent a unique opportunity to characterise insecticide/toxin binding and identify the critical structure/function determinants of the P450/insect toxin interaction.\n\nIn this project I will exploit cutting-edge advances in genomics, epigenetics and transgenics to study the insect P450 resistome in three main workpackages:\n\nWP-1: Will identify the molecular drivers of quantitative changes to insect P450s.\nWP-2: Will explore the role of qualitative changes in insect P450s in mediating resistance and identify structure/function determinants of insecticide metabolism.\nWP-3: Will exploit the knowledge gained in WP1/2 and from previous research to deliver a \u2018P450 toolkit\u2019 consisting of in vitro and in vivo screening tools, with which to identify resistance breaking chemistry, and high-throughput diagnostics for use in resistance management.\n\nIn summary this project will provide novel insights into this important enzyme family and provide tools that can be used to develop new products and strategies that slow, prevent, or overcome resistance and so ensure sustainable crop protection", 22380.0, 1699345.0, "P450RESIST", null, null, null, null, "http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk", null, "h2020_199651_999455021"], ["2JQ", "Addiction of Insects for Biosensoring", "Rothamsted Research Limited", "Although the value of the olfactory systems of animals, and particularly insects, for detecting key marker chemicals associated with anthropogenic problems has been explored, this training program will study a totally new approach. The objective is to study the possibility of inducing a positive association between an originally aversive marker chemical and an addicting reward in the German cockroach  B. germanica through associative learning processes. The German cockroach has been chosen as model insect for its particular evolutionary and physiological features. The challenges of the present proposal are to understand how addiction shape adaptive control mechanisms and how induced drug addiction affects the behaviour of individuals and groups in the recognition of olfactory stimuli. The innovative idea is to induce flexibility in the behaviour of the model insect, reassessing the motivation priorities in order to be able to manipulate the behavioural responses of the insect. Defining and understanding the reactions of insects to different environmental stimuli associated with addiction inducing chemicals could open new technological insights in the use of insects for beneficial purposes and will generate new keys of interpretation of insect brain physiology. This project will also impact the society at large with a new concept of applied entomology under three main aspects. Under the industrial point of view, the use of addicted insects will open new areas for development of biosensors and bioelectronics; under the humanitarian point of view, the achievement of the training will open new possibilities for the use of insects for beneficial purposes and third this project will offer a different and unexpected view of the science of entomology which is most often intended as related exclusively to agriculture or to human health.", 157945.0, 157945.0, "ActIng", null, null, null, null, "http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk", null, "h2020_197277_999455021"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["2JQ", "AgRIA: Agricultural Research and Innovation Accelerator", "Rothamstead Research", "Provision of research and innovation mechanisms drawn from multiple sectors to co-create solutions to problems in the agri-food sector", "ERDF", 1316387.0, 2632775.0, "erdf_england_55"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2JQ", "ROTHAMSTED RESEARCH LTD*", 645625.0, "Securing sufficient supplies of safe and high quality food and other bio-based products (05.09.03.01)", "fts_2017_4792", 2017], ["2JQ", "AGRIMETRICS LIMITED", 188269.0, "Strengthening European research infrastructures, including e-infrastructures (08.02.01.03)", "fts_2017_8417", 2017], ["5BZ", "POLYTEC LIMITED", 89448.0, "Leadership in nanotechnologies, advanced materials, laser technology, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing and processing (08.02.02.01)", "fts_2017_8786", 2017], ["2JQ", "AGRIMETRICS LIMITED", 3842.0, "Appropriations accruing from contributions from (non-European Economic Area) third parties to research and technological development (2014 to 2020) (08.02.50.01)", "fts_2017_49211", 2017], ["1AU", "SPACECHIPS LTD", 43613.0, "Leadership in space (02.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_57674", 2017]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["4TA", "RAL", "HARPENDEN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL"], ["4TA", "RC9", "HARPENDEN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL"], ["4TA", "RWG", "HARPENDEN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL"], ["4TA", "RY4", "HARPENDEN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "AL5"}
