Despite a ban on asbestos use, our members\u2019 workers are continually exposed to this potent, invisible carcinogen from legacy products such as insulation, water tanks, ceiling panels, floor tiles and textured wall coverings. We feel that this level of risk is completely unacceptable for our members and must be addressed. Currently, asbestos is detected by a slow process of air sampling, with samples sent off to a lab and results being returned days later. Not only is this too late to take action, but tests are only performed if asbestos is suspected to be present. There is currently no way to detect asbestos in real-time. The ALERT project will change this. A decade ago, researchers discovered a way to detect asbestos fibres through a light-scattering technique. This work stalled due to technical and cost barriers; barriers we now believe we can overcome. We have assembled a world-leading consortium to extend this early research and develop a low-cost portable detector that can be worn by the worker to continuously monitor their work environment. By developing the ALERT system, we will provide 30 million European workers with a means of detecting asbestos the moment it is disturbed, allowing them to protect themselves and avoid becoming one of the 100,000 people worldwide killed each year by exposure to asbestos.", 221878.0, 1891061.0, "ALERT", "New asbestos sensor could save lives", "A group of EU companies and research institutions have built a wearable asbestos sensor for plumbers, builders and technicians exposed to this dangerous chemical.", "Asbestos-related diseases are responsible for an estimated 100\u00a0000 deaths per year in Europe alone. Despite this terrible occupational hazard, the only way to detect asbestos in the air is to send a sample to a lab for testing.\n\nTo address this, the EU-funded project 'Portable real time detection of airborne asbestos fibres for tradespersons' (http://www.asbestos-alert.com (ALERT)) aimed to build a real-time, portable asbestos sensor.\n\nALERT brought together expertise in a range of technologies needed to create a sensor. The sensor is based on a decade-old method of detecting asbestos fibres by how they scatter light.\n\nResearchers built and tested a prototype detector that can easily be worn by workers. End-user testing provided feedback on ergonomics and ease-of-use.\n\nThe prototype was tested successfully in industrial, commercial, retail and domestic environments. ALERT reported a success rate of 99\u00a0% in identifying airborne asbestos fibres.\n\nThe ALERT\u00ae sensor will now be developed into a commercially available device. Ultimately, the results of this project will help to protect the 30 million workers who are exposed to asbestos fibres in Europe.", null, "http://www.selectselect.net", "/docs/results/images/2015/149412.jpg", "fp7_107810_991826068"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["7EJ", "Hi-Tech & Digital Work-hub", "South Devon College", "This ERDF project will enable the creation of 15 individual work-hubs plus 2 large open plan collaboration zones with 2 meeting rooms within the new South Devon College Hi-Tech & Digital Centre (HTDC).  \nThe project offeres good value for money on both the Capital and Revenue elements.\nVFM was checked as part of the appraisal process and the project offers good VFM when compared to the OP average.", "ERDF", 928210.0, 1547017.0, "erdf_england_496"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TQ4"}
