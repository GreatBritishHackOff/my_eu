Despite a ban on asbestos use, our members\u2019 workers are continually exposed to this potent, invisible carcinogen from legacy products such as insulation, water tanks, ceiling panels, floor tiles and textured wall coverings. We feel that this level of risk is completely unacceptable for our members and must be addressed. Currently, asbestos is detected by a slow process of air sampling, with samples sent off to a lab and results being returned days later. Not only is this too late to take action, but tests are only performed if asbestos is suspected to be present. There is currently no way to detect asbestos in real-time. The ALERT project will change this. A decade ago, researchers discovered a way to detect asbestos fibres through a light-scattering technique. This work stalled due to technical and cost barriers; barriers we now believe we can overcome. We have assembled a world-leading consortium to extend this early research and develop a low-cost portable detector that can be worn by the worker to continuously monitor their work environment. By developing the ALERT system, we will provide 30 million European workers with a means of detecting asbestos the moment it is disturbed, allowing them to protect themselves and avoid becoming one of the 100,000 people worldwide killed each year by exposure to asbestos.", 221878.0, 1891061.0, "ALERT", "New asbestos sensor could save lives", "A group of EU companies and research institutions have built a wearable asbestos sensor for plumbers, builders and technicians exposed to this dangerous chemical.", "Asbestos-related diseases are responsible for an estimated 100\u00a0000 deaths per year in Europe alone. Despite this terrible occupational hazard, the only way to detect asbestos in the air is to send a sample to a lab for testing.\n\nTo address this, the EU-funded project 'Portable real time detection of airborne asbestos fibres for tradespersons' (http://www.asbestos-alert.com (ALERT)) aimed to build a real-time, portable asbestos sensor.\n\nALERT brought together expertise in a range of technologies needed to create a sensor. The sensor is based on a decade-old method of detecting asbestos fibres by how they scatter light.\n\nResearchers built and tested a prototype detector that can easily be worn by workers. End-user testing provided feedback on ergonomics and ease-of-use.\n\nThe prototype was tested successfully in industrial, commercial, retail and domestic environments. ALERT reported a success rate of 99\u00a0% in identifying airborne asbestos fibres.\n\nThe ALERT\u00ae sensor will now be developed into a commercially available device.

SDC has therefore highlighted an important need to develop more internationally relevant curriculum and generate more cultural impact to better prepare our learners with International Employability Skills to be able to compete with learners from other nations and make a meaningful contribution to the global economy.\r\n\r\nThe main activities within our Developing Overseas Skills Experience 3 (DOSE 3) Project will be one flow of 12 student mobilities for two weeks to each of our partner organisations., per year. These will be in France (two locations), Saint Gabriel Vocational Training College in Pont l\u2019Abb\u00e9 and Cannes Hotel and Trade School plus Bromangymnasiet, Hudiksvall, Sweden with a programme of work placement, college and cultural activities. Plus one flow of Business students to our partners in Kiel for the Business Game, work simulation experience, per year. In addition one flow of staff mobilities per year to each country partner  for work shadowing and review of quality assessment systems  for Automotive and Marine; Tourism, Catering & Hospitality, Engineering and Business.\r\n\r\nThe main areas we wish to develop through this project are:\r\n- Our teaching methods and resources to improve skills in communication and critical thinking \u2013 recognised as key employability skills which enable people to apply skills to different contexts, solve problems, use their initiative and work independently;\r\n- Our methods of working with industry to better inform curriculum developments and respond to and anticipate sector skills needs;\r\n- Ensuring an international context and dimension is present throughout the learner journey at SDC;\r\n- To convert existing international relationships to partnerships with knowledge transfer and innovation outcomes for staff, and cultural experiences and work placements for learners;\r\n- To cement a network of international contacts from which to grow and generate sustainable international collaboration.\r\n\r\nSDC has a mission 'to inspire its community through learning for all' and has an entirely learner centric focus to enable every learner to achieve their best potential.\r\nThe main objectives for the participants are to:\r\n- Support learners to develop their competences through the acquisition of skills and experience\r\n- Improve their personal development and employability in the European labour market\r\n- Develop their cultural awareness and improve social understanding of another country\r\n- Broaden horizons by breaking down perceived barriers that may limit learners aspiration\r\n- Provide further professional development opportunities for staff through work shadowing experiences\r\n- Improve progression levels to higher levels/Higher Education.\r\n\r\nWe expect that this programme will have positive, long lasting effects on all the participants, students and staff and the organisation. and these will mirror the aims of the programme.

Provide participants with practical training through the 3 months-stay in businesses in Italy, Portugal or the UK, thus enabling the Technician qualification through recognition of the stay by the form of Training at Work or FCT. These stays will be developed between March and June 2018. \r\n- Improvement of their language skills: Learning and/or improvement of one or more languages (Italian / Portuguese / English): general knowledge and technical information relating to their professional field.\r\n- Improvement of Professional Skills: Participants acquire skills and abilities terminals set in the training program placement module, which enable them to carry out their profession. Development of a set of capabilities or skills necessary for incorporation into the workforce.\r\n- Improvement of Cultural and Personal Skills: It is, in many cases, the first experience and stay abroad, which implies personal maturity. To live in a multicultural environment, involves the acquisition of a spirit of adaptation to different social-cultural as well as a huge cultural enrichment. \r\n- Promote and encourage VET innovation and internationalization.\r\n\r\nConfebask has been participating for over 15 years in European mobility projects, with a baggage accumulated over 1600 participants so that vocational students are concerned.

All participants benefit from this school partnership as a perfect procedure is guaranteed by this longterm cooperation based on trust.\r\nIn order to realise our internationalisation strategy we also set up teacher trainings with our partners in France, Great Britain, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and Spain. The courses provided in Spain, France and Bournemouth/GB as well as Cheltenham/GB focus on enhancing competences in teaching a foreign language. In the long run we wish to guarantee teacher trainings on a regular basis, so that as many colleagues as possible can take part. This year some of our English teachers are sent abroad for courses via Kulturlife. Coming year we will apply, ensuring that more colleagues teaching English participate in teacher trainings abroad, thus improving both their competences in the English language and methodology or other educational fields being important in the 21st century.\r\nOur teacher trainings are varied and match the requirements of our modern school. Apart from developing competences among teachers, we also look after the modernization of our school library and work on setting up a new concept.
