The competition is sensed in almost all areas of the economy, particularly in the industry and subsequently in machine building sector.On the other side EU and the rest of the world are facing tremendous tragedies in fires accidents, ranging from hazardous plants fires up to tragic wildfires or forest fires.To respond to above mentioned specific threats several EU located SMEs partners from machine building sector supported by two outstanding RTDs put their efforts together to form a consortium and propose the innovative project that will create new, higher added value product that they can share in. Strategic overall objective of proposed project is to develop the prototype of the autonomous unmanned fire fighting vehicle that will be able to fight efficiently against fires in hazardous environments, particularly where men and firemen are highly jeopardized. Limitations and technical barriers of similar present product a relatively low fire exposure resistance, reduced operability in the conditions and environments of a low visibility and unreliable navigation possibilities The particular aim is to develop firefighting vehicle which will be able to enter into the heart of fires, operate and navigate reliable and recognize different objects, especially people, fight fire and remove flammable or dangerous materials. To overcome mentioned barriers and reach targeted performances, selected EU R&D organizations should help with the research and development activities in order to create the final product marketable in EU and worldwide. Novel scientific technological solution will overcome this barriers\u2019 by development of a new concept for vehicle high temperature resistance based on Intumescent, reflective materials, new thermo vision, pattern recognition system  and strapdown inertial navigation system supported by integrated GPS and IMU sensor.", 16003.0, 907458.0, "FIREROB", null, null, null, "http://www.firerob.info", null, null, "fp7_107630_999436106"]]}}, "outwardCode": "ML4"}
