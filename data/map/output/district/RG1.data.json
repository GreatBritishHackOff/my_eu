Micro Clouds will rely on novel extensions to operating systems and virtual machines, allowing for dynamic migration of threads or full virtual machines from one core to another. Finally, High Performance Clouds will balance highly dynamic workloads, aiming for full utilisation of the underlying platform but at the same time providing performance guarantees to selected applications.

Those systems are also called dependable systems, as our lives can depend on them. Examples are controllers in an airplane, breaking controller in a car, or a train control system. Those safety-critical systems need to be certified and the maximum execution time needs to be bounded and known so that response times can be assured when critical actions are needed. Even with high performance processors in our desktop PCs we notice once in a while that the PC is 'frozen' for a few seconds. For a safety-critical system such a 'pause' can result in a catastrophic failure.The mission of T-CREST is to develop tools and build a system that prevents pauses by identifying and addressing the causes for possible pauses. The T-CREST time-predictable system will simplify the safety argument with respect to maximum execution time striving to double performance for 4 cores and to be 4 times faster for 16 cores than a standard processor in the same technology (e.g., FPGA). Thus the T-CREST system will result in lower costs for safety relevant applications reducing system complexity and at the same time faster time-predictable execution.Standard computer architecture is driven by the following paradigm: make the common case fast and the uncommon case correct. This design approach leads to architectures where the average-case execution time is optimized at the expense of the worst-case execution time (WCET). Modelling the dynamic features of current processors, memories, and interconnects for WCET analysis often results in computationally infeasible problems. The bounds calculated by the analysis are thus overly conservative.We need a sea change and we shall take the constructive approach by designing computer architectures where predictable timing is a first-order design factor. For real-time systems we propose to design architectures with a new paradigm: make the worst-case fast and the whole system easy to analyse. Despite the advantages of analysable system resources, only a few research projects exist in the field of hardware optimized for the WCET.Within the project we will propose novel solutions for time-predictable multi-core and many-core system architectures.

Recent security trends stress continuous adaptation to increase attacker work factor and to confound reverse-engineering. Critical CI systems must undergo extensive and costly scrutiny under diverse certification regimes. Improved, effective and affordable development and certification methods are essential.\n\nCITADEL will provide innovative platform technology, methodology and tools for development, deployment, and certification of adaptive MILS systems for CI, to be demonstrated in three industrial CI use cases. The solution enables robust and resilient CI through monitoring and adaptive self-healing mechanisms that respond to natural and malicious occurrences by intelligently reconfiguring hosts, functions, and networks, while maintaining essential functions and defences.\n\nCITADEL is based on MILS, an approach featuring modular construction and compositional assurance, reducing the time and cost for development, certification, and maintenance of dependable systems. The MILS platform, based on a separation kernel, manages physical resources while establishing and enforcing a verified application architecture.\n\nLeveraging advances from the D-MILS and EURO-MILS projects, CITADEL will extend the MILS approach by adding dynamic reconfiguration to the MILS platform, and Monitoring and Adaptation Systems enabling resilience to adversity while preserving vital system properties.\n\nCITADEL supports certification of Adaptive MILS systems by analyzing configuration change mechanisms, adaptation system, configuration properties, and configuration change policies with automated verification tools, and by providing an innovative runtime evidence management agent to automatically generate up-to-date certification assurance artifacts as the system adapts.", 501775.0, 5260485.0, "CITADEL", null, null, null, null, "http://www.opengroup.org", null, "h2020_202704_999789283"], ["1AX", "Cross-Layer and Multi-Objective Programming Approach for Next Generation Heterogeneous Parallel Computing Systems", "X/Open Company Limited", "As today \u201cto out compute is to out compete\u201d, the position of Europe in all industrial sectors and societal challenges is highly depending on the technological progress in computing.

To that respect, PHANTOM wishes to deliver an economically and energetically sustainable solution for next generation computing systems, through a cross-layer design comprising reconfigurable multi-core and heterogeneous hardware platforms managed by a hardware-agnostic software platform that hides the complexity from the programmer and offers multi-dimensional optimization. Specifically, PHANTOM is structured in three layers. First, parallel programming and productivity tools are provided including application-driven APIs for programming and annotations, a parallelization toolset for maintaining intrinsically the code parallelization and model based testing techniques for early parallel program verification. Then, multi-dimensional optimization is addressed through an adaptive and multi-objective scheduler, deciding on where to execute each application component, which is supported by runtime monitoring/data analytics and security implementations. Last, low power, heterogeneous hardware platforms are built together with system software for enabling their management as a service. PHANTOM brings multi-disciplinary expertise through an ecosystem of academia, industries and a strong number of SMEs.

One of the most critical obstacles are the \u2018vertical silos\u2019 that shape today\u2019s IoT because they constitute a serious impediment to the creation of cross-domain, cross-platform and cross-organisational applications and services.

Such horizontal interoperability makes it possible to develop Systems of Systems where cross-domain information from platforms, devices and other information sources can be accessed when and as needed. bIoTope-enabled Systems can seamlessly exploit all available information, which makes them smart in the sense that they can take or propose the most appropriate actions depending on the current User\u2019s or Object\u2019s Context/Situation, and even learn from experience. bIoTope capabilities lay the foundation for open innovation ecosystems where companies can innovate both by the creation of new software components for IoT ecosystems, as well as create new Platforms for Connected Smart Objects with minimal investment.

The only currently available vaccine, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, is effective against severe childhood forms, but it demonstrates a variable efficacy against the pulmonary form of TB in adults. Many of these adult TB cases result from the reactivation of an initially controlled, latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection.  Effective prophylactic vaccination remains the key long-term strategy for combating TB. Continued belief in reaching this goal requires unrelenting innovation in the formulation and delivery of candidate vaccines.  It is also based on the assumption, that the failure of recent human vaccine trials could have been due to a sub-optimal vaccine design and delivery, and therefore should not erode the key principle that a TB vaccine is an attainable target. This proposal focuses on mucosal vaccination, which has been considered in the past, but not implemented efficiently. The innovation of the proposal is focused on several important aspects of vaccine development and testing, including the use of novel technologies for vaccine delivery, novel ways of specific targeting of mucosal immune cells and tissues, the use of polypeptides incorporating early and latent MTB antigens and putative CD8\\ T cell epitopes, and application of novel tools for identifying early predictors and correlates of vaccine-induced protection.
