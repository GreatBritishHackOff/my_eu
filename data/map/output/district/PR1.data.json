The portal provides activities to users that increase their meta-linguistic awareness about the bi- and multilingual use of sign languages. Specifically, we will exploit research data and analyses by translating them into a resource with educational units that support upskilling of deaf people in order to communicate remotely with signers of other sign languages. The MULTSIGN project had demonstrated that sign language users have a unique enhanced potential, compared to spoken languages, to communicate across language boundaries, and the project will enable signers to exploit this potential. The portal also provides a service for setting up flexibly adaptable bi- and multilingual online work spaces for transnational groups of sign language users, with an integrated tool for sign-to-sign-translation between different sign languages. This will enable disadvantaged deaf communities, who are largely isolated from international contact, to access developments and resources already available elsewhere among international deaf communities but not linguistically accessible. The project is a collaboration between an academic partner, the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) in the UK and a private company with special expertise in the relevant area, Dolphio Technologies, in Hungary.

Male National Teams in international tournaments have underachieved given levels of investment in the game\r\n2. European trained players are increasingly entering English/Welsh Senior teams instead of homegrown and very few English or Welsh players go into mainland Europe to play\r\n3. Of the top 100 training clubs (those producing players performing in the top European Leagues) only 3 are English and 0 are Welsh (CIES data) - Holland, Spain and France have the most representatives \r\n4. At 18 years of age only 40% the 675 apprentices attached to professional Football League Clubs will be offered a contract\r\n5.

Expose players/coaches to the philosophies and training environments which are producing players in Europe who are migrating to England/Wales \r\n2. Enable players/coaches to observe, experience, evaluate, improve and acquire new technical, tactical & physical skills/training techniques  \r\n3. Facilitate Personal/Professional Development of players/coaches and the acquisition of greater self-knowledge, new behaviours and attitudes, cultural awareness, employability and language skills\r\n4. Expand player/coach knowledge of labour market opportunities inside and outside of performance within Europe and encourage outward migration\r\n5. Challenge players/coaches to take responsibility for embedding acquired knowledge and learning in to their everyday environments and programmes\r\n6. Effect structural changes at the governing body level (Premier League/Football League/FA) and within the Apprenticeship framework based on European best practice\r\n      \r\nIn order to create learning and development opportunities for the above objectives the following activities are proposed:\r\n\r\n1. Two week training programme for 14 professional youth teams in Holland/Spain. \r\nApprentice players are aged 16-18 and undertaking the Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (ASE) programme. \r\nThis would give 280 apprentices an opportunity to learn and develop.  \r\n2.

This is a non-formal education project using heritage investigation through film as the medium to motivate and develop the skills and self-confidence of young Deaf people.\r\n\r\nThe majority of hearing societies across the EU (indeed across the world) fail to truly recognise Deaf people who use sign language as a first or preferred language positively as a cultural and linguistic minority group.  Deaf people face barriers in accessing many services and activities which hearing people access freely without barriers.\r\n\r\nDeaf people, their sign languages and their culture have a great deal to offer - not only to Deaf people, but also to hearing people and society. There is strength, pride, encouragement and enhanced positive self esteem to be had from meeting, working with and developing friendships with Deaf young people from other parts of the EU.  Learning about the lives of other EU citizens who are Deaf contributes to a greater sense of being European.\r\n\r\nThis application is based on our ongoing \"Signed Voices\" heritage project in the NW of England, which is all about capturing the Deaf Community\u2019s memories, experiences and contemporary values; showcasing them now, and preserving them for future generations. Exploring our own and others' heritage is a gateway to pride, respect and identity. Yet, most people do not know what \u201cDeaf Heritage\u201d means and are unaware that British Sign Language (BSL) is a complex language with its own grammar and art forms. Deaf people who use BSL have their own cultural and linguistic heritage. However, they have fewer opportunities than other native language groups in the UK to consider heritage.\r\n\r\nSigned Voices is an \u2018oral history project\u2019 with BSL at its core. It enables members of the Deaf Community to share their heritage with a wider community and creates a lasting legacy. Deafway works with Deaf volunteers to film memories and contemporary thoughts, in short semi-structured interviews \u2013 conducted in BSL by pairs of young people who decide their own interview topic. This culminates in a live celebration and reflection event and a final exhibition which will be available to tour.\r\n\r\nThis Erasmus+ project will extend the methodology, results and impact of Signed Voices to four other European countries (Estonia, Poland, Greece and Netherlands) while also helping us to extend the project within the UK.

The high percentage of underage beneficiaries requires the involvement of carefully selected group leaders who will play a key role in facilitating the socio-cultural integration in the host country and the supervision and monitoring of mobility activities.\r\nAs outlined in the European development Strategy, the Consortium members are committed to strengthen the internationalization process continuing in the promotion and implementation of international activities already undertaken.\r\nCurrently Two projects Erasmus + KA1-2016-1-KA102-005082 IT01 and IT01-016-1-KA102-005083 are currently being implemented, coordinated by CPV, which foresee 30-days mobility flows in 10 EU countries and are targeted, respectively, at 175 and 104 students of technical and professional institutes. The Consortium Institutes participate by sending students from different fields of study.\r\nIn order to connect the overall strategy of the school with the design of students\u2019 mobility schemes, training, tutoring activities, updating and job shadowing abroad through the participation of teaching staff will be promoted in the framework of Erasmus + KA1 and Learning event in eTwinning projects.\r\nCPV is likewise engaged in the:\r\n\u2022 support for the management of no.

Our expertise  through all these projects has been strengthened over the years and we have developped high quality tools (mobility passport, skills booklet...) to support better all participants in their project.\r\n\r\nThe goal of ADICE, and of the project, is to ensure the social and professional development of the learners (including those with fewer opportunities), by participating in a valuable mobility experience. ADICE considers the mobility experience as a tool allowing the development of technical, transverse and social skills which favors employment. \r\n\r\nThe project \u201cLUCIE: Learning Unique Competencies In Europe\u201d plans for two years, from the 1st of June 2017, the sending of 30 learners in vocational training, in mobility for purposes of learning, in the eligible countries of the European Union, planned in our partnership agreement: in United Kingdom, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Germany, Spain and Czech Republic. These mobility projects will be characterized by professional internships in companies or within non for profit organizations, and would last for 3, 6 or 10 months.\r\n\r\nThese placements will be organized and defined according to the experience, sector of activity, professional project, needs, expectations at short and long term and the profile of the participants. Indeed, ADICE\u2019s goal is to promote the European mobility, but also to fight against discriminations and to promote people with fewer opportunities at a social and professional level. Our public is diverse and so, our projects are, first of all, accessible to all local learners, without any discrimination, yet no level of studies is required or limited age, and also, characterized by destinations, durations, and various sectors of activity. They are fitted to the needs, objectives and profile of each person. Participants are supported with regard to all these criteria and on the motivation and relevance of the participant\u2019s personal and professional project. \r\n\r\nAt the level of the European partners, we work on one hand with intermediate structures which organize the mobility of the participants, and, thus, provide a support to the participants with more difficulties, and on the other hand, we work also more and more directly with host structures and companies. These structures are found, during the whole contract period, and especially selected for the mobility of a participant in specific areas. They also may have already hosted participant within their structure in past projects.\r\nOur partnership network is related to our internalization strategy. It is characterized by a geographical, linguistic and economic diversity a plurality of activities sectors adapted to every public (social, tourism, sale, communication, etc.) and of types of structures (companies, associations, training centers\u2026) Every partner, whether it is a direct structure or intermediate structure, is in charge of providing a quality placement (within its structure or one of its local partners), if possible the accommodation, and a support if the participant is facing difficulties (in the activities, with the team, social or cultural difficulties, or a problem linked to the security of the participant). Indeed, the partner has to provide a quality follow-up during the mobility, and a relevant and fitted evaluation at the end. The diversity of the partners allows us to offer a large panel of relevant opportunities to the participants\u2019 needs and careers. Thus, our international strategy aims at offering internships in companies as well as in associations, in a varied number of professional sectors and in a diversity of countries.\r\n\r\nRegarding the development at the European level, ADICE being a territorial actor of social and professional inclusion, our action plan is in complete relevance with the analysis of the needs at the territorial and sectorial level, but also for the public. Indeed, the Hauts-de-France area is very affected by unemployment, which rate is higher than other area and largely exceeding the national rate (12%, while 9.6% in metropolitan France data given by INSEE for the 2nd trimester 2016). Moreover, the city of Roubaix knows a high economic development, but the rate of unemployment stays high and affects 30.9% of the local population. \r\nWith mobility experience being an entrance to employment, it enables the development of new experiences, skills and opportunities to enrich the professional life, the project of ADICE is thus absolutely relevant at a local level, according to the territory priorities and background. Moreover, a project like this one, allows the development of the territory at a European level, the enlargement of the opportunities and network and the exchange and developpement of new skills among this local network, which is a real added value for our structure but also for the territory.", "http://www.ukworkplacement.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA116-035846_10"], ["6UY", "AUDACE+2", "UK Work Placement", 141272.0, "\u201cAUDACE+2\u201d is a mobility project led by a consortium, coordinated by the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Regional Council, the sending partners being P\u00f4le Emploi Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes and the 14 \u201cMissions Locales\u201d of the Auvergne. The consortium wishes to offer work placements in European companies for VET learners that experience difficulties in entering the job market.\r\n\r\nWithin the project, the consortium wishes to send 80 beneficiaries for 8-week work placements in European companies (Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, the United Kingdom). The beneficiaries are continuing VET learners who are not preparing for a diploma. These people encounter difficulties in entering the labour market and in managing their transition to working life. They are monitored by counsellors at P\u00f4le Emploi Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes and \u201cMissions locales\u201d (members of the consortium).\r\n\r\nThe main objectives for the VET learners are:\r\n1\u00b0 behaviour: motivation, autonomy, self-reliance, communication, social skills, mobility\r\n2\u00b0 professional: professional skills and competence, new professional techniques and practice, better knowledge of the world of enterprise;\r\n3\u00b0 linguistic and cross-cultural: practising a foreign language, discovering another European language, realising one's European citizenship, growing aware of one's own culture.\r\n\r\nTransversal skills - necessary for one's personal, social and professional fulfilment - are in the centre of the project for these two groups of VET learners, and this even prior to gaining professional skills as such. A pedagogical, linguistic and cultural preparation will take place before the mobility and there are language classes during the mobility period.\r\n\r\nAfter an open call for tenders, AFORMAC was chosen by the Regional Council to assist in the implementation of the project.\r\n\r\nThe 80 learners will leave in 6 groups of 14 people in average, in 3 different destinations among the following countries: Ireland, Italy, the UK, Portugal, Lithuania, Spain or Slovenia. The departures will take place every 3 months (except during the summer months).\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes for the VET learners include:\r\n- gaining professional, linguistic, cross-cultural and transversal skills;\r\n- re-establishing one's personal and professional project;\r\n- increased employability;\r\n- renewed interest in learning;\r\n- more active citizen involvement;\r\n- better capacity for geographical mobility on all levels: regional, national, European, or even international;\r\n- quicker access to better employment or to skills training/a diploma course.\r\n\r\nAll beneficiaries will receive a Europass Mobility on their return to certify the achieved learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nFinally, the potential longer term benefits of the project include:\r\n- pursuing the regional dynamic created amongst the members of the consortium of AUDACE mobility projects;\r\n- training of better quality for continuous VET trainees in Auvergne;\r\n- internationalisation of employment/training support structures;\r\n- more international activity both in sending and receiving regions.\r\n\r\nThe results will be disseminated through:\r\n- Europass awarding ceremonies in the presence of regional councillors and local press;\r\n- forums for international mobility, forums on employment, etc.;\r\n- articles in local newspapers;\r\n- presentations in reunions;\r\n- the newsletter of the \u00ab Auvergne Network for International Mobility \u00bb, the IODA network of the CARIF-OREF, social networks (\u201cAuvergne Mobilit\u00e9 Internationale\u201d on Facebook, Twitter).\r\n\r\nEvolution in the \u201cAUDACE+2\u201d project (2017-2019) in comparison to \u201cAUDACE+\u201d project (2015-2017): On 1st January 2016, the Auvergne Region and the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Region merged to form the new Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Region. Furthermore, a change in the political leadership took place at the same time.\r\nIn order to adapt to this new situation, we will focus efforts on the main group of beneficiaries of our project, described above. The experimentation that we had launched for the \u201cgroup 2\u201d (20 grants for 4-week work placements in European companies for continuing VET learners, enrolled in a regional training programme preparing beneficiaries for entering skills training or employment of the Auvergne Region) in the \u201cAUDACE+\u201d project currently going on (2015-2017) will not be renewed in 2017-2019. Indeed, it is uncertain whether the regional training programme in question will be maintained by the new Regional Council or not. Likewise, we will not apply this time for grants for mobilities of staff of the consortium member organisations. The \u201cAUDACE+2\u201d project for 2017-2019 thus returns to the line of the previous projects \u201cAUDACE\u201d 1 to 6 (2008-2015) within the Leonardo da Vinci programme.", "http://www.ukworkplacement.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA116-036153_7"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["2HE", "Engineering Innovation Centre (EIC)", "UCLAN", "This project will equate to 2,069m2 of floorspace resulting in 40 researchers working in improved research facilities .
