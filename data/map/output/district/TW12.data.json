This is (in part) due to the current manufacturing technologies that are based on subtractive processing that are expensive, wasteful and energy intensive, making manufacture in the EU economically and environmentally unfeasible. Printed electronics is set to revolutionise the electronics industry by enabling direct, additive processing that significantly reduces capital and operating costs as well as massively reducing process hazardous chemical waste and energy.\nCurrently the EU dominates the innovation and technological know-how in printed electronics. It is very important that this intellectual capital that Europe developed is translated to direct economic benefits by ensuring that manufacture is retained within the EU. However, there are barriers that are preventing widespread adoption of printed electronics including the availability of cost effective, high performance electronic inks, lack of awareness of end-users and lack of integration of individual printed components into large systems.\nPLASMAS directly builds on world-leading nano-materials, printing and display device technologies developed and patented by the consortium members. Our consortium is unique in that it covers the entire supply chain and also in terms of its ambition. PLASMAS directly addresses the current commercialisation barriers by demonstrating the capability of technology (based on novel copper and silicon inks with favourable cost to performance ratios) through development of printed circuit boards and printed logic as well as displays with printed copper and silicon-based back panels and established \u201cself-emissive\u201d OLEDs and \u201creflective\u201d low power Electro-Chromic elements. As a consequence of the limitations in the availability of printed silicon an emphasis will be put on the development of printed grid electrodes for OLEDs and OPV applications as well as printed R2R fabricated RFID antenna structures. The addressing of EC displays will be accomplished by using ECT based technology.

In particular, the wood coatings sector is facing a number of threats. The sector is coming under increasing pressure from low cost imports from Asia that have low solids content and subsequently poor durability. There is a need in Europe to maximise the use of timber as a sustainable resource within the built environment. For coated components including windows, doors and cladding this requires maximising service life and minimising maintenance costs. Wood coatings have themselves undergone considerable change in response to environmental and other legislation and require substantial testing to establish or predict service life across different wood species and climatic zones. The pace of development and potential long life of modern coatings means that real life durability data will not be available when new products are brought to the market place and this creates a risk which affects SME joinery manufacturers and applicators. Ultimately it will also affect the downstream customer and consumers who in the absence of credible guarantees may use less sustainable substrates for components, such as uPVC or Aluminium.

EU industrial wood product manufacturers are coming under increased competition from imports and are looking to reduce their costs. About 11% of industrial wood products in the EU are coated with UV curable coatings, which contain zero VOCs and are fast curing. UV LED lamps, which emit near-UV radiation, are 60-80% more energy efficient than conventional UV lamps and have environmental, health and safety benefits, but UV LED cured coatings cure much slower than coatings cured with traditional UV lamps, even under an inert atmosphere. The technological objective of the UVLED project is to enable UV coatings to cure using UV LED lamps at the same rate as conventional UV curing, without the need for an inert atmosphere. Our approach is to prepare new, high efficiency near-UV photoinitiator packages, by developing novel silicon- and germanium-based photoinitiators and new chemical methods of overcoming oxygen inhibition. As a result of the UVLED project, we expect to improve our collective competitiveness and generate increased sales of coating and equipment products into the EU industrial wood products market of at least \u20ac106M over a 5 year period. In addition, we estimate that an end-user with just one UV curing unit would save about \u20ac13K in energy costs per year, compared to the use of conventional UV curing lamp systems.

There is growing evidence that maternal obesity increases the long term risk of CVD, T2D and neurodegenerative morbidity in the offspring. This project will clarify if and to what extent maternal obesity leads to premature and unhealthy ageing, by causing early, i.e. pre-/perinatal metabolic and genetic vulnerability, starting from insulin resistance and glucocorticoid exposure, leading to oxidative-stress, telomere/DNA damage, epigenetic changes, interacting with genetic and environmental variability, resulting in altered gene expression/repair, and ultimately in disease during life and pathological ageing. We will investigate the postulated mechanisms during pregnancy and development, their life long consequences in animal models and in large human cohorts followed from prenatal life until ageing, and the possibility to intervene when the condition is still reversible.

Babies born to obese mothers are exposed to perturbed insulin levels due to the mothers' insulin resistance, which could increase the long-term risk for developing cardiovascular disease, diabetes or neurodegenerative conditions.\n\nAdditional evidence shows that the placenta in obese mothers expresses higher levels of pro-inflammatory molecules, and combined with pathological glucocorticoid exposure babies could suffer from greater birth weight and blood pressure. However, studies linking the gestational period with adult health are limited.\n\nTo this end, the EU-funded 'Developmental origins of healthy and unhealthy ageing: The role of maternal obesity' (http://www.dorian-fp7.eu (DORIAN)) project wishes to improve our understanding of the basic early developmental mechanisms that impact health in later life. In order to delineate the impact of maternal obesity on offspring health and ageing, the study will focus on various parameters such as insulin resistance, glucocorticoid exposure and oxidative stress, and how these could interact with genetic and environmental factors to promote disease.\n\nEpidemiological analysis of existing birth cohorts has so far unravelled an association between maternal body mass index (BMI) and offspring BMI as well as diabetes development. Interestingly, this relationship was prominent in women and not men. In contrast, men of low birth weight born to obese mothers showed a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\n\nActivation of the glucocorticoid stress response in the adult offspring was another significant side-effect of obese pregnancy in non-clinical models.

These stakeholders included nano-medical researchers, physicians, patients, and policy-makers.\n\nThe round table identified the need for reliable data to predict the economic impact of nano-medicine on healthcare costs and benefits, as well as on market growth. This enables the European Medicines Agency to take strategic decisions early on. It also allows national governments to manage finances more efficiently.\n\nIn addition, the project concluded that a proactive regulatory system is required for better coordination and harmonisation of regulatory procedures. This would involve dialogue with users and stakeholders at early stages of research and developing, and account for the economic cost implications of regulation. The project has outlined who is best fit to play this role.\n\nLastly, the round table has identified 45 different types of products based on nano-medicine that are already on the market. The policy recommendations emerging from this exercise can serve as a timely and substantial response to the need for genuine engagement and involvement of all the key stakeholders (public and private) in the nano-medical field.\n\nNow that nano-medicine has become a reality, the results of this project will prepare the groundwork for optimised, collective decision making at the European level.", null, "http://www.hayhurstmedia.com", "/docs/results/images/2011-01/46272.jpg", "fp7_88912_998597832"], ["1NJ", "Evidence-based ICT tools for weight loss maintenance", "European Association for the Study of Obesity", "Most adults who try to lose weight fail to maintain it. Obesity is a key economic and healthcare challenge for Europe. Effective interventions and commercial programmes for weight loss are widely available, but most people re-gain their lost weight. Currently few comprehensive solutions exist to help Europeans manage weight loss maintenance (WLM).\nCurrent research suggests the most promising evidence-based behaviour change techniques for WLM are self-monitoring, goal setting, action control, building self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation. Recent research also suggests that stress management and emotion regulation skills are key enablers of relapse prevention and weight-regain.\n\nInformation technology offers attractive tools for teaching and supporting these techniques, some of which are currently delivered through resource-intensive face-to-face therapies. ICT-delivery includes networked-wireless tracking technologies, weighing-scales and activity sensors, online tools and smart-phone apps, multi-media resources and internet-based support. A broad choice of tools is most likely to be acceptable to users, who can pick and choose their own preferred technologies. \nThe NoHoW project tests whether ICT-based delivery of the most promising evidence-based behavior change techniques is effective for WLM. We will carry out a large-scale international 3-centre trial of information technology tools that implement the most up-to-date behavioural science research. This trial will establish the effectiveness of these ICT tools in supporting WLM, linked to studies of European consumer needs and behaviour.\n\nImpact: The project will directly feed results into development of new products and services from the UK\u2019s largest commercial weight-loss provider, Slimming World providing immediate benefit to 500,000\\ consumers.

Many triggering effects make ESL a complex multisector phenomenon: school failure (disengagement, low achievement, transition between schools and school levels), pull effects from labour market, social and family situation. If it differs from country to country and from region to region, there are some recurrent features: children from vulnerable groups are more likely than others to leave the school system early. Boys are more affected than girls.\r\nThanks to the constant work on drop out preventive and intervention measures carried out by all TO_YOU TOO YOUNG TO FAIL partners, the partnership has pinpointed the need  to FOCUS ON A SPECIFIC AGE FRAMEWORK (10-15 years\u2013 including both Middle school, and moments of transition between school levels) in a broad number of regions, to tackle the issue, and potentially intervene when the problem starts arising. TO_YOU leading idea is that, if the causes of school failure and dropout can have roots in the pre-teen years, middle school - a potentially powerful learning time \u2013 becomes a critical \u201cmake or break\u201d period.\r\nTO_YOU has identified 3 core needs and objectives and designed associated actions.\r\nNeed 1 - to\r\n- provide a cross-sectorial platform of exchange of experiences and practices between partners with excellence initiatives in this area and of different backgrounds and missions,  thus fostering a mutual learning process. \r\n- grant access to a wide menu of consolidated comprehensive and cross sectorial prevention and intervention strategies tailored on the specified age group (best practice collection \u2013 innovative feature). \r\n- promote focused research on the broad issue of relationship/ social capital (peer-to-peer relationship, school leadership and family engagement) and on its potential impact on drop out measures (innovative feature). \r\nNeed 2\r\nThe school cannot and must not address independently the broad range of social, emotional and personal needs that affect the academic performance of children. A process is needed for the school and community to avoid isolation, develop a common vision, and build long lasting commitment and collaboration from policy makers, society, family and other stakeholders.\r\nA first important step in building such cohesive vision is to provide institutions' leaders with the essential content knowledge and materials necessary to develop successful school/community collaborations (reliable, flexible, adaptable and appealing  awareness raising /advocacy tools)\r\nNeed 3\r\nNeed for a continuous professional development and empowerment of teachers and school management, need for school staff to gain a deep understanding of ESL, enhance awareness on their own role in preventing it and to develop the skills to work with other professions and partners, in a \u201cwhole school approach\u201d (design, development, testing and sharing of specific training modules and support multimedia tools)\r\nThe two level focus on management/strategy (advocacy tools for school leadership) and education/ pedagogical tools (teachers/educators) represents an innovative feature.\r\nAnother innovative element of the project is the type of partnership. All 9 partners have a sound regional experience in tackling early drop out. 2 have furthermore participated in ESL related EU projects.\r\n TO_YOU brings together players with different backgrounds, missions (4 schools, 1 municipality, 2 non profit foundations, 1 employers association, 1 higher education body), geographic and social focus (IT, NL, ES, PT, UK).\r\n Moreover most partners have the means to share project outcomes with a significant number of local school communities, and stakeholders (e.g. public administrations, foundations/donors, education practitioners, academia and other stakeholders), well beyond the project boundaries.\r\nAll 4 schools (IT, UK, PT, NL) have experience in dealing with drop-out preventive and intervention schemes and are currently involved in relevant projects wit very different social, geographical and cultural contexts (ranging from excellence situations to highly critical environments). All school projects address the identified relevant age bracket. In TO_YOU the schools will play a strategic role in the definition of research/ advocacy needs and topics, training priorities and multimedia tools design. \r\nThe 2 non profit foundations (IT, PT) the municipality (NL) and Politecnico (PT) have an extensive, sound experience in supporting complex educational projects in specific geographical school/educational contexts, in line with their overall mission of fostering the implementation of sustainable and innovative educational models.\r\nThey will associate with the teachers employers association (ES) to ensure that the expected impact will be granted beyond the project time/geographic boundaries and also in non strictly school related contexts (e.g. donors, public administrations, research & academia.", "http://www.hamptonhill.richmond.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-IT02-KA201-003609_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TW12"}
