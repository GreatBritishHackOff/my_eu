Starting with efficient fulfilment of various customer demands the red line goes along efficient utilization of Big Data sources, present knowledge and critical new knowledge foreseen as outcomes from this project.\nTechnical development and mechanization has been a winning concept for high productivity now emphasizing more gentle methods and just in time deliveries to different industry customers. This is possible to reach if new knowledge, improved methods and technical development are combined with better transfer of information and data from different sources (e.g processes, geo data from LiDAR scanning, other conditions such as weather data etc).These Big Data sources have been available for some years, but it is not until recently that hardware, data communication and merging possibilities enable full potential for a revolution of new applications. \nIn the EFFORTE proposal we have identified three main subjects that have specific importance for efficiency, productivity and environmental concern in forest practice. Two of these implies to increasing crucial knowledge and the third, Big Data applications, combines the new knowledge with high resolution information sources into practice increasing efficiency in forest management and the connected value chains. The main objectives of EFFORTE are: i) To develop scientifically firm and techno-economically feasible methodology to predict trafficability prior to forest operations. ii) To increase forest growth and productivity of tree planting and young stand management iii) To develop, customize and pilot modern \u2018Big data\u2019 solutions that will increase productivity and decrease negative environmental impact (e.g. soil, water and reduced fuel consumption).

In East Dunbartonshire Council all schools have made language learning a priority on school improvement plans and for Lenzie Meadow Primary this is also on the cluster improvement plan. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to further improve the language skills of 6  teachers at Lenzie Meadow Primary and make them aware of current culture and teaching methods through attending immersion courses in France and Spain. At Lenzie Meadow Primary staff have already participated in local authority PLL (Primary Language Learning) training for French as this will be the language 2 for all pupils in the school. All staff have highly evaluated the PLL training but have identified further training needs in this area. The introduction of Spanish as a second additional language for pupils in primaries 5, 6 and 7 means that staff are also required to be able to deliver lessons in Spanish. Training needs have been identified in order to take this forward as part of the cluster improvement plan. \r\n\r\nThe immersion courses will give all teachers the opportunity to acquire new language skills in real contexts, engage in professional dialogue with fellow teachers and discover for themselves aspects of life and culture in France and Spain. The teachers will return to school with renewed confidence and enthusiasm for teaching modern languages and embedding them within the school's curriculum.\r\n\r\nA high level of impact is envisaged from this project because of the potentially large number of staff involved and the opportunity to more fully embed language learning into daily routines and classroom contexts when the teachers return. High quality learning experiences will be planned within and beyond the classroom and opportunities to further develop existing links with schools through eTwinning will be taken. For the teachers involved there will be increased levels of confidence and competence which will in turn have a positive impact on pupils and other staff.  Both language learning and adopting an international outlook will be seen as something which should be valued and embraced by the pupils and all staff in Lenzie Meadow Primary and the wider community.", "http://www.lenziemeadow.e-dunbarton.sch.uk/", "Lenzie Meadow Primary", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035430_coordinator"], ["1NX", "Romania EVS/LD", "Zone Out Partnership", 147329.0, "This project wants to provide  long term placements of 3 months to 3 participants  from Romania.   After these volunteers return to their own countries another set of 3 volunteers will  then come to Scotland for the next 3 months  ensuring that within the 2 years of the project  we have total no of vols 24  participants  from Romania. \r\n\r\nThere are two 6 week components for the EVS volunteers. The first involves them working in the safe supported environment of our  social enterprise garden  project which provides placements to those with a intellectual impairment. This garden center provides opportunities  around horticulture and the environment as well as animal care. For example volunteers will assist with planting and growing flowers and vegetables, designing the flower display beds, daily maintenance of the plants and flowers or feeding and grooming the hens, goats and sheep. In addition the volunteers can have an opportunity to serve customers either in the garden shop or the cafe and can, if appropriate assist in the kitchen preparing food. Volunteers would be assisted in traveling to and from this placement. Within this placement the mentor would provide both individual 1-1 support and small group work support.\r\nThe second  component is working in the Zone Out main office  along side volunteers some of who do not have an intellectual impairment. There are three  options here ; working with groups of Zone out volunteers providing fun based activities to groups of adults experience with a learning disability,  working with groups to provide peer training on issues such as smoking , knife crime etc, and working in our charity shop for several hours a day serving customers and dealing with donations. Ideally we would look to start the individual within the supported volunteering environment and have an individual plan in place for them to move on to the second  more independent placement where they have less support and eventually  have to make their own way to the volunteer placement. Clearly however each volunteer will be different and the 3 months placement will be devised so that they are challenged but not overwhelmed. For some this will mean progressing from one project to the other, for others it may mean staying for 3 months within the supported volunteer placement whilst for others they may bypass the initial placement and mover straight to the less supported placement.", null, "Zone Out Partnership", "erasmus_2017-3-UK01-KA105-046568_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1NH", "Lead Partner Management", "East Dunbartonshire Council", "Strategic Intervention management, administration and compliance.", "ESF", 63763.2, 159408.0, "esf_scotland_171"], ["1NH", "Employability Pipeline (East Dunbartonshire)", "East Dunbartonshire Council", "The operation will provide a new employability pipeline for the area and ill specifically target stages 1-4 and will have a common pathway for clients with multiple barriers that support employability and skills in response to local labour market needs.", "ESF", 289063.2, 722658.0, "esf_scotland_172"], ["1NH", "Youth Employment Initiative - East Dunbartonshire", "East Dunbartonshire Council", "Supporting young unemployed people aged 16-29 into education, training and employment", "ESF", 134000.0, 200000.0, "esf_scotland_243"]]}}, "outwardCode": "G66"}
