Thus, RLW Navigator will crucially serve as an enabler for future energy efficient smart factories. RLW is emerging as a promising joining technology for sheet metal assembly due to benefits on several fronts including reduced processing time, (50-75%) and decreased factory floor footprint (50%), reduced environmental impact through energy use reduction (60%), and providing a flexible process base for future model introduction or product change. Currently, RLW systems are limited in their applicability due to an acute lack of systematic ICT-based simulation methodologies to navigate their efficient application in automotive manufacturing processes. The project aims to address this by developing a Process Navigator simulation system that will deal with three key challenges thereby allowing manufacturers to utilize the advantages of the RLW system.Firstly, the most critical obstacle that currently prevents the successful implementation of RLW is the need for tight dimensional control of part-to-part gap during joining operations, essential to ensure the quality of the stitch.Secondly, the existing assembly system architecture must be reconfigured to provide the opportunity to evaluate the RLW system in terms of its feasibility to perform all required assembly tasks. This will provide crucial information about the most advantageous workstation/cell reconfiguration, which will serve as the basis for optimal robot path planning to reduce joining process time and workstation level efficiency assessment.Finally the project will develop systematic evaluation and learning methods to assess and improve the overall performance, cost-effectiveness and eco-efficiency of the RLW system.", 86510.0, 5416569.0, "RLW Navigator", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_100030_966988442"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1RD", "Kokapstr\u0101des ra\u017eo\u0161anas apm\u0101c\u012bbas meto\u017eu pilnveido\u0161ana prak\u0161u vad\u012bt\u0101jiem", "Severnvale Academy Limited", 7710.0, "The timber industry has a special role in the Latvian economy , which has been one of the main drivers of export.

As regards our catering training more particularly, it is been fifteen years since the establishment started its actions towards a programme of international oriented development on a European level. The three-year establishment project is focused on international axes mainly for 2015-2016. Lannion being located within an area with a strong touristic activity, it is of the responsibility of the training establishments to get the necessary means to increase the language attractiveness and exchanges with foreign countries in order to make our students improve their skills. Besides, our establishment is a catering and hospitality vocational school which on the one hand aims at making our students enter the local labour market world- students in a face-to-face relationship with foreign customers, and on the other hand it aims at enabling them to have an access to positions abroad.The project mainly focuses on the professional mobility of the learners from the Technological option (Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel). During eight weeks, the students are immersed into a company and take part in its daily activities. As regards the corporate training, our students have to attend it but this has a more important meaning since it takes place in the United-Kingdom, Spain or Sweden. In line with this approach, a programme is also planned for our school teachers so that they can remobilise their language skills and live a cultural experience linked to the country and language they are in charge of teaching.The skills acquired during mobilities abroad will be fully reinvested first in the profit of the students\u2019 daily training in relation with their final training cycle. Moreover, the fact of enclosing that experience in the curriculum vitae reinforces the company interest during its recruitment as regards the application study of the students who don\u2019t have much work experience. For the learners who are planning to study at University the acquired skills will constitute serious assets during the file selection in the post-graduation admission procedure. As far as language teaching is concerned and in European section their acquired fluency removes any apprehension when they speak, the effects are immediate and and have an exceptional impact\u2026Last years\u2019 experiences show that mobility strengthens these skills for a long-lasting period and with efficiency.
