This is because SCC requires a substantial quantity of fine powder to give the concrete the necessary cohesion to achieve its flowing properties, and prevent segregation.

The group of participants will have at their disposal a Coacher, a Placement Coordinator, a Company Tutor and a Mobility Manager.\r\nThere will be 3 flows, of which 2 groups for Spain with 6 participants + 1 Accompagning person and 1 for the UK - 7 Participants + 1 Accompanying person. The flows will be of 46 days, in the fields of broadcasting, media and visual sector. The mobility is preceded by a period of training in Italy. The admission requirements: to have completed secondary education, age between 18 and 29 years, inclusive, possibly to be enrolled in one of our VET courses, mainly residents in the province of Chieti or in other neighboring provinces of Abruzzo.  They should be willing and able to spend 46 days abroad and open\r\n to learn new skills. \r\nThe Accompagning Person will be present for the first week of the mobility period and together with the Placement Coordinator will monitor and check that all the learning outcomes of the participant are achieved. Each participant gets ECVET credits at the end of the placement, these can be used in other VET courses at EQF level 3. At the end of the placement the skills and competences are registered in the Regional personal assessment booklet as per D.lgs. 13/13 and the ECVET credits are registered in the Europass Mobility Certificate.\r\nWe want to create professional vloggers who are aware of their skills and professionalism and are able to enhance their work chances, reducing, thus, youth unemployment and creating new job opportunities. The foreign experience also encourages collaboration between different countries and the value of European citizenship.\r\nThe project promotes collaboration between the different agencies and also offers a period of training for the staff, with job-shadowing. The hope is to also create skilled staff who are comparable to the different European training systems and create new training programmes and projects in the future, where the inclusion of cultures, religions, socio-cultural aspects and needs of the labour market are based on the innovative training methods.\r\nThe impact on the territory is expected to be on different levels, producing benefits to the participants, their families, the place where they live and training institutions, and therefor will contribute to the understanding of the importance of life long learning and the benefits of European citizenship.", "http://www.wlv.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005794_6"], ["4EX", "Learning hospitality in Europe by undergoing a VET traineeship", "Cafe Maxsim", 304309.0, "Over the past 20 years, the technical and vocational education has been subject to numerous reforms and changes that had weakened the training offer. Add to this the phenomenon of widespread Italic \"genericism\" that, pushing students towards a choice of extensive and generic studies, is actually the main reason of demotivation towards studies and school drop-out.\r\n\r\nThese elements move in contrast with the needs of the labor market for technical-professional and in particular in tourism and hotel sector.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the demand for labor, in conjunction with the technological development and competitiveness of the market, requires increasingly specific skills and the same employers recognize that the preparation of the staff coming out of the training course is not always adequate.\r\n\r\nTo complete the picture, it is estimated that in the near future, at the conclusion of the current economic crisis, the demand for labor will greatly increase, with particular reference to its technical and professional fields\r\n\r\nIn this context the institutes IFOM, Varalli, Bertarelli and Besta have found the common need to compensate the mismatch between training offer and the needs of enterprises, reducing the mismatch between demand and supply of labor, reduce early school leaving and improving integration between schools and business.\r\n \r\nThe realization of this general objective goes through the achievement of the following specific objectives:\r\n\r\n- For students, to strengthen their professional skills, transversal and personal, enhancing their career prospects and their motivation, creating a sense of entrepreneurship, emancipation, European and intercultural awareness;\r\n\r\n- For the staff involved, to improve their professional and linguistic skills, to understand the practices related to the world of education and its links with the world of work, to understand the social, linguistic and cultural differences, to increase the ability to address the needs of the most disadvantaged and to strengthen the capacity to sustain their motivation to work;\r\n\r\n- For the organizations involved, to learn to operate internationally, to understand how to provide the most stimulating educational activities, to create a modern and dynamic working environment, to develop activities good for the whole civil society.\r\n \r\nFor this reason, the project \"Learning in hospitality Europe by undergoing a traineeship VET\" promotes the development of internships abroad for students of the consortium schools.\r\n\r\n The project includes two activities:\r\n1) Mobility of 92 students and 16 escorts for an internship abroad lasting one month;\r\n2) Mobility of 20 neo-graduates for an internship abroad lasting 10 weeks\r\nThe activities will take place from 01.06.2017 until 31.01.2019 and includes the selection and preparation of students, the organization of the mobilities, activities abroad, evaluations, dissemination and follow-up activities.\r\nThe consortium plans to include in mobility 8 students with special needs, in detail students with DSA or BES.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the proposed actions will be wide and will involve multiple levels of recipients in direct and indirect manner:\r\n\r\nstudents:\r\n- Competitiveness on the labor market;\r\n- Improving their social skills;\r\n- The acquisition of transversal skills (self-esteem, responsibility, ability to take tasks, ...) will also bring benefits to emancipation and employability;\r\n- Peers of the students are indirect beneficiaries, through the experiences of the participants in the action.\r\n\r\nTeachers:\r\n- The renewed interest in teaching will bring greater efficiency in learning of the students;\r\n- Sharing a common experience with the students will produce a greater understanding of their difficulties and more effective communication between teachers and students;\r\n- A better understanding of the labor market in Europe will offer more precise knowledge in supporting the education of students.\r\n\r\nSchools:\r\n- Increased ability to manage projects;\r\n- Increased understanding of the training gaps of students who are entering the world of work;\r\n- Development of ECVET as tools for the recognition and validation of students' Learning Outcomes;\r\n- Increased understanding of the tourist business processes in Europe;\r\n- Increased ability to intervene on motivation and orientation of students, particularly those with fewer opportunities;\r\n- Increased competitiveness of vocational schools, compared to other training institutions, crediting the institutions involved at the local level;\r\n- Refinement of the offer of training based on the skills and specific needs of the students, thanks to new contacts with foreign companies;\r\n- Training of students in line with market requirements;\r\n- Increased internationalization of training institutions, in line with European standards of education.\r\n\r\n During the project, the Europe Direct Regione Lombardia will disseminate the project among

Volunteers selected will come from Spain, Germany, France, Italy and Portugal.\r\n\r\nThey will be young people who have:\r\n\u2022 Capacity and passion for involvement in activities with women and children who have been affected by domestic abuse\r\n\u2022 Willingness to improve their communication skills and social skills as well as their initiative, enthusiasm and creativity\r\n\u2022 Values and ideals of solidarity, social cohesion and European identity.\r\n\u2022 Sensitive to gender equality and equal opportunities\r\n\r\nORGANISATION OVERVIEW/ ACTIVITIES\r\nSet up in 1973, The Haven Wolverhampton is a local, registered charity which provides safe, temporary, emergency accommodation and support services to women and dependent children affected by domestic abuse and homelessness. \r\n\r\nEVS will be encouraged to volunteer across a range departments, being able to develop different roles and boost their skills whilst gaining work experience supporting vulnerable women and children and learning how the UK Charity sector operates. This will take place through a structured programme that will be tailored according to the applicant\u2019s motivations, experience and skills.\r\n\r\nEVS volunteers will be expected to undertake specific roles relating to the YIA project. This will include raising awareness of cultural aspects from their home country, sharing good practices and delivering activities to empower women with a view to promote gender equality and anti-discriminatory practices among others. Example of the activities carried out by the volunteers are: \r\n\r\nRefuge support\r\nChildren\u2019s Services\r\nCommunity Advocacy Team\r\nHelpline\r\nSupport services: Fundraising, Finance, Volunteer Service, HR, etc.\r\n\r\nMethodology: formal and non-formal learning methods\r\n\r\nBenefits to the volunteer:\r\n\u2022 Professional experience supporting vulnerable women and children which will complement their CV\r\n\u2022 Develop network connections\r\n\u2022 Accredited training in awareness of domestic abuse and related issues\r\n\u2022 Personal development (Build confidence, self-belief and assertiveness)\r\n\u2022 Develop transferable skills such as IT, team work, communication and interpersonal skills, appreciation of other cultures and interests\r\n\u2022 Enhanced level of English through formal and in-situ learning\r\n\u2022 Better understanding of the UK Charity Sector\r\n\u2022 Positive professional reference upon volunteering completion\r\n\u2022 Certificates of achievement including Youth pass. \r\n\u2022 Make friends/ become an inspirational role model to other volunteers and service users\r\n\u2022 Improved employability\r\n\r\nThe project will benefit the volunteers, as well as the local community and the partners involved. For the volunteers, the project will encourage them to develop new skills, gain more confidence, to take responsibility for their own actions and decisions, provide a space to develop their skills and use their strengths for the benefit of the whole community.

An international experience contributes to more security on the labour market. To live, work in an international multidisciplinary environment offers students the opportunity to gain knowledge of innovation and will ask for a flexible and independent attitude. Increasing understanding of (people in) other cultures and the flexibility to adapt to their attitude. Nova believes that this experience contributes to job security and personal growth of its students and staff. The work experience in the framework of vocational training is valuable and a must. That it takes place abroad is another valuable addition of the potential of the student and the employee.\r\nThe planned number of students who will carry out an international experience (internship) during this project is 583. The number of staff is 95. It involves students and staff from the entire width of the Nova College. 3 X 16 day projects in Sweden, France and Austria, are the three projects that will take place in less than 30 days (or more) projects. \r\nNote: In previous applications we applied for about 50 of our Cosmo students. Nova College has decided, because of the financial  compensation and room and meals these students receive in the host country, this group will no longer be eligible for any reimbursement of Erasmus +. Where necessary and possible, the project group internationalisation will look for other resources. \r\n\r\nThe starting point is to be performed in the Test of Proficiency core tasks and work processes in the relevant qualification file. Core tasks and work processes have been translated and are extensively discussed with the international organization or companies. In the Economics Unit, all trials and portfolio assignments are written in English in partnership with IVS Alliance and the Practice Learning Foundation. In the shorter projects, the internship plan needs to meet the criteria of the curriculum \r\nWith the receiving partner the project is discussed and looked at in feasibility and the guidance that will be offered. Upon returning achieved competences are checked and added to measured competences.\r\nThe learning agreement, the aptitude test and the associated program will be discussed with a representative of the host institution. Comments of the company will be discussed (for example, following evaluations of previous experience) and can lead to adjustments.\r\n\r\nAll students of Nova College must of course comply with the conditions of Erasmus + which has become evident in the process. \r\nThe students are supervised by teachers from Nova College who will stay in contact with them by phone, email, Skype and visits. Abroad an intermediary will often arrange the initial assistance to the students, see to their placement in companies for practical vocational training and to their monitoring, of course in consultation with Nova College. The intermediary will, in many cases ensure our students\u2019 housing and is the closest contact in case of emergencies. The intermediary will be in close contact with the teachers / unit officers of Nova College. Also almost all students will be visited during their stay abroad. The frequency of these visits will be determined by the period abroad; long term or short term.\r\nWithin internships performed in the past, the focus was mainly on students of levels 3 and 4 with a single side step to level 2. In this project from different disciplines, more level two students will be offered to participate in work placement abroad. For example, in the health department, a visit is planned to Spain with a 2nd grade level class. The group will be divided into three separate groups in three different institutions. The students and teachers will be job shadowing, cooperate and live in the environment of the institution en the people who work and live there.  This pilot project will be extended hopefully in future projects. \r\nWithin the Tech department, in 2017 study trips from 2 to 3 weeks for Level  2 students will be organized in relation to the \"optional part\" of internationalization (keuzedelen). Also, level 2 students will join the pop up schools within the excellence program. \r\nIn 2017 the sports department will organize an intensive program of two weeks where students and teachers will participate in. Participating countries are Japan, Spain, Turkey, Italy and Germany. The plan is to organize this as an alternating annual program, also in 2018.\r\nThis application also includes students from the Maritime academy. It concerns a group of students at levels 3 and 4 within the training Merchant Marine Officer small / all ships.\r\nWithin the program of excellence in internationalization the pop up school program will be expanded with at least one new project in Sweden. \r\nThe planning is to expand the existing network.
