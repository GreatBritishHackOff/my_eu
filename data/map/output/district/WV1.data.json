The full benefits of SCC are far from being exploited. One of the main reasons for this is its high materials costs (one and half times) compared to conventional concrete.  This is because SCC requires a substantial quantity of fine powder to give the concrete the necessary cohesion to achieve its flowing properties, and prevent segregation.
