Recent documents stress the necessity of testing the clinical utility (in terms of risk prediction, diagnosis validity and prognostic significance) of the existing definition of frailty by using combinations of clinical criteria (current definition) and lab Biomarkers (BMs).\nWe will measure the levels of blood and urine omic-based BMs in old people selected from eight cohorts, which include up to 75,000 participants, using standardized and innovative technology (WP1). This figure will allow us to test the research questions with a high power and validity. Combining these lab BMs with clinical BMs, we will develop predictive, diagnostic and prognostic models (WP2), with its modulation by nutrition and physical activity, in general old population and in old people showing some characteristics that confer a high risk for developing frailty (selected cardiovascular risk factors and diseases) (WP4).

Practically, the project website will provide an exchange of scientifically validated data templates, to assist SMEs to pass the right questions to their suppliers. Carbon Footprints are a perfect entry point for SMEs to LCA strategies. Thus, implementation of an SME-compatible PCF methodology is a key element of the project.

The reasons for this include the costs and expertise required to run the LCA studies. However, the project aims to tackle these issues and devise methods and tools for sectors such as bio-based plastics, industrial machinery, electronics, renewable energy, sensors and smart textiles. These sectors were chosen since manufacturers showed a keen interest in demonstrating to SMEs how they can reduce their environmental impact.\n\nWith access to free web tools, SMEs will be able to see how their needs can be met and make full use of the technology available to them. These include key environmental performance indicators (KEPIs) for smart textiles and a product carbon footprint (PCF) based on technology parameters of printed circuit boards. Building on the findings from the survey, customised approaches by sector are under way. For example, in smart textiles, developers, designers and business executives of SMEs can take advantage of a two-step approach based on ready-made LCA data and a fast-track LCA approach. This will allow the calculation of the environmental performance of materials, at the energy and life-cycle stages.\n\nThese approaches are regarded as the perfect entry point for SMEs to LCA strategies, so devising a compatible tool for SMEs will be a key element.

The rapidly increasing aged population in EU also places a huge burden on governments and health care systems that are not adequately equipped to meet their needs.\n\nWHYWEAGE is an initiative established to identify areas of research for better understanding of molecular mechanisms of ageing and for finding solutions to improve quality of life. Twelve successful workshops were held with participants from 21 European countries, including industrial stakeholders along with scientists to provide technical and commercial perspective. Topics such as 'biomarkers of ageing', 'oxidative stress, protein damage and protein maintenance', vascular ageing, 'sarcopenia, muscle weakness and physical exercises', and 'clinical biogerontological studies' were addressed.\n\nDeficits in knowledge and technology were identified and research areas were prioritised based on criticality of intervention.
