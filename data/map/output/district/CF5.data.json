Disability is usually preceded by a condition named frailty that encompasses changes associated with ageing, life styles and chronic diseases. To detect and intervene on it is of outstanding importance to prevent disability, as recovery from disability is unlikely. Recent documents stress the necessity of testing the clinical utility (in terms of risk prediction, diagnosis validity and prognostic significance) of the existing definition of frailty by using combinations of clinical criteria (current definition) and lab Biomarkers (BMs).\nWe will measure the levels of blood and urine omic-based BMs in old people selected from eight cohorts, which include up to 75,000 participants, using standardized and innovative technology (WP1). This figure will allow us to test the research questions with a high power and validity. Combining these lab BMs with clinical BMs, we will develop predictive, diagnostic and prognostic models (WP2), with its modulation by nutrition and physical activity, in general old population and in old people showing some characteristics that confer a high risk for developing frailty (selected cardiovascular risk factors and diseases) (WP4). After that, a selected set of BMs will be validated prospectively (WP3) and assessed to find the best-fitted models (WP4). These models will guide the development of the ready-to-use kits to be implemented in the clinical settings.

These sectors have been chosen, as the manufacturers show a high interest in making clear the environmental benefits of their products to customers ('Green industries') and in prioritizing so they can reduce their environmental impacts. This is particularly the case for SMEs. Free webtools ('apps') will serve dedicated needs of these sectors, addressing the specifics of the technologies and implementing parameterised models, such as calculators for energy-break-even-point of photovoltaics, Product Carbon Footprints (PCF) based on technology parameters of printed circuit boards, and Key Environmental Performance Indicators (KEPIs) for smart textiles. Selected Product Category Rules will be developed to provide a robust LCA guidance for SMEs. Practically, the project website will provide an exchange of scientifically validated data templates, to assist SMEs to pass the right questions to their suppliers. Carbon Footprints are a perfect entry point for SMEs to LCA strategies. Thus, implementation of an SME-compatible PCF methodology is a key element of the project. The approaches will be tested in 7 sectoral case studies, involving suppliers, end-product manufacturers and engineering companies. Inter-linkages between the sectors (on a technical and data level) will be thoroughly addressed. A broad dissemination campaign includes a mentoring programme for 100 SMEs, which will act as showcases for others, boosting use of LCA approaches among European SMEs at large.

The reasons for this include the costs and expertise required to run the LCA studies. However, the project aims to tackle these issues and devise methods and tools for sectors such as bio-based plastics, industrial machinery, electronics, renewable energy, sensors and smart textiles. These sectors were chosen since manufacturers showed a keen interest in demonstrating to SMEs how they can reduce their environmental impact.\n\nWith access to free web tools, SMEs will be able to see how their needs can be met and make full use of the technology available to them. These include key environmental performance indicators (KEPIs) for smart textiles and a product carbon footprint (PCF) based on technology parameters of printed circuit boards. Building on the findings from the survey, customised approaches by sector are under way. For example, in smart textiles, developers, designers and business executives of SMEs can take advantage of a two-step approach based on ready-made LCA data and a fast-track LCA approach. This will allow the calculation of the environmental performance of materials, at the energy and life-cycle stages.\n\nThese approaches are regarded as the perfect entry point for SMEs to LCA strategies, so devising a compatible tool for SMEs will be a key element. These will be tested in seven case studies involving suppliers, end-product manufacturers and engineering companies.\n\nThe campaign will include a mentoring programme involving 100 SMEs, and is expected to have a direct impact on sectors representing nearly 500 000 SMEs.\n\nOverall, LCA TO GO has many facets that benefit SMEs, like the free in-house web tools that provide precise information to match ongoing needs.

However, LED-based product systems contain many resources like indium, gallium or rare earth metals. Some of these substances are classified as critical raw materials at EU level. Therefore, if the current expansion of LED technologies is most welcomed from an economic and energy point of view, it requires optimising resource flows and addressing key societal issues. To strengthen the emerging LED market in Europe, cycLED focuses on improvement of the material flows and policy measures to remove barriers for LED technology dissemination. Innovation is needed to achieve an efficient management of the different materials used in LED systems, so that the growth of the LED-related markets is decoupled from resource depletion. A material flow analysis will first be conducted to obtain an overview of the most relevant materials contained in LED products, their origin and the situation regarding recycling. Further research will focus on the different life-cycle phases (production and manufacturing, assembling, use and material recycling) to provide overall solutions to improve the resource flows. These results will be combined to develop and implement solutions regarding product design for eco-innovation, adaptation of business models and overcoming of barriers to diffusion.

Unravelling the fundamental mechanisms of ageing is a pre-requisite for maintaining activity and independence of the elderly, thus improving the quality of life at older age. After some preparative effort made in FP6, time has come to federate the European research on ageing around commonly agreed perspectives, considering the need for progress in an area of great socioeconomic and political stake in Europe. The next step is therefore to raise a road map for the European research on the molecular aspects of healthy human ageing, considering also some aspects of development. Based on an assessment of the state of the art in molecular gerontology and breakthroughs in biotechnology, we shall clarify the main priorities for the next 15 years. We will engage an open and transparent mechanism to support a closely prepared and coordinated series of subtopic research workshops merging in a get-together integrative conference.

These degenerative changes are usually due to alterations in molecular mechanisms at the cellular level. Age-related disorders reduce quality of life, increase dependence on others and lower contribution to the work force or knowledge pool. The rapidly increasing aged population in EU also places a huge burden on governments and health care systems that are not adequately equipped to meet their needs.\n\nWHYWEAGE is an initiative established to identify areas of research for better understanding of molecular mechanisms of ageing and for finding solutions to improve quality of life. Twelve successful workshops were held with participants from 21 European countries, including industrial stakeholders along with scientists to provide technical and commercial perspective. Topics such as 'biomarkers of ageing', 'oxidative stress, protein damage and protein maintenance', vascular ageing, 'sarcopenia, muscle weakness and physical exercises', and 'clinical biogerontological studies' were addressed.\n\nDeficits in knowledge and technology were identified and research areas were prioritised based on criticality of intervention. The outcomes were used to develop a road map outline for EU research on ageing. Press conferences and individual project websites (see, for example, http://diamap.eu/) were used for information dissemination.\n\nThe WHYWEAGE road map will guide the way for unravelling the mystery behind ageing at the molecular level.
