The next generation will be developed at distances of 40 km in sea depths up to 80m. These new locations present technical challenges for engineering and the possibility of new synergies between all marine renewable energy resources including wave, tide and wind. Inspection and maintenance at depth is difficult and the raising of transmission voltages to keep cable sizes manageable is urgently required as the technical difficulty of hauling heavy cables is significantly increased. The availability of self-monitoring connectors to eliminate routine maintenance at greater depths is seen as a potential step-change improvement in infrastructure management and the development of ROV-installable wet-mate connectors as an alternative to dry-mated cable is a dominant industry objective. We will deliver a prototype 33kV hybrid wet-mate connector with a connectivity monitoring system and future-proof features for higher voltage connector technologies. This will lead to efficient power transmission, reduced installation and maintenance costs and  precision remote monitoring that reduces routine maintenance and intervention by divers, benefitting health, safety and affordability.", 446226.0, 1283660.0, "WETMATE", null, null, null, "http://www.wetmate.eu/", "http://www.HydroGroup.plc.uk", null, "fp7_106010_953174866"], ["8GD", "Development of a novel autonomous vehicle significantly reducing costs related to subsea sensors deployment and recovery", "C.D. Limited", "There is a distinct need for an improved method for accurate and inexpensive deployment and retrieval of seabed sensors and equipment. The AutoDrop will be hydro dynamically designed in order to glide through the water experiencing a minimum of drag. The rudders will maintain stability and change the direction if desired. It is important that the time used by the AutoDrop to travel from the surface to the seabed is kept at a minimum to maximize accuracy. A short time descending requires a heavy weight load attached to the unit, while releasing the weight load should lead to high degree of buoyancy to enable rapid ascent. Manner of operation: Prior to deployment operation, the units are programmed with a destination on the seabed and a location on the surface. The unit uses the surface location as a reference in order to navigate to the target area. As the unit is dropped into the water, it gains momentum until terminal velocity is reached. The navigation system calculates the position of the unit relative to the target and, if necessary, adjusts the rudders to change direction. A gentle landing further increases the chances of a successful deployment. The sensors transported down to the seabed by the AutoDrop units perform their task over a defined time period. When it is time to ascend, either dictated by a programmed time limit or by a broadcasted signal from top side, the AutoDrop units release their weight load or in other ways change their buoyancy. The buoyancy causes the units to ascend towards the surface. The navigation system will be applied on the way up and may be programmed to form clusters on the surface, thus simplifying the retrieval process. Clusters are easy to form by sending a number of units to the same surface location. At surface the AutoDrop units will have the possibility to radio its GPS coordinates to a service vessel.", 4057.0, 1256011.0, "AUTODROP", "Robots on the seafloor", "Researchers have developed an innovative robot vehicle concept that could reach deep into the sea. If developed further, the vehicle will facilitate exploration and help retrieve data sensors more efficiently.", "Collecting environmental data from the seafloor is crucial for evaluating weather trends, monitoring sea life and furthering science. While sensors have helped in gathering valuable data, the costs of bringing them to the surface are very high. The EU-funded project AUTODROP worked on a novel solution to overcome this challenge.\n\nConducting in-depth research for new vehicle prototype requirements, the project team designed the new rudder assembly and defined the vehicle cargo capacity. It finalised the design of sub-systems such as landing gear and hull size, as well as the communication system involved. The project team envisioned a vertical vehicle that would drop fast to the desired location, supported by negative gravity and weight.\n\nAs AUTODROP worked on the prototype, it saw the potential not only in designing a generic tool that deploys sensors but also an excellent solution for improved seabed seismic operation. Other possible future markets for a vehicle of this type include underwater exploration for natural resources such as oil and gas.\n\nMuch effort was directed to creating an embedded control system software and mission data communication, as well as navigation and estimation software. The various sub-systems were tested for their viability with palpable success, getting the team much closer to building an effective vehicle prototype as projected.\n\nWhile the team made significant headway in designing a successful concept, it stopped short from building the prototype due to the project's complexity and the additional resources required. Nonetheless, the technology envisioned is very promising and the research has undoubtedly opened new avenues to building a viable prototype in the future. \n\nAs the market trend continues to point towards robotisation of operating sensor nodes, project results could have a profound impact on below-sea activity if or when they are exploited.", null, "http://www.cdltd.net", "/docs/results/images/2014/147527.jpg", "fp7_97327_984678429"], ["8GW", "Sensors for LArge scale HydrodynaMic Imaging of ocean floor", "Hydro Bond Engineering Limited", "LAkHsMI will develop a new bio-inspired technology to make continuous and cost-effective measurements of the near-field, large-scale hydrodynamic situation, for environmental monitoring in cabled ocean observatories, marine renewable energy and port/harbor security.
