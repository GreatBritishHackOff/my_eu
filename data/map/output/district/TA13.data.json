This manifests itself in the occurrence of serious ailments such as acute infectious diarrhoea (AID), ulcerative colitis (UC), travellers\u2019 diarrhoea (TD) and antibiotic associated diarrhoea (AAD). Specifically, in the case of AAD, it is estimated that between five and 25 per cent of patients experience diarrhoea, including Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea, as a complication of treatment with antibiotics. The project aims to develop a three-fold Quality Control approach to the development of a probiotic supplement: i) Develop a \u201cTailor made\u201d unique blend of bacteria, the origin of which has a sound scientific basis and is not based on commercial availability. Each individual bacterial component will be screened for stability (both processing and gut environment), and adhesion to gut mucosa. ii) Develop a \u201cTailor made\u201d prebiotic \u201cpartner\u201d which will ensure the sustainability of the resulting synbiotic blend and to potentially enhance the immunostimulatory and anti inflammatory properties of the synbiotic. iii) Pre-conditioning of the bacterial blend will impart inherent robustness and eliminate the need for the additional (costly) physical and chemical processing required for protection in the gut.", 149075.0, 980718.0, "QUALVIVO", null, null, null, "http://www.qualvivo.eu", "http://www.protexin.com", null, "fp7_107795_997665662"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TA13"}
