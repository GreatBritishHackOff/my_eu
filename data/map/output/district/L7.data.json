There is an unmet medical need to prevent P. aeruginosa infection in critically ill patients and to develop new antibiotics for infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). The Combatting Bacterial Resistance in Europe - Molecules against Gram Negative Infections (COMBACTE-MAGNET) consortium will provide groundbreaking multinational phase 2 and phase 3 studies in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients and a phase 1 paediatric safety and PK study with the bispecific immunoglobulin (IgG)1 mAb (MEDI3902) targeting the pathogenic components PsI and PcrV as a new approach for preventing P. aeruginosa infections, especially pulmonary infections, in ICU patients. In addition, the consortium will perform phase 1 and phase 2 studies, including extensive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies, with a new beta\u2010lactam \u2010 AIC499 \u2010 with enhanced beta\u2010lactamase stability and in vitro/ in vivo activities against MDR-GNB, including P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. Alone, or in combination with a beta\u2010lactamase inhibitor (BLI), AIC499 is active against MDR isolates producing a wide range of beta\u2010lactamases, and therefore, offers the real prospect of a new treatment option for patients with life-threatening infections due to MDR GNBs. The COMBACTE-MAGNET consortium brings together 5 pharmaceutical industry partners and 36 academic partners, and is a true nexus of world class researchers from 10 European countries with expertise in (i) designing and executing observational and interventional studies related to antibiotic\u2010resistant bacteria; (ii) conducting high\u2010quality research in the epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of infections caused by MDR\u2010GNB, (iii) identifying novel biomarkers in critically ill patients; (iv) performing Phase I PK/PD studies; (v) performing Phase 2 studies enriched for PK/PD endpoints; and (vi) performance of large definitive Phase 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) for regulatory purposes. The two European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) project sponsors, MedImmune and AiCuris, will provide all required study\u2010related expertise in clinical development of monoclonal antibodies and antibiotics with MEDI3902 and AIC499 plus BLI as Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs), respectively.

The clinical studies related to MEDI3902 and of AIC499 will be supported by innovative epidemiological studies, including mathematical modeling of the consequences of P. aeruginosa infections. Furthermore, detailed biomarker studies will be performed to explore associations of host biomarkers (e.g., pre\u2010existing antibodies against P. aeruginosa virulence factors, protein biomarkers, and ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules) and infections, disease severity and outcome, which will enhance the successful execution of clinical trials.

Highly sensitized patients accumulate and often die on the transplant waiting lists as it is almost impossible to find donors towards which they don\u2019t have antibodies. The acceptable mismatch program of Eurotransplant has shown to be an effective tool to enhance successful transplantation of highly sensitized patients.  However, 35% of the patients have rare HLA phenotypes and no suitable donor can be found. HLA phenotype frequencies vary amongst European populations. Rare HLA phenotypes in one population are more frequent in other populations. The major objective of the 10 partners in this project is to analyze the feasibility and requirements for a Europe-wide acceptable mismatch program to enhance transplantation of patients with rare HLA phenotypes in their own population. Long waiting patients will be matched with virtual donors based on known HLA frequencies of different European populations and with actual donors from the different transplant organizations. If successful, the logistics will be tested by transplanting some of these patients with donors from elsewhere in Europe. Second objective is to simplify the definition of acceptable HLA mismatches. Although almost 4000 HLA class I antigens are known, only 150 polymorphic residues differentially spread over the different HLA antigens are responsible for the induction of antibodies. An innovative typing and matching strategy based on the definition of acceptable HLA epitopes will facilitate the identification of suitable donors. Third objective is to define whether antibodies against non-HLA targets on the donor endothelium affect the results of transplants in highly sensitized patients.

The same applies for human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), the cell surface molecules that regulate the human immune system. Antibodies against foreign HLAs are considered a contraindication for renal transplantation due to acute graft rejection.\n\nThe emergence of anti-HLA antibodies can be induced by blood transfusions, transplantation and pregnancy. To enhance the outcome of renal transplantation, one approach is to remove anti-HLA antibodies using immunosuppressive drugs. However, this strategy has side-effects and does not work for all patients.\n\nAlternatively, the Eurotransplant Reference Laboratory's Acceptable Mismatch Program identifies the HLAss for which the patient never formed antibodies. Donor selection is then based on the compatibility of the donor with the patient's own HLAs and the acceptable HLA mismatches. This programme was established across Europe and has proven to be very effective with the majority of the highly sensitised patients receiving a transplant within two years.\n\nHowever, the polymorphic nature of HLAs and their geographical distribution resulted in a significant proportion of highly sensitised patients with no transplant available in the Eurotransplant region. Seeking to address this, the EU-funded http://www.eurostam.eu/ (EUROSTAM) project set out to extend the potential donor pool through a Europe-wide collaboration.\n\nAs a first step, the consortium has created an inventory of 600 highly sensitised patients in Europe who have been waiting for a transplant. The central database has been enriched with the patients' HLA phenotypes and their acceptable mismatches. In addition, partners have gathered HLA information from 212\u00a0634 individuals from 27 European countries in the http://hla-net.eu/ (HLA-net) bioinformatics platform. HLA phenotypes have also been collected from over 46\u00a0000 organ donors across Europe.\n\nUsing simulation methods, the consortium hopes to predict the chances for a particular highly sensitised patient to receive a transplant from a particular region.

AKU is a genetic deficiency of homogentisic acid dioxygenase, causing high levels of homogentisic acid (HGA). Oxidation of HGA to pigment polymer, termed ochronosis, alters connective tissues. This leads to multisystemic damage dominated by premature severe arthritis. Currently, multiple arthroplasty is inevitable since AKU is incurable and there is no effective palliative therapy. No data exists regarding the presence or absence of ochronosis before age 30 years. Hence, it is unknown whether treatment is necessary before then. A potential HGA-lowering therapy with nitisinone is available, but lacks outcome data. Thanks to our existing successful fundamental and clinical research (cell models, animal models, natural history studies), we are now ready for the final stage of clinical development of nitisinone for AKU in order to overcome these challenges. This will involve a dose finding study, a phase 3 clinical trial to prove efficacy, and a cross-sectional study in children and young adults to determine when to start treatment.
