The system is extremely versatile because it only requires one vessel to operate and that can be any vessel of opportunity at the time of an emergency spill.\nThe mops are made by novel fibres with controlled oleophylic and hydrophobic behaviour in order to absorb large quantities of oil and increase the recovery efficiency.  Once the mops are saturated they are recovered onboard of the vessel and squeezed through a roller system: the oil collected is then stored and the mops are deployed again for another cycle.  Traditional systems, in comparison, are characterised by lower performance in terms of oil recovery and cannot be used in harsh sea conditions, which are typically encountered in case of ship wreckage and often characterize the cold seas.\nProject objectives are related to the development of the oleophylic and hydrophobic fibre materials of the mop and the related treatments, the optimisation and production of the mops, and the development of the overall oil spill recovery system for field demonstration.\nFour SMEs constitute the core of the Project, representing the whole supply chain for the oil spill recovery end product. SMEs are supported by three RTDs providing the necessary experience in the field of technical textiles, engineering and oil spill responding services. SMEs will benefit 100% of project exploitable results, in a scheme that will provide full return of investment within 3 years by the end of the project.", 4211.0, 1173713.0, "Force7", "New oil slick technology cleans up", "The hunt for oil has lead to its exploitation in environments that experience low temperatures and harsh sea conditions typical of the polar and sub-polar regions. However, the technology for containing and recovering spilled oil has not changed significantly over the past 25 years.", "Oil spills can cause enormous damage to the marine environment by poisoning and smothering ocean life. Although a wide range of technologies currently exist for the removal of oil spilled into water, none are capable of successfully recovering spilled oil from cold, rough seas. \n\nThe in\u00a0situ burning of the spilled oil and the use of dispersants are of limited value and must be implemented within 72 hours of the incident. However, these methods do not remove all the oil, even under ideal conditions. Containment and collection of the oil is also a common solution, but requires calm seas for it to be effective. \n\nAn EU-funded consortium made up of small and medium-sized enterprises and research institutes solved this problem. They developed a highly effective oil recovery system capable of operating in challenging conditions. The http://www.force7.eu/ (FORCE7) project designed and tested an innovative system made up of interconnected mops that are deployed behind a tugboat and dragged through an oil slick. \n\nThe mops are made up of a novel combination of natural and man-made fibres that absorb large quantities of oil, but not water. Once they are saturated, the mops are brought onboard and squeezed by rollers to remove the oil, which is collected. They are then redeployed for another cleaning cycle. \n\nProject partners developed and tested fibres to determine their oil sorption capacity and their ability to repel water under different conditions. The information was used to select the most suitable grades of synthetic and natural yarns. Currently, polypropylene is the most commonly used absorbent material for clearing up oil spills. However, natural fibres such as cotton, wool or flax show superior behaviour and come from renewable resources.\n\nResearchers also investigated the best surface modification treatments in order to improve the fibres' properties by developing high-performance textile structures. The materials were then tested on a small scale under simulated working conditions to determine mop behaviour. \n\nDifferent configurations of the mops were modelled and studied using simulations of the marine environment in order to determine the key parameters. This data was then used to design and build an efficient oil recovery system suitable for use in cold, rough waters.", null, "http://www.opec.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20141119135950.jpg", "fp7_106833_952516624"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8AS", "Aller Travailler en Europe pour mon Avenir  (ATEA = la porte en langue basque)", "Fairfield School", 10057.0, "Our project  is aimed at sending  22 selected trainees in the European Union for the twelfth year.\r\n\r\n1) The four professional courses proposed in our school are concerned with training periods in the European Union.\r\n     -Vocational High School Diploma \u00ab Management of a farm \u00bb which corresponds to agriculture and breeding courses. Those  students intend to work as agricultural technicians or farmers.\r\n    -Vocational High School Diploma \u00ab Management of Cats and Dogs breeding \u00bb which corresponds to pet courses. Those students intend to work among dogs and cats as breeder, dog handler, dog trainer in the army , the police, dog units .\r\n  -Vocational High School Diploma \u00ab Services to people and territory \u00bb which corresponds to health and social  courses. Those students intend to work as nursing auxiliary, educator, home assistant, nurse assistant.\r\n  -Vocational High School Diploma \u00ab Technician adviser in the sale of pets \u00ab corresponds to  sale of pets courses.

They involve :\r\n  6.1) the integration of the notion of european citizenship . The notion of mobility is also explained to our students in the courses of langauges and sociocultural education. That increases the number of candidates to mobility and the the desire for classes to go for study trips, in the states of  European Union.\r\n  6.2) the integration of mobility in the communication with the families concerning the pursuit of studies in our school or elsewhere. Mobility and certification are two main advantages in the recruit of students since they increase the appeal of our school.\r\n 6.3) Mobility is put forward as an argument for our students (holder of high school diploma ) in their pursuit of studies in advanced technician's certificate classes (two-year technical degree).This is all the more useful as some classes propose training periods abroad.Our former students who have already experienced a training period abroad usually go on for studies in higher education.", "http://www.fairfieldschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA102-014052_4"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WF17"}
