For the operators\u2019 mobilities there are two competence areas:- Youth Area about pedagogic methodologies applicable to the inclusion of young immigrants (unaccompanied minors), NEET, young people at risk of scholastic dispersion and with physical and psychological disadvantage;- Adult Area about pedagogic methodologies applicable to immigrants, disables, new poverties and prisoners.The Trainers' mobilities have a length of 2/3 days (travel excluded) in 5 different European countries: Spain, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Finland and Belgium.On the basis of the internationalization strategy of the operators' competences, the project foresees 4 mobility paths of 12 days in Ireland for the foreign language preparation, addressed to educators of the linguistic/communication area, to be realised during a professional updating about foreign languages didactic and the ICT in the didactic.SCF intends to develop a training services catalogue for youth's sustainable transnational mobility promoting awareness among the operators coming from both sending and hosting context in terms of: - Choice of the mobility destination country on the basis of the sector and companies\u2019 excellences able to host internships and to guarantee pedagogic quality;- Choice of the mobility duration on the basis of the nature of the training project decided by the sending organization for its beneficiaries (enhancing of the acquired competences, learning experience internship with an intercultural approach; internship integrated to formal learning path, internship like work experience added to the learning path or post-qualification);- Choice of the Learning outcomes to be acquired during the mobility through \u201csoft\u201d valorisation (reuse of the knowledge and skills  acquired abroad, transfer peer to peer) or use of recognition procedures structured through the tools collection, Gores evaluation and recognition.For the Staff mobility, SCF intends to invest on WBL methodologies on the basis of:- The promotion on an international dimension of the training company and its impact in terms of social innovation;- SCF coordination of the dual system experimentation in Italy to be realised by the associated organizations in different regions.", "http://www.stroodcommunityproject.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA116-005050_6"], ["2RY", "Youths Saving Our Seas", "38th&40th Strood Sea Scout Group (40th Strood)", 28052.0, "This project shall be implemented among European Sea Scout groups from Malta, United Kingdom, Ireland, Slovakia and Greece and shall follow the roadmap of the conference held in Malta by the UNEP and the European Commission in October, \u201cOur Oceans - An Ocean For Life\u2019. We shall be 50 youths (10 from each country) and several leaders to implement a Youth Exchange titled 'Youths Saving our Seas' - YOUTHS SOS!\r\n\r\nThe Msida Sea scout group, which falls under The Scout Association of Malta, shall be implementing an Erasmus+ Youth Exchange project between August 21st and 29th August 2018 in Malta. However although the actual projected camp will be in those dates the participating countries shall be starting a pilot project 1 year before from August 2017 onwards each participating group will be collecting micro plastics and plastic debris from washed seashores surrounding marine protected areas in their respective country in a qualitative and quantitative research. The results will be mapped across the regions to sustain any arguments which the groups will come up with to present to policy makers at the end of the project.\r\n\r\nScouts carry out several activities outdoors such as camping, archery and abseiling, however the main activities of sea scouts is always intertwined with the sea. This brings the Sea Scouts in contact with several different marine environments and ecosystems. One of the philosophies of Scouting is that we leave a place better than when we found it no matter what activity we are organising. We therefore feel not just the need to do something for a better change but to inform also the public and the governmental policy makers about what is at stake if we keep degrading our oceans which are also linked through space and time. In order to do this, it is important to provide the tools to our sea scout youths as form of empowerment to be at the forehead of any discussions relating to preserving our Oceans.\r\n\r\nOur project activities are:\r\n\u2022Promoting awareness among Scouts and the general public locally and internationally \r\n\u2022Demonstrating in practice how sustainable fishing can be achieved touching also the blue economy which boosts also jobs.\r\n\u2022Increasing our understanding of the negative impact human activity can have on marine pollution, marine protected areas and climate change.\r\n\u2022Becoming empowered to bring about positive change within our countries by being the voice for endangered marine species.\r\n\u2022Youth empowerment to present their arguments to policy makers and making pressure to change what is needed.\r\n \r\nThere shall be several outdoor activities, which leaders and youths within each organisation have planned together and organised into a programme of activities, including:\r\n\u2022taking part in qualitative and quantitative research\r\n\u2022site visits\r\n\u2022meetings with experts\r\n\u2022interactive discussions\r\n\u2022hands-on activities\r\n\u2022interactive workshops\r\n\u2022a final public event\r\n\u2022a once in a year commitment to be continued every year in participating of clean ups around marine protect areas or beaches. \r\n\r\nWe shall also practice self-sustainability during the project itself:\r\n\u2022volunteering for the project data mapping of micro plastic and plastic debris starting this year and keep doing this every year. \r\n\u2022workshops on soap made from olive oil for washing clothes and personal hygiene which have no impact on the environment or marine ecosystem.\r\n\u2022Most of the herbs/greens used during the camp will be planted before hand though the use of aquaponics. \r\n\u2022Recycling and reusing of waste from the campsite.\r\n\u2022Getting most of the food from farmers surrounding the area with limited preserved things to reduce the carbon for print.\r\n\u2022All of us shall participate in cleaning and clearing the campsite before departure\r\n\r\nThese measures shall help us to mitigate our environmental impact during the project itself and allow us to practice self-sufficiency by practicing it to observe how relatively simple measures can have a huge impact. These simple measure will be urged to be used in their home country. Natural Soap  which they will be shown how to make it with different oils for different heart properties can also be sold through the groups as a means of fund raising to sustain certain cleaning activities. \r\n\r\nTo officially start the project, we  will  invite the Minister for sustainable development and the local press to cover this launch. On the final day,  a discussion will be held  with policy makers where the youths will present their arguments and suggestions from their findings after comparing and collecting the data of micro plastics along the year. They will address \u2018What can be done\u2019 and later we shall invite the public to visit the G\u0127ajn Tuffie\u0127a campsite for a tour of the campsite.There will be stands representing each activity day within the project, and the theme addressed. The stands shall be run by all participants (split into groups). EUPA shall be asked to also participate and have a stand of its own to promote the Erasmus+ Programme.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-2-MT01-KA105-027016_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "ME2"}
