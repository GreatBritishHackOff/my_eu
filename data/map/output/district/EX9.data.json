Recruiting and qualifying employees is also essential in order to ensure that companies maintain and develop their innovative strength and competitiveness.  A stay in another country can bring lots of positive outcomes. You can gain insights into your field of study from an international perspective, improve your foreign language skills, learn about a new culture, make international contacts and improve your career prospects.\r\n\r\nTraining abroad  is a unique opportunity for the development of professional knowledge and gaining new practical skills. The particular field of training depends on training needs defined by a participant. A significant component of the internships will be the acquisition of new work habits specific for a given foreign environment, improvement of language skills and multicultural competence. \r\n\r\nAn internship abroad is useful for several reasons. It is advantageous for future job applications, it helps with language skills and fosters intercultural competence. Furthermore, interns abroad encounter new work routines and mentalities, become more open and tolerant and learn to find their way in new environments.\r\n\r\nApprentices who have been selected for an internship abroad , will learn to become an industrial mechanic, electronics engineer for automation technology, engineering mechanics, mechatronics, technical product designer. The apprentices are already in the second apprenticeship year and must be at least 18 years of age\r\n\r\nFundamentals practical skills and knowledge in:\r\n engineering duties in planning and designing tools, engines, machines, and other mechanically functioning equipment, operation, maintenance, assembly and repair of equipment have already been laid.\r\n\r\nMARK WAISTELL , Senior Partner of Accent International, arranged for the participants to be met upon arrival at  Airport by our Airport Transfer Service and taken to their respective host family addresses. On arrival the participants were given their \u201cWelcome Packs\u201d, which contained useful information about their programme. During the meeting, the students were given information about their work placements, host family accommodation, social and welfare programme and emergency procedures.\r\n\r\nThrough the welcome meeting, participants receive specific information about:\r\n- The appropriate contact person of Accent International\r\n- Course hours for the language course\r\n- Information on the use of public transport\r\n- For more information about internships\r\n\r\nOn their first day of work, each student was accompanied to their work placement and introduced to their Supervisor by a member of Accent International  staff. The Work Placement team continually monitored the students and the work placements throughout their stay in the UK.\r\n\r\nMobility means collecting new experiences in the context of vocational stays abroad, e.g. via internshipsor further education programmes. Mobility offers the chance to acquire cross-country technical and social competencies, to further improve one\u2019s qualification and, as a result, have better chances on the international job market. Especially in an internationally oriented sector such as the aviation industry, the readiness for mobility plays an important role.\r\nKey competencies such as initiative, ability to work in a team and flexibility are an essential prerequisite for living and working together. \r\n\r\nThey help people to react quickly to new situations and to design work flows in an effective manner. Skilled personnel with intercultural competencies represent a decisive competitive advantage to companies. Improving language skills in a sector oriented towards international relations, language as the basic means of communication is of utmost importance. \r\n\r\nMobility means collecting new experiences in the context of vocational stays abroad, e.g. via internshipsor further education programmes.

Our target is to make students, teachers, staff, schools and working life more international. We need to keep the amount of students\u2019 exchange at least on same level as earlier. Every participant will develop their language skills, social skills, professional skills, attitude, tolerance, general knowledge and entrepreneurship. The project affects students\u2019 employment and the internationality of our organisation and the region. Main issue in our international work based learning  is quality and continuous improving. We must keep our good level also in the future with our partners.\r\nIn CUBE 2017- project we send 74 students and 3 staff members to work based learning periods abroad.  This means real work in real work places. Additionally we send 7 staff members to visit partner schools abroad and receive three experts to teach our students and get to know our education, teaching methods and companies. We try to offer possibilities also to students with fewer opportunities, which means we have to accommodate accompanying persons with their periods. We try also achieve more periods to adult students and  even apprentices. In CUBE 2017 \u2013project we have about 80 partners in16 different countries. We try to expand our network during the project. \r\n\r\nDuring the work based learning periods both students and staff collect cultural differences at work places, free time and everyday life.  This information will help next travelers to meet the differences in other countries. They also describe in they travel report how internationalism and technology \u2013 specially digitality -   is seen in the working place. We also try to find new digital solutions with our domestic partners how to administer our Erasmus+ projects.", "http://www.bicton.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA116-034389_8"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EX9"}
