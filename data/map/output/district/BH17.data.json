Direct earth fire combat using hoses is a key method used for fighting fires in forestry environments, often used in conjunction with air fighting and other methods. Given the unpredictability of fire in natural environments, versatility and safety are key element to de successful action of the fire brigade. Currently used fire hoses cannot resist more than 1 minute to a direct fire of 350C, resulting in many cases in hoses burning as a consequence of now fire start ups. This has shown dramatic consequences in fire-fighter\u00b4s safety, as well as a decrease in the versatility and efficiency of direct fire combat action plans. The project aims to produce a novel fire-fighting hose system for forestry applications able to provide enhanced versatility, efficiency and safety of fire-fighters in their forestry protection action plans. The hose system will be made of a novel rubber formulation based on PVC/NBR using intumescent additives and fire-resistant components, particularly based on nano-clay inclusions. The hose will provide enhanced fire resistant properties, aiming at increasing current performance by 5 to10 times, while retaining similar mechanical specifications as currently exiting products in the market (weight, service pressure, curvature radius, min temperature, and resistance to abrasion, chemicals, hydrocarbons and ozone) The innovation is expected to impact in other applications for fire-resistant rubbers such as civil, industrial and military.

One of the results was the drastic decline of biodiversity at local level. European regulations offer some protection for what is left, but do not affect most local decisions that cause a change in land use outside protected areas.\n\nThe main aim of the 'Transactional environmental support system' (TESS) project was to help reverse the decline in biodiversity. Funded by the EU, it proposed that local communities are able to restore environments if they are informed, empowered, and helped by policymakers and society as a whole.\n\nIn the first phase of TESS, biodiversity management information requirements of authorities at national and intermediate levels were analysed, and practical needs and stakeholder perspectives at the local level were identified. The project also developed a database of models suitable for bio-socioeconomic predictions and decision-making assistance both locally and regionally.\n\nTESS project partners then designed a system that integrates biodiversity information from the local level into central planning and land-use decisions, while at the same time supporting local people to conserve their environment. Other project results include recommendations and policy guidelines based on how biodiversity trends relate to different management practices across Europe.\n\nCurrently, the design is being tested in a knowledge web portal; this trial will continue beyond the duration of the TESS project.

The high level of turbulent skin-friction occurring, e.g., on the surface of an aircraft, is responsible for excess fuel consumption and increased carbon emissions. The environmental, political, and economic pressure to improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions associated with transportation means that reducing turbulent skin-friction drag is a pressing engineering problem.\n\nThe current project will tackle this problem with the development of superhydrophobic nanostructured top coatings, which do not only exhibit improved aerodynamic efficiency but at the same time they prevent icing on the aircraft. The nanostructured coatings will be based on metal oxides or nanostructured carbon (carbon nanotubes or graphene). Both types of nanoparticles can become superhydrophobic by suitable surface treatment while nanostructured carbon can also thermally activate the coating using the plane's on-board electrical system.\n\nThe proposed project involves the synthesis and chemical modification of ad-hoc nanoparticles. The latter will be employed for the synthesis of novel composite coatings, based on epoxy or polyacrylic resins, which will be characterized to obtain information on the structure and topology of the coatings. Wind tunnel tests, in combination with fluid dynamics modeling, will be conducted to optimise the application methods and the effect of different substrates, icing fluids, contaminants etc., thus correlating the aerodynamic and de-icing behavior to the morphology of the material.

Acute and persistent pain of different origins represent a common medical, social, and economic burden, and its pharmacotherapy is often inadequate. To advance management of pain patients and support decision making in clinical practice, more predictive assessments of treatment success are needed. The development of analgesics is onerous because promising preclinical data often do not translate into the clinic. Improved pharmacodynamic biomarkers could define whether nociceptive signalling is adequately modulated by a new drug, so increasing the chance of successful translation and greatly reducing the risk in initiating clinical development. Further, the pathophysiology of chronic pelvic pain indications is poorly understood and no adequate preclinical models are available, precluding focused preclinical research and leaving affected patients with little hope of relief. \nIMI-PainCare aims at making advances in these three pain areas in a complementary manner. Three subprojects will address specific scientific challenges. Subproject PROMPT will identify Patient Reported Outcome Measures as tools to standardise assessments of treatment success of acute and chronic pain in Real World conditions and controlled trials, and so improve its management; subproject BioPain will validate the translatability of pharmacodynamic biomarkers and PK-PD modelling in pain pathways of healthy subjects and preclinical species, thereby offering tools to improve drug development; subprojectTRiPP will identify biomarkers and novel therapeutic pathways of clinical phenotypes of patients with chronic pelvic pain, which after back-translation, can improve how preclinical models reflecting human diseases.\nThe goal of IMI-PainCare is to improve the care of patients with acute or chronic pain by providing a toolbox to streamline the development process for novel analgesic drugs and to improve treatment quality in clinical practice.", 6541.0, 20343034.0, "IMI-PainCare", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_216095_921109770"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8PJ", "Erziehen und Lernen in Europa", "Cuddles Day Nursery Ltd", 91105.0, "The P\u00e4dagogische Akademie Elisabethenstift (PAE) is a vocational college that provides its second year students with the opportunity to do an internship in one of the EU member states. \r\nDuring their second year the students can do a six week internship abroad.
