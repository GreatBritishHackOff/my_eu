We want to give them an International experience on their CV, which will be a great asset for their professional future and recruitmentThe Acad\u00e9mie de Lyon, the GIPAL, 15 French vocational high schools and 80 receiving partners in Europe are involved in that project. Motivation and involvement of all them show their willingness to work in team and share skills and practices. It is undeniable that the pooling of resources and practices has provided a new impetus and a new dynamism in the international programs coordinated by Acad\u00e9mie. Reiterating this initiative, we confirm our commitment to International Mobility of young people and staff with the support of Erasmus ProgramThis innovative consortium reflects the variety of our Acad\u00e9mie with a representative panel of 15 schools in the field of \"sales professions\". Supported by the Rectorat, this project aims at enriching the professional skills of the staff and the students. It also aims at strengthening the European dimension of this Baccalaur\u00e9at which needs to improve its image and which has developed very few mobilities so far.

These stages will imply a vast panel of people: staff, high schools, companies, academic authorities, families, associations, consulates, language assistants in France but also abroad.

The piloting committee is in charge of developing the project, of insuring the follow-up, the management and the evaluation of the project. The latter also has to check the financial balance and controls that the various actors meet their commitments. The sending organizations will respect the terms of the mobility program of the consortium. They are in charge of the evaluation of the participants.
