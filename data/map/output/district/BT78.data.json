We provide our students\u2019 with a professional and up-to-date education, which facilitates a good and quick entrance into the working world.\r\nIn recent years, in and around V\u00f6lkermarkt, there has been a growing demand for a workforce with international experience, professional qualifications, transparent mobility and especially language competence. The new program Erasmus+ enables us to prepare the students for these business demands.\r\nAs the applicant (home institution) we managed to acquire different businesses in Europe (host institutions) to work with us. In summer 2017 three students will do their internships abroad (one in England, one in Ireland and one in Northern Ireland). We are still searching for additional partners in the English-speaking countries. In the future (next school year 2017/18), we would like to offer all students the possibility to do an internship in the European Union.\r\nThe three students who are going to do the internship abroad are keen language users. They will work for our excellent partner companies which have already signed long-term partnership agreements or plan to do it with our school. In the 2017/18 school year, we would like to acquire additional partner companies.\r\nThrough participating in the Erasmus+ support program, the students will not only expand and perfect their professional skills but also their language abilities. In addition, they will get to know a foreign culture and its people and build social networks for the future. Such experiences are of vital importance to young people when it comes to shaping their personalities. Also, it can be a stepping-stone for building their future.\r\nThe partner companies are willing to share their daily work with the students and will assign them a mentor who will accompany and support them throughout the entire internship. Moreover, the mentor will hold several talks with the students, record their professional skills, and language competencies.  In the end, they will put them into writing in the form of a learning agreement.\r\nIn addition, the partner companies pledged to give the students a respective certificate (personal assessment) and the Europass-Mobility of the internship.\r\nDuring the internship the students will not only record their tasks but also their professional and private experiences in order to publish them on the school website and the school Facebook site at the end of the project. We also plan to have the students organize an event in V\u00f6lkermarkt to thank the host institutions in person and on behalf of the school again with hopes to foster relationships between the school and the companies.", "http://www.camphillclanabogan.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA102-034691_3"], ["1EE", "Second Step In Europe", "O'Kane Supermarkets Ltd", 81526.0, "Title: Second Step in Europe \r\nTheme: Reception issues for Customers\u2019 Care, Management/Administration and Logistic Transport students.\r\n\r\nDirect and indirect actors:\r\n- 6 training institutions or placement companies,\r\n- more than 40 companies in 5 countries\r\n- 46 young people preparing vocational high school diplomas in Customers\u2019 Care, Management/Administration and Logistic Transport (level IV, from 17 to 20 years old), \r\n- The 9 EFP staffs who will go on training period abroad,\r\n- Teachers / Students\u2019 guides,\r\n- The teams at the initiative of the project in the 6 partner organisations,\r\n- The companies which will welcome the participants,\r\n- All the pupils of the other classes and sections, \r\n- The students\u2019 families,\r\n- The administrative and educational teams, \r\n- The academic and diocesan authorities\r\n- Our local partners\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\n- France (sending organisation)\r\n- England, Germany, Spain, Norway and Sweden (recieving organisations).\r\n\r\nWhen:\r\n- Total duration of the project: 2 years \r\n- A placement of 29 days in March / April, 2018 and 2019\r\n\r\nWhy:\r\nOur project respects the objectives of the EU, it meets the needs of students\u2019 curriculum but it also meets the expectations of the pupils, eager to discover other cultural and professionnal horizons.
