Customization is also a great challenge and a way of giving added value to the products. And aesthetic personalization is one of the main ways for achieving customization.UV-Marking project aims at demonstrating that unitary customization (individual configurations/designs of each customer) is possible, by developing a new laser in the ultraviolet (UV) range that provides high quality marking on different materials.A final user will be able to select or create its own aesthetical design (colour, size, text, pictures...) using easy ICT applications and these will be marked easily by manufacturers using the new UV-laser system. The marking process will achieve high quality on marks, and high durability compared to current printed techniques.The new UV-laser system will help manufacturers with customized products, allowing shorter cycles, environmental friendliness, energy efficiency, higher integration and automation. One of the main goals will be to do the marking on-line at the end of the assembly line. It opens very interesting opportunities and possibilities for customization, but also for process optimization: delivery time, environmental impact, flexibility, shorter launching time, etc.The marking customization will be achieved by:\u0095\\tDeveloping a new laser in the UV range\u0095\\tAdapting existing materials for having a better beam absorption\u0095\\tIntegrating the laser in the industrial process\u0095\\tDeveloping a user application for demonstrating the unitary customization with real customersBSH, one of the most important companies of the home appliance sector, will lead the project. They are the perfect validators because they use several materials and aesthetics for commercial purposes is very important for them. ROFIN will be the laser developer, which is a leader company in this sector. U-MARQ is an ICT company that will work in the software for the integration of the laser in the industrial process, and the user application; WIRTHWEIN and DATALASE are leader companies and will work with plastic materials to improve the absorption properties and to obtain concrete colors different than black or white. ILVA and TORRECID will work in the field of glass and ceramic materials.

Radical innovative cheap manufacturing technologies on large area PVD, inkjet and roll-to-roll processes on low cost plastic will be developed. These processes are fully compatible with heterogeneous integration of several functions to produce a completely autonomous device (thin film battery, PV cell, sensors and communication) with great added value respect to traditional solutions. The optimization of co-integrated (separated building blocks laminated together) and convergence (using same materials for different building blocks) approaches will allow to fabricate a fully autonomous system. The first step will be the optimization of deposition and patterning technologies in terms of processes parameters and in-situ monitoring to allow the high control of film growth; the second step will be the heterogeneous integration of the different building blocks to produce the self-powered systems for the targeted applications.Four academic and research institutes guarantee a high level interdisciplinary research on solid-state physics, material chemistry and integration; this will assures the proper technology transfer to industrial partners at all product chain levels (materials, devices and end users) for a successful exploitation of results.

The school is a high performing school, however we wish to challenge and change the more traditional approaches to teaching and learning, replacing them with modern styles and methodologies in order to accelerate pupil progress at a faster rate.\r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\r\nThe school's over arching aim is to target teachers' and Teaching Assistants' professional development in upgrading their knowledge, skills and competencies in the following areas: leadership (developing and enhancing school and classroom leadership), curriculum design (upgrading and modernising the current curriculum with innovation, creativity, international dimension perspective, and use of the outdoors making it more contextual and purposeful), curriculum delivery (incorporating new methodologies, increased creativity, innovation, and use of new technologies), and modern foreign language learning (enhancing the level of pure language knowledge and methodologies).\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n26 practitioners in total with a range of experiences and competencies: a newly appointed Headteacher with leadership and international exchange experience, a capable and enthusiastic Senior Leadership Team of four people requiring leadership training to help accelerate the school's progress, a stable body of nine teachers across the experience spectrum - each at differening stages of their career with a range of skills and experiences, and twelve Teaching Assistants again with a range of experience and skills who are keen to develop. \r\nDESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES\r\nLeadership training for all five members of the Senior Leadership Team.\r\nCurriculum design training for three members of the Senior Leadership Team and three members of Early Years.\r\nCurriculum delivery training for 17 members of teaching staff (teachers and Teaching Assistants).\r\nLanguage learning training in France for 15 members of teaching staff (teachers and Teaching Assistants) and Poland for one teacher.\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nSchool will appoint a local expert in International Exchanges as a consultant, and an International Coordinator from it's Senior Leadership Team. This person, with the support of the Headteacher and Senior Leadership Team will have responsibility for planning, monitoring and evaluation, and dissemination of the project at each stage using electronic tools recommended and made available by the national agency. The Headteacher will have the responsibility for reporting the progress of the project and the final reporting to the national agency using the reporting tool.\r\nSchool practitioners will have a responsibility to engage with the pre-course tasks and learning, to attend said training, to complete post-course tasks including evaluation, reporting and dissemination in keeping with the agreed project plan.\r\nThe school's Finance Officer, supported by the International Coordinator and Headteacher, will be responsible for ensuring that the project spending plan remains in-budget. They will also have responsibility for booking the travel and course training for all participants.\r\nThe Governing Body, with the support of the appointed local International Support Officer, will be responsible for providing the Headteacher with a level of challenge and support during the lifetime of the programme. This will provide a level of accountability that will ensure that the project's aims are met and that the desired outcomes lead to the level of school improvement being sought.\r\nRESULTS, IMPACT & LONGER TERM BENEFITS\r\nPractitioners will see increases to their confidence, have upgraded leadership competencies, enhance their teaching skills bringing a revised mindset to the classroom along with new ideas that will raise both expectations and standards across the teaching and learning of all subjects. Language skills will be developed following course immersion. They will benefit from the experiences of each other following in-house sharing.\r\nThe school will benefit from increasing the numbers of leaders with strong capabilities in project management and school leadership. This will in turn place the school in a stronger position to make improvements and change, for example in designing a new curriculum which is modern, stimulating and fit for purpose.\r\nIndividual pupils will benefit from a highly skilled, highly trained, highly motivated workforce. Raised expectations, challenge, and stimulus will be evident in classroom learning, with an enquiry based approach to learning enabling pupils to acquire modern learning techniques / skills and learn at greater depth.\r\nOther local teachers and schools will benefit from the information and experiences we are able to share with them.
