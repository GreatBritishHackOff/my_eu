It is widely thought however that the low hanging fruits of innovation for wireless communication are all but exploited with only marginal gains possible. For a real step change towards the coveted 1Tbps wireless transmission, new areas of the spectrum must be utilized. Recent breakthroughs in terahertz systems are overturning the \u201cTerahertz gap\u201d stigma associated with the previously difficult to access spectrum. With the emergence of viable THz communications systems on the horizon, it is crucial to develop a technology roadmap for THz communication for beyond the 5G timeframe. \nThe aim TERAPOD is to investigate and demonstrate the feasability of ultra high bandwidth wireless access networks operating in the Terahertz band. The project will focus on end to end demonstration of the THz wireless link within a Data Centre Proof of Concept deployment, while also investigating other use cases applicable to beyond 5G such as wireless personal area networks, wireless local area networks and high bandwidth broadcasting. The project seeks to bring THz communication a leap closer to industry uptake through leveraging recent advances in THz components, a thorough measurement and characterization study of components and devices, coupled with specification and validation of higher layer communication protocol specification.", 91281.0, 3032589.0, "TERAPOD", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_211071_919955955"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2AF", "Vergleich Europ\u00e4ischer Programme und Formen der Teamarbeit im elementarp\u00e4dagogischen Bereich als Grundlage des gemeinsamen Erfolgs", "The Devon School of English Ltd", 36700.0, "Project background:\r\nThe Bildungsanstalt f\u00fcr Elementarp\u00e4dagogik Sacr\u00e9 Coeur Pressbaum (Higher Vocational School for Nursery Education of the Sacred Heart, Pressbaum) has been taking part in EU mobility projects (Leonardo da Vinci, Erasmus+) over the last years and, due to former participants\u2019 positive feedback on such projects, is eager to organise an Erasmus+ project. The focus will be put on participants\u2019 placements in English nursery schools. The positive feedback we have received from the Austrian National Agency for Lifelong Learning motivated us to apply for another project. We have been trying to react to the suggestions the agency has made to improve our project.\r\n\r\nProject goals:\r\nThe focus of the project (teamwork in nursery schools) is to further the competence of students in this particular field.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\nThe 40 participants are attending a higher vocational school with didactics and nursery school education being key areas of training. The school also focuses on training teachers in after-school care and in early childhood education. In the year of the intended mobility (2018) the participants will attend third grade and will be aged around 17. In the first two grades, they spend two hours a week in placements and from third grade onwards, they spend a day a week in placements including two week-long additional placements. Step by step, the participants are made familiar with the duties of fully-qualified nursery school teachers, they learn to offer learning opportunities to children as well as planning, reflecting and analysing a wide range of situations in nursery school. We deem them as young professionals who are well suitable for placements in England. The participants will be accompanied by three teachers in the areas of didactics (to support the participants in the placements) and English language teaching.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nDivided into small groups, the participants will spend 40 hours in placements and will receive linguistic support for their teaching practice in a language course. In their placements, the participants will offer learning opportunities to children in various competencies (literacy, music, games, creativity, movement) and will practice supporting the daily routine in nursery schools. By the help of tasks set to prepare for the placements in England, the participants will analyse the framework as defined in the goals and will reflect upon their results in the post-learning phase.\r\n\r\nCarrying out the project:\r\nDue to past EU mobility projects, the staff at Sacr\u00e9 Coeur has acquired know-how on carrying out such projects. In a well-tried system, the participants will be prepared by their teachers in inter-disciplinary lessons. In England, carrying out the project is supported by our long-time partner, who organizes the placements as well as the linguistic support.\r\n\r\n(Long-term) Effects:\r\nTeamwork is a most valuable resource of innovative, professional and high quality educational work in early childhood education. Team work does not just mean working together, but rather focuses on tackling necessary tasks and recognises current challenges by working together both, effectively and efficiently. Teamwork seizes these challenges and solves them in a constructive manner. The aim of this project is for the participants to get to know and to apply these dimensions of successful teamwork.", "http://www.devonschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA102-034775_1"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2HN", "BAY PHOTONICS LTD", 91041.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_12130", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "TQ3"}
