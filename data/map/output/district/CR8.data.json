Patients at risk for SCD may benefit from prophylactic treatment with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). ICD implantations have dramatically increased in recent years leading to multi-billion Euros of costs with significant regional disparities across Europe. Information on risks, benefits and costs supporting current guideline recommendations may be outdated, and the influence of gender remains unclear.\nEU-CERT-ICD (Comparative Effectiveness Research to Assess the Use of Primary ProphylacTic Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators in Europe) aims to generate contemporary clinical outcome data on ICD effectiveness in Europe. Clinical outcomes including all-cause mortality, appropriate and inappropriate ICD shocks, and quality of life (QoL) are assessed by:\n- a prospective study of patients undergoing indicated ICD treatment for primary SCD prevention, with a control group of patients not undergoing ICD treatment\n- a large European registry collecting available data on prophylactic ICD treatment\n- meta-analyses of available and emerging ICD outcome studies\nQoL-adjusted cost-effectiveness will be estimated from actual cost comparisons and Markov decision models with attention to sub-groups, regional, and sex comparisons. Outcomes in patients receiving ICDs for primary SCD prevention will be compared in sub-strata, and with patients fulfilling guideline criteria but not undergoing therapy as per prior decision of treating physicians. Sub-groups with particularly large or small benefit from ICD implantation will be identified using risk markers and clinical characteristics with specific emphasis on gender. EU-CERT-ICD is expected to provide important novel information to validate or challenge current guideline indications for primary prophylactic ICD treatment.", 114292.0, 6273716.0, "EU-CERT-ICD", null, null, null, "http://www.eu-cert-icd.eu/", null, null, "fp7_110067_950479527"], ["4EJ", "Development of a handheld antimalarial drug resistance diagnostic device using nanowire technology", "Quantumdx Group Limited", "'Malaria is a global health priority that has been targeted for elimination in recent years. Attaining the goals that define elimination of malaria in different countries depends critically on provision of effective antimalarials and further that these antimalarials are used appropriately in individual patients. Drug resistance is a major threat to malaria control and has important global public health implications. Over the past decades the genetic bases for resistance to most of the antimalarial classes currently in use has become defined. For some drugs and combinations, these mutations are the most important predictors of treatment failure. This proposal will innovate new technologies to confirm malaria diagnosis and detect drug resistance in malaria parasites by analysis of mutations in nucleic acids, using nanowire technology, and will result in the development of a simple, rapid and affordable point-of-care handheld diagnostic device. The device will be useful at many levels in malarial control by:\n\n1. Optimising individual treatments for patients\n2. Assessing the epidemiology of drug resistance in malaria endemic areas\n3. Assessing population impacts of antimalarial interventions\n\nThe development programme capitalises on highly original and proprietary advances made by QuantuMDx in the field of point-of-care diagnostics. This is complemented by academic expertise that has made major contributions to the understanding of antimalarial drug resistance mechanisms in laboratory models, as well as parasites obtained directly from patients. The impact of this proposal can be extended rapidly to other established and emerging infectious diseases.'", 2124106.0, 4230018.0, "NANOMAL", "Fast and easy malaria diagnosis", "Drug resistance is one of the most important factors in malaria treatment failure, often with deadly consequences. A pioneering cell phone-type device that analyses infection and malarial mutations with a finger prick could save billions of lives.", "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about half of the world's population, numbering in billions, is at risk of contracting malaria. Despite being preventable and treatable, malaria killed approximately 482\u00a0000 children under the age of 5 years in 2012, almost 1 child every minute.\n\nWith EU funding, the project 'Development of a handheld antimalarial drug resistance diagnostic device using nanowire technology' (http://www.nanomal.org/ (NANOMAL)) is creating a simple-to-use, affordable tool to analyse mutations in malarial DNA with proven nanotechnologies. Treatment can then be based on the specific malaria parasite while assessing the real-time risk of drug resistance emergence and the impact of antimalarial interventions.\n\nThe low-cost device capable of delivering a diagnosis in less than 20 minutes of sampling from a finger prick of blood is being integrated with cell phone technology. The system will support remote consultations, transfer of data to central processing centres for global tracking and appropriate treatment for improved outcomes.\n\nNANOMAL's device works by extracting and amplifying DNA from the sample and binding it to probes immobilised on the surface of nanowire sensors. This assay can detect all five species of human malaria, including the most dangerous, most common and newest. Furthermore, the assay can also detect more than 10 mutations associated with drug resistance in the most dangerous species.\n\nAll components have been integrated into the handheld device and disposable malaria assay cartridge that are now ready for testing. The device will be evaluated in comprehensive testing using parasite DNA samples, laboratory testing with clinical samples and, finally, near-patient testing. The consortium has developed a roadmap for commercialisation, including links with external advisors to establish regulatory and quality control measures.\n\nMalaria, often seen in the poorest tropical and subtropical areas of the world, can go undetected and untreated due to limited availability of health care facilities. The tremendous potential of the NANOMAL device has already been recognised as the number one innovation in malaria elimination by The Guardian's Global Development Professionals Network. By project end, this robust, field-tested tool should be ready for commercialisation. It will bring appropriate diagnosis and life-saving intervention for malaria to underserved regions of the globe.

Recent advances have shown that NWs with predefined properties can be grown, offering a new paradigm enabling functional device prototypes including: biosensors, solar cells, transistors, quantum light sources and lasers. The critical mass of scientific knowledge gained now needs to be translated into NW technologies for industry. FP7-MC NanoEmbrace (ITN) and FUNPROB (IRSES), made substantial contributions to NW research, producing excellent scientific and technological results (>100 journal papers published) and delivered outstanding training in nanoscience and transferable skills to ESRs.\n\nDespite demonstrable scientific and technological advantages of NWs, NW-based technology concepts have not yet been translated into market-ready products, because industry and academia have not worked hand-in-hand to commercialize the research findings. Thus, it is essential that NW research is now directed towards customer-oriented scientific R&D; whilst applying innovative industrial design techniques to ensure rapid translation of the basic technologies into commercial devices.\n\nThis ambitious challenge requires close collaboration between academia and the nascent NW industry, combining the efforts of scientists and engineers to address market needs. Building upon our previous achievements, a team of leading scientific experts from top institutions in Europe, strengthened by experts in innovative design and industrial partners with an excellent track record of converting cutting edge scientific ideas into market products has formed the INDEED network to address this challenge.
