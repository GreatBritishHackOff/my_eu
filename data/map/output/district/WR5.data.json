Large parts of water distribution networks have to be rehabilitated requiring investments of \u20ac 20 billion/year. Prioritization and optimization of investments is needed urgently. In many countries, water quality needs improvement in order to reduce health risks and resources for water production and distribution must be used more efficiently. The European Innovation Partnership on Water has established priority areas related to the challenges in water supply distribution networks, focusing on resource efficiency, Smart Water Management and decision support systems. Although the technology components for Smart Water Management are available, the route to application is still uncertain. The main hurdles are: lack of integrated and open solutions; difficulty to comply with user and integration requirements; lack of clear and validated business cases for solutions; lack of business intelligence awareness and lack of political and regulatory support.\nProject aims\n1) To integrate and demonstrate 12 innovative solutions\n2) To demonstrate 4 integrated solutions\n3) To establish and guard integration and standardisation aspects\n4) To establish business cases, deployment potential and market uptake routes\nSolution\nThis project will overcome the hurdles by developing and demonstrating in 4 important Smart Water Management themes (water quality management, leak management, energy optimization and customer interaction).  12 innovative theme oriented solutions and 4 integrated (technological, financial, ICT, organisation, management) solutions will be demonstrated at 4  well-scaled and real-life demonstration sites in France, United Kingdom, Spain and The Netherlands.
