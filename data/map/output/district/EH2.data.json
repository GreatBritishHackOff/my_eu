The courses will empower them with the tools to communicate effectively in English and to apply their knowledge to the classes too. The participants will refresh the oral and listening English skills, apply a modern, communication-oriented teaching methodology, benefit from the exchange of best practice.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\nOur school has participated in two Erasmus plus KA1 projects so far and the mobilities and results were amazing. Therefore we know we can expect great benefits for our school, our pupils and our teachers. We hope to promote students' deeper interest in learning, and not only English. Our teachers will inject life into lessons and make them more attractive. \r\nWe are also convinced that the chosen courses will contribute to giving European dimension to our school. The students will gain a better understanding of European life, culture and values in its various aspects.\r\nWe believe our participation will promote cooperation of our school with other educational institutions abroad.\r\nOur school is part of local community.

There are many obstacles faced both on local, regional and European level in making the youth environmental movement more inclusive.\r\n\r\nThrough this project, we aim to provide solutions for inclusive work on both international and national levels. The project will give youth in local groups in YFoEE the tools to effectively collaborate with marginalised communities disproportionately affected by climate change and other social and environmental injustices locally and globally. We strive to make sure that our work is beneficial to everyone, not just those with a dominant voice. \r\n\r\nThe overall aim of the activity is to train young trainers from YFoEE member groups to organise workshops in their home countries, which enable their groups and individuals to practically implement values of equality and interculturalism, and lead on intersectional activities to challenge local cultural and political frameworks that prevent people from marginalised communities to actively participate in climate change agenda and democracy processes in their countries.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cTraining for Trainers\u201d activity will take place in Norway and will bring together 25 young people from from 12 member groups of YFoEE for an intensive 4.5 days training.

To ensure in-depth training the activity will invite already experienced and committed volunteers of YFoEE who are leading their local youth groups, and experiencing obstacles (external and/or internal) to inclusive and intersectional activities and campaigns. The activity will prepare young leaders to successfully design and carry out workshops in their local communities, promoting intersectional approach within their groups and members.

Follow-up phase of decentralised workshops will ensure flow of topics that are being discussed on the European level, into the national and local levels. Through local workshops at least 200 young people will become aware of the importance of intersectional work in social and environmental justice organisations and will become equipped with practical popular education tools to start building their own activities that put marginalised communities in the centre of youth work (contributing to overall objective 2). We expect that these young people will apply gained knowledge not just in their work with youth, but will also challenge other institutions and will facilitate real changes to lack of understanding of these issues in their surroundings.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, YFoEE will use this activity to discuss next steps to further build intersectional movement on European and international levels and choose a coordination group which will mentor new trainers, monitor the implementation of these values on local level and prepare for follow-up activities. .  \r\n\r\nBy equipping participants with knowledge and skills on equity, human rights and promoting tolerance and critical thinking, the project will amplify voices of marginalised communities facing environmental injustices. This will be reached by encouraging young individuals to employ tools of inclusive participation, anti-oppressive education and active outreach to organisations working on other social issues that intersect with climate change throughout the implementation and the dissemination of the project. These new attitudes and knowledge will feed into the future work and strategies of partner organisations.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on youth empowerment and equipping young people with essential skills and knowledge to effectively work with marginalised communities and empower them to participate in national and international debates on climate change and climate justice.Through solidarity and allyship the project aim to amplify voices of marginalised communities.

To reflect the role of leadership and explore participants\u2019 own attitudes, approach and inner motivation of their work with volunteering.\r\n2.  To improve and boost the practical skills of the participants for working with groups and projects in volunteering.\r\n3.  To put participants\u2019 experience into practice and multiply among their colleagues and target groups.\r\n \r\nBoth trainings will consist of 3 parts reflecting the overall objectives. The 1st part will be self-reflective, focused on self-awareness. The participants will be guided by methods of coaching to sensitize their own approach and attitudes regarding leadership, reflect on their behaviour, characteristics and inner motivation. For the purposes of our project, we will closely connect this attitude reflection with leadership in projects (in positions of campleaders, coordinators etc.) and will use it as essential base for the second, practical part of the trainings. The second, practical part of the 1st training will be focused on coaching and mentoring methods in supporting the groups; the 2nd training will focus its second part on team and project management. Third part of both trainings will contain creating action plans for implementing the experience in practice as well as will provide space to share the participants\u2019 ideas and create new international projects with other participants.\r\n \r\nMain target group of both trainings are campleaders (youth leaders of international voluntary projects, so called workcamps), but the trainings are intented also for youth (junior) trainers, experienced volunteers and staff members of partner organisations.\r\n \r\nMethods used during the trainings:\r\n- structured exercises, outdoor, dance, theatre, art,\r\n- debriefings on learning outcomes\r\n- self-directed learning according to participants\u2019\u2019 goals and YouthPass\r\n- daily reflection in groups, journal-keeping, mid-term and final interactive and creative evaluation\r\n- outdoor training\r\n- simulations\r\n- facilitated discussions and group work\r\n- information sessions, interactive presentations\r\n- practical exercises\r\n \r\nMain output of the training is the toolkit, describing both training modules, which are piloted in this project.

On other hand we expect that the project will contribute for the quality rising of EVS projects, which will definitely raise the positive influence on the EVS volunteers and the administrative capacity of their organizations.
