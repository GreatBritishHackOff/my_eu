The French language and culture is delivered through weekly modern languages lessons, by select members of staff with the relevant knowledge and confidence. The School Improvement Plan, and council objectives identify modern languages as an area of development. In line with national policies, we are working to embed the 1+2 approach with learning additional languages. Three teachers were selected to represent the school at an immersion week.\r\n\r\nThrough attending an LFEE French Immersion Course for Primary Teachers, we will develop our competency and confidence in the French language and culture; teaching in French; and the use of ICT to enhance learning. We will gain resources to share with our colleagues, and on return develop further resources for colleagues across our local authority. We will offer training across our authority and attend (and contribute to) national modern languages events. Through the course we will build relationships with teachers from across Europe and develop these through our pupils, encouraging communication in French; developing an understanding of their place within Europe. This works alongside our national curriculum which encourages pupils to be global citizens. \r\n\r\nThe three participants are Primary Teachers from Our Lady of the Missions Primary School. We have the relevant qualifications and experience to be registered with the General Teaching Council of Scotland. We have a keen interest in learning an additional language, and immersing ourselves in the French culture. \r\n\r\nWe will attend the LFEE immersion in July 2017 and follow-up with activities that will benefit pupils and staff within our school and local authority. We will embed the French language in our own classroom and across the school, and support our colleagues in doing this too.  We will share what we have learned through our school Twitter page and school newspaper, inviting families and the local community to participate in whole-school language events. \r\n\r\nThe long-term aim of this project is to raise attainment in the French language amongst Primary pupils. This will be done through improved teaching methods which will in turn lead to better learning experiences for pupils. To assess this, we will assess the number of pupils who have achieved second level by the end of Primary 7 over the coming years.", null, "Our Lady of the Missions Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036261_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["8NG", "East Renfrewshire Council Employability Pipeline - Management and Compliance", "East Renfrewshire Council", "Strategic Intervention management, administration and compliance.", "ESF", 148385.0, 371105.0, "esf_scotland_176"], ["8NG", "East Renfrewshire Council Employability Pipeline - Procured Activity", "East Renfrewshire Council", "This Employability Pipeline will provide intensive one-to-one support to overcome barriers to work; provide targeted employability services for young parents; support job brokerage; and prepare participants for interviews, placements or work.", "ESF", 363920.0, 909900.0, "esf_scotland_177"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["8PY", "ST ANGELA'S PARTICIPATION CENTRE", 9580.0, "Developing the European dimension in sport (15.02.03)", "fts_2016_56351", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "G46"}
