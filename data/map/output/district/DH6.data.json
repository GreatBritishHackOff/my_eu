Such a network forms the infrastructural basis to promote awareness of specific working practices of RECs across Europe, to enhance the shared knowledge base of European RECs, to support coherent reviews and opinions and to meet new challenges and emerging ethical issues. The central objective of EURECNET as a Coordinating Action is to foster the already existing network of European REC networks (in short \u201cEUREC\u201d). In particular, the contribution of EURECNET aims at five different levels: - fostering a sustainable infrastructure for European RECs (including a statute and a secretariat) to promote exchange and cooperation and to allow for international cooperation; - gathering information on RECs in Europe to build a basis for mutual exchange - collecting and evaluating training materials for REC members to enhance the quality of review; - conducting capacity building to facilitate the development of national REC networks (as future partners of EUREC); - identifying emerging ethical issues to develop common solutions for challenges posed by new technologies and scientific methodologies.", 7178.0, 759809.0, "EURECNET", "A stronger base for ethical research", "An EU Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) Coordinating Action has helped to strengthen the work of EUREC, a network of organisations and bodies relevant to ethical research.", "The project 'European research ethics committees' network' (http://www.eurecnet.org (EURECNET)) worked to foster a sustainable infrastructure for European research ethics committees (RECs). In support of promoting exchange, cooperation, reviews and network development, the primary objectives covered five main areas: infrastructure, information gathering, training materials, capacity building and emerging ethical issues.\n\nProject efforts and deliverables succeeded in strengthening links between European RECs. One of these is the website, which acts as a common information portal that has become a virtual meeting point for REC members Europe-wide. Additionally, a permanent EUREC Secretariat was established to monitor developments and coordinate EUREC work.\n\nOther work involved exchanging information regarding national legal backgrounds and structures of European RECs, as well as exchanging experience with training programmes for REC members. Furthermore, EURECNET identified new partners to continue the European networking process \u2014 an important aspect of capacity building.\n\nA regular electronic newsletter was distributed during the project to inform about the proceedings, and a print newsletter helped raise awareness for EUREC. Results, proceedings, events and relevant news are also available on the website.\n\nEURECNET also made progress with regard to the drafting process of a 'Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC'. This was accomplished through dialogue in conjunction with the European Commission and relevant bodies.\n\nExpanding the network of European RECs, EURECNET contributed to consolidating and strengthening the base for ethical review of research in science and technology. Improved networking process an developing high-quality standards in clinical trials should also ensure the better protection of human research subjects.", null, "http://www.arec.org.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/140032.jpg", "fp7_97226_973636434"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DH6"}
