Such a network forms the infrastructural basis to promote awareness of specific working practices of RECs across Europe, to enhance the shared knowledge base of European RECs, to support coherent reviews and opinions and to meet new challenges and emerging ethical issues. The central objective of EURECNET as a Coordinating Action is to foster the already existing network of European REC networks (in short \u201cEUREC\u201d). In particular, the contribution of EURECNET aims at five different levels: - fostering a sustainable infrastructure for European RECs (including a statute and a secretariat) to promote exchange and cooperation and to allow for international cooperation; - gathering information on RECs in Europe to build a basis for mutual exchange - collecting and evaluating training materials for REC members to enhance the quality of review; - conducting capacity building to facilitate the development of national REC networks (as future partners of EUREC); - identifying emerging ethical issues to develop common solutions for challenges posed by new technologies and scientific methodologies.", 7178.0, 759809.0, "EURECNET", "A stronger base for ethical research", "An EU Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) Coordinating Action has helped to strengthen the work of EUREC, a network of organisations and bodies relevant to ethical research.", "The project 'European research ethics committees' network' (http://www.eurecnet.org (EURECNET)) worked to foster a sustainable infrastructure for European research ethics committees (RECs). In support of promoting exchange, cooperation, reviews and network development, the primary objectives covered five main areas: infrastructure, information gathering, training materials, capacity building and emerging ethical issues.\n\nProject efforts and deliverables succeeded in strengthening links between European RECs. One of these is the website, which acts as a common information portal that has become a virtual meeting point for REC members Europe-wide. Additionally, a permanent EUREC Secretariat was established to monitor developments and coordinate EUREC work.\n\nOther work involved exchanging information regarding national legal backgrounds and structures of European RECs, as well as exchanging experience with training programmes for REC members. Furthermore, EURECNET identified new partners to continue the European networking process \u2014 an important aspect of capacity building.\n\nA regular electronic newsletter was distributed during the project to inform about the proceedings, and a print newsletter helped raise awareness for EUREC. Results, proceedings, events and relevant news are also available on the website.\n\nEURECNET also made progress with regard to the drafting process of a 'Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC'. This was accomplished through dialogue in conjunction with the European Commission and relevant bodies.\n\nExpanding the network of European RECs, EURECNET contributed to consolidating and strengthening the base for ethical review of research in science and technology. Improved networking process an developing high-quality standards in clinical trials should also ensure the better protection of human research subjects.", null, "http://www.arec.org.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/140032.jpg", "fp7_97226_973636434"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5BE", "e+Lazos: Otra mirada hacia la ense\u00f1anza biling\u00fce", "Bowburn Infant and Nursery School", 127239.0, "The Regional Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports of Castilla-La Mancha, aware of the needs that the plurilingualism plans generate in schools, teachers, students and all the educational community, creates the consortium through the resolution of 18/10 / 2016, which calls for the selection of public educational schools to establish an Erasmus + Consortia under Key Action 1 in the School Education and Vocational Training sectors in the Erasmus + call for proposals and coordinates the Erasmus + Project \"e+ Ties: Another Look at bilingual education\" to respond to the needs of ten schools that need to give a new approach to their institutions to improve the quality of their educational offer.\r\n\r\nThe objectives are framed around five areas of needs:\r\n1. Area of organization and management of schools: To know other systems of organization of schools that facilitate the incorporation of bilingual programmes.\r\n2. Internationalization area: To foster internationalization through the participation and collaboration in European Programmes.\r\n3. Linguistic and methodological area: To make educational centers more attractive by improving the quality of their educational offer:\r\nA)To participate in bilingual programmes and offer Hight Quality Content and Language Integrated Learning in foreign languages (CLIL).\r\nB) To apply methodologies of active work in the classroom.\r\nC) To create new learning scenarios based on the Future Classroom Lab. \r\n4. Area of Integration and attention to diversity: Develop different strategies to be able to attend to diversity and promote integration and inclusion.\r\n5. \"Soft Skills\" development area: To develop teacher's own abilities that allow him/her deal better with the challenges of the school and the classroom as motivation, negotiation, delegation, time management, personal interaction, communication, resolution\r\nIn order to achieve them,  we propose courses in English Language, Active Methodologies, CLIL,  Teaching of English as a foreign Lnguage and  Attention to diversity in the United Kingdom and Ireland and courses in New Learning Scenarios in the Future Classroom Lab in Belgium. We also propose Job Shadowing periods in schools in different European countries (Belgium, Cyprus, Slovenia, Finland, Italy, Poland, Greece, United Kingdom and France). We highlight \u201cRitaharju School\" in Oulu, Finland, considered one of the eleven most innovative schools in the world.  Teachers of the centers that are part of the consortium will participate in this mobility activities.\r\n\r\nAn eTwinning project called \"eTwinning Ties\" will be founded and its Twinspace will be used as a platform for the development of the Erasmus+ project, document management, contact with consortium partners and host centers. Our objectives are to involve the rest of the teachers in the schools, to involve the students, to carry out collaborative activities with the students of the receiving schools and also to involve families and other members of the educational community.\r\n\r\nTo conclude the project, there will be an International Meeting that will last from 1 to 2 days. All the schools that are part of the consortium, their teachers, their students, other members of the educational community, other teachers  from the region, teachers and students from the receiving schools and different educational authorities will participate.   \r\n\r\nThe methodology used will be collaborative, as we seek to create professional links with the partners of the structured courses and with the host centers to work on European collaborative projects through eTwinning or Erasmus+ and to promote the internationalization of our institutions, a fact that will also guarantee sustainability and transferability of the project.\r\n\r\nThe results of the project will be reflected in:\r\n-The Institutions, which will incorporate systems of organization and management that will favor the implementation of bilingual and / or multilingual programs making them more attractive to increase the number of enrolled students.\r\n-Participants, both in the mobility activities and in the Consortium, who will see their professional development enhanced by improving their linguistic, methodological and other soft skills that will allow the incorporation in the teaching-learning process of new spaces, strategies, techniques and methodologies that will improve the quality of inclusive education.\r\n-The students, that will increase their motivation for education and as a consequence their academic results.\r\nThe results of the project \"e + Ties: Another look at bilingual education\" will be beneficial for the entire educational community as they will be transferable and disseminated to other teachers at regional, national and international level and will generate experiences that will allow the creation of new educational approaches framed in new learning scenarios.", "http://www.bowburn-inf.durham.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-037720_11"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DH6"}
