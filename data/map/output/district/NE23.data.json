This idea of a higher status links not only to student engagement but to staff success. There is the need to make professional relationships with schools abroad in order to strengthen the professional profile of the teaching professions. In addition, a consistently high level of French and Spanish throughout the department will help encourage students to learn through the example the teachers set.\r\n\r\nA higher status of MFL in our school would also lead to an increase in engagement. It is the case that the more engaged the student, the higher their attainment. In addition, a boost in engagement can prevent some students from leaving school early and not taking the opportunity to continue into KS5. It is also really important to mention that the students at Cramlington react well to finding out about different cultures and learning new languages. In the north east, where language \u2013learning is not as popular as other areas of England, there has been a struggle to interest students in other places in the world. That said, at Cramlington, students are very curious and would respond very well to a more European influence. This in turn would raise attainment.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to send 2 members of staff on structured training courses in France/Spain over 1year. These members of staff plan to go more than once over this time, as there will be a continual need for professional development, following on from our experiences. \r\n\r\nThe idea is to send two members of staff, both already proficient in French and Spanish to France and Spain in order to develop their language skills and to observe different methodologies. These members of staff will then return with their knowledge and use it to implement it into Cramlington\u2019s curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe staff involved will have regular meetings (once every two weeks) to discuss the action plan and the areas we would like to focus in particular during our trip. For example, it will be interesting to see how Spanish/French education uses differentiation to ensure everybody in the class is supported and challenged. Another area of interest for us will be how language learning can be more engaging for the students. It will be an excellent opportunity to share ideas with other practitioners, familiarize with schools both France and Spain with the potential to establish a partnership for trips abroad or multi-international projects in which students can see the benefits of learning the language and apply it to a real context. Also, it will be a great incentive for both students and teachers to bring back in the classroom the atmosphere and the thrill of being abroad after a week of cultural immersion. \r\n\r\nAfter the trip, we will organize a presentation to the department during CPD, displays around the school so the students can develop curiosity about going abroad therefore study the language. The school also set up a eTwinning programme and SKYPE project with the schools abroad so students can know each other and keep the language alive.  \r\n\r\nThe impacts that will follow from taking part in the project are several such as: \r\n\u2022 Improvement of language competence\r\n\u2022 Increased confidence\r\n\u2022 improvement of teaching methods\r\n\u2022 motivation of pupils and staff\r\n        \u2022 increased inter-cultural understanding through better contact with native speakers\r\n\u2022 professional networks to improve teaching and attainment", "http://www.cramlingtonlv.co.uk", "Cramlington Learning Village", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002097_coordinator"], ["7RD", "Mobile aujourd\u2019hui pour \u00eatre employable demain", "Fergusons Transport Ltd", 19956.0, "Sophie Germain high school is the promoter of the Erasmus+ project 2014-2015 and will give the opportunity to 12 motivated students, willing to live an unusual experience, to go to England as a trainee. They are students preparing a baccalaureate exam (High School Leaving Certificate) in administration & management, sales and trade.\r\nWe do have 18 work placement possibilities  and more (see appendix 2: letters of intent, appendix 3: list of partners) thanks to the relationships we developed  throughout the six previous Leonardo projects. However, we chose to give this opportunity only to 12 participants which gives us the possibility to have six extra safe work placements in case of problems. \r\nAfter several months of training (see appendix 1: work plan), the students will go to England in January & February 2015.  \r\nThey will do a work placement linked to their vocational training during four weeks in the area of Whitley Bay and Newcastle. \r\nStudents in administration & management will be welcomed in companies such as OXFAM, North Tyneside Council or Tynemet College or international companies such as  Fuda or Ferguson Transports. \r\nSales and trade students will get the opportunity to improve their skills in charity shops such as Age UK, Barnardos, British Heart Foundation, Red Cross,  and shops such as FE Maughan and Marks and Spencer, the new partner in this Erasmus+ project. \r\nOur students will individually stay at selected host families in order to encourage relationships and improve their English.   \r\nMrs Christine Goodwin, the manager of Northumbria school of English, will be in charge of selecting host families, providing linguistic support, and organising one cultural activity each weekend. She has been involved in our mobility projects for four years. \r\nOn Tuesday afternoons the participants will meet Whitley Bay High School students during tuitions where they will attend linguistic and cultural supports. Whitley Bay High School teachers all agree that French students show a real interest in the English language and culture.  This could lead them to be more open-minded and dynamic. Our participants mobility could also offer future prospects to English students who are not willing to leave their country. It will enable us to organise exchanges and encourage mobility in both countries. Our vocational high school is located in Thionville, in the core of \"La Grande R\u00e9gion\" (Luxemburg, France and Germany). This location makes this experience relevant. Indeed, mobility with these three countries is a characteristic of local employment markets with the increasing number of border workers. This new application aims at securing this need to get interested in other farther European countries. One of our school project priorities is the mobility development. Moreover getting involved in such a project enables to meet the demand of the objectives of our European sections.  \r\nSuch a project offers obvious and important benefits for our students. This mobility is a profitable experience, useful and enriching their professional career. Discovering a new culture and improving language skills will develop autonomy, responsability,  and self-fulfillment.  Besides, a one-month work placement for our students, in an English company, will encourage the awareness of  European citizenship. Indeed very few students are unaware of this concept because they are not used to travelling. The impact of mobility on our students will help them to pass their examination more easily and to get the \"European\" Mention plus the \"Europass Mobility Certificate\". Thus, thanks to an improved C.V., their job search or future studies should be faced with less anxiety.  \r\nConsequently, they will be more likely to work on the European or international market.  This Erasmus+ project will make our Sophie Germain high school, the Region Lorraine and the European Union more attractive and enhance their values and fame. \r\nWe will try and share our experience and activities with the press and media, which hopefully should raise interest in other students to join the programme. \r\nTo put it in a nutshell, the educational systems have to upgrade and fit into the new ways of teaching and learning. Therefore, we have the duty to carry on with this new European Erasmus+ project.", "http://www.fergytrux.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA102-000292_9"], ["6BN", "Internacionalizaci\u00f3n de la educaci\u00f3n inclusiva de personas con necesidades espec\u00edficas de apoyo educativo con metodolog\u00eda de aprendizaje basado en proyectos (ABP).", "Cramlington Learning Village", 5818.0, "This project was born from the need to know other academic environments where students work with specific  educational needs within the framework of a methodology PBL (Project based learning), in particular students with any degree of hearing loss (deep hearing loss / cochlear implant Or hearing aid) and in an inclusive way.\r\nThe need to know other strategies, resources and materials that allow the adaptation of the students in all modules and subjects they study, so that the realization of an PBL task is interdisciplinary.

This new form of education is based on the need to change the paradigm of the learning process, which unfolds without knowing why and for what or their need in life, meaningful learning. The PBL allows all students to learn, in an inclusive way, socially building knowledge.\r\nAnother aim of this project is to know how to work the deficiencies of the motor or sensory type in the classes of Physical Education integrated with the rest of the students.\r\n1 mobility activities are planned for a total of 5 teachers from the center. Each visit will have a duration of 5 days in the reception center and will be programmed activities dedicated to the observation of practical teaching with students with specific educational support needs. Teachers from the center will take part, specially the Department of educational guidance, Mathematics and Physical Education.\r\n It will follow a participatory methodology and focused on the observation of communication between peers and teachers, where the exchange of didactic and pedagogical resources will be promoted.\r\n\r\nThe METHODOLOGY of the organization of mobility of teaching staff abroad by the experience that we already have in our center consists of the following phases: contacts with host partner, selection of candidates, linguistic and cultural preparation by the faculty, signature by all (E-mail, telephone, final report in the Erasmus Mobility Tool) that contact the international coordinator in the destination, collection of the Documentation provided by the faculty upon their return (certificate of attendance and Europass).\r\nAll these phases are widely known by our IES since we have been doing it for 12 years with the students under other programs for FP students and in the academic year 2015-2016 also with teachers in our two projects mentioned above KA 101, KA102 and KA103 .\r\n Our quality standards are demanding and the approval of this Project will allow us to request with sufficient merits the second project that would have in the Institute for Secondary Education and focused on students with specific educational support needs,  given that our center is cataloged as a center of compensatory education and presents Pupils with a special educational need for recognized disabilities (sensorial, physical and intellectual), students with socio-cultural disadvantage and students with serious learning difficulties.\r\n It is also intended to create a climate of trust to request in the near future stays of one week of students with hearing loss accompanied by a teacher of our center. For this purpose, 5 teachers will be selected according to criteria set by the Selection Committee (involvement shown with the European Programs, involved in PBL methodology and language competences) who must be responsible for the dissemination of the training received to produce the highest Possible impact in the school.", "http://www.cramlingtonlv.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-036780_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NE23"}
