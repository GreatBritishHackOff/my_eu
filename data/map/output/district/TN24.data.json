The volunteering focusses on activities that are related to people who need extra support. The volunteers in Rotterdam work for a great diversity of organizations, like a women shelter, an art gallery that educates less priveleged youth, a production kitchen where housemade products are made, together with special education students, a primary school with a coloured population of children, a gym for people with limitations, and an organization that supports people with mental and physical limitations. \r\nThe volunteers in the Zutphen area work at a biodynamic farm (De Vijfsprong; Vorden) or residence for children with limitations (de Kleine Koning, Vierakker). \r\n\r\nObjectives of the project:\r\nThere are different objectives. From the organizational perspective, the aim is to support local organizations that aim to support local people in need. From the volunteer's perspective, the aim is to let volunteers get to know social work and the different ways how social work can be organised and how this is done in the Netherlands. Besides, volunteers learn to work and live with a multicultural group of people and how to can grow in their role as active citizen. \r\n\r\n17 volunteers are involved in this project (one volunteer will participate in a short term project (2 months lasting) and long term (3 months lasting). \r\n\r\nDescription of activities: All volunteer support activities that aim to help people that are in need of extra care. The content of the work is diverse: the activities consist of playing activities with children, educational activities, art and cultural activities for less priveleged young people, production of food products, farm work, household chores, administrative activities and sports activities, . \r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project: \r\nThe volunteers learn while doing. They execute operational activities and collaborate with professionals that are trained and educated in the social field. By watching how professionals work, the volunteers learn to know different working methods and strategies that are relevant in the social field. In case volunteers show a motivation, they can set up their own project that aims on a social goal and that is in line with Erasmus+ objectives. \r\n\r\nResults and impact: volunteers learn to know about social work, their role as active citizen and what type of work they like and dislike. The learn to adapt by living in an apartment/house with other volunteers and running a household. Local community benefits because of the structural support that is received by the volunteers: this is beneficial for the individual people in need but also for the organizations that support these people. Volunteers bring new cultural input in the organizations that can give input for the organization that they support. \r\n\r\nLong term benefits: volunteers learn about working ethics, like being reliable, work according to the rules, coming in time. These general competencies that are helpful for their future careers. This is especially true for volunteers that are over 25 and have very little working experience. Volunteers also learn to develop their skills to live and work with a diverse group of people. Also this is an important competency for their future life. \r\nLava Legato learns new things from a group of volunteers each time: rules change, activities are adjusted, mentors are replaced, accommodation is changed, all to optimise the organization of EVS. \r\n\r\nResults and impact envisaged: \r\nThe main result is related to broadening the horizon of people involved: professionals learn to work with young people (from abroad) who might have a different view/approach on a working strategy, clients/students/children learn to know people from abroad, the volunteers bring foreign influences inside their organization. Last but not least, volunteers learn about working strategies, habits, norms and values of a country which is foreign for them. This makes them (more) aware of their own cultural background, but they also learn to know the Dutch culture from the inside.", "http://creativeashford.org/tag/the-creative-collective", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL02-KA105-001625_4"], ["8RY", "Sharpen up your skills", "The Creative Collective", 20214.0, "The project \u2018\u2019Sharpen up your skills\u2019\u2019 started from the need to find a way to reduce the unemployment rate which is increasingly rise and influence youth, and especially young people in provincial areas. The best way to stand against this, is to prepare appropriate the new comers in the employment field. This programme aims to give the opportunity to people with fewer opportunities- as those who live in provincial areas- to learn, to share experiences, and to explore various tools, techniques, and practices on issues such as employability, active participation in social environment and entrepreneurship.\r\nThe main objectives by the implementation of this project are: to increase the knowledge about possible ways and opportunities of employability and develop promotional skills in order to improve the ability to promote their strengths and make more attractive CVs)\r\n To familiarize with the term of \u2018\u2019entrepreneurship\u2019\u2019 and acquire the relevant skills in order to be an entrepreneur.

Also to gain promotional skills (expression tools: to develop and improve the ability to promote their strengths and make more attractive CVs).\r\nThe main activities of the youth exchange program were formed in order to meet the objectives of the program. Significant role to the exchange has the visits to some entrepreneurship samples in real life, business that built up in provincial areas by youth people that origin from these areas.\r\nThroughout the youth exchange, there will be a combination of methods and activities of formal and non-formal education, such as team-work presentations and statistics and team-building activities and role-playing respectively. The participants will not only gain more knowledge through these activities but also they will bring them more close to each other. Thus, the participants will get the opportunity to discover each other\u2019s cultures and uniqueness. They will be a combination of the non-formal educational methods with formal and informal methods, making sure that participants are engaged in all activities and have enough time for reflection.\r\nWe expect that \u2018Sharpen up your skills\u2019 will have at first direct impact on the participants and the target groups. In particular, the participants will have a better idea of what is going on in the working field and which are the appropriate tools to develop their skills. \r\nFinally, young people will gain important knowledge about Erasmus+ opportunities giving them the opportunity to become volunteers and active citizens.
