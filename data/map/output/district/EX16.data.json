The static types are much cheaper but apart from producing a lot of waste (paper, glue, ink) they are also limited as they are not capable of real time advertising. In addition, human resources are required for changing images, generating additional costs for the board owners. Dynamic (digital) advertising is becoming more popular but they consume energy constantly and limited in some applications (curved surface, glare of the sun, light pollution).\nSPABRINK aims to fill the gap between static and dynamic advertising by developing a tool that is capable of displaying static images that can be changed digitally through the internet. SPABRINK will only use energy during the image change and can be operated remotely, hence differentiating it from both existing static and dynamic outdoor advertising. Furthermore, the technology will allow displaying images on curved surfaces making it the only available tool for certain markets (e.g.: advertising columns)\nThe technology will allow onsite printing of adverts and the printed image can be wiped off while the ink can be reused after separation. The end result will be a new advertising tool that can be controlled remotely to display different images periodically without creating waste and will only use energy during image change (could be operated with a battery).\nThis new novel tool will use the innovative combination of existing and new technologies. It will be a low cost, low maintenance advertising board that will be remotely operated to display the required static images in real time. The final product is proposed to be a reusable and self-printing advertising board. This board will consist of a reusable printing surface, a printing module, an ink-remover and collector system, and a specially developed reusable ink. All components will be enclosed into the board\u2019s housing allowing the width and height of the board to be flexibly chosen. The flexible printing surface will also allow for use on non-flat surfaces, being ideal for bus stops or advertising pillars.", 83466.0, 1137365.0, "SPABRINK", "Eco-friendly self-printing billboards", "This project is working to produce a cost-effective, environmentally friendly and real-time outdoor media tool. This proposed new system is as visually effective as a paper-based advertisement board, but more eco-friendly than printed advertisements and digital displays.", "SPABRINK (Self-printing advertisement board with reusable ink) works like a printer using coloured powder deposited through a piezoelectric ceramic printing head onto an electrostatic surface. The adhesion force can be precisely manipulated so the powder can be easily removed. Because of the kind of material used for displaying images, colours are achieved through a custom-developed colour scheme. The system incorporates a web-based user-friendly interface enabling live content monitoring through a built-in camera.\n\nThe project started with a market survey, an in-depth component search and requirement analysis for system specifications. Research was carried out for selection of the most suitable powder attachment technology. Different nozzles and ink materials were tested for the optimum way to deposit the power and required powder quantity. Detailed specifications were laid down for the control system and the auxiliary parts, including the mechanical parts and the monitoring unit.\n\nA complete design specification was put together containing the necessary features for each part of the project. Maintaining compatibility between components was noted as an important feature of all subunits, which will be especially critical in the integration phase.\n\nSpray technology development started with powder selection with attention to factors like electrostatic, dielectric and magnetic properties, printing head compatibility, and economic and health-related aspects. The selected pulverisable solid powder material exhibits good colour properties and printability while being inexpensive and environmentally friendly. Basic experiments were carried out to test the possible means of separations.\n\nThe mechanical design of the system started in month eight and the rolling mechanism required for the electrostatic surface was successfully designed. The exact definition of the parts in this design will be used in the prototype.", null, "http://www.fraser-antistatic.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-10/163462.jpg", "fp7_109853_952157045"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "hospitalName"], "data": [["6NT", "RH8", "Tiverton and District Hospital"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EX16"}
