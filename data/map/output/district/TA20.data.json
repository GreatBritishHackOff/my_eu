Approximately 30% of people over 65 fall accidentally each year, and for those over 80 this rate raises up to 50%. Falls are an important factor in the health limitations of the elderly due to a high morbidity caused by physical and psychological consequences, loss of independence and even death. Late or non existing responses cause 2 million persons having to be hospitalized and approximately 85000 deaths can be attributed each year to this fact. There are a number of alarm devices trying to satisfy the need of an early intervention in case of fall, but existing fall detectors do not have a remarkable social impact neither a significant market penetration: just 4.5% of Europe&apos;s potential end users have any of the existing social alarms. Two facts hinder their effectiveness of the existing fall detectors, capping therefore the market demand: bad ergonomics and lack of reliability. FallWatch project proposes a new generation fall detector device included in a whole fall detection system and is thought as an effective way of minimizing the consequences of falls in the elderly. FallWatch will automatically detect a fall and immediately contact the health services to allow an early intervention. FallWatch will produce, on the one hand, a miniaturized fall detector device of a scale reduction by 50% of existing devices, and on the other hand, biocompatible materials for the device\u2019s package and for an adhesive patch to comfortably stick the device to the user\u2019s skin. FallWatch system will solve the reliability problem by using both wearable device and environmental infra red sensors at the user\u2019s home and developing a specific data fusion algorithm that will cross check the variables to avoid false alarms. In order to achieve the ergonomics and reliability goals, FallWatch project will work in different technological areas which are widely explained along this proposal.", 93443.0, 1274766.0, "FALLWATCH", "Novel device enhancing care for older generation", "Fall detectors, used mostly by the elderly, are limited by bad ergonomics and unreliability. A group of researchers proposed a new-generation device encompassing a whole fall detection system that enables early intervention and minimises the consequences of falls for this vulnerable population.", "Funded by the EU, the objective of the project 'A wearable miniaturised fall-detection system for the elderly' http://www.fallwatch-project.eu/ ((FALLWATCH)) was to develop a wearable and radio-communicating fall-detection device. The first of its kind, the Vigi'Fall solution comprises a miniaturised embedded electronic device patched to the skin.\n\nSeeking to overcome deficiencies of existing fall-detection products, FALLWATCH project partners advanced the concept of a comprehensive system able to manage a fall event from the moment it happens. From detecting the event to assessing its cause to initiating medical intervention, Vigi'Fall is a 'context-aware' rather than a standalone system.\n\nEmbedded on the holder, the device continuously measures kinematics and classifies the situation according to low, medium or high activity. Another system component, an in-home control box, monitors ambient activity from movement detectors, classifying the situation on its own three-degree scale (inactivity, average or exceptional).\n\nMiniaturisation of the device involved complex technological routes for electronics (miniaturised multi-chip module (MCM)) and battery miniaturisation. Other technical work included development of a fall-detection algorithm, the construction and testing of an electrochromic display, the development and manufacture of a functional mechanical biocompatible package, and the selection of silicon material for the housing.\n\nThe prototype has been delivered and integrates the whole system, covering MCM, battery, electrochromic device, package and patch. Vigi'Fall has been validated on a first version of the prototype; following the industrialisation phase, it will be refined to produce a commercial first version of the device.\n\nFALLWATCH achievements not only have the potential to better respond to the needs of the elderly in the event of a fall; a range of sectors will also benefit greatly. Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) partners will boost their competitiveness and help develop MCM and battery design, biocompatible materials and packaging, electrochromic pigments and high-tech electronics in general. Moreover, SMEs will have extended opportunities in the human health market.", "http://www.fallwatch-project.eu/", "http://www.pmbl.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014-01/58267.jpg", "fp7_95777_991971956"], ["1FA", "Optimization of process, quality and cost as well as clinical tests of the wearable miniaturized fall detection system for the elderly", "Pmbl Limited", "During the previous FP7-SME\u20132008\u20131-FallWatch Research programme, a miniaturized fall detection device, Vigi\u00b4Fall\u2122 has been developed, achieving the following characteristics and performances:\n- Ergonomics: Vigi\u2019Fall has been miniaturized to a scale 50% smaller than current devices. Additionnal biocompatible materials for the casing and the adhesive patche make it comfortable and easy to stick to the user\u2019s skin\n- Reliability: to tackle the high rate of false alarms that hinder the market, the FALLWATCH Consortium has develop a enhanced data fusion algorithm that crosses check accelerometers and heartbeat frequency meter monitored by the wearable device and infra red environmental information from the user\u2019s home\nThe present project will represent the next step, i.e. the progression from research developments and lab-prototype to industrialization and commercializable products. It will aim at:\n- Adapting the technology to the US standards, controlling the performances  of the device, optimizing the component selection, process and overall cost\n- Organizing clinical trials to demonstrate and validate the high performances of Vigi\u201dFall\n- Obtaining CE marking and FDA clearance to launch Vigi\u2019Fall to the EU and US markets\n- Develop the best business strategy and commercialization routes\nFALLWATCH Demo will offer to the market a new generation of practical, easy to use and install, reliable fall detector, which thanks to a strong supply chain of SMEs (Vigilio, BSE, PMBL & Plastod) and a large company (AEMtec) will enable an enhanced quality of life to millions of European citizens, saving more than 10.000 hospitalizations and above 3.000 premature deaths caused by falls.", 150461.0, 1201758.0, "FALLWATCH DEMO", "Keeping Grandma safe", "Already commercialised in European countries and soon in the USA, the Vigi'Fall patch is characterised by fewer false alarms and a more cost-effective design to automatically detect all kinds of falls in the elderly.", "As more of the population becomes elderly, so grows the need for improved care products for the elderly. Many of us are familiar with an older version of the device used by the elderly to call for help by pressing a button. What many may not know is that the old design was cumbersome and generated numerous false alarms.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'Optimization of process, quality and cost as well as clinical tests of the wearable miniaturized fall detection system for the elderly' (http://www.fallwatch-demo.eu (FALLWATCH DEMO)) was initiated to upgrade and optimise the Vigi'Fall\u00ae solution, an improved version of a similar device. It brings together an extensive network of European technology and expertise for this purpose.\n\nVigi'Fall\u00ae has a tiny triangular patch that can be worn by the user in a non-intrusive, permanent manner. Smaller by 50%, the addition of biocompatible materials for the case and the adhesive patch makes the device user-friendly and more comfortable. This improved version optimises functionality and accuracy even further by incorporating heartbeat monitoring and motion sensing to dramatically reduce false alarms. It measures one\u2019s posture and intensity of movement and heartbeat to grade one\u2019s movements into low, medium or high intensity category. The interaction between the device worn by the user, the infrared motion sensors mounted throughout the living area and a central control box ensures optimised accuracy.\n\nTechnical optimisation is earmarked for the second half of this project. Areas to be addressed include battery life, heart rate module, obtaining relevant certifications and compatibility with the US market. The completed marketing research and business plan will include product launching commercially in the US and internationally.\n\nThis improved device is expected to reduce hospital visits by 500,000 and reduce the 40,000 premature deaths caused by falls in Europe every year. The elderly, the families and friends that care for them will all benefit from commercialisation of Vigi'Fall\u00ae.", null, "http://www.pmbl.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/145801.jpg", "fp7_106817_991971956"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "hospitalName"], "data": [["1NF", "RH5", "Chard  Community Hospital"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TA20"}
