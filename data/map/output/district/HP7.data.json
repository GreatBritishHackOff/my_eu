Addressing this grave human and economic challenge requires efficient solutions that do not exist yet: tools to detect and diagnose persons at an early phase, and interventions for delaying disease progression.<br/>PredictND provides an objective ICT-based approach for diagnostics of neurodegenerative diseases. It is based on the principles of evidence-based data-driven medicine and builds upon previous successful Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) projects.  An existing decision support tool is enhanced to meet the needs of clinical practice and validated in real conditions across several EU regions. The first goal is to show that modern computer-based models enable earlier and more objective clinical diagnostics. The second goal is to improve cost-efficiency of early diagnostics by developing a low-cost test battery that detects persons at high risk of dementia and forwards these persons to more accurate (and expensive) clinical tests. Everything is implemented as an ICT ecosystem that integrates the clinical decision support tool with services for citizens for assessing the risk of diseases. Thus, PredictND transfers the scientific VPH concepts not only to clinical practice but to an environment suitable for solving the larger challenge of dementia.<br/>PredictND impacts healthcare professionals by providing tools for objective and earlier diagnostics. The tools, combined with interventions that delay disease progression will increase the quality of life for patients and their caregivers. PredictND also reduces costs to society and produces new scientific understanding of this family of diseases.

Another novel putative cancer marker is the enzyme choline kinase alpha, responsible for the synthesis of the major membrane lipid phosphatidyl choline. Choline kinase alpha is in turn regulated by the Rho family of GTPases through a complex membrane lipid biosynthesis pathway.\n\nSmall molecule inhibitors of choline kinase alpha have already reached early clinical trials, supporting the notion that this enzyme and the whole pathway could be explored as avenues of therapy. Based on this, the EU-funded CANCERALIA project will investigate the potential of targeting the biochemical pathways involved in lipid metabolism and small G proteins for the treatment of lung and pancreatic cancers.\n\nAnalysis of the lipid and gene expression profiles of over 200 lung carcinomas has revealed some interesting results. Analysis of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in the membrane lipid metabolism pathway will hopefully identify genes associated with high risk of lung or pancreatic cancer. This information on the genetic variation of the lipid biosynthesis pathway will also prove useful for prognosis and response to therapy.\n\nAdditionally, the CANCERALIA consortium is interested in predicting the response to choline kinase alpha inhibitors. To this end, scientists have developed specific in vitro models of resistant and sensitive tumours and have managed to identify ASAH1 as a possible marker predictive of lack of response as well as a possible new therapeutic target. Furthermore, they are in the process of associating the response to choline kinase alpha inhibitors with gene and lipid expression patterns.\n\nNew non-invasive imaging tools will facilitate the evaluation of the activity of choline kinase in vivo. Partners are proposing to use labeled choline precursors for screening patients with lung cancer by positron emission tomography (PET).\n\nThe lipid and protein profiles of lung and pancreatic cancers have the potential to generate information on key genes and their association with prognosis and response to conventional therapies.
