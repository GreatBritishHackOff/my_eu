The goals of the projects are to offer meaningful utilization of free time of young people and to increase European awareness in different regions and social groups among young people in Slovakia. The duration of the project when the EVS volunteers are in our organization is 24 months. In the project the volunteers will have space to create and realise their own projects what will help in converging of Europe and their citizens.   \r\n\r\nNowadays - in the socialy isolated society - it is necessary for real people to meet real people, to meet them FACE to FACE. If we do not start to do and live this, then not only our country but the whole Europe will be conected with social networks but despite of this, it will be isolated. Therefore - we want the volunteer to come and be a good example for people in our cultural context\r\n- we want to deepen EU awareness with personal example. We see that during these personal times, there will be an exchange of information and experiences, looking for common values and during this the volunteer will learn a lot , create friendships, educate himself and change his / her attitudes and character. \r\n\r\nThe title of the project is YOUR LIFE AS AN EXAMPLE TO OTHERS\r\nWe see 3 reasons for realisation of this project\r\na) EVS as a positive example of service for others\r\nb) increasing of EU awarness \r\nc) elimination of social isolation \r\n\r\nThe project will be realized in three levels. \r\nThe first level is the local level (town P\u00fachov). There will be organised a conversation course for citizens of P\u00fachov and there will arise participation in local activities of the local community. These can happen through dialogues, games, songs, presentations, etc. This will be connected with realisation of international European meetings. \r\n\r\nThe second level is the regional level which involves the town P\u00fachov (20.000 citizens), village Z\u00e1rie\u010die (800 citizens), village Lazy pod Makytou (1.400), Pova\u017esk\u00e1 Bystrica (42.000 citizens) and others. Here will be concentration on cooperation on regional youth projects, sports, music and educational activities, as well as there will be the opportunity for volunteers to participate in the local activities in these towns and villages (depending on the skills of the volunteers). In these towns and villages there will be organised also some international European meetings that will increase European awareness and the programme Erazmus +. The volunteers will participate in realization of different youth meetings (many of them are in small villages) in the area from Myjava region to Martin region where they will inter alia present their EVS service. \r\n\r\nThe third level is the national level that includes for example projects Helping Hand (based on outdoor activities and experiencing of pedagogic supporting of a healthy life style) and Semfest (national youth open-air festival) where above mentioned focuses will be integrated in different ways.   \r\n\r\nThe third level is the national level that includes national projects like Helping Hand, Meet God, Semfest orSport olympiade, where there will be space to integrate above mentioned focuses.", "http://www.timeforgod.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SK02-KA105-001309_3"], ["5RR", "Regional Youth Contact", "Time For God", 37776.0, "The Regional Youth Contact (RYC) is an activity and information platform through which youth from different cultures, religions/ church denominations and ethnic groups meet, become acquainted with each other and learn to appreciate each other as they participate in a variety of bridgebuilding activities. EVS volunteers help organize these activities and  participate in them; building bridges of friendship, faith and understanding and breaking down walls of prejudice, ignorance and indifference.\r\n\r\nThe RYC is a long-term individual 11 month EVS project during which we want to host five volunteers. Four Sending Organisations from Programme countries will be our partners. We will host two volunteers from Great Britain, one from Germany, one from France and one from Hungary. wo volunteers are positioned at the Atlantic Bridge center (The Vierslag), where they will assist in the running of a local youth club while also  helping with the facilities management of the center; administration, housekeeping, caring for guests, gardening, etc. Of the three remaining volunteers, two are positioned in the town of  Goes, the central town of the region of Beveland, and one is placed in the town of Middelharnis, the central town of the region of Goeree Overflakkee. In these towns and regions they will be involved in youth culture research projects, visiting youth clubs, build contacts with students, assist in language lessons, assist in leading a Bridgebuilders Club in school, doing presentations about their own culture and heritage, and promoting the activities of building bridges in the region. \r\n\r\nThe themes of the project are European Awareness, Youth work & participation, and Ethics, religion and philosophy (Inter-religious dialogue). The objective is building bridges across the many polarisations and walls in our world and in our communities close by. \r\nCentral to the success of the RYC is a local support network in the region where a RYC is established. Youth work becomes a community effort with various groups complementing each other and with a special role for the older generation to initiate and participate in building these bridges.\r\n\r\nThe potential long term benefit of this project is found in the building of exemplary positive communities of which young people need to be part as they are our future. Connecting them with each other, helping them find their personal, cultural and historic value will  establish a bridge to future generations as good experiences spread also back to their own countries and communities.

The main component of the project is the voluntary service, working for and with people on the edge of Dutch society (e.g. homeless people, (former) drug addicts, people, immigrants, mentally disabled people and children in disadvantaged neighbourhoods). \r\n\r\nAnother important component of the Amsterdam Voluntary Year is the intercultural exchange that takes place when living together (or spending a lot of time together) within an international community.\r\n\r\nTo support the Non Formal Learning process during their service, the volunteers are offered an extensive training & support programme. This includes a language training and training seminars, as well as a (work) supervisor at the host organisation, a contactperson and a mentor.\r\n\r\nWe offer trainings for all the volunteers taking part in the voluntary year in order to better equip them for the year.  For these trainings we use the 4 Dimensions of life:\r\n- Myself\r\n- Society\r\n- The other\r\n- God/ Spirituality\r\n\r\nThe result of this training will be that the volunteers reflect on themselfs and the relationship with others and develop capacities that they can use in their work and social life.\r\n\r\nA language course will also be offered to all volunteers in order that they can better intergrate in their projects and Dutch society by being equipted with the basics of the Dutch language. We support the learning process of the volunteers by helping them with setting learning goals and reflecting on them and their process during the year.\r\nIn the end the volunteers will be equipped with a Youthpass.

Solas Project has a strong reputation both within the community and with partnering community organisations for building relationships with young people. The children which Solas Project supports have been identified as the most in need of a community which faces social and economic disadvantage. Afterschool clubs provide an opportunity for stability, nutrition, healthy peer and adult relationship building, exposure to new activities to promote confidence, and support for young people to meet their full potential. \r\nSolas Project also has extensive experience working with and supporting short and long term volunteers. Volunteers make up the heart of the organisation, numbering over 150 volunteers in the 2016-2017 school year. The impact that EVS volunteers have on the children and the community is a special one. Similarly, the kids have a special impact on the volunteers. While the kids can exhibit challenging behaviours, partially due to their own challenging environments, volunteers routinely say the best part of their experience was spending time with kids and the fun they had with them. \r\n\r\nThe objectives for the project include:\r\n\u2022 Providing support through energetic long term volunteers to Solas Project\u2019s work with children and young people in South Inner City Dublin- with a focus to meetings its 5 objectives for children.\r\n\u2022 Encouraging a spirit of mutual learning for volunteers where they are supported in their learning and development while also supporting the learning and development of the children they are working with.\r\n\u2022 To further the values of Europe by supporting cultural sharing and widening the horizons of work and travel for volunteers, as well as the upcoming generation of children and young people in South Inner City Dublin. \r\n\u2022 Building both the personal and career capabilities of EVS volunteers who come to participate.\r\n\r\nNumber and Profile of Participants:\r\nThe project will involve 3 EVS participants. Participants will be a mix of male and female, with one male and one female starting in September, to be joined by a third person of either gender in January. They should be enthusiastic about working with children and young people and willing to learn and try new skills. \r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nThe Club strives to be \u2018a home away from home\u2019. Sitting around a table having a meal, helping with homework, doing a fun activity together \u2013 in all these ways we are striving to create a loving environment that is safe, peaceful, encouraging, stimulating and constructive. We support children to grow up to be healthy, confident and caring members of their community. Volunteers will have the opportunity to lead activities, plan for trips, and participate in the office support of the programme. Other activity opportunities exist in The Bridge, to help young people transition to secondary school, in Solas Sport and Solas at School, in Step Up, one to one mentoring for secondary school students, and in The Yard, leading woodworking workshops for schools. The aim for all activities is to develop relationships, to broaden horizons and experience, and to build confidence and self-worth.\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nWe will work with sending organisations to identify, prepare, and place volunteers in the most suitable activity for their experience and interest. Their placements are flexible to suit the interests of the volunteer and the needs of the programmes. Volunteers will be supported in three main aspects once at Solas Project. First, by the volunteer manager who will ensure they are integrating well to Solas Project and Dublin. Second, by the programme manager who will provide daily supervision to help with challenges in their work with children. And thirdly, by an external mentor who will support their personal development. Informal and non-formal learning will be ongoing driven by the volunteer's goals. Volunteers will work on Youthpass as means of goal development during their participation and offered the opportunity to complete it at the end.\r\n\r\nResults and Impact\r\nFirstly, the impact for the children is in the meeting of their basic needs for safety, health, stability, learning and fun with consistent adults and environment. It is in the broadening of their horizons through cultural sharing and awareness of opportunities. Secondly, the impact for volunteers is in the building of transferable skills for future study or employment, as well as in their own confidence and personal development. It is an opportunity for them to broaden their own horizons, experience a new culture and fully immerse themselves in the Dublin community. We also hope there will be a long term benefit to the larger community from sharing of cultures. We hope that the volunteers will go back to their own communities and bring with them some of what they experienced in Dublin.", "http://www.timeforgod.org", null, "erasmus_2017-2-IE01-KA105-025743_2"], ["5RR", "Changing Lives: Service to Others and Self-Leadership", "Time For God", 173516.0, "The project \u201cChanging Lives: Service to Others and Self-Leadership\u201d has been developed by Time for God (TfG), drawing on more than 50 years\u2019 experience in international volunteering, and building on strong partnerships with multiple European and UK-based organisations.\r\nThe project is expected to bring volunteers from 9 different countries (Germany, Hungary, Ukraine, France, Italy, Slovakia, Spain, Poland and Belgium) to the UK, for an 11-12 month volunteering experience in one of 8 project activities. \r\nVolunteers will be supported by their Sending Organisations (SOs), by TfG, and by the Receiving Organisations (ROs) with which they will undertake their activities. Volunteers will develop their professional skills and knowledge as well as their intercultural experience. Each RO is involved in activities that benefit local communities, so volunteers will be directly aiding these communities with their service.\r\n\r\nThe project is designed to meet the following objectives:   \r\n1) Challenge young people to become actively involved in society by \u2018being there\u2019 and caring for others, especially those on the edge of society\r\n2) Give the volunteer new skills and work experience through volunteering\r\n3) Develop the volunteer\u2019s capacity to work, and/or live in, groups/teams\r\n4) Get to know the British culture, people and language \u2018from the inside\u2019\r\n5) Promote intercultural dialogue between young people (in the volunteer group, but also in the local community of which the volunteer is part)\r\n6) Challenge the volunteer to reflect critically on his/her spirituality and be open to other religions & ways of life\r\n7) Benefit the Receiving Organisation with the enthusiasm and cross cultural experience of a volunteer, who is able to augment the work of paid staff members with energy, new perspectives and time to build relationships with the community/ client group being served. \r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that this project will involve 20 volunteers, who will have a range of socio-economic backgrounds. TfG encourage participation from volunteers who may otherwise struggle to access opportunities for higher education or work experience, whether this is due to geographical reasons, health problems, or economic obstacles. It is anticipated that the project will be accessed by both male and female volunteers. \r\n\r\nThe specific tasks of a volunteer will vary with the different ROs, but all will involve an element of service to others, and all volunteers will be given comprehensive training and ongoing support and supervision to help them manage the challenges of this type of work. \r\n\r\nSeveral methods (including the Youthpass tool and various TfG-created documents) will be used to monitor the success of the project and gain feedback on the learning achieved by the participants.", "http://www.timeforgod.org", "Time For God", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-036071_coordinator"], ["5RR", "\u00d6nk\u00e9ntesek a B\u00e9k\u00e9\u00e9rt", "Time For God", 108965.0, "Type of activities: \r\nLong-term voluntary service (EVS), 11 Months.\r\nNumber of volunteers: 20 people\r\nPlacements: Budapest (12 vols), Magyarmecske and Gilv\u00e1nfa (3), Debrecen (3), Baja (1) and \u00c9rd.\r\nLength of service: September 1. 2017 \u2013 July 31. 2018\r\nCountries: France (1 volunteer), Germany (5), Italy (2), England (2), The Netherlands (2), Romania (3), Slovakia (1) Ukraine (4) \r\nCoordinating organisation MRSZ Foundation ODE Program Office. \r\nSending partners are 9 different organisations.

In today\u2019s Europe it is highly important to talk about and protest for peace-making.\r\nThis does not accrue only in humanitarian actions but also young people expressing their longing for peace and the acceptance of differences in a colourful group using their own abilities. \r\nThroughout the project the young people will have the chance not only to know the culture of others but to improve their personalities and take part of an intensive learning process. In this way they will help others and at the same time would be able to learn about themselves gaining considerable self-knowledge.  \r\nThe main goal of the project for the volunteers is to get involved and get engaged with the tasks of the placement. They will get all the help to define the common goals as well as their personal ones. In this project 20 volunteers are involved out of 4 partner countries (Ukraine) and 16 volunteers are from program countries. \r\nThis way there will be an intensive dialogue between the volunteers so they can learn much of each-other and at the same time will be able to observe the culture and the costumes of the other.  \r\nWe are planning on to create a Flash mob where volunteers and placements are calling the attention of the society for peace and peace making given the nature of Flash mob speaking loudly and spreading its message.
