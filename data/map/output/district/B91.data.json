The magnetic properties of the entities offer an additional dimension for their manipulation by external magnetic fields, e.g. for flow reactors, for recovery from the environment, for imaging (MRI) or for directed targeting of tumors in living beings. The consortium spans the synthesis of coated (graphene, silica, polymers) magnetic nanoparticles with metal and metal oxides cores, covalent and non-covalent functionalization with chemical and biomedical agents, applications in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis for fine chemical production or detoxification of the environment, or biomedical applications such as tumor recognition, drug delivery or gene transfection.

Their promise lies in the fact that materials take on unique properties when their sizes approach the nano scale (around a billionth of a metre).\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.magneticfun.eu (MAG(NET)ICFUN) (Functionalized magnetic nanoparticles and their application in chemistry and biomedicine) project aims to develop magnetic nanoparticles for chemical and biomedical uses.\n\nA consortium of six academic institutions and three companies is working on three main topics centred on specific properties of the nanoparticles. Within each topic, researchers will focus on various stages of magnetic nanoparticle manufacture and application.\n\nThese stages include creating and characterising the nanoparticles, giving them a specific function and testing the newly developed particles for practical applications.\n\nMAG(NET)ICFUN is particularly interested in using magnetic nanoparticles for speeding up chemical reactions, detoxifying environmental pollutants and delivering drugs to specific cells in the body. The innovative particles' magnetic properties in particular offer an extra dimension in allowing external magnetic fields to manipulate them.\n\nFor example, MAG(NET)ICFUN has already developed magnetic nanoparticles that can remove mercury from contaminated water. Potential medical uses include imaging in magnetic resonance imaging machines and directly targeting tumours in cancer sufferers.\n\nDuring the next few years the consortium will generate a plethora of new magnetic nanomaterials for sustainable chemical processes or new cures in medicine. In addition, MAG(NET)ICFUN will build a training programme at the interface of chemistry, materials science and biomedicine to nurture these skills in young scientists.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2015-10/163162.jpg", "fp7_104677_953990248"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["9QS", "GBSLEP TA", "Solihull Metropolitan Borough Coucil", "The Project brings together a range of partners with relevant sector and thematic expertise to deliver a coherent package of TA provision to support the ERDF elements of the GBSLEP ESIF strategy.
