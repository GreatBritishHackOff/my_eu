This agreement is recorded in the \"minutes of the staff meeting\" and in \"the minutes of the Consejo Escolar meeting\".\r\nThus, the staff agree to be trained according to their needs.\r\nBased on well-established criteria, the commission will select the most suitable teachers for the teachers' mobilities and will issue both the sctivities and their evaluation.\r\nThe teachers will get the Mobility Europass  and the Europen passport of the Languages.\r\n\r\nOur project will focus on the promotion of the activities carried out in and out of school via the school webpage and the etwinning platform.\r\n\r\n The activities carried out will be assessed according to  the attendants' degree of satisfaction and  the  subsequent promotion, but it wiil  be assessed as well the certificates earned for the completion of any educational courses and if we enroll in the International Baccalaureate.", "http://www.suttonhigh.gdst.net/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-037348_2"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1EL", "CROWN AGENTS LIMITED", 811893.0, "Completion of actions in the area of European Neighbourhood Policy and relations with Russia (prior to 2014) (22.04.51)", "fts_2016_22149", 2016], ["1EL", "CROWN AGENTS LIMITED", 4295401.0, "Mediterranean countries \u2014 Poverty reduction and sustainable development (22.04.01.02)", "fts_2017_8376", 2017], ["1EL", "CROWN AGENTS LIMITED", 3052884.0, "Response to crisis and emerging crisis (19.02.01)", "fts_2017_12007", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "SM1"}
