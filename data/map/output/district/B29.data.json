All manufacturing technology was integrated into a common platform and specifications for an e-tool to capture and analyse manufacturing information were defined.\n\nThe Polytubes consortium also optimised and customised processes for product development and successfully designed, manufactured and evaluated first and second functional prototypes. One demonstrator in the pipeline for commercialisation is used for human sperm capture and promises to significantly enhance efficiency while reducing the cost of in vitro fertilisation.\n\nPolytubes results establish the technological readiness for volume production of polymeric microtubular components.

The academy is situated on the Bournville Village Trust and is surrounded by relatively affluent housing. Our children are drawn from housing that ranges from large detached owner occupied units to council flats located in tower blocks and newly built houses.As an educational establishment we are looking to continually improve provision for all our children by providing a broad and balanced curriculum. We have identified that to further improve provision for our children we need to learn about and adapt different approaches to education. Liaising with colleagues from across Europe can only benefit this process. training, learning and sharing within a European setting will provide a new dimension to our experience that will impact on our curriculum, staff and pupils.Therefore, our project objectives are:To raise standards in the core subjects of English. Mathematics, Science and Computing.To broaden our curriculum by learning from and liaising with European partners.To further enhance our Outdoor Curriculum for the benefit of an increasingly wide range of children.To act as a catalyst for European educational co-operation within the Victoria Academies Trust.To provide high quality professional development for a range of our staff.These objectives are closely linked with Northfield Manor's development plans and ensures that we are making a real contribution to the future of the Victoria Academies Trust.We strongly believe that Erasmus+ offer us the structure to access a range of educational experiences within Europe that meet the needs of our children and give us ideas to extend and broaden the curriculum for children within and beyond our establishment.We have chosen specific programs from  from LEAP that not only enhance our provision, but also meet the development needs of the staff involved.  The structured courses will be delivered in Finland, Spain, Italy and Belgium and will be attended by 6 staff  who have been selected following discussions with  SLT and staff taking  into account a number of factors such as their role in leading teams and leading changes in school, their motivation to attend, their experience and ability to share and implement new strategies and methods as a results of taking part ion those chosen courses abroad. They range from leaders to teaching and non teaching staff who will be able to ensure that these European experiences have the highest possible impact in our school and beyond.
