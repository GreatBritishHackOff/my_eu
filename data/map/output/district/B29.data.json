Potential applications include specially shaped functional components for an instrument innovated by the Polytubes consortium for electrophysiological study on human sperms, heat transfer structural and functional parts for micro-heat-exchangers, parts for Capillary Electrochromatography, etc. Besides efforts to ensure functional realisation of the innovative products which use polymer microtubular components, manufacturing challenges must be met to produce sophisticated microgeometrical features of the components with an efficiency which is economically viable.\n\nThe overall objective of the POLYTUBES project is to develop a process chain and corresponding micro-manufacturing platform for the manufacture of polymer-micro-tubes and tubular micro-components for innovative products (medical and non-medical applications). It aims to create new markets for EU SMEs with innovative and economically competitive micro-products and micro-manufacturing equipment to meet the needs for a wide range of emerging applications. The development will also support the SMEs to increase business opportunities with new volume production capabilities in micro-manufacturing.

Innovative technology for high-volume, cost-effective production should enhance product and market development.", "Microtubes made of polymers, among which perhaps capillary tubes are best known, are widely used in a number of fields. These small, hollow, cylindrical structures are used in medical applications, optics, communications and many more areas.\n\nA European consortium initiated the Polytubes project to develop a process chain overcoming current micro-manufacturing challenges to ensure functional realisation of innovative products. Scientists focused on creating new markets for European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). With development of high-volume manufacturing capabilities, the consortium sought to deliver economically competitive and high-performance micro-manufacturing processes and products for a wide range of emerging applications.\n\nManufacturing-focused activities included development of polymer microtube shaping and rolling equipment, a polymer microtube expansion/inflation machine, laser forming systems and an online product inspection system. All manufacturing technology was integrated into a common platform and specifications for an e-tool to capture and analyse manufacturing information were defined.\n\nThe Polytubes consortium also optimised and customised processes for product development and successfully designed, manufactured and evaluated first and second functional prototypes. One demonstrator in the pipeline for commercialisation is used for human sperm capture and promises to significantly enhance efficiency while reducing the cost of in vitro fertilisation.\n\nPolytubes results establish the technological readiness for volume production of polymeric microtubular components.

The project will take place from 7.4.2018 to 12.4.2018 in Moscow and the Russian Black Sea region, and it will involve 28 youth workers from 12 partner organisations from 12 countries.\r\n\r\nTOPIC: the role and practices of NGOs and youth work to empower civil society and bring about positive change in society\r\n\r\nCOUNTRIES INVOLVED \r\nThe partnership embraces organisations from 12 countries representing Europe and all neighbouring partner regions: Albania, Armenia, Austria, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Lebanon, Palestine, Poland, Russian Federation, Tunesia and UK.\r\n\r\nMAIN OBJECTIVES / PROGRAMME ELEMENTS\r\n\u2022 Share realities of youth in the different countries and regions we represent, with a focus on the common challenges such as unemployment, radicalisation and migration\r\n\u2022 Compare realities and exchange practices in civil society activism and youth work in the different countries and regions we represent\r\n\u2022 Excursions, meetings and study visits to get to know the reality of civil society activism and youth work in the Russian Black Sea region\r\n\u2022 Practice tools in civil society activism and youth work, with a focus on the use of social media, participation and social diplomacy\r\n\u2022 Partnership-building and foster follow-up projects on local and international level, with a focus on ERASMUS+\r\n\u2022 Ensuring a strong dimension of transfer of competences and learning points after the international meeting, as well as a widespread dissemination and multiplication of the results.\r\n\r\nMETHODS AND ACTIVITIES\r\nThe pedagogic approach of the project will be based on the full toolbox of non-formal education. Apart from educational sessions in and around plenary, there will also be a lot of study visits, excursions and round tables with local youth workers and decision makers, as well as an embedding of the project in an online learning and exchange space. \r\n\r\nIMPACT, RESULTS, LONG-TERM BENEFIT\r\nWe expect the participants and the partner organisations to have more competent hands, hearts and heads concerning the role and practices of NGOs and youth work to empower civil society and bring about positive change in society.  By bringing together youth workers from Europe and all neighbouring partner regions in their role as civil society activists and changemakers, we want to provide and opportunity to learn from each others\u2019 realities, inspire and support each other, and exchange practices and tools that will lead to new youth-related projects at local, regional, national and European level. The fostering of new projects will be supported by an in-depth presentation of the funding possibilities offered by ERASMUS+ and related schemes. The project also aims at ensuring a strong dimension of transfer of competences and learning points after the international meeting, as well as a widespread dissemination and multiplication of the results.\r\n\r\nIn the very big picture, the project sees itself as a contribution to peace and the development of civil societies in Europe and her neighbouring regions.", "http://www.youthworkeurope.com", null, "erasmus_2017-3-AT02-KA105-002005_10"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B29"}
