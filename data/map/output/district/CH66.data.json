Within this, further aims are: to see French taught consistently across Key Stage Two; to increase language skills, develop positive attitudes and levels confidence of staff teaching French; to develop methodology to ensure that progression in French is taught effectively, and to develop the role of the subject leader.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind this project is to equip the school for the compulsory languages element of the new primary curriculum, coming into force in September 2014.  Currently, only four of the eleven Key Stage Two classes are receiving consistent French teaching, with one receiving occasional French teaching.  Key reasons for this are a lack of confidence of teaching a language which many have not had experience with since school themselves, and a lack of awareness of how to approach teaching French.\r\n\r\nDue to one of the main reasons for French not being currently taught consistently across Key Stage Two being reluctant attitudes towards language learning, a carefully selected mixture of staff have been chosen to attend immersion courses in France.  There will be four participants taking part in the project.  Two members of  staff who are enthusiastic about French will be paired with two members of staff who are less confident, and more reluctant in engage in teaching French.\r\n\r\nWhen in France, participants will spend their time in French immersion classes, developing their own pedagogical and subject knowledge, along with their intercultural understanding.  The aim of pairing more reluctant members of staff with staff who are already passionate about French is to ignite their own interests and enthusiasm about language learning, through first hand experience, and through seeing a purpose and a value of providing French education to pupils.\r\n\r\nOn return to England, participant's enthusiasm and passion will inspire other members of staff to develop their own skills and understanding, through being involved in training and support delivered by the participants.  Training will involve team teaching, modelling lessons and activities, support in teaching sequences of French lessons, and sharing knowledge of the French culture.   Staff will also learn about meaningful links of French to other areas of the primary curriculum, for example how learning French can support the development of spelling, phonics, and grammar in pupil's mother tongue.  \r\n\r\nAs a consequence of teachers at Woodlands Primary School being prepared and supported in delivering French lessons, children will be taught French regularly, in a structured approach, building upon and embedding children's current skills.  If teachers continue to build upon this sound base, children will be  more confident in using their acquired language.  Under the support and guidance of the participants, staff will feel enthused, prepared, and more confident to deliver engaging, structured French lessons to pupils.", "http://www.woodlands.cheshire.sch.uk", "Woodlands Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000189_coordinator"], ["4SZ", "MFL Enhancement project", "Meadow Community Primary School", 3722.0, "In summary Meadow Primary School is a successful school which identified the value of teaching a language several years ago.  While we feel the teaching of French is good, we feel the profile of French can be enhanced with the introduction of the compulsory curriculum in September 2014.  We feel we are in a good position to move our teaching to outstanding by embedding French into our whole curriculum, not just as a stand alone subject. As a starting point we need to enhance the skills and knowledge of the staff. By sending two members of staff on the immersion courses in France, we will achieve this and we will raise the support for the key teacher who currently has been teaching French in isolation.  Using Meadow's current and proven methods of raising standards, we can ensure impact is assured.\r\n* Clear and precise objectives and actions within the school development plan \r\n* A rigorous baseline that can be used throughout the year to assess impact.\r\n* Team approach to introducing the changes through the task and finish team approach.\r\n* A support network in place for those leading the changes.\r\n* Quality training provided by attendance on the course and then staff meetings/twilights to introduce actions and train the wider staff.\r\n* Regular learning walks, lesson observations, staff and pupils interviews to identify impact as well as any strengths or further areas for development.\r\n* Half termly staff meetings to evaluate the SDP and progress made towards the objectives.\r\n* Subject leader working alongside the Curriculum leader to ensure statutory requirements are covered.   \r\nWe intend to provide our pupils with not only a wider French vocabulary but the opportunity to learn in an environment where those skills and knowledge are valued and celebrated by every teacher. We want to send our pupils to secondary school with a head start towards fluency in another language and with the enthusiasm and commitment to using that language to enhance their life and work expectations.", "http://www.meadow.cheshire.sch.uk", "Meadow Community Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000222_coordinator"], ["1HF", "French through a thematic approach", "Rossmore School", 7485.0, "Rossmore is a smaller than average Primary School in the North West of England.We are reviewing the language provision in school and have found the following 3 needs:- lack of French skills and confidence,- lack of cultural understanding- languages are not embedded in the curriculum.The majority of the staff lack confidence in this subject as was identified in the staff voice subject audit. It was clear that many staff feel that they are not providing the national curriculum criteria to the desirable standard. It was also highlighted in a previous Ofsted inspection that there is a lack of cultural understanding at the school.Our project is to send 4 teaching staff on short immersion courses in France, through the Erasmus + programme. we feel this will address our needs and the project will enable staff to teach more French during thematic lessons with more confidence. Furthermore it will greatly improve the cultural understanding of the staff and the children. The children will then benefit as they have more opportunities to practice and learn French and will make more progress. This new thematic approach will be commencing in September 2016.In France, our teachers will benefit from the expertise of other tutors when planning French schemes of work. The teachers will also be spending a full day in a primary school. This will give a snapshot of what day to day life is like for children in France. The course will be tailored to the particular needs of the staff who will be going to France and this should ensure that the staff can make the most of the opportunity they have been given. Methodology and pedagogy skills will be developed that can be integrated into classrooms at Rossmore.French will be happening more often with the children making clear progress and being at least in line with expectations. There will also be an even balance of all four skills and grammar teaching with the children enjoying lessons. Systems will be in place to assess all of the time.The overall impact of the courses in France will effect our school and the local community, both improving French skills and the future teaching and development of our children. We are at the beginning of our language journey and In the long term, we feel this project will begin to open the hearts and minds of our pupils and begin to build a European dimension into our curriculum.", "http://www.rossmore.cheshire.sch.uk", "Rossmore School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023755_coordinator"], ["2BD", "Engaging learners in MFL and embedding Spanish throughout our school to raise attainment.", "St Saviour's Catholic Primary and Nursery School", 28083.0, "At St Saviours we are at the beginning of our journey to embed MFL teaching in KS2 and introduce incidental Spanish in EYFS and KS1. \r\n\r\nOur pupils need language introduction and development, and an awareness of other cultures and the wider world. This is particularly important as some of our children have very little exposure to other cultures and countries other than through school. They will only receive language immersion through the opportunities we provide for them.\r\n\r\nWe have planned a two-year project involving members of staff from across the whole school taking part in intensive week-long immersion courses in Spain. We would like to apply for a total of 13 mobilities.\r\n\r\nLearning gained from these courses will be integrated into our curriculum and school life. The headteacher, senior leadership team and governors all fully support the project and we will ensure that changes become embedded into our school in the long term.\r\nWe will create a strong capacity across our school by involving members of staff from many different backgrounds, to create our strong ethos of valuing languages and cultures and making Spanish visible and prominent across the school.\r\n\r\nBased on our audit of staff skills, appraisal process, and targets the enthusiasm of the applicants, and our aspiration to make sure that we have a good range of staff from all year groups and roles we have already identified our key group of participants.\r\n\r\nIn addition to our teaching staff we have prioritised the inclusion of support and non-teaching staff. Their role is critical to our whole school approach and our aim to embed Spanish across the whole school. They have very little language or experience but are very enthusiastic about our project. It would make a huge difference to give them this opportunity and would mean that we could greatly increase our pupils\u2019 exposure to the language through making best use of all learning opportunities.\r\n\r\nDue to the demographic of our children, we need to ensure we inspire them to have high aspirations and aim for the most that they can achieve. We believe that language teaching in primary school is one step can help to facilitate that. This will include widening their views on other cultures and introducing the idea of international employment possibilities.", null, "St Saviour's Catholic Primary and Nursery School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047019_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CH66"}
