At the same time EUROCOURSE is seeking to optimize the use of cancer registration data for the amelioration of cancer control and the strengthening of population-based cancer research in Europe.  EUROCOURSE will therefore adopt a two-pronged approach. Firstly, funding organisations, will exchange information, best practice and technical know-how in order to harmonise the way cancer registries are funded and organised.   Secondly, cancer registries will be provided with the infrastructure necessary for harmonizing their data through exchange of technical know-how, best practices and the development of recommendations. Additionally, the process of data collection will be streamlined in order to provide comparable, accurate and timely statistics at the European level.

A key challenge in forensics is the detection of trace explosive residues at a post-blast scene or on the hands or clothes of an alleged suspect. Detection of the primer charge (e.g., PETN) is often hampered by higher-concentration residues from the main charge, e.g., ammonium nitrate. Detection of the primer can be essential in order to secure a prosecution, especially if the materials that comprise the main charge are commonly available, e.g., ammonium nitrate is present in fertiliser.\nROSFEN\u2019s goal is to deliver an advanced forensic platform for rapid, on-site direct detection and lab-quality analysis of narcotics, explosives and their precursors. The performance targets are detection limits down to 1 ng/mL, 1% false alarm rate and response time < 10 seconds.\nROSFEN combines innovative technology from two leading SMEs: Microsaic Systems\u2019 chip-based mass spectrometry and Environics\u2019 ion filter systems. This novel platform removes the need for slow, costly chromatography methods currently used in lab-based analysis. ROSFEN will enable reduction of total analysis time (samples, blanks, controls) from hours to minutes, thus reducing the load on forensic labs and enabling intelligence-led investigations.\nROSFEN will also innovate in the rapid analysis of new psychoactive drugs, by coupling the isomer selectivity of the ion filter technique with the detection sensitivity of tandem MS.\nROSFEN will thus enable European industry to develop and deliver innovative technologies into key global markets: Analytical instruments for security applications ($2 billion annually) and the $3.3B market for mass spectrometry.\nThe ROSFEN consortium comprises two research-intensive SMEs, two leading research groups and two end users.

The plan was to develop a portable device able to detect both explosives and narcotics. The unit is intended for screening use and to deliver lab-quality analysis at a crime scene. The principle involves filtering chemical noise from interfering or masking substances, and identifying chemical signatures of psychoactive drugs.

The six-member consortium runs to July 2015.\n\nThe project made good progress during its first year. Achievements included establishing the initial system hardware and software specifications, and gathering information about police evidence procedures. The team also developed a second-generation prototype of an advanced ion filter, able to operate under ambient conditions. The filter was interfaced with the project's redesigned and optimised miniature tandem mass spectrometer. The researchers created a set of novel receptors designed for explosives detection, and developed high-surface-area templates and protocols for molecular capture.\n\nBy its completion, the ROSFEN project expects to have created a portable unit for the detection of drugs and explosives and capable of onsite forensic analysis.

The elevation of non-formal education methods largely used in international youth works has attracted various kinds of professionals and young people to work in the field of youth. Impactful youth work and sustainable youth organizations needs two key skills domiciled within their organizations which are Advocacy and facilitation skills because youth activities revolves alot around training and advocacy of change for or against status-co or policies. A lot of youth workers and youth leaders in voluntary youth sector are driven by passion and sense of determination to help and make society a better place. But zeal and passion as important as they are in international youth work, they can not replace competence. Youth organizations have conceptualized projects, but only to rely only external professional trainers to carry out the training and facilitations of the trainings. These has ended up in disappointments between what  was expected and the delivery. This arrangement also denies them the opportunity to develop their own skills and the motivation to effectively lead and advocate change or even help upcoming informal groups in their training initiatives. After a recent training project on social inclusion organized by Diversity and Integration Initiatives and the quality of facilitations that were carried out by officers of the organization. There has been overwhelming request from organizations and youth workers to Diversity and Integration Initiatives to put this project together with a view to helping organizations to develop crucial skills of facilitation and advocacy . These skills are so fundamental that not only does it help youth workers , young people and youth leaders in their works at developing internal pool of facilitators and advocates but it is also the foundational skills for aspiring entrepreneurs. Ability to effectively explain your ideas to others for comprehension which you get in facilitation and ability to knock on doors of barriers persistently without fear of rejection with passion which is a bedrock skill of advocacy.
