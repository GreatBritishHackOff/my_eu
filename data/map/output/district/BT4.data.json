It will do so by exploring ways to link and integrate national/regional programmes aimed at supporting cancer registries and research carried out using registry data. At the same time EUROCOURSE is seeking to optimize the use of cancer registration data for the amelioration of cancer control and the strengthening of population-based cancer research in Europe.  EUROCOURSE will therefore adopt a two-pronged approach. Firstly, funding organisations, will exchange information, best practice and technical know-how in order to harmonise the way cancer registries are funded and organised.   Secondly, cancer registries will be provided with the infrastructure necessary for harmonizing their data through exchange of technical know-how, best practices and the development of recommendations. Additionally, the process of data collection will be streamlined in order to provide comparable, accurate and timely statistics at the European level.    EUROCOURSE\u2019s consortium represents a significant coverage of the European Cancer Registry landscape. Given the large number of cancer registries and funding organizations supporting the registry network however, the project envisages a flexible structure, including the introduction of new parties during its lifetime. This will be done essentially through the working groups that are firmly embedded in the workpackages. EUROCOURSE\u2019s inclusive approach will culminate in the FIRST EUROPEAN CANCER SUMMIT, which will aim to bring for the first time all stakeholders in the cancer control community in Europe \u2013 including funders, researchers and other interested parties \u2013 around one table to sketch out the future of European Cancer Registration in Cancer Control.

A key challenge in forensics is the detection of trace explosive residues at a post-blast scene or on the hands or clothes of an alleged suspect. Detection of the primer charge (e.g., PETN) is often hampered by higher-concentration residues from the main charge, e.g., ammonium nitrate. Detection of the primer can be essential in order to secure a prosecution, especially if the materials that comprise the main charge are commonly available, e.g., ammonium nitrate is present in fertiliser.\nROSFEN\u2019s goal is to deliver an advanced forensic platform for rapid, on-site direct detection and lab-quality analysis of narcotics, explosives and their precursors. The performance targets are detection limits down to 1 ng/mL, 1% false alarm rate and response time < 10 seconds.\nROSFEN combines innovative technology from two leading SMEs: Microsaic Systems\u2019 chip-based mass spectrometry and Environics\u2019 ion filter systems. This novel platform removes the need for slow, costly chromatography methods currently used in lab-based analysis. ROSFEN will enable reduction of total analysis time (samples, blanks, controls) from hours to minutes, thus reducing the load on forensic labs and enabling intelligence-led investigations.\nROSFEN will also innovate in the rapid analysis of new psychoactive drugs, by coupling the isomer selectivity of the ion filter technique with the detection sensitivity of tandem MS.\nROSFEN will thus enable European industry to develop and deliver innovative technologies into key global markets: Analytical instruments for security applications ($2 billion annually) and the $3.3B market for mass spectrometry.\nThe ROSFEN consortium comprises two research-intensive SMEs, two leading research groups and two end users.

While numerous laboratory-based methods are available for detecting chemical residues, current field analysis units are generally too unreliable.\n\nHence, a need exists for a reliable portable universal unit. The EU-funded 'Rapid on-site forensic analysis of explosives and narcotics' (http://www.rosfen.eu (ROSFEN)) project aimed to meet that need. The plan was to develop a portable device able to detect both explosives and narcotics. The unit is intended for screening use and to deliver lab-quality analysis at a crime scene. The principle involves filtering chemical noise from interfering or masking substances, and identifying chemical signatures of psychoactive drugs. The technical goal was to integrate two analytical methods \u2013 ion mobility spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry \u2013 into the device. The six-member consortium runs to July 2015.\n\nThe project made good progress during its first year. Achievements included establishing the initial system hardware and software specifications, and gathering information about police evidence procedures. The team also developed a second-generation prototype of an advanced ion filter, able to operate under ambient conditions. The filter was interfaced with the project's redesigned and optimised miniature tandem mass spectrometer. The researchers created a set of novel receptors designed for explosives detection, and developed high-surface-area templates and protocols for molecular capture.\n\nBy its completion, the ROSFEN project expects to have created a portable unit for the detection of drugs and explosives and capable of onsite forensic analysis.

SPaRK recognises that genuinely game-changing intersectoral, international and interdisciplinary collaboration does not happen simply by making available opportunities for mobility, placements, or input from other disciplines. It is therefore designed to offer an innovative model of professional and scientific development that is proactively training researchers to be able to maximise the potential of these 3i partnerships. Only by rethinking our current, competence-based skills agenda in ways that embrace a model based on intellectual flexibility and creativity can we prepare the leaders who will be equipped to respond to constantly shifting global challenges.
