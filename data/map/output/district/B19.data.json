Project will advance recent innovations towards preparation of ordered nanoporous, nanostructured materials using anodisation methods and applying them to develop commercially relevant novel materials and address the market potential for these improved materials. The nanostructuring process is the growth, during the anodising process, of nanoporous films consisting of well-ordered pores of Anodic Al Oxide in hexagonally close-packed distribution with large aspect ratio. The concept of self-assembly is not yet implemented in actual anodising Al processes due to a number of bottle-necks; project aims at developing pilot line equipment and methodologies enabling to overcome them. The objective is to solve actual market needs by achieving the single stage treatment and industrial evaluation of nanostructured aluminium alloys. The overall research methodology of the Nanocoat project will follow a progression from detailed laboratory studies through scale-up to applications testing on industrial aluminium grades under industrial relevant conditions, to evaluate their structural and functional characteristics, the reproducibility of the process, and to deliver to end-users suitable test structures as predemonstrators. It is expected that on controlling the formation of the anodised nano-size cell structures on aluminium it will be possible to achieve novel performance in terms of adherence, wettability, corrosion and wear, and adsorption/absorption properties. The scope of applications is very large in the field of surface engineering. The specific anodising markets to be addressed during the project are concerned with improved functionality and new coatings for traditional anodisation processes. In addition, new markets will be assessed, which are based on the enhanced performance of these coatings.", 102153.0, 1279816.0, "NANOCOAT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ashton-moore.co.uk", null, "fp7_96899_984498494"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["1BP", "RXT", "DRUG REHAB REQUIREMENT HOSPITAL PRESCRIBER"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B19"}
