These opportunities typically include development of new products or the improvement of their process performance. However, it is very difficult to determine, ex-ante, to which combination of improvement opportunities they should devote resources in order for the firm to maximise its performance. The ValuePOLE project is focused on delivering a Model, an ICT Tool and a Methodology to answer this challenge for the SME decision maker so that they can maximise their competitive position with the minimum investment of resources. ValuePOLE, delivers  - a new Predictive Performance tool for SMEs, to maximise value creation in the entire product, process life cycles. (ValuePOLE will maximise value creation by providing an infrastructure for the ex-ante, i.e. before the event, prediction of performance outcomes in planned innovations). - a model for performance Prediction and Optimisation of the product and process Lifecycles in SME value chains. - a methodology that goes \u2018beyond lean\u2019 in that it enables organisations to better deploy its resources to be both operationally effective through the selective application of improvement methodologies to current organisational configurations for today\u2019s customers as well as strategically flexible in the adaptation of new configurations of products, processes, technologies, competencies, and systems that enable the satisfaction of tomorrow\u2019s customers. ValuePOLE will support organisations for improvements in processes and innovations in products based on either existing or new technologies.", 157159.0, 1290021.0, "VALUEPOLE", "Better production processes for SMEs", "Development of a novel high-tech tool to help manufacturing businesses has shown great promise in doubling sales and improving production.", "The survival and competitiveness of European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) depend on their power to take advantage of the knowledge economy in order to streamline operations and innovate. Deciding which new products to develop or what opportunities an SME should embark on is no easy task, particularly if research and development budgets are limited.\n\nWith this in mind, the EU-funded project http://www.valuepole.eu (VALUEPOLE) developed an information technology to facilitate the task for these businesses. The tool effectively identifies best value improvement opportunities among potential new products or process improvements.\n\nMore specifically, the project provided several mechanisms to promote efficiency and innovation. These include a market demand response model that helps SMEs pinpoint market needs for products, both now and in the future. Another key project achievement is the performance improvement project (PIP) model and optimisation tool to help SMEs maximise operational performance against a set of key performance indicators.\n\nOverall, the information and communications technology (ICT) tool and accompanying methodology developed by the project team enable SME decision makers to enhance competitiveness with minimum investment. Member companies with the project consortium demonstrated phenomenal success in adopting the system, with one business doubling its sales and another tripling them in export markets.\n\nVALUEPOLE can bring success to other European manufacturing SMEs in a similar manner, helping them to manage performance prediction and diagnostics in order to achieve operational, tactical and strategic objectives. Improved efficiency across the value chain could help meet 'better, cheaper, faster' competitive objectives, as well as 'greener, safer, securer' EU socio-technical policy objectives.

The iBUS model focuses on the capture, creation and delivery of value for all stakeholders \u2013 consumers, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers.\nThe main focus of iBUS is to drive sales for EU traditional toy and furniture manufacturers by leveraging internet based technologies, focusing on safe products, quality, design and innovation. In this new iBUS model consumers become designers, designing, customising and placing orders for their own products online in the iBUS cloud. They will be supported by embedded services in iBUS, developed in the main by SME Technology providers. These services include augmented reality design assistants, design verification tools for compliance with EU product safety guidelines, analysis of environmental footprint and prototyping with additive layer / 3D printing. Subsequently, parametric engineering design principles will take the design from concept to demand. This demand will then be synchronised and optimised across the supply chain, supported by the embedded supply chain optimisation tools, to produce sustainable demand driven production and supply plans. Manufacturers will then produce the furniture and toys in small scale series production driven by the actual customer demand. Suppliers will have visibility of, and make decisions based on, end-customer demand. Likewise customers will have visibility of their orders through all stages of production and delivery. The infrastructure will be cloud based using internet and social media technologies, allowing interaction and collaboration, but also accessible to home-based or small business users, promoting social inclusion.", null, 6289530.0, "iBUS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_196843_999456670"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LN10"}
