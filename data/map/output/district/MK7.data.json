While the ADVANCE Forum concept engages all stakeholder groups in a parliament-like structure, specific representative committees drive the innovative progress. Specific attention will be given to workflows depending on the level of urgency and on who is requesting utilization of the framework: regulatory authorities, vaccine manufacturers, public health organizations.\n\nADVANCE partners leverage their recent pioneering achievements in establishing operative technological platforms, developing pharmaco-epidemiological methods for burden of disease, coverage, effectiveness and risk. ADVANCE partners also build on a track record of delivering results of ground breaking international collaborative studies of unprecedented population size. ADVANCE capitalizes on these achievements and tailors structures and processes to the needs of collaborative public-private vaccine benefit-risk assessment. ADVANCE partners will provide access to data on more than 40 million subjects for testing of methods and immediate studies.  \n\nThe existing technical platform boosted by the strong connection to the IMI EMIF project and many other synergistic initiatives will allow ADVANCE to focus on creating access modalities and accelerating exploitation of both underutilized and established rich data sources, to test innovative methods for integrated and vaccine specific benefit risk assessment, and to undertake real life studies from the outset of the project. \n\nConsortium: The ADVANCE Consortium is designed to engage all stakeholders in Europe, while ensuring project feasibility by careful selection of a small group of 15 partners driving progress..

Given their remarkable stability, fullerenes are ideally suited to survive the harsh conditions in the ISM, and as a result may be abundant and widespread in the Universe. Accordingly their detection is considered one of the priorities in the field of interstellar organic chemistry. I played a key role in the first unambiguous detection of fullerenes (C60 and C70) in space. Following our discovery of fullerenes in a young Planetary Nebula, they have now been detected in many other astronomical environments (e.g. post-AGBs, proto-PNe, PNe, reflection nebulae, HII regions, stars, YSOs), indicating that fullerenes form efficiently in many diverse regions. The major scientific challenge is now to understand their formation mechanisms, excitation, and role in the ISM, since this will provide clues to the key chemical pathways leading to larger organics and set their diagnostic value in the ISM. I will address this challenge through three key questions:\n\n1. Are fullerenes thermally or stochastically (fluorescence) excited?\n2.

The first is to provide a number of discrete learning interventions, which can be delivered either through a web-based trading platform or in a day-trading facility, to enhance the quality of financial decision-making by private investors trading on their own account.  Within that overall objective, the principal goal is to address issues of emotional regulation in financial decision making.  In common with many other areas where technology has been used to assist learning, financial training has largely focused on imparting propositional knowledge and increasing people's intellectual understanding. However, our work to date has shown that despite investors having considerable appropriate knowledge, their actions can still be ruled by their attitudes, habits, or emotional states. Emotions not only mediate rapid expert situation recognition and the application of expert intuition, but they also give rise to important persistent biases in decision-making through framing effects and the disposition effect in particular.  Game based technologies are becoming proven as a method of learning, particularly as they can place people in virtual situations.  In the context of financial decision making, xDelia will use serious games to analyse and train behavioural patterns and to support the non-formal and informal learning process.  The project will produce learning interventions which employ physiological sensors alongside serious games.  Wearable sensor equipment will help build a picture of a person's emotional state.  Data collected via sensors in both game play and during actual trading will be analysed alongside real time event logging, diaries and past trading data.  The validity and effectiveness of the interventions will be tested and further developed through a series of trials, including 'live' testing with private investors.  Because of the problems of transfer of skills learned into actual practice and the need to support the development of expertise over extended periods, learning interventions developed by the project cannot rely solely on learning games.

To reduce the outdoor traffic noise to a sufficiently low level for a good acoustic environment is a major challenge of high need.

The ultimate aim of this effort is to develop some definitive plan to knock massive asteroids out of their Earth-bound orbit.\n\nAsteroids approaching our planet travel at up to 30 kilometres per second. At that speed, a body with a diameter of only 100 m, could have major consequences for our civilisation.

However, it is possible to stop an asteroid from hitting Earth. The NEOSHIELD scientists and engineers are evaluating promising methods for asteroid deflection, which may simply mean providing a nudge in the right place at the right time.\n\nOne way to do this is to have a spacecraft impact the asteroid and impart enough force to change its orbit. NEOSHIELD researchers are working on finding ways to guide the spacecraft to the moving target at the right angle with the right velocity. Another way is to use the spacecraft's gravitational pull to tow the asteroid into a different orbit. If the asteroid is far away, a tiny tug could be sufficient to cause the asteroid to miss the Earth.\n\nThe most powerful but least appealing technique explored during the NEOSHIELD project relies on explosive power to divert or break up the Earth-bound asteroid. However, breaking up a large asteroid could be disastrous if it were to result in the Earth being showered by many large fragments, instead of impacted by one solid piece. NEOSHIELD scientists use data from asteroid observations, lab experiments, and computer simulations, to find ways to best protect Earth from future devastating impacts.\n\nAt the end of the project, the NEOSHIELD researchers will provide detailed space-mission plans, which could form the basis of a proposal to national and international space agencies for a mission to demonstrate the necessary technology.", "http://www.space.com/14370-asteroid-shield-earth-threat-protection-meeting.html", "http://www.open.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/143591.jpg", "fp7_101239_999923337"], ["6AA", "European Planetology Network Research Infrastructure", "The Open University", "The Europlanet RI project will provide the European planetary science community with a unique research infrastructure, combining access to a suite of state of the art facilities while fostering their joint development and integration in terms of capacity and performance.

Recent work has shown that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have enhanced tree growth in forests. However these increases in growth can also cause \u2018priming effects\u2019 whereby microbial degradation of soil organic matter is stimulated by fresh carbon inputs, such as plant litter, releasing additional carbon from the soil. Given that forest soils represent the largest terrestrial carbon pool, priming effects could cause a major release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Despite their potential importance in ecosystem carbon dynamics under environmental change, the processes and mechanisms underlying priming effects are still poorly understood. This is in part due to the enormous disparities in the experimental scales and methods required to study microbial processes vs. ecosystem carbon dynamics and the difficulties in extrapolating the results of laboratory studies to the ecosystem level. This project will significantly advance our understanding of the role of priming effects in forest carbon dynamics in different forest types and reconcile the experimental problems of scale using multidisciplinary nested studies across multiple scales. The nested design will explicitly test the validity of extrapolations made at one scale to predict effects at another.

The framework will be supported by Knowledge Spaces as a generative force and Business Services as an enabling force. A network of Business Labs will be set up, based on three key variations: Design Labs (e.g. creating emotionally-oriented immaterial value), Making Labs (e.g. converting skilled labour into material value), and Place Labs (e.g. generating spatial community- and socially- oriented value). Each of these Labs will explore the issues of cost, product/service and productivity enhancement in a transversal manner and from cross-disciplinary perspectives - including economic, anthropological, and engineering approaches as well as new business values such as environmental and social responsibility, sharing economy, social enterprising, customer-driven small series production (the focus of this call) and emergent or disruptive technologies. With these tools, and supported by an open Associates Programme, TCBL will carry out real-life experimentation and market deployment of a number of Supply Chain, Localisation, Business, Skill Management and Policy innovations involving no fewer than 160 workshops, laboratories and manufacturing plants at EU level with at least 15,000 T&C workers involved.
