Treatment is based on lifetime drugs administration for blood glucose control or parenteral infusion of insulin to better control glucose levels and glycosylation of hemoglobin. Artificial pancreases are in development but still dependent by external energy sources and need permanent transcutaneous access to release the hormone. Pancreatic whole organ transplantation is a major intervention requiring selected recipient and matched cadaveric donor which keep numbers down. Islet of Langerhans transplantation is a non-invasive method for the treatment of type 1 diabetes but several questions remain and several issues have to be addressed in order to improve the method since islet engraftment is clearly suboptimal, as a result of pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory stimuli sustained during islet isolation and at the site of implantation, the long-term islet graft function drops to 15% with time, and the current systemic immunosuppressive regimen has several drawbacks in terms of side effects. Solution should be find to increase transplantation efficiency with an higher number of islet, eventually from animals, induce tolerance toward the graft, avoiding systemic, lifetime immunosuppression and, lowering a specific inflammatory reaction and enhancing graft micro vasculogenesis to improve islet nesting.

The EU-funded 'RAPPORT' project aimed to help SMEs to access research capabilities that were of high quality and appropriate to their level of development.\n\nThe project outlined good practices and benchmarks to strengthen knowledge exchange and technology transfer between SMEs and research organisations in the public or the private sector. It mapped SME research support mechanisms focusing on public programmes or public\u2013private partnerships. These steps are meant to produce the ideal economic climate and innovation policies to advance SMEs within the European Research Area (ERA).\n\nRAPPORT developed a thorough methodology to investigate the interaction between SMEs and organisations offering access to available research. The project looked into how to strengthen SMEs' ability to articulate its innovation needs, identify the right source of expertise, integrate the acquired knowledge and exploit it commercially. The project team looked at 331 national, regional and local programmes that supported knowledge and technology transfer for SMEs. It interviewed 481 programme stakeholders, including 305 programme managers, 32 KTT enablers (agents, network brokers etc.), 37 knowledge providers (researchers) and 57 beneficiary SMEs.\n\nThe project distinguished between SMEs with high absorptive capacity and SMEs with low or medium absorptive capacity. It differentiated between the programmes and the practices that were appropriate for each group of SMEs. \n\nThe analysis of this project provided a clear insight into the challenges faced by KTT programmes. KTT programmes should be able to provide the means to HAC SMEs to enable them to engage in meaningful innovation and commercialisation activities. KTT programme should also be able to detect those LAC SMEs that have a poor track record of innovation and KTT, but possess the willingness to innovate and grow. Finally KTT programmes should be able to engage with those LAC SMEs that have no obvious interest or appetite for innovation and alter their attitudes and their behaviours in order to convert them gradually into SMEs of higher absorptive capacity.\n\nThree generic strategies were identified to cope with these challenges.  This included agent-supported programmes, firm-incentive programmes and network-based programmes. The agent-supported and the network-based programmes possess the greatest potential for behaviour change and innovation. Agent-supported programmes are more frequent with the low absorptive capacity SMEs, while the network-based programmes fit better the requirements of high absorptive capacity SMEs. Firm-incentive programmes (like the innovation voucher schemes) can provide resources for KTT and innovation but have little potential for behavioural and attitude change.\n\nA number of reports were produced to further knowledge transfer and assist SMEs. Among these was a set of good practices that were converted into proposed actions and activities for for policy-makers at the European Commission, plus the national or the regional level. This was followed by five roadmaps for different programmes or services to support SMEs in order to integrate the findings of the project into the ERA and the EU's Horizon 2020 programme.\n\nThe findings were also presented at a major conference for SME support and innovation in Denmark and through the project's advanced website.

One of the problems of using scaffolds in hospital is bacterial infection, which tends to start at a focal point, and spread across the wound bed and by the time this is obvious enough to see, the infection is well-progressed and difficult to eradicate with either antibiotics, or silver or iodine dressings.\nThis proposal seeks to develop a novel material, smart cryogels, capable of responding to specific \u201csignalling molecules\u201d released either by bacteria or as a product of the immune response; to be used as wound dressings, and as tissue engineering scaffolds. The strategy proposed in the proposal is to secure the antimicrobial agent inside the polymer matrix controlling its release until it is needed. This allows targeting of the areas affected by infection, with antimicrobial agents, thus performing micro-point treatment. The fast specific response also allows release of the antimicrobial agent at the first sign of bacterial colonisation, providing earlier treatment, preventing infection and bacterial spreading, thus providing better treatment. The ability to treat infection at an earlier stage will significantly improve the healing process, providing better treatment and reduction of cost.\nThe potential benefits of the project are very high, as the novel smart macroporous materials which will be developed have clear clinical and commercial potential as delivery materials for diverse applications in medicine, such as biomaterials, sensing/diagnosis devises and drug delivery systems.", 37827.0, 37827.0, "Bio-smart", "Novel smart materials for biomedicine", "European researchers developed novel materials for tissue engineering purposes.

The capture of microbial antigens by scaffold-embedded antibodies facilitates the antimicrobial drug release from the hydrogel. This specific response takes place at the first sign of bacterial colonisation, thereby providing prompt treatment and preventing infection.\n\nAn additional, innovative approach entailed the incorporation of bacteriophages into polymer films. The capacity of bacteriophages to survive and function in dried films could be further exploited for covering wound dressings.\n\nAnalysis of the water content of the generated hydrogels indicated the presence of free water rather than water confined in the pores of the scaffold.

The EU-funded Gradient project aimed at identifying what could be done to improve this situation.\n\nThe project worked on assessing what kind of policies could be effective and to recommend approaches  to 'level-up' the health gradient amongst children, young people and families. Gradient found that no single policy or strategy reduces health inequalities single-handedly, requiring an overall government approach to improving well-being.\n\nArmed with these findings, the project has called on governments and the private sector to develop coherent strategies across policy sectors. It pointed out that investments to identify the causes of ill health among children could generate significant social and economic returns. In its bid to find ways to level up the health gradient, the project team factored in poverty, school dropout rates, working mothers and childhood education.\n\nInterestingly, interviews with policymakers revealed how policymaking improved when young people and families participated in the process. The project involved the first investigation into the relationship between community social capital and the health of children and young people. It found that the health gains of increasing social capital are particularly marked for disandvantaged children and young people in communities with low social capital., making this an important entry point to reduce reducing health inequities. Policy makers are therefore advised to regularly measure social capital in the community and assess the effects of existing programmes on social capital to develop new programmes.\n\nIn this light, Gradient developed an evaluation framework, self-assessment policy tool and common indicators for EU governments to assess health measures. It published a book titled 'The Right Start to a Healthy Life' to help policymakers adopt better health measures that lead to more inclusive, cohesive and sustainable societies.

This would necessarily be tailored to the needs of first responders and based on a nanoporous adsorbent.\n\nWith the aim of integrating the two main areas of protection required (chemical warfare agents and toxic industrial chemicals) without reducing capacity in either, FRESP partners sought to also integrate features not available in current state-of-the-art adsorbents. These offer protection against radioactive gases and biological threats.\n\nInitially, efforts were devoted to analysing different preparation routes for the development of nanoporous sorbents with a highly developed porosity.

Exposure to chemicals added to food, such as flavour enhancers and contact with packaging, have become the focus of food safety research among European scientists.\n\nHowever, according to the research project 'Flavours, additives and food contact material exposure task' (FACET), bottlenecks exist in exposure assessment. These include access to national food consumption databases, difficulty with food categorisation, limited knowledge on food chemical occurrence, and lack of data on food chemical concentration and packaging substances. The 20-partner FACET project is tackling these shortcomings through the creation of a food chemical exposure surveillance system, focusing on flavourings, food additives and food contact materials.\n\nThe consortium, made up of academia, industry, SMEs and national governmental agencies, is working on a database of targeted food chemical concentrations and their intake, as well as creating publicly available software with the data already integrated to help with exposure risk modelling.\n\nWork to date on the food additives side has focused on evaluating high-risk candidates (where the theoretical estimated intake is higher than the acceptable daily intake). But it will also illustrate different situations for additives authorised in the EU for future exposure assessments. Linking these additives with foods consumed in representative regions of the EU, and with concentration data is underway, according to the FACET team.\n\nAs for flavourings, data for both added and natural substances is being analysed for a limited number of target substances. Classification of foods according to a hierarchical tiered system, which meets the needs of the three chemical groups, has been completed, the consortium confirms. Database managers from eight countries (France, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Finland and the UK) are coding their national consumption surveys according to this tiered system.\n\nA targeted survey of the occurrence of food additives, flavourings and food contact materials available in each of the eight countries is nearing the end of the planning phase (minimum of 3 000 products). A database for logging information contained on these product labels is well underway, say the researchers. And cluster analysis of consumption patterns in EU countries has been completed using available data. This technique provides a method for identifying countries with similar food consumption profiles.\n\nDevelopment of the exposure model is well advanced, including an investigation of techniques to improve the treatment of uncertainty in the modelling. The first prototype of the software was released in January 2010, and the feedback collected will guide subsequent versions. Work on model validation and testing begins in earnest once adequate data comes on-stream.\n\nAt the end of the four-year project, the FACET team expects its scientific approach will help boost consumer protection efforts in Europe while fostering innovation in the food chain.

Vocational orientation is an integral part of the Waldorf School curriculum in Austria, therefore the aim is to offer high quality work placements in Europe as a part of quality development in this field of the upper grades of the Waldorf Schools.\r\nThe participants do a 2 to 8 weeks work placement (agricultural training, industrial placement, social placement).  Waldorf Schools are comprehensive schools with a wide range of knowledge from upper secondary school level to pupils with special needs. The receiving partners (SME, large company, NGO, Charity organisations) are situated in at least 9 countries (Germany,  Ireland, United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, Iceland, Portugal) and choosen with  focus on sustainability. The partnerships are evaluated through the project reports of former Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus+ projects and by personal contacts. New partners could join the project due to the students interests. We paid attention to geographical and language variety to offer a wide choice. In the field of project management the coordinators at the sending schools are working close together.\r\nIn the schools they support the pupils prior, during and after the mobility. They arrange Learning Agreements with the receiving partner and the student and are responsible for the validation of the learning results. At the regular project meetings problems are discussed, and any organisational questions are clarified. The evaluation meetings with the students are also organised then.\r\nWe expect good progress in the field of language skills, intercultural awareness, learning, initiative and especially personal development like increasing independence and self reliance and creativity.

We are going to research Freuds theories as well as Kirkeg\u00e5rd, Plato and other philosophers. Perhaps we'll even make a new theory, perhaps not - the outcome isn't whats important but the journey, the conversation and the possible self realizations along the way.\r\n\r\nAs individual human beings, we are only powerful enough to change the way we think by installing new perspectives in to our hard drive. New perspectives can be created through discussion and confrontation of other points of view.\r\n\r\nPhilosophy has worked with the division of the self, the ego, the consciousness, for as long as philosophy has existed, but how is it relevant today? We live in a world ruled by alteregos, illusions, and make-believe, where the most important personality trade is to be able to create a profile so strong that people wont ever see that you are actually human, with flaws and all. An illusion that contaminates our ability to actually balance between the different layers of our selves.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then take part in art workshops, leaded by well known and lesser known artists.
