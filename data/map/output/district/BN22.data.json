They have to do their compulsory training within these four months.\r\nAt our school there are two different focuses: 1. language and media 2. wellness and health management. Most of the students have very good English skills as well as good Italian/French skills. Some of them have even attended optional subjects like Russian, wine-connoisseur, bar-keeper, patisserie, etc. \r\nDuring their placements abroad students want to practise, strengthen as well as enlarge their practical as well as theoretical knowledge which they have acquired in the first three years at our school. Furthermore, within this project students will be given the chance to get to know a country which they might not know at all or only from a short holiday. Another important aim is to improve their language skills \u2013 make use of what they already know, internalize it and expand their vocabulary, phrases, etc. \r\nWhich skills are to be focused on, will be put down in the Learning Agreements in accordance with teachers, employers and students. During the training (visits, reports from students and mentors), that is, afterwards - the achievement of these goals will be checked. Additional ECVET aspects included in the project are: Personal Transcript and Memorandum of Understanding which are to be signed in the course of visits in the respective countries.\r\nTaking part in this project is therefore useful for the students in many respects. By working in foreign countries they can consolidate their practical as well as their language skills, brush them up and enlarge them and that way increase their chance on the job market significantly. A further important aspect is that with the help of the Erasmus Plus project the students are to crack prejudices, become more open-minded and tolerant. And last but not least, participants are to become more mobile, even at an early age. \r\nThe results of the project will be published by means of articles in local and regional newspapers.

The aims are to find out how exactly the British school system works and, of course, how tuition in class works.

A  preparatory visit was done in May 2012 by Mrs Tournier \u2013 the former chef de travaux and Mrs Ozanne, a DNL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) teacher in Italian. It allowed them to understand how the Xarxa FP network works and how important it is to go through this association which is very helpful for the students' mobility. Indeed, it looks for placement and accommodation places, proposes adapted means of transport and public transport tickets. Moreover, it is present in case problems may occur.  The teacher in charge of the European Section in Italian (Mrs Ozanne) also made a second preparatory visit in October, 2014 to specify the conditions of the mobilities in the city of Rome. In 2014/2015, 5 pupils of the European section in Italian did their mobilities in Rome. Then, in 2015/2016, 5 other pupils performed their last work placement in Rome in March 2016.

The students in this mobility program have been preparing for three school years. The students must satisfy the following required conditions : maturity, motivation and consistent, regular training. Their behavior must be model. The mobility program will take place during the last training period according to the Educational skills base. This allows students to make the most of all their acquired professional knowledge, improve their level of English and experience a stronger cultural opening into Europe. The most important difficulties are the students\u2019 adaptability abroad and developing a good sales practice in English. \r\nThe targets are mentioned at the very start and remain a priority along all three years ; they match those of the Erasmus+ program:\r\n-Improvement of the skills and capacity level considering the employment situation.\r\n- Increase in youth mobility, tendency to improve the quality, innovation, and globalization between organisms.\r\n- Improvement in language teaching and practice, as well as alerting students to the intercultural diversity.\r\n-Promote the emergence of a European status and modernize the Educational systems.\r\n- Reinforce the relationship between the partners in the field.\r\n- Reduce the rate of dropping out of school.\r\nThe 2017 European section is composed of 15 students. Due to the reform of the BTEC National diploma which has reduced schooling to a three year course, the applicants are now younger, sometimes did not pass the BTEC first diploma and are no longer selected to study the BTEC National Diploma. This lack of maturity and the lower educational level make it difficult to select the students because of their incapacity to adapt abroad. Students find it hard to live with a host family. The lack of professional knowledge may also create disagreements during the training placement, such as :\r\n- Incapacity to take part in selling and social activities.\r\n- Difficulty communicating with the staff and customers.\r\n- Refusal to speak English. \r\nThe European section members can change during the three school years; some of them give up, some are no longer motivated and some move to other schools, while others join the mobility program because they and their families are aware of the significant opportunity which awaits them. Several candidates have already reached the targets but most still have to work on them. \r\nThe activities skills are described in the appendix. The skills to obtain include being able to sell, be in charge of a department and manage the selling space of which they are in charge.\r\nThe language is also kept as an important aspect: students must overcome their language difficulties in their professional and daily life.\r\nThis experience will enable them to reach the required level in language European reference, a common reference for all languages taught in the European Community. \r\nThe cultural aspect, which permits students to discover the social and professional habits and practices of a foreign country, is also very important. Good behavior must be a priority, in regards to their autonomy and future personal growth.\r\nThe discovery of a new working practice and immersion in a new environment encourages the students to be open-minded, assures them a better capacity to adapt, and encourage them to be mobile. Finally, the student will acquire better self-confidence and will consider their job and future in a positive way.\r\nEach student is given an individual and adapted training during the three school years. The entire educational team is in charge of training to help broaden the European exposure. The vocational part of the program proposes selling situations ; the English assistant plays an important role in this. The individual training course is used as individual help. Each student may receive personal help in making their mobility report. The aim is to develop their capacity to adapt, to encourage the youth to be more mobile, to improve their language skills and make them more confident. The training period helps them to acquire new selling skills and other ways of working; life with a British family opens their eyes up to the world, another culture, a different society and to other ways of living.\r\nParticipating in this mobility program helps the students improve their professional and language skills and gives them a better level of maturity. Young people could now be part of the employment market due to their capacity to be mobile and their language improvements.

The second year , we are planning to organize  a mobility to Spain, it's already well underway. \r\n\r\nAs the students will be totally immersed, they will be able to discover new professional practices which will be assessed, a new culture and this experience will definetely contribute to improve their English or their Spain level especially their oral skills.\r\n\r\nIncoming mobility\r\nWe intend to welcome 2 spanish  students. This partnership will enable a real meeting of cultures, We will assist them in  setting in and following the students, we will be their local advisor and oversee the work placements. \r\nWe intend to develop a parternship to create exchange programs for students and develop mutual work placements \r\n\r\nVirtual mobility\r\nWe want our students to read and write as they would do in reality, communicate \u00ab for real \u00bb with both the other students of the consortium and the foreign students. This will make sense to their written exchanges  and they will also have to comply with a  standard.\r\n\r\nEducational Mobility\r\nThe consortium staff will share their professional practices with the foreign partners which will contribute to mutual enrichment. It will be used and disseminated moreover innovative methods will be implemented.\r\n\r\nThe different activities  of these mobilities will be proposed to the whole consortium community, it will not only concern the selected students. Thanks to these activities, students  will have the opportunity to speak English outside the habitual school class.\r\n\r\nThese activities will be connected to several school subjects, enabling cross-disciplinary teaching  and the foreign language will then be much more than just a tool\r\n\r\nOur schools are mobilized to promote the  International concept by using the medias, through peeer-exchanges and  by organizing special events to celebrate key events of the European calendar, celebrate 30 years of erasmus,  in order to have an impact in and outside the school community.\r\n\r\nAs a conclusion, this project has both a professional and personal  interest as it requires and develops  knowledge and adaptation to another culture. It will be integrated into a lifelong training of our staff. It will develop autonomy and international concern.

On the occasion of a contact seminary, we got to meet representatives from equivalent institutions to ours, in terms of structure and training courses, among which the vocational and technical school in Kartuzy, Poland.\r\n\r\nWe, then, agreed on a partnership mode which materialized - within the framework of Leonardo Da Vinci, then Erasmus+ programmes - by constant exchanges of trainees, placed in retail businesses, in Bergerac and Kartuzy, between 2010 and 2016. On the same terms, twelve Polish students will, once again, carry out an internship, in the P\u00e9rigord region, in 2017.\r\n\r\nSince 2011, we have also undertaken a partnership with the Italian catering school Artusi, near Faenza.

Targetting quality improvement of the project, we have intended to include that cooperation into our 2015 proposition, aiming for better implementation conditions. Eight French students have, therefore, taken advantage out a international opportunity in Italy, in 2016.\r\n\r\nThanks to such experiences and aware of what is really at stake for beneficiaries, in terms of professional increase in value and education to European citizenship, our 2015 and 2016 projects allowed us to offer mobility experiences to students from every vocational training speciality taught in our school.

It is with this in mind that The CONSORTIUM and its partners will set up some linguistic tuition involving a multidimensional approach (language, culture, communication, training on expressions used on a daily basis).\r\n\r\n- Set up a network of actors engaged in mobility projects:\r\nMobility is not enough considered as a professionalising experience. Many ways are however available to put forward actors promoting the mobility and their action : it is obvious that the impact of the professionals\u2019 mobility will be seen through the mobilities of young people. Indeed, partners getting involved will have a better knowledge to advise young people who wish to go abroad thanks to their own experience in a foreign country (language school, intercultural experiences, meeting with various partners (job center, youth hostels...)) , the professionals will know each partner better and will be able to guide youngsters towards programs that are suitable to their requirements. \r\n\r\nThis way, the training of professionals within the social integration network will answer to the following innovations:\r\n- towards an optimisation of answers for young people:\r\nThe CONSORTIUM has always in mind to adapt its services to its public. But to reach this goal, actions need to be put in place to help advisers but also any actors getting involved in the mobility and in the social and professional integration. These actions represent the foundation of an intervention addressed to a public looking for a job, with the perspective of improving the quality of service. \r\n- better understanding of the actions of international mobility to offer more access to continued quality training to the public they deal with in order to maximise their personal and profesisonal development within the concept \"work First\"\r\n- Maximise the tailoring of the territories\u2019 needs through the strong set up of The CONSORTIUM with a development of work opportunities, transnationnally particularly, with the support of geographic mobility.\r\n- Stenghten the quality of the services addressed to young people and contribute to improve the transparency of the services related to mobility.\r\n- Professionalising advisers so they can face any type of situations. The goal is also to make profesionnal practices evolve in order to develop ways to build a path towards employment.", "http://www.breakaway.fr", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA104-036716_4"], ["8UY", "Carri\u00e8res Europ\u00e9ennes pour les Dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s R\u00e9cents de l'Enseignement Secondaire et Sup\u00e9rieur", "Breakaway Agency Limited", 317795.0, "The IERF, founded in 1995, an organisation providing training, career guidance and mobility accompaniment, proposes for consideration the renewal of the CEDRES.S project \u2013 \u201cEuropean Careers for Recent Graduates of Secondary and Higher Education\u201d, approved through simplified procedure since 2014.\r\nIts goal is to offer 135 participants from the Ile de France region a mobility road-map enabling them to acquire professional skills and improve their employability.\r\nThe underlying methodology of its implementation derives from our previous experience on Leonardo, certified since 2009, and particularly MERIT, designed for young people of 18-25 years old with social integration problems, as well as CAMEP, designed for candidates for professional retraining. Of great benefit also is the experience gained in the context of CEDRE.S first presented for Leonardo 2013. This allowed us to develop programmes specifically for a post-student public, coming out higher education, not a priority group in our previous programmes. It has also inspired the title given to this 2014 project, which seems to fit our target group.\r\nWhilst CEDRE.S is clearly structured in terms of phases and apprenticeship units, its overriding purpose is to encompass and improve the professional capacities of participants of level V to I, who have left either secondary education, higher education or full-time training of any sort within the past year. It would offer them an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d programme of qualification, embracing different job skills, technical linguistic capacities and intercultural exposure, all designed to meet the individual\u2019s specific needs at the time.\r\nOne of the principal advantages of the teaching programme resides in the cross-fertilisation between these 3 aspects which make up the whole experience. To help the students attain this goal, we have devised two mobility \u201croad-maps\u201d: the first lasting 6 weeks, particularly geared to young people in integration from level V to II, the second of 13 weeks targeted at participants of a higher level, either older or with longer professional experience. Whilst the periods of mobility can vary, the teaching plan contains the same stages and objectives:\r\n1. Pre-departure: collective socioprofessional guidance sessions accompanied by individual assessments. Intercultural and language preparation.\r\n2. Abroad (outside France): practical internship in a company meeting the profile or personal project of each participant, with constant monitoring to measure linguistic and professional progress, certified by Europass and level tests.\r\n3. On return to France: session to assess what has been learnt from this experience, followed by accompaniment during 3 to 6 months to allow the participants to:\r\n- Develop their capacity to summarise and explain in their own words the key skills acquired in relation to the specific professional context they have chosen.\r\n- Learn to identify what experience and training is most relevant to maintaining a competitive professional profile on the job market, this in a logic of \u201cLong Life Learning\u201d.\r\n- Acquire a continuous ability to judge their own progress, their technical, linguistic and intercultural skills, hence enabling them to position themselves to advantage vis-\u00e0-vis European or international recruiters.\r\n- Identify concrete employment opportunities: a major indicator of the impact of our project is integration in the job market within 6 months.\r\nWe have built a partnership network with 8 experienced intermediary organisations in different countries to ensure optimum welcome and logistics for participants. Clear specifications are drawn up with appropriate norms against which performance is measured, supervised by the IERF and a Piloting committee. Choice of the partners reflects level of demand by country; English and Spanish-speaking destinations tend to dominate language-based requests, but other countries are selected as a function of specific sectors.\r\nTo encourage initiative, evaluate results and publish them, we collaborate with centres located throughout the Ile de France region, which in turn embraces 250 organisations, whose vocation it is to assist this public in obtaining employment. \r\n\r\nThe Erasmus+ Mobility Charter acquired in 2015 as well as the active partnership of many public authorities should help to enlarge our partnership networks to other teaching organisations or local authorities. It should also contribute to confirme the qualifying and professionalising dimension of mobility paths.", "http://www.breakaway.fr", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA116-035548_7"], ["8UY", "L'Europe dans l'Assiette", "Breakaway Agency Limited", 19246.0, "The people concerned are the pupils that are undertaking their hospitality industry training in our establishment, the \u201cLyc\u00e9e des\r\nM\u00e9tiers de l\u2019H\u00f4tellerie et des Services \u2013 Jules Le Cesne\u201d (The Jules Le Cesne Vocational School for Hospitality and Services). The social\r\ndimension of our project becomes particularly pertinent when you take into account the fact that 70% of the young people who\r\nattend our establishment are considered to be \u201csocially disadvantaged\u201d. Allowing them to go abroad for free is a bet on the future of their employability, as hospitality is a sector where mobility is important and where the ability to speak modern languages is\r\nparamount, however their social situation does not often offer them the opportunity to be mobile.\r\nThe link between this Leonardo Da Vinci mobility project and the Jules Le Cesne vocational school\u2019s own project is no less relevant\r\ntoday as, within the context of the contract agreement, tackling early school leaving is the main objective of part of the measures\r\ntaken and the actions carried out within the establishment.\r\nThere are many specific needs targeted:\r\n1. Optimising the chances of success in the exam by acquiring different work techniques in the professional environment as well as\r\npromoting the learning and the use of foreign languages in professional situations.\r\n2. Validating professional techniques by the assessment made through the joint work of the supervisor and the evaluator who fill in/\r\nexpand on the work experience booklet when evaluating it at the end of the placement.\r\n3. Valorising and validating the professional experience, as young people who spend one and a half months abroad immersing\r\nthemselves in the professional world will definitely develop their adaptability.\r\n4.\r\nThe provision of their Europass Mobility will also allow them to testify their training period in a business abroad and will be an\r\ninteresting asset for future employers.\r\n5. Our city, Le Havre, named a UNESCO World Heritage City in 2005, needs to recruit qualified staff who are capable of expressing\r\nthemselves correctly in a foreign language, as there is an increasingly significant number of foreign tourists: cruise ship passengers,\r\ncultural and architectural tourists etc\u2026\r\n6. The opening of the BTS (HND) hotel and restaurant management option \u201cTableware\u201d is the proof of a real necessity to train young\r\npeople in these industries, as the feasibility studies show us this real need for a highly skilled workforce.\r\n7.\r\nIn terms of our partners, we expect to pursue, reinforce and further develop the number of different placements, all the while  offering reciprocity in order to reduce accommodation costs. In this way, for several years we have been receiving Slovakian, Italian\r\nand Portuguese pupils who we accompany throughout their work placement.\r\nWorking in close collaboration with colleagues in our establishment who successfully coordinate Comenius has allowed us to\r\ndevelop partnerships with the hotel establishments hosting these ongoing programmes. We are therefore now in a position to offer\r\nour pupils the chance to go to Belgium, Portugal, England, Romania, Italy and Spain. All of this collaboration equally allows us to\r\noffer our pupils hotel establishments which are more appropriate for the skills expected in their assessment booklets for their workbased\r\ntraining period. Thus we now offer work placements for pupils with the \u201cbaccalaur\u00e9at professionnel\u201d, but also to those with\r\nthe \u201cbaccalaur\u00e9at technologique\u201d.\r\nThis mobility programme is vital to us in order to pursue our politics of opening up to Europe. It allows us to place pupils abroad in\r\nexcellent conditions, all the while consolidating their professional skills, giving them professional experience and allowing them to\r\nuse a foreign language daily, without forgetting providing them with an extremely enriching human experience.\r\nWe intend to open this possibility of mobility to pupils of the final year of Vocational high school \" Hotel business \" for their autumn internship in the field of the accommodation.", "http://www.breakaway.fr", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA116-035886_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BN22"}
