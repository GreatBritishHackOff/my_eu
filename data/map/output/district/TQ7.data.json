They will engage through a series of European and regional workshops.   GAP1 represents phase 1 of a three-phase programme that aims to explore the complementary nature of alternative knowledge and investigate how to combine it in ways that will enhance understanding and management of natural resources.  Tied to knowledge, GAP1 is an evidence-based approach that uses participation as the vehicle to improving understanding on fisheries research and management issues of common concern to stakeholders, scientists and policy makers. This is a pre-requisite for fostering the mutual respect essential for successful future collaboration.   Through initiation of cooperative research and helping build the capacity of stakeholders to engage in participatory research, GAP1 contributes towards the wider aspiration of the Science in Society programme. In particular, to enhance democratic debate with a more engaged and informed public, thus providing better conditions for collective choices on scientific issues relating to sustainable management, conservation of ecosystem integrity and biodiversity of the marine environment.", null, 672846.0, "GAP1", "Better future for fisheries", "Bringing together researchers and producers from the fisheries sector has helped address major differences between the two. The initiative is also helping to drive sustainability of the sector.", "Science has much to benefit from cooperative research between scientists and stakeholders such as consumers and producers. The EU-funded project 'Bridging the gap between science and stakeholders: phase I common ground' (GAP1) explored different avenues to better understand fisheries research and their management.\n\nWhile fisheries stakeholders would like to ensure the sector's sustainability, they are sometimes at odds with policymakers and scientists who are perceived as distant to realities on the ground. GAP1 has brought the stakeholders together with scientists to improve understanding and management of fisheries through unified, collaborative analysis.\n\nThe drive saw 15 partnerships from 11 countries in Europe among parties where science exchange and stakeholder research led to joint research. GAP1 produced 12 case study research proposals to outline priorities. Themes discussed included ecology, marine spatial planning, discarding, management measures, sustainability and decision making, with a strong overall management component.\n\nGAP1 helped bring science and society closer in this respect. It enhanced public engagement in researchers, focusing on sustainable collaboration and dialogue among actors in the field of fisheries. It also outlined the challenges that hinder progress and exploit stakeholder engagement in a way that impacts European policies.\n\nThe outcomes of this initiative have been used for creating a strategy for future research based on a participatory planning process for GAP2. The latter aims to integrate stakeholder and scientific knowledge in powerful ways that could positively influence policy. In the meantime, the outputs of GAP1 have been released on the project's website and are already cementing ties between science and industry. A much healthier fisheries sector is on the horizon.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2011-08/45658.jpg", "fp7_89991_995591608"], ["2TJ", "Bridging the gap between science, stakeholders and policy makers \nPhase 2:Integration of evidence-based knowledge and its application to science and management of fisheries and the marine environment", "South Devon and Channel Shellfishermen Ltd", "GAP2 is about making a difference to an issue of significance to the whole of society; the wellbeing of the marine environment and the sustainability of fisheries upon which society depends for food. It builds on the relationships, processes and plans arising from GAP1 by enabling Mobilisation and Mutual Learning (MML) actions that promote stakeholder participation in the debate on and development of research knowledge and structures relevant to emerging policy on fisheries and the marine environment.\n\nA broad range of stakeholders will participate, including actors from civil society organisations, research institutions, universities, national and regional ministries and media organisations. Their work will involve: participatory research actions that integrate the knowledge of stakeholders and scientists and render it useful for management and policy development, critical evaluation of the participatory processes and incorporation of the lessons learned into systems of research and decision making. Global networks will be developed to enable trans- and international cooperation on comparing and establishing good practice.\n\nThe actions of the participants and the outcomes from GAP2 will provide a concrete realisation of specific Science in Society objectives for engaging the public in research, enabling effective two-way communication between scientists and other stakeholders, and helping to make policy based on scientific evidence and research knowledge.
