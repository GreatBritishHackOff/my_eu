They will engage through a series of European and regional workshops.   GAP1 represents phase 1 of a three-phase programme that aims to explore the complementary nature of alternative knowledge and investigate how to combine it in ways that will enhance understanding and management of natural resources.  Tied to knowledge, GAP1 is an evidence-based approach that uses participation as the vehicle to improving understanding on fisheries research and management issues of common concern to stakeholders, scientists and policy makers. This is a pre-requisite for fostering the mutual respect essential for successful future collaboration.   Through initiation of cooperative research and helping build the capacity of stakeholders to engage in participatory research, GAP1 contributes towards the wider aspiration of the Science in Society programme. In particular, to enhance democratic debate with a more engaged and informed public, thus providing better conditions for collective choices on scientific issues relating to sustainable management, conservation of ecosystem integrity and biodiversity of the marine environment.", null, 672846.0, "GAP1", "Better future for fisheries", "Bringing together researchers and producers from the fisheries sector has helped address major differences between the two. The initiative is also helping to drive sustainability of the sector.", "Science has much to benefit from cooperative research between scientists and stakeholders such as consumers and producers. The EU-funded project 'Bridging the gap between science and stakeholders: phase I common ground' (GAP1) explored different avenues to better understand fisheries research and their management.\n\nWhile fisheries stakeholders would like to ensure the sector's sustainability, they are sometimes at odds with policymakers and scientists who are perceived as distant to realities on the ground. GAP1 has brought the stakeholders together with scientists to improve understanding and management of fisheries through unified, collaborative analysis.\n\nThe drive saw 15 partnerships from 11 countries in Europe among parties where science exchange and stakeholder research led to joint research. GAP1 produced 12 case study research proposals to outline priorities. Themes discussed included ecology, marine spatial planning, discarding, management measures, sustainability and decision making, with a strong overall management component.\n\nGAP1 helped bring science and society closer in this respect. It enhanced public engagement in researchers, focusing on sustainable collaboration and dialogue among actors in the field of fisheries. It also outlined the challenges that hinder progress and exploit stakeholder engagement in a way that impacts European policies.\n\nThe outcomes of this initiative have been used for creating a strategy for future research based on a participatory planning process for GAP2. The latter aims to integrate stakeholder and scientific knowledge in powerful ways that could positively influence policy. In the meantime, the outputs of GAP1 have been released on the project's website and are already cementing ties between science and industry.

Their work will involve: participatory research actions that integrate the knowledge of stakeholders and scientists and render it useful for management and policy development, critical evaluation of the participatory processes and incorporation of the lessons learned into systems of research and decision making.

A profound theoretical and practical education and training in the field of tourismas well as a  competent language skills in English and Italian forms a comprehensive educational framework for this goal. \r\n\r\nPart of this work-oriented education are obligatory practical trainings of 12 weeks.  \r\nIn the past two years the interest of the students and graduates of the HLW Lienz in doing a practical training abroad has risen enormously. In order to facilitate all the work regarding practical trainings abroad for all people involved (students, parents, teachers, partner enterprises) two teachers got in charge of co-ordinating the entire Erasmus+ programme for the school and founded the  Verein der HLW / HF Lienz zur F\u00f6rderung von Auslandspraktika in the school year of 2015/16.\r\nWith this additional offer of training places abroad as well as the entire co-ordination of the Erasmus+ programme organised at the school, the internationalisation and the quality management of the two schools could be intensified and the positive reputation of the schools as a contact point for international work experience was established.  Due to the positive  feedback regarding the Erasmus+ programme by students and their parents as well as teachers of secondary schools we can also assume that the option of doing a practical training abroad has already become one of the main reasons why these students choose our schools their next educational step. \r\n\r\nAdditionally to the strong co-operation with the partner enterprises, based on mutual visits and a regular communication and contact throughout the whole year, the Erasmus + programme was promoted at the school and in the whole area with a vast amount of information about it. This included informational meetings as well as a buddy project with former trainees, information evenings for parents and students, permanent information boards introducing the Erasmus+ programme as well as all the parntner enterprises at the school, articles and blogs about the project on the homepage of the school, presentations about it at the parents' day and all secondary schools of East Tyrol etc..  Through this advertising of the programme as well as the personal networking of the trainees regarding this project other schools have already been inspired to consider practical trainings abroad for their students and the news about Erasmus+ programmes is spreading.\r\n\r\nCurrently 33 students are involved in this project. All of them have already signed their placement contracts as well as Learning Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding with the partner enterprises in England and Italy. All the training places have been chosen by the students themselves. They all got a positive reply for a practical training after their application including Europass CVs, motivation letters and personal job interviews. As all partner enterprises only have had positive experiences with trainees from our two schools, this co-operation has turned out to be a win-win situation for both: our schools profit from this additional international offer and the training places can rely on polite, helpful, dedicated and competent trainees for the most hectic period of work.\r\n  \r\nBesides an improvement in practical knowhow, intercultural knowledge and linguistic competences, which all lead to better resuls in the final exams as well as the A-levels, a practical training abroad is especially important for the positive development of all personal and social skills, especially an enhanced self-esteem of the trainees. This huge step in their personal development obviously also has a great impact on their further career at the school and in their later life.  Their career prospects do not only increase because of this international work experience but also due to their - often newly gained - openness, flexibiltiy and professional appearance which they get during an international internship. A large number of students who have done a practical training abroad plan a longer placement abroad after their final exams and they are much more confident and sure about their future plans when they start applying for jobs in international companies. This naturally makes them become role models for many others.\r\n\r\nDue to this project an international way of thinking, working and evaluating has been established at the HLW / HF Lienz and has made it a more modern and  more attractive place of education.", "http://www.thurlestone.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA102-034653_2"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["1AT", "RA9", "SOUTH HAMS (KINGSBRIDGE) HOSPITAL"], ["1AT", "RK9", "SOUTH HAMS HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TQ7"}
