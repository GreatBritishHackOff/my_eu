The target group are child care workers and nursery school teachers in VET (second year of education). The participants will be doing a six-week-internship integrated in accordance with their training and examination regulations with Paris (Cr\u00e9teil), Prague, Dublin, Brighton, Pevensey-Westham and London (Wandsworth and Croydon being the places of venue. The task-based main focus will be on acquiring and broadening skills and competences in the fields of language, culture and interculturality, nursery and child care as well as personal development and interpersonal skills. Furthermore, it is the aim of the project to enable the participants, by means of comparing the relevant pedagogical approaches, to get to know and learn about European educational concepts, in particular early childhood education. To that end, the participants will have the opportunity to compare both the concepts and the practical work in Germany and the European partners with a clear focus on educational and social backgrounds as well as pedagogical concepts and methodology. In that connection, the salient points are the challenge of early learning and inclusion. By intensifying adaptability, coooperation, linguistic competence, flexibility, ability to reflect, independence and generally broadening horizons, the participants will enhance their personal, interpersonal and professional skills. It has become characteristic of our school policy to implement European internships which have contributed immensely to the quality of our syllabus and pedagogical work.\r\nIn order to achieve and substantiate those goals and targets, we are using ECVET elements to ensure quality under operational parameters.

The project will further explore ACDF's strategy of using performing arts as a medium for engaging young people and facilitating their involvement in productive pursuits. It will examine and test the processes and activities used by \u2018ACDF Getfamilyar Project in enabling ACDF meeting its objectives and where necessary make recommendations for enhancing ACDF's approach.Participants will use the performing arts workshops and taster sessions to explore ideas and create new work for their performances, which will provide opportunities for them to identify similarities in artistic processes between singers, dancers, photographers and producers in planning and constructing their performances and demonstrate how each genre uses material and individual interpretations to facilitate crafting their performance responses. By considering these similarities in artistic processes as a starting point for new performances, participants will be able to develop a better understanding of expressive visual language and how observations and discussions can be melodized and developed through work in the studio and be exchanged across performing arts disciplines.The project will bring young people from the United Kingdom, Holland, Germany and Cayman Islands together with the aim of building their capacity to use the performing arts as a tool for building individual confidence, encourage cross cultural learning and interaction and building bridges of friendship and partnership across four countries within the contexts of a united global village. The long term goal is to create a common youth-led strategic approach for engaging young people to learn from each other, intermingle and feel more acceptable, productive and safe with a sense of pride and purpose.
