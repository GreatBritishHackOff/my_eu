However, Ink jet printing has only been able to achieve a resolution of >=10um and the viscosity of printable inks is limited to <40 centipoise, this further limits the solids content of inks to <30-Vol% and the size of the nano-fillers to <50nm typically. These factors limit the range of functional inks that can be printed as well as the resolution and final properties of the resultant printed/sintered structures and components.\n\nThe HI-RESPONSE project is based on highly innovative, patented Electro-static printing technology (ESJET) that has already been proven on TRL 4 to print to a resolution of 1um and be able to print inks with a viscosity of up to 40.000 cP. The resultant printed/sintered structures will therefore be able to achieve a high resolution and increase final component properties through enabling the printing of highly filled nano-inks and functional organic materials.\n\nThis technology will be further developed to TRL 6 within the project to allow for the design and assembly of a multi-head system that can achieve resolution, speeds and cost that far surpassed that of current ink-jet systems. The resultant system will be demonstrated at TRL 6 for a wide range of materials, including: nano-Cu and nano-ceramic filled inks and organic polymers. Each of these materials will be printed to create components specifically defined and specified by the industrial organisations within the consortium: Infineon, Ficosa, Piher (Meggitt) and Zytronic.

A Youth Exchange about bringing it out.\u201d is an event in which we involve 14 organisations from Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Malta, Romania, United Kingdom, Albania, Armenia, Estonia, Ukraine, Greece, Turkey in two events in Potsdam, Germany, and in Newcastle, United Kingdom. \r\nTolerance is not only a slogan but also an ideology. Definitions have shifted over the centuries from tolerating the existence of different religions to contradicting opinions. People tend to see the term from different angles, from that of freedom and from that of the oppression through \"political correctness\". But it remains at the center of each democratic order, it proves as the main ingredient of durable peace, and it is also a very good way of saving energy and focusing on the important issues instead. \r\nThe two planned activities deal with tolerance and a way how participants can fully express their opinion about it to the public. Participants will learn together what tolerance means to them. They will develop and teach each other methods how to create tolerance in your own surrounding. They will reach out to people, organizations and institutions that also strive for tolerance in the communities of Potsdam and in  Newcastle/Gateshead, either for themselves, for others or to promote it among each others. From them participants will learn, what tolerance means to them. And then they will bring out what they learnt onto the road and to the people in a Tolerance Race. \r\nThe youth exchange is also a theatrical even. Participants will plan, learn, design and rehearse this Tolerance race in a professional fashion for days, will learn their moves, go out and explore life in the two towns, make friends and confront with prejudices of their own and of other people.

Thanks to the effort of NaturKultur e.V. and Leppe\u00acGanespalte Foreningen in Langfjord. The Youth Exchange deals with negative developments in the globalized chain of food producers, food processing enterprises and the final consumers.  The exchange aims to to raise awareness among youth to improve their consciousness for good food, its origins and a responsible ecological behavior of all of us, that will lead to a healthier lifestyle.\r\nIt will take place in Romania, Targu Neamt between 25 September and 3 of October 2017. The youth exchange will bring together youth from \r\nNowadays the largest share of world\u2019s population participates in a global cycle of production, trade, processing and consumption of food. This food is not any more consumed, where it has been produced nor does it reach the end consumer in a raw form. In our global world imported food replaces local food, convenience food and eating out replaces home-cooked food, fast food replaces slow food. Even worse, large quantities of food produced actually never reaches the consumer. Due to distorted consumer demands it is sorted out and thrown away. Food decays during transport and storage or it is taken out of stores due to over-regulated shelf-life prescriptions. Interests of international food conglomerates to sell cheaper products with higher profits lead to the gradual degradation of food. The growth of food is industrialized in plantations, older more healthy races are replaced by genetically modified sorts. Cattle is subjected to inhumane treatment. Mono-cultures become a danger for nature\u2019s sustainability. Food items are redesigned. Its contents are replaced by cheaper products. Artificial spices, colors,  salt, etc. are used to create taste and looks where there are none. Sugar is added to spur hunger for more. Chemicals are added to prolong shelf-life. \r\nBut there is also a growing awareness that such developments lead to higher obesity, increased allergies, destroys nature and deprives local and smaller farmers of good profits. Movements springing up everywhere in the world attempt to stop that development and to increase consumer awareness. They do not stop short there, but actively change their own and others behaviors. There is a movement for fair production prices for third world farmers. There are hundreds of thousands of farmers switching to ecological farming, permaculture, biodynamic farming. There are urban gardeners growing food in their cities. There are the adherents of aquaponics, growing vegetables and raising fish in leftover industrial plantations or even on rooftops. There are those reshaping distribution channels by marketing homegrown food directly into households or from ecological farms into farmers\u2019 markets in the cities. There are also those, who are recycling allegedly \u2018bad\u2019 food sorted out before passing the farm gate or in the wholesale markets. There are even people diving into the dumpsters of supermarkets. There are those who are attempting to provide cheaper and better food through the evasion of packaging, the exchange of industrial food sorts against traditional, more healthy and more valuable ones. \r\nWe design this follow up youth exchange to introduce a large group of participants to the situation, its outlooks and possibilities to act themselves. They will learn from each other about developments in their countries. They will study the importance of transport, storage, sorting, packaging and positioning to influence their consumer behaviors. The will be visiting farmers, wholesale markets, supermarkets to inquire and discover themselves the mechanism of price and production. They will train themselves to read, study, understand and analyze the prescriptions of food. They will attempt to design an own youth-friendly diet by buying, tasting and by cooking food together. We will experience in person the difference between industrial farming and ecological farming. They will be helped by activists, researchers and inspection services. We want this Youth Exchange to be one of several, through which youth workers can learn from youth, how it is possible to mobilize and train young people of their age to become more aware and receptive to a more pleasing food diet, that instantly reduces the ecological \u2018food\u2019 print of generations to come. To award the effort of the participants and to achieve an intimate link between this and future youth exchanges we will introduce the certificate of \"food activists\".", "http://www.silverfoxne.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-RO01-KA105-037677_8"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NE21"}
