We believe that this area will have a great impact on the technology of the future, as well as on our understanding of nature, and we are eager to train new\nscientists and engineers in this broad field. We believe that Science and Technology in Europe will greatly benefit from this research, and from the education and and knowledge that we will impart to a new generation of researchers. Our research plans are organized into five scientific work packages, which cover mathematical systems theory, modelling and model reduction, relevant aspects of control theory, and applications. The applications that we plan to investigate concern a wide range of flexible structures in interaction with fluids: wind turbines, aircraft wings, precision machine tools, vessels linked by cables as encountered in marine salvage operations and microscopic electromechanical devices. These apparently unrelated systems face similar challenges and can be analysed and controlled in a unified framework.", null, 3431011.0, "ConFlex", null, null, null, null, "http://www.narec.co.uk", null, "h2020_211583_998811620"], ["1LZ", "Advanced integrated supervisory and wind turbine control for optimal operation of large Wind Power Plants", "Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult", "Cost of energy (COE) is the most important single factor in deployment of renewables in the energy system. Reduction of COE is, among other things, directly related to operational control of Wind Power Plants (WPP) as a whole and the individual wind turbines (WT) within them. In the Total Control project the COE reduction will be pursued by developing and validating advanced integrated WPP/WT control schemes, where all essential interactions between the WPP WT\u2019s are accounted for including both production and load aspects.\nOptimal WPP control is traditionally formulated as a one-parameter optimization problem focusing on the WPP production only. However, ultimately the optimal WPP performance should result from a multi objective optimization problem, where the optimal economic performance of a WPP is pursued over the WPP life time, conditioned on external grid demands. This is what Total Control is about.\nThe suggested integrated WPP/WT control approach seeks the optimal economical WPP revenue \u2013 i.e. the optimal economic balance between WPP power production and WPP operational costs. This is done by developing hierarchically coupled WPP and WT control schemes conditioned on a set of superior grid operator demands. \nIn the WPP control design phase information is only fed from the WPP controller to the individual WT controllers, whereas in on-line operational control available WT and WPP flow field information will be assimilated into the WPP control for optimal system performance. Furthermore, the WPP controller will also make use of current market information (e.g. energy price, demand for ancillary services etc.) as well as information about the state of individual turbines (e.g. current operational state, maintenance requirements and component lifetime consumption) to allow COE objectives to be optimised dynamically.", 494507.0, 4251498.0, "TotalControl", null, null, null, null, "http://www.narec.co.uk", null, "h2020_212578_998811620"], ["1LZ", "Enabling Future Arrays in Tidal", "Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult", "In this flagship project, the EnFAIT (Enabling Future Arrays in Tidal) Team, a partnership of leading European companies, will demonstrate a grid-connected tidal energy array that: \n\n- demonstrates a step change in the lifetime cost of energy for tidal power; \n- proves that high array reliability & availability can be achieved with best practice maintenance regimes; \n- captures and disseminates substantial learning on fundamental issues for the ocean energy industry; \n- builds investor confidence; \n- takes a huge step towards creating a commercial, bankable tidal energy sector; and\n- at 6 turbines, will be the largest number of devices ever deployed in an ocean energy array. \n\nThis project will build upon an existing operational site, minimising development risk and allowing the generation of real-world results from day one.
