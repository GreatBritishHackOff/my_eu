Accurate predictions of the effects seawater warming and other stressors on marine resources are needed to successfully manage our seas and plan for future change. Of all the facets of global change, increasing temperature is perhaps the most important, as temperature affects all biological processes. In terrestrial systems, researchers have used polytunnels and cloches to manipulate climate to investigate the effects of warming on community structure, dynamics, and biodiversity. There have been no such experiments conducted in the marine realm. As such, a major knowledge gap relates to the lack of field-based experiments conducted on marine organisms to date, and most knowledge stems from highly artificial laboratory manipulations.

These included 21 marine expeditions to offshore storage and seepage sites for studies and data collection. During these cruises the researchers used and advanced a suite of cutting edge monitoring technology.\n\nScientists did not detect any CO2 anomalies at Sleipner in waters above the storage site. However, formation waters are released through a 3 km long fracture 25 km north to the Sleipner platform while both natural gas and formation water are seeping through abandoned wells located in the area. The observed geological features pose a number of important questions that are currently addressed by ECO2: Are there any high permeability pathways for gas and fluid flow through the overburden? Are seepage rates amplified by the ongoing storage operation? May CO2 stored sub-seabed ultimately leak through the overburden via seismic pipe and chimney structures, fractures and abandoned wells?\n\nTo find answers, CO2 release  at three natural seep sites was studied and deliberate CO2 release experiments were conducted in the vicinity of the Sleipner storage complex.

Natural seep sites and shore-based mesocosm experiments showed that birth and development processes of sensitive organisms such as echinoderms are negatively affected by increased CO2.\n\nThe environmental risks of CCS and its financial, legal and political implications have been elucidated and field data stored in a project database.

Field data, satellite remote-sensing data and scientific reports will be used and the system will abide by standards of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) common infrastructure (GCI).\n\nResearchers already have a clear picture of the current national and regional monitoring capacities in countries in North Africa, meaning that gaps can be identified. They have also pinpointed all potential sources of data, which include information about primary production, harmful algal blooms, sea surface temperature, water transparency and wave impacts.\n\nThe Bay of Bejaia (Algeria), Lake Burullus (Egypt), the Gulf of Sirte (Libya), the Lagoon of Nador (Morocco) and the Gulf of Gabes (Tunisia) were selected as case study areas in which to test MeI's indicators, models and services. Once completed, the MeI and the tools developed within the project and a MEDINA geoportal will be made available to end users http://www.medinageoportal.eu (online) .\n\nThese products will contribute to studies on the impact of climate change on coastal habitats.

Cyanobacteria cause similar problems in freshwaters. These episodes encompass a broad range of phenomena collectively referred to as \u00abharmful algal blooms\u00bb (HABs). They include discoloration of waters by mass occurrences of microalgae (true algal blooms that may or may not be \u00abharmful\u00bb) to toxin-producing species that may be harmful even in low cell concentrations. A broad classification of HAB distinguishes three groups of toxic organisms. For adequate management of these phenomena, monitoring of microalgae is required.  However, the effectiveness of monitoring programmes is limited by the fact that it is time consuming and morphology as determined by light microscopy may be insufficient to give definitive species and toxin attribution. Once cell numbers reach a threshold level, then shellfish are selected to toxin analysis by the mouse bioassay. The mouse bioassay is continued on a daily basis until no more toxin is detected. Molecular and biochemical methods are now available that offer rapid means of both species and toxin detection. In this project we will target rapid species identification using rRNA genes as the target. We include antibodies to specific toxins because even when cell numbers are very low, the toxins can be present and can be accumulated in the shellfish.  Microarrays are the state of the art technology in molecular biology for the processing of bulk samples for detection of target RNA/DNA sequences..  The purpose of MIDTAL is to support the common fisheries policy to aid the national monitoring agencies by providing new rapid tools for the identification of toxic algae and their toxins so that they can comply with ECC directive 91/1491/CEE that can be converted to cell numbers and reduce the need for the mouse bioassay.", 219553.0, 2866766.0, "MIDTAL", "High-throughput screening for toxic algae", "Algae are an essential part of marine ecosystems.

This necessitates the continuous monitoring of this phenomenon to avoid the potential health dangers and economic impacts of contaminated seafood.\n\nTraditionally, phytoplankton monitoring is carried out by identification and enumeration using light microscopy. However, this method, apart from being time consuming, is prone to error due to the phenotypic similarity among various algal species. To distinguish among different species in complex samples, various DNA-based methods such as fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) have been developed.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Microarrays for the detection of toxic algae' (MIDTAL) project proposed to develop a universal microarray to test bulk water samples for toxic algal species and their toxins. This method would speed up the laborious identification of individual species.\n\nFollowing extensive optimisation, MIDTAL partners developed an array with 163 probes covering all the major harmful algal species of current interest in the EU. The array was validated using traditional PCR for specific species and microscopy-based cell counts which showed reasonable agreement. The so called phylochip was considered to be more accurate in cases of small flagellate cells and Pseudo-nitzschia species, which are particularly difficult to quantify by light microscopy.\n\nA further aspect of MIDTAL's work involved the detection of main algae-producing toxins by the use of antibodies on a microarray format. Although not as sensitive as the ELISA, this chip could be utilised in samples of significant toxicity.\n\nGiven the importance of toxin-producing algae for human health, directly or through the consumption of contaminated seafood, MIDTAL deliverables will aid the monitoring and prompt identification of toxic species.

The proposed 5-year programme brings together single cell biophysics, imaging and state of the art molecular biology with in situ studies of natural oceanic phytoplankton populations, focussing principally on two significant groups, the diatoms and coccolithophores.  A major aim is to gain critical mechanistic understanding of membrane transport, cellular regulation and key physiological processes at the single cell level along with information on the microenvironment that surrounds cells.  This will be used in conjunction with modelling studies to determine how phytoplankton cells regulate their immediate environment and how this in turn interacts with metabolic activity.   In order to understand how the physiological properties of single cells in the laboratory translate to behaviour of natural populations we will examine cell physiological properties in natural populations.
