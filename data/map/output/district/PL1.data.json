Accurate predictions of the effects seawater warming and other stressors on marine resources are needed to successfully manage our seas and plan for future change.

In terrestrial systems, researchers have used polytunnels and cloches to manipulate climate to investigate the effects of warming on community structure, dynamics, and biodiversity. There have been no such experiments conducted in the marine realm. As such, a major knowledge gap relates to the lack of field-based experiments conducted on marine organisms to date, and most knowledge stems from highly artificial laboratory manipulations.

These included 21 marine expeditions to offshore storage and seepage sites for studies and data collection. During these cruises the researchers used and advanced a suite of cutting edge monitoring technology.\n\nScientists did not detect any CO2 anomalies at Sleipner in waters above the storage site. However, formation waters are released through a 3 km long fracture 25 km north to the Sleipner platform while both natural gas and formation water are seeping through abandoned wells located in the area. The observed geological features pose a number of important questions that are currently addressed by ECO2: Are there any high permeability pathways for gas and fluid flow through the overburden? Are seepage rates amplified by the ongoing storage operation? May CO2 stored sub-seabed ultimately leak through the overburden via seismic pipe and chimney structures, fractures and abandoned wells?\n\nTo find answers, CO2 release  at three natural seep sites was studied and deliberate CO2 release experiments were conducted in the vicinity of the Sleipner storage complex.

Cyanobacteria cause similar problems in freshwaters. These episodes encompass a broad range of phenomena collectively referred to as \u00abharmful algal blooms\u00bb (HABs). They include discoloration of waters by mass occurrences of microalgae (true algal blooms that may or may not be \u00abharmful\u00bb) to toxin-producing species that may be harmful even in low cell concentrations. A broad classification of HAB distinguishes three groups of toxic organisms. For adequate management of these phenomena, monitoring of microalgae is required.  However, the effectiveness of monitoring programmes is limited by the fact that it is time consuming and morphology as determined by light microscopy may be insufficient to give definitive species and toxin attribution. Once cell numbers reach a threshold level, then shellfish are selected to toxin analysis by the mouse bioassay. The mouse bioassay is continued on a daily basis until no more toxin is detected. Molecular and biochemical methods are now available that offer rapid means of both species and toxin detection. In this project we will target rapid species identification using rRNA genes as the target. We include antibodies to specific toxins because even when cell numbers are very low, the toxins can be present and can be accumulated in the shellfish.  Microarrays are the state of the art technology in molecular biology for the processing of bulk samples for detection of target RNA/DNA sequences..  The purpose of MIDTAL is to support the common fisheries policy to aid the national monitoring agencies by providing new rapid tools for the identification of toxic algae and their toxins so that they can comply with ECC directive 91/1491/CEE that can be converted to cell numbers and reduce the need for the mouse bioassay.", 219553.0, 2866766.0, "MIDTAL", "High-throughput screening for toxic algae", "Algae are an essential part of marine ecosystems.

This necessitates the continuous monitoring of this phenomenon to avoid the potential health dangers and economic impacts of contaminated seafood.\n\nTraditionally, phytoplankton monitoring is carried out by identification and enumeration using light microscopy. However, this method, apart from being time consuming, is prone to error due to the phenotypic similarity among various algal species. To distinguish among different species in complex samples, various DNA-based methods such as fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) have been developed.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Microarrays for the detection of toxic algae' (MIDTAL) project proposed to develop a universal microarray to test bulk water samples for toxic algal species and their toxins. This method would speed up the laborious identification of individual species.\n\nFollowing extensive optimisation, MIDTAL partners developed an array with 163 probes covering all the major harmful algal species of current interest in the EU. The array was validated using traditional PCR for specific species and microscopy-based cell counts which showed reasonable agreement. The so called phylochip was considered to be more accurate in cases of small flagellate cells and Pseudo-nitzschia species, which are particularly difficult to quantify by light microscopy.\n\nA further aspect of MIDTAL's work involved the detection of main algae-producing toxins by the use of antibodies on a microarray format. Although not as sensitive as the ELISA, this chip could be utilised in samples of significant toxicity.\n\nGiven the importance of toxin-producing algae for human health, directly or through the consumption of contaminated seafood, MIDTAL deliverables will aid the monitoring and prompt identification of toxic species.

The participants were for young workers who had completed their predominantly City and Guild qualifications and their equivalents from the St\u00e4dtische Berufsschule M\u00fcnchen. The students from both countries spent 6 weeks in the host college and 4.5 months in local industry. This program was funded by the Young workers Program.\r\n  \r\nUp to today there is taking place an annual meeting with all our partners \u2013 every year in another place to have the possibility to visit the placements and learn to know the proceedings of the schools where we send our students to. During the meeting the partners of the network discuss and determine the standards of the program. \r\nDuring the mobility we offer a 4-week- course of language teaching, practical and theoretical studies as well as cultural information and a lot of sightseeing tours. This is to familiarize the students with the new country, language, team members and culture.\r\nAfter that period the students get a placement according to their business they are trained for and their abilities and interests. In these placements they stay for 4 months. The employers are responsible for the accommodation, food and salary. \r\nDuring these 5 months they are always in close contact with the coordinators of the host country as well as with the coordinators of the home country.\r\nThis project is especially meant for students who need some support because they are too shy, have a low self-esteem, poor foreign language knowledge and not enough money. So this projects tries to establish equal opportunities for students that would probably not be able to organize a stay abroad for themselves.\r\nAfter having taken part in this project the young people are able to adopt more easily to new situations, have become more self- confident and increased the chances of getting a good job in a foreign country as well as better professional career chances in their home country.

Students have been empowered with confidence as they discover that they are able to function in a new environment, away from their families or caretakers.   Students\u00b4 ability to co-operate in a group improves and their models of action and identity are constructed towards a more positive and sustainable direction. Students learn how to communicate in English and learn to control their financial affairs; in other words, they learn more about the basic skills in life. The self-controlled and goal-oriented use of social media before, during and after the mobilities increases the knowledge of the responsibilities and rules of digital communication and 21st century skills. The aim of the project is not only to increase professional skills but also simultaneously interactive and life-management skills of our students.  This happens with the construction of vocational student identity, flexibility, empathy and solidarity in a professional framework; mobilities are ideal environments for this kind of processes.  These aims are taken into consideration in every stage of this project.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to include as many vocational fields as possible and to provide positive and constructive experiences of mobility for special needs vocational students.  The project partners in the mobility have been chosen keeping in mind the key competences and the aims of this project and include colleges, companies and intermediary partners.\r\n\r\nThese learner mobilities will be carried out :\r\n\r\nHousehold and Cleaning Services students to Hungary and Czech Republic for on-the-job learning and learning at the college\r\nProperty Maintenance Operative students to Hungary  for on-the-job learning\r\nWarehouse Operative students to Poland and Malta for on-the-job learning\r\nCatering (Cook) Services students to Poland and Malta for on-the-job learning\r\nSocial and Health Care (Practical Nurse) students to Estonia for on-the-job learning\r\nSmall Engine Mechanic students to Germany for on-the-job learning\r\nSign Language students to Germany for on-the-job learning\r\nDance students to United Kingdom, England for learning at the college\r\nMusician students to United Kingdom, England for learning at the college.\r\n\r\nTwo week mobilities will be carried out as group  mobilities with always at least one accompanying person.  Accompanying persons are able to provide support during the whole moblity period. The support provided by the sending organisation is extremely important in order to carry out succesful mobilities. The vocational teachers of the participating fields are actively involved in the planning, implementation and evaluation of the project.  \r\nAll students participating in the mobilities have special education needs. Since the students are not yet chosen, we do not know exactly their special needs. However, we can presume that the students have, for example, mental problems, delayed development, disorders in the language development, attention deficits, visual or hearing impairment, Asperger syndrome, autistic features, or combinations of several disorders. We emphasise the fact that our students who participate in the project do not need to be top students but all students are entitled to apply for it.\r\n\r\nThese staff mobilities will be carried out:\r\nStaff members of Music, Dance, Catering (Cook) and Rehabilitative Instruction and Guidance for the Disabled to United Kingdom, Scotland to learn about special needs vocation education in their respective fields\r\nStaff members of Technology fields to Spain to learn about  project learning\r\nStaff members of Adult Education and Practical Nurse studies to  the Netherlands to learn about multiculturalism and vocational education\r\n\r\nAlso staff mobilities have a tremendous positive impact on personal, organisational and social levels.

Its main profile is adult education and it is provided with all the necessary licences allowing it to function as an adult educational institute. \r\nIn the last few years we have set up new goals selecting new target groups of students. We have laid special emphasis on teaching foreign languages to senior students over 45. \r\nSince the academic manager of the school is visually impaired (VI), a considerable number of VI students has studied in the school. Recently we have also received some adult students with hearing impairment (HI). Experiencing the learning difficulties of our impaired students, our interest has turned towards the equality of opportunities accessible to the Hungarian VI and HI. We have started to take interest in examining the hardships they while learning foreign languages. \r\nIn the framework of the Erasmus+ Project we endeavour to participate in a mobility programme during which our teachers can access knowledge of and gain experience in foreign language teaching to VI and HI adults and we intend to provide our teachers with the special language teaching methodology needed in this field. We plan to delegate 9 qualified teachers to 3 different language institutes in 3 distinct countries of the EU. (UK, Malta, Spain)\r\nEvery course is designed for 2 weeks and their focus will be on various sub-fields and aspects of foreign language teaching to VI and HI adults. On the basis of the syllabi received from our 3 selected partners, all of them seem to be thoroughly knowledgeable and strongly committed. \r\nIn our partner school in England the goals are to cover a wide spectrum of topics giving comprehensive picture about teaching foreign languages to VI and HI adults: they are due to present the special needs of the students concerned, relate to their own practical experience and deliver all their knowledge in methodology gained during their work with the local and regional institutes dealing with impaired adults. The participants in the course are scheduled to visit institutes involved in special education and to meet VI language teachers. \r\nOur project partner in Malta puts the emphasis on teaching English to HI adults. Their experts are determined to explore the special methods of how to develop various language skills for HI adults and to reveal their particular cognitive and psychological specialities. They also plan to introduce the technical devices available for the HI. \r\nOur project partner in Spain is equipped with a vast amount of knowledge and practical experience in teaching foreign languages to VI. \r\nThe preparatory period has lasted 5 months as a result of a long a thorough selection process. From the very beginning we have made it clear that the most important goal of the whole project  is to supply our experienced languages teachers with the special methods and approaches of surdo-pedagogy and tiflo-pedagogy that can help them teach foreign languages to VI and HI adults. \r\nIt is noteworthy to mention that there is no special university course for language teachers where the special methodology can be obtained and no foreign language specialisation for SEN teachers either.   It is a gap to fill because it is impossible to achieve results in the field of social inclusion without helping VI and HI adults in learning foreign languages.  \r\nWe are planning to disseminate our knowledge and experience in every possible forum:  our main target audience is our teachers who will not participate in the mobility but show interest in the topic.\r\nWe are convinced that our participating teachers will obtain new competences, mostly intercultural, they will get an insight into an under-researched field of methodology. With this asset our language school will be able to help the social integration of the VI and HI. We expect that the intercultural competences will be developed in our teachers and as a result our VI and HI students can learn foreign languages easily and efficiently in our school. We hope to help them overcome the anxiety and additional stress they feel in facing a new challenge. We aim to make them understand that the knowledge of foreign languages can open up new opportunities for them. As the impaired students are scheduled to study in integrated classes, their able-bodied group-mates can also learn a lot from them resulting in extra bonus for the latter ones.\r\nWe intend to incorporate the newly acquired apparatus and methodology into the everyday practice of our school.

They learn how to communicate efficiently and in a (media) responsible way.\r\n\r\nConcrete, within our internationalization strategy, we actively continue working on an increase in the number of departments and fields of study that get access to European internships and trainings (e.g. within the food department: confectioner/pastry baker-chocolate making & processing, pastry & caterer; within the people care department: youth care and care for people with disabilities; within the wood and construction department: building sciences; ), a further increase in the number of mobilities, combined with a further strengthening of our qualitatively high internship network, an increased accessibility and democratization for all motivated potential participants.\r\n\r\nAccompanying persons\r\nBecause the pupils in traineeship are of minor age, the Danish and one Swedish partner demand the pupils to be accompanied by a teacher of KOGEKA. He takes care of the guidance, the monitoring of the traineeship, the evaluation of the traineeship, the cultural programme during leisure time and, possibly, troubleshooting.", "http://www.cityplym.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-BE02-KA116-034553_8"], ["5QG", "Maini pasauli - s\u0101c ar sevi!", "City College Plymouth", 406156.0, "Project \"Change the world - start with yourself\" is the third Erasmus+ project applied by RTRIT and the first project applied in new quality - with VET Mobility Charter. Mobility projects have always been significant in motivating the learners, raising the quality of VET, enhancing international activities and in overall development of RTRIT.  \r\nInitiated by National Agency, developed by RTRIT, Internationalization strategy 2016-2020  structures the further plans and international development paths of the school. This project application is developed based on two essential documents - Internationalization strategy and VET Mobility Charter. \r\nOne of the targets of international development is to create new partnerships, and this project aims to involve several new partners. Organization CHASE (Consortium of Hotel and Accommodation Schools of Europe) continues it development by involving new partners who are able to fulfill quality criteria and are accepted in internal voting thus tourism and hotel school of Netherlands has joined the CHASE. RTRIT has plans to realize two student mobility to Netherlands within this project. Besides the partner from Netherlands, RTRIT has made contacts and plans mobility to new partners in Spain, Slovenia, Lithuania and Malta. \r\nThe title of the project \u201cChange the world - start with yourself\" is continuance of previous project \"To change the world, you have to start with yourself\" yet this project aims to address the participants more directly, to challenge them to start the positive change, and to put emphasis on development of individual participant and his/her further input in the development of organization. \r\nMobilities that have significant role in international development of RTRIT, are to be carried out in this project as described in the internationalization strategy. \r\n1) Long term mobilities of qualification training for last year students will be realized within CHASE. CHASE members have mutually agreed upon exchange of the learners, quality measures of training programs, and the most important - February 2017  member schools of organization (19) will start development of new training evaluation system that will be fully compatible with education systems working with ECVET. Mobility trainings realized within this project will be evaluated by the newly developed system. \r\n2) 2-5 week long mobilities for various training programs in different sectors and host organizations.  \r\n3) Mobilities addressing the needs of learners who are facing learning difficulties, losing learning motivation or are on the edge to be disclosed of voluntary leaving the education process.  In cooperation with partner-schools from Kaunas and Tartu mobility programs are specially designed to strengthen personality, develop social and communication skills, and raise learning motivation. These mobilities involve necessary accompanying persons that will support learners practically and mentally during the mobility. \r\n4) Mobility of teachers and staff involving a) development of professional skills that will be used in further work after mobility, b) demonstration of skills and sharing experience to rise the status or the school in on international level, and c) developing and strengthening of new partnerships for further cooperation and future mobilities. \r\nTaking into account descriptive evaluation of mobility charter, number of participants is adjusted, excluding the participants that will be funded by own means. Total number of participants is corrected from what has been mentioned in charter plans, corrections with slight decrease in number is made due to actual numbers of current learners and planed numbers for next academic year. The numbers planned for the next academic year are also corrected in common development strategy of RTRIT. Number of participants representing certain education program is directly proportional to the number of learners in each program.  Time and duration of mobility is set according to study process in the represented education program and by taking into consideration possibilities of host to organize study and training at high quality.", "http://www.cityplym.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-LV01-KA116-035386_9"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2PB", "MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM LBG*", 324091.0, "Strengthening European research infrastructures, including e-infrastructures (08.02.01.03)", "fts_2017_2094", 2017], ["3DH", "PLYMOUTH MARINE LABORATORY LIMITED*", 999373.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_7791", 2017], ["2PB", "MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM LBG*", 47102.0, "Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie actions \u2014 generating, developing and transferring new skills, knowledge and innovation (15.03.01.01)", "fts_2017_27370", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "PL1"}
