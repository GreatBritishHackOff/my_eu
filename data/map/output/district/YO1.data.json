ArchSci2020 will combine (i) a common purpose, (ii) an unconditional commitment to the student experience, (iii) a pro-active stance towards international, inter-institutional research support and interdisciplinary study, (iv) a simple but effective management structure provided by a Management Team, Supervisory Committee and the Work Package leaders, (v) and an established academic infrastructure and reputation.\nKey features of ArchSci2020:\n1.

On top one needs to take into account that the City of M\u00fcnster is a main university city. Quite a number of students (out of in total more than 60,000) come from abroad. Moreover, many employees of the universities have non-German roots (FH M\u00fcnster, research institutes, WWU etc.). \r\n\r\nLast but not least, the Council of M\u00fcnster took the decision to strengthen the city's European commitment. The city plans not just to join or to run through European projects but to take part in consultation processes etc. The aim is to become a good example how valuable it is to have an exchange not just on a national but on an European level. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the city administration of M\u00fcnster is facing the challenge of implementing globalization within its own ranks. \r\n\r\nFor this purpose the city of M\u00fcnster needs employees with international experience and advanced language skills. The proposed international measure enables individual training on the job and the sensitisation for international affairs. Immigrants as well as international guests and citizens of M\u00fcnster will directly benefit from the professional, linguistic and social competences gained by all participants of this measure.\r\n\r\nThere is also a strong argument in this kind of qualification for the take-over of internal trainees. Having successfully participated in this language program and the international job shadowing increases the chances in the labour market - even so it is no guarantee for a take-over after the traineeship at the City f M\u00fcnster, but definitely improves the candidate\u2019s qualification and chance to enter the current job market.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this program, five groups each comprising eight or nine trainees and two - three trainers will travel to York. The trainers are not only responsible to assist the trainees locally but more importantly to enhance their own intercultural experience and language knowlede. Each group will stay in York for 15 days. Their language class will take up five days and for another five days each participant will get to know the British daily business routine through job shadowing. The weekend will be spent in the respective host families to further improve language skills and experience the British culture first hand.\r\n\r\nAfter this program all participants will have improved their language skills as well as their social and intercultural competences.  Last but not least they will have a much broader understanding of council administration expertise as a whole and also in respect to their individual work environment. In addition each participant will have been introduced to the British system of council administration and hence benefit from having experienced different ways of problem solving solutions.\r\n\r\nIn addition, all trainees will have profoundly enhanced their professional profile for the job market. Due to this international experience and their gained competences they will be more attractive to their employer and will improve their chance for a job offer following their training program \u2013 internally but also externally. \r\n\r\nFor the City of M\u00fcnster it is very important that all participants generally mature their readiness to embrace in international projects.  Over time this will change the atmosphere and corporate culture within the administration. Based on improved language skills and intercultural experience this will lead to the fact that employees are more willing to participate in European affairs.", "http://www.york-associates.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003612_1"], ["7PJ", "Fremdsprachenassistenten und Industriekaufleute EU - Kompetenzen f\u00fcr Europa", "York Associates International Ltd", 79359.0, "For many years the Robert-Schuman-Berufskolleg in Essen has been offering, among others, a two and three-year course to become a \u201cState-qualified Commercial Assistant with Languages\u201d. The two-year course is for students with university entrance qualifications and the three-year course for those with higher education entrance qualifications. An important feature of these courses is an eight-week work placement, all or part of which can be absolved abroad e. g. UK, France, Spain, the Netherlands. The duration of the work placement abroad varies between four and eight weeks depending on the requirements of the company and the wishes of the trainees.\r\n\r\nThe course, \u201cEuropean Business and Administration Assistant\u201d, which is also offered at the RSBK, has been putting the requirements and wishes of the individual training companies into practise within the framework of the primary vocational training since 2004. This training course provides young people, who have higher education and university entrance qualifications, with a good alternative to a university degree. The mandatory 13-week work placement in the UK is absolved in their second year and is one of the main focal aspects of this year.\r\n\r\nGlobalization of markets in international companies makes it necessary for employees, who have comprehensive language skills at their disposal, to possess inter-cultural awareness and demonstrate a high degree of flexibility and mobility. As these requirements need to be met during the initial vocational training, the above-mentioned courses with the following objectives were introduced:\r\n- increasing language and inter-cultural skills\r\n- the application of such skills in companies in other European countries\r\n- extending communication skills as well as the ability to acquire experience of working  \r\n  internationally and being mobile\r\n\r\nAs a result, the trainees should be in a position to cope well with the increasing requirements of the job market.\r\nAll the 33 trainees will complete their work placements predominantly in small and medium-sized companies, in administrative as well as tourist businesses i.e. 15 Commercial Assistants with Languages in various European countries or respectively 18 European Business and Administration Assistants in the UK. Contracts for these placements have been concluded. This type of work placement is particularly suitable because there they can better experience how complex company operations are than in large companies. A language course together with the work placement for the European Business and Administration Assistants also improves language skills and is completed with a BEC qualification. The trainees are accommodated either with host families or in student hostels. \r\n\r\nFor both courses, the work placement abroad takes place after approx. half of the course. On the one hand, this has the advantage that the trainees have obtained considerable insight into how companies operate, as well as extensive language and commercial skills during their lessons at college. On the other hand, in the final year, they have to sit numerous final exams which certify the skills they have acquired and the relevance of the important role of their work placement abroad.\r\n\r\nAs a result it has been possible to strengthen and expand the cooperation with our numerous international partners which has developed over the years. This has led to a high degree of satisfaction for everyone involved in these work placements. In conclusion, we would like to emphasize that we set great store on continuity and reliability when building up our partnerships and this is reflected in the structural growth.\r\n\r\nIt is our wish to work together with companies based in the countries whose languages are taught at our college, in companies which mainly use these languages or with whom we have been involved in international projects. In various companies, the trainees can, with skilled instruction, put into   practise and improve their foreign language skills as well as the theoretical knowledge which they have acquired. As a result of the mobility programme, the perspectives of life-long learning can be taught. Furthermore, motivation and the ability to work under pressure independently can be developed, while at the same time prejudice towards people who think and behave differently can be diminished.
