Few other academic disciplines have been so transformed in the last decade as Archaeology. ArchSci2020 meet the need of a new generation of researchers. International, intersectoral and interdisciplinary training will equip its early-stage researchers (ESRs) with specific research-related and transferable skills, in order to provide enhanced career prospects across academia, industry and the third sector. The proposed ArchSci2020 network will bring together four leading research clusters each with complementary expertise to deliver an integrated, flexible training package that will provide a sound basis for academic independence and preparation for vocations in the archaeology, heritage and beyond. ArchSci2020 will combine (i) a common purpose, (ii) an unconditional commitment to the student experience, (iii) a pro-active stance towards international, inter-institutional research support and interdisciplinary study, (iv) a simple but effective management structure provided by a Management Team, Supervisory Committee and the Work Package leaders, (v) and an established academic infrastructure and reputation.\nKey features of ArchSci2020:\n1. ArchSci2020 will create a multidisciplinary training environment that brings together archaeologists, biologists, mathematicians, analytical chemists, and policy experts around an archaeological hub.\n2. ArchSci2020 priorities and cross-cutting training themes align closely with \u2018Grand Challenges\u2019 across its themes of Health, Diet, and Environment and incorporates the important current skills and future training needs in archaeological science. \n3.

Citizens will select 108 performances that will be presented in 8 different European cities to a large audience; 3. the development of an online platform utilizing readily available technologies  that will provide an online forum for organizations, communities and audiences with a tool to collectively explore and define curatorial strategies and discuss artistic content and ideas;   4. open rehearsals, international seminars, the production of a documentary (distributed to cultural European networks & TV), publications and other appropriate activities for promotion and dissemination of the project.", "http://www.yorktheatreroyal.co.uk", null, "creative_552041-CREA-1-2014-1-IT-CULT-COOP2_2"], ["9TL", "eeemerging, Emerging European Ensembles Project", "THE YORK EARLY MUSIC FOUNDATION LBG", 1609662.0, "\u2018eeemerging\u2019 is a contraction of three very significant words: Emerging European EnsemblesThis innovative European collaboration project is the fruit of work by the eight co-organisers: Ambronay Cultural Encounter Centre (leader), the Bucharest National University of Music, The G\u00f6ttingen International Handel Festival, Ars Ramov\u0161 in Ljubljana, Ghislieri Musica in Pavia, Riga Early Music Centre, the audiovisual production company Ozango in Strasbourg and the York National Centre for Early Music.Together they have observed that artistic excellence alone is not enough to forge a career in early music, a field which is disparate and unevenly developed in Europe.

Finally, it will promote them through the production of audiovisual products and the creation of digital sites and platforms.
