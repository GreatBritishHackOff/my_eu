The buildings will be retrofitted to at least the latest national building standards for new buildings. The type and number of technology deployed will be optimised using life cycle energy analysis for each type of building.\n\nThe work programme will involve development of computer models for optimising technologies and solutions, analysing dynamic energy demand of buildings and predicting microclimate indoors, development and testing of technologies and solutions under laboratory conditions, retrofitting and monitoring residential buildings in different climatic conditions, and a socio-economic analysis.\n\nThe above outcomes will be delivered through innovative solutions developed by a Consortium comprising leading companies, universities and public institutions from 10 European countries.", 23834.0, 6821858.0, "HERB", "Green solutions for old buildings", "An EU-funded project is working to develop sustainable refurbishment solutions for residential buildings.

These will be leakage tests and thermal imaging to determine the main parts of the building envelope that need to be improved. Furthermore, smart meters will be used for each technology to measure energy savings.\n\nSo far, project members have developed computer models for optimising components for each technology and each combination of technologies for retrofitting various types of buildings. Additionally, they have developed models for simulating energy demand and supply as well as the indoor environment in residential buildings.\n\nHERB is providing a holistic approach for retrofitting homes, allowing them to achieve the energy efficiency levels of new buildings.

Academic environments in Norway and in the host countries have recommended schools to visit. Staff visiting schools to study assessment for learning, will observe how teachers work and take part in discussions related to this topic. They will be focusing on to learn about how to let students take part in assessment in a way that is moving them forward in their learning. Staff teaching science subjects will take part in courses and conferences relevant to our objectives. The expected short-term effect of this project is an increase in the score on reported motivation and student involvement in assessment, measured through the national student survey. We also expect students to report they experience more support from their teacher in their learning. We expect the long-term effects to reflect in higher scores on both exams and national tests. Finally, this should result in less students dropping out of secondary school.", "http://www.englishmartyrs.org", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NO01-KA101-038710_2"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["9JQ", "AMETEK (GB) LIMITED", 494.0, "Nuclear safeguards (32.03.01)", "fts_2016_44097", 2016], ["9JQ", "TAYLOR HOBSON LIMITED", 311187.0, "Appropriations accruing from contributions from (non-European Economic Area) third parties to research and technological development (2014 to 2020) (08.02.50.01)", "fts_2017_9058", 2017], ["9JQ", "TAYLOR HOBSON LIMITED", 29651.0, "Leadership in nanotechnologies, advanced materials, laser technology, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing and processing (08.02.02.01)", "fts_2017_32007", 2017], ["9JQ", "AMETEK (GB) LIMITED", 51453.0, "Nuclear safeguards (32.03.01)", "fts_2017_55476", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "LE4"}
