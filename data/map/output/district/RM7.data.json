B2S will expand upon a cloud based construction support platform, conceived following the most advanced integrated design and delivery framework for the building sector and hosting applications that facilitate worksite activities and quality compliance by putting knowledge in hands of contractors, in the form of shared design specifications and 3D models, installation guidelines, information on regulatory frameworks, and help from construction experts on smartphones and tablets.

The project will be delivered over a 24 month period, with learners traveling in several flows across both the 2017/18 and 2018/19 academic years. \r\n\r\nThe project will provide 2 week Mobility periods for learners studying coaching, development and fitness as part of their Level 3 subsidiary diploma in sport, who are part of BDC's football and rugby academies. The football academy learners will travel to Spain, to train and complete work experience/observations in 2 groups of 15 participants in 2018/19\r\nThe rugby academy learners will travel to France in 2 groups of 25 in 2018/19, where they will train with a local rugby club and gain experience of coaching and performance analysis.\r\n\r\nThe ICT learners will travel to Prague in two flows of 10 participants in each of the two academic years. \r\n\r\nThe Business participants will also travel to both Prague, with a total of 80 participants travelling in two cohorts per year (20 in each group) over 2 years. \r\n\r\nThe Hair & Beauty department will send 20 learners to Crete to complete a 2 week work placement, in the 2018/19 academic year\r\n\r\nThe Construction department will send 10 students from 4 sub-sectors (Electrical, Plumbing, Painting & Decorating and the Built Environment) each year, to placements in Spain. \r\n\r\nThe Health & Social care department will send 1 group of 12 students each year, to placements in Esposende (Portugal)\r\n\r\nIn total, this project enables us to provide opportunities for 324 learners, and professional development opportunities for our staff, who will join the groups as accompanying persons (with a ratio of 1 AP:10 learners)\r\n\r\nThe hosting organisations that we are working with in each of these countries will provide the participants with the opportunity to increase their professional skills and work based competences, with a view to making them more job-ready and placing them in a strong position to access job opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe Mobility opportunity will build on the training that each of the learners has received in BDC as part of their vocational course of study and will offer the opportunity to gain real work experience within a professional environment, whilst increasing their personal and soft skills. Whilst the course that the learners are studying at BDC will equip them with technical skills and theoretical knowledge, the mobility experience will add value to the learners' studies through the provision of a practical element that will increase their employability and significantly improve their chances of obtaining sustainable employment at the end of their studies.\r\n\r\nThe mobilities will last between 2 - 3 weeks. It is highly unlikely that any of our participants will have completed an overseas work placement and therefore the 2 - 3 week mobility period is considered a realistic and attainable time frame for each group to gain valuable work experience, allowing a sufficient period for the participants to adjust to life in a new country as well gain a meaningful experience with the host organisations that will enable them to achieve their specific learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nAll of the project learners will agree a number of different Learning Outcomes at the start of their mobility, which reflect key skills, knowledge and work based competences that need to be achieved in order to obtain specific course units; learners will work towards achieving these Learning Outcomes during the 2 -3 week mobility period.\r\nAhead of commencing their mobility the learners will receive preparatory training in the UK. This will include some practically focused elements that will help to manage the learners expectations effectively, as well as assisting them with advice on suitable items to pack, such as suitable clothing.\r\n\r\nThe mobility project will also benefit BDC staff, enabling them to increase their teaching competences as well as gaining a better understanding of the needs of employers, on a European level.", "http://www.bdc.ac.uk", "Barking & Dagenham College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036166_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "RM7"}
