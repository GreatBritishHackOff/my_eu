The TACMON technology is innovative in that it applies electrostatic MEMS actuator technologies with a micro hydraulic amplitude transmission to realize a large matrix of tactile dots using cost-effective bath-processing technologies. There are 7.4 million visually impaired people in the European Union. High unemployment amongst the disabled is a serious social and economic problem for the EU, as continued exclusion from productive activity requires increasing state-funded support for social programs. There is a need for effective assistive technology to facilitate employment of the visually impaired and for industry to better be able to meet anti-discrimination legislation. Furthermore, the EU is investing heavily in e-learning to modernize education and training, but locking out the visually impaired since information and communication technologies are heavily oriented to visual user interfaces. The EU must quickly address the needs of sector SMEs that provide technological solutions for the disabled, as there is a continuous competitive threat from both foreign companies and large enterprises. TACMON offers SMEs an innovative technology targeting an interactive graphical tactile display and user interface for the visually impaired to access electronic information. TACMON technology can contribute to the creation of new business opportunities in software for learning, leisure, communicating via Internet, among many others for the disabled community. The TACMON product responds to important market demands in industry, education and other sectors that lack appropriate inclusive technology adaptable to meet the needs of their visually impaired clients.", 248988.0, 3369029.0, "TACMON", "An innovative touch screen for the blind", "There are 12 million blind people in the European Union. They need effective assistive technologies that can help them find employment and avoid social exclusion.", "High unemployment rates amongst blind people are a serious social and economic problem for the EU. Their exclusion from the workforce leads to social isolation, which ultimately results in higher social support costs for society. Assistive technologies can help overcome these barriers.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.tacmon.eu/new/ (TACMON) project developed an innovative and cost-effective touch screen technology that provides blind people with interactive access to both textual and graphically oriented electronic information. The system consists of three modules: a novel tactile actuator chip based on micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) technology, the driver electronics for the MEMS, including high-voltage electronics, and a pneumatic support system.\n\nIn combination with conductive elastomer technologies, MEMS technology is critical for success. MEMS allows for a large matrix of tactile dots to be produced using low-cost electrochemical bath techniques. The pneumatic support system ensures the forces on the tactile dots are maintained.\n\nSoftware specifications for this module, which is a graphical application, were specified with the help of the HyperBraille project. TACMON's research was successfully completed with a small-scale functional prototype demonstrating the viability of both the actuator technology and the other technologies required.\n\nA start-up company holding the jointly-owned TACMON intellectual property rights has been established as a platform for the further development and market introduction of the project's technology.\n\nThe current technology already offers a significant cost advantage compared to the state of the art. However, the consortium is eager to develop the technology, reduce costs and bring graphical tactile displays to the market at a price comparable to current Braille single line displays. This will help to create new opportunities for Europe's blind citizens.", "http://www.tacmon.eu/new/", null, "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58175.jpg", "fp7_94826_988363944"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9AG", "Cr\u00e9er son entreprise au Royaume Uni", "Barking Abbey School", 6140.0, "1 - OUR PROJECT : CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES :\r\nOur project consists in creating and broadcasting online a bilingual blog (French and English) titled 'STARTING ONE'S OWN BUSINESS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM' to promote an entrepreneurial spirit and to promote mobility of European French or English native speakers towards the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nOur vocational school is located in a rural area, in a fragile economic and social environment with a suffering labour market. The\r\nlearners we are welcoming are generally not mobile and unaware of the European dimension. That is the reason why our project is\r\nrelevant because it will develop mobility among beneficiaries, mainly thanks to the work placements in England. It is also relevant\r\nbecause it will increase their 'employability' as they will be able to highlight the great added value of their training on the world of\r\nwork (language and professional skills, culture and european awareness).\r\n\r\n2 - NUMBER AND PROFILE OF BENEFICIARIES :\r\nThe beneficiaries are students in our vocational institute : St Pierre FOURIER Vocational School in Gray (Haute-Sa\u00f4ne, France). They\r\nare preparing a Technical A-Level in Services (French acronym : ARCU) or a Technical A-Level in Commerce. All the beneficiaries of\r\nthe mobility are in the second of a two-year course. They are between 16 and 20 years old. Altogether 10 participants will be\r\nselected in our European Department to go on a 4-week work placement in England (Greater London)\r\n\r\n3 - ACTIVITIES :\r\nThe first school year is a year of reflection and collection of the information. First of all it must allow the beneficiaries to discover the\r\nstructure of British companies operating in the field of Services or in the field of Commerce. It must also allow them to have a better\r\nunderstanding of the differences with French companies. Then, they will be able to investigate our British partners (companies and\r\nhost families) during 4 weeks in order to collect the information required to create our bilingual blog.\r\nDuring the second year, participants will produce and put online the bilingual blog. Then, they will be able to promote  it\r\nduring a second 4-week mobility period.\r\n\r\n4 - PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROCESS :\r\nOur project is directed by a team composed of three teachers, in charge of managing, developing and following up of the project.\r\nEvery member of the team will be responsible for a sub-section and will have to achieve goals according to a pre-established\r\nprogram. To ensure the follow up of the project, the members of the team will organize a working meeting at least once a month.\r\nDenis Mouchot, a teacher of English : coordinator, Head of the project management, in charge of the relationship with our British\r\npartners, in charge of technical prospecting tools, in charge of the language and cultural training of our beneficiaries, in charge of\r\nsettling the students in England (week 1 of each mobility period) and assessing them (week 4 of each mobility period).\r\nCatherine Bouju, a teacher of vocational subjects, deputy coordinator of the project management, in charge of vocational training in\r\nEnglish of our beneficiaries (DNL-non language subjects), in charge monitoring the students (weeks 2 and 3 of\r\neach mobility period).\r\nCharline Fournier, a teacher of English : in charge of translating any documents required for our project.\r\n\r\n5 - RESULTS AND IMPACTS :\r\n\r\n5.1 Expected results are clearly defined :\r\n- a survey on the legislative framework regarding the creation of businesses\r\n- the production of a bilingual blog : 'Starting one's own business in the United Kingdom'\r\n- publishing this blog\r\n- promoting this blog", "http://www.barkingabbeyschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036778_1"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["9LX", "RAT", "B&D ACCESS & ASSESSMENT 2, BARKING COMMUNITY HOSPITAL (EPACT)"], ["9LX", "RAT", "BARKING HOSPITAL"], ["9LX", "RAT", "OAHTT (BARKING HOSPITAL) (EPACT)"], ["9LX", "RF4", "BARKING HOSPITAL"], ["9LX", "RP6", "MOORFIELDS COMMUNITY EYE CLINIC AT BARKING HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "IG11"}
