This CHEST Community has been started with 18 important organizations already involved as  supporting partners;- create a liquid information and social deliberation platform, based on a cooperative awareness approach and implemented on top of a broad spectrum of social media, which gives voice to communities bearing interests about hard-to-solve, high-impact social problems. The platform promotes the emergence of innovative solutions and allows a transparent and collective testing and selection of social innovation experiments;- launch and manage three rounds of open calls to distribute a consistent part of our project budget (around 2,5 Million euro); these funds will be allocated with a public competition for ideas with social innovation, and measure the effectiveness of proposed responses to social problems.  This evaluation and co-funding scheme includes public assessment of proposals with  crowdfunding and crowdsourcing (for optimal combination of expert/stakeholders input).The beneficiaries of the project are individuals, companies and organizations that want social innovation projects, and need to have their original ideas field-tested by an intelligent ad hoc crowd of experts and stakeholders.", 46780.0, 3011734.0, "CHEST", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110594_919022330"], ["3DP", "Management Of Networked IoT Wearables \u2013 Very Large Scale Demonstration of Cultural  Societal Applications", "Yorkshire County Cricket Club Limited", "The SoundCity Project MONICA aims to provide a very large scale demonstration of multiple existing and new Internet of Things technologies for Smarter Living.

This way they will have the opportunity of developing professional, linguistic and multicultural competences and skills for their future professional life.

Austria in general and especially Carinthia live from the interdependence with the European and international economic and cultural areas. Accordingly qualified young people are urgently required here. At the same time we want to continue to internationalize our education that already conveys a strong international component. We also believe that in this way we can counter tendencies towards stronger national differentiations with positive experiences with international exchanges. Aims:The emphasis lays on the development of occupational competences of the trainees, which we define as language, commercial, intercultural and social competences. The interns are challenged to use and extend their knowledge and skills as they are deployed in enterprises of great interest and quality. Consequently their chances on the Austrian and international labour market are rising (\u201eemployability\u201c). Moreover, their qualifications are increased to take an active part in European life and to accept the challenges of a more and more multifaceted society in a positive way. The participating institutions (school, companies) should also share their experiences and benefit from them.Participants and activities:In the first year of the project probably 6 students from the third to the fifth grade will take part as \u201cpioneers\u201c in this special project. They will carry out economic activities, for example in a hotel, a welfare institution and a language school (office, marketing, event management, customer service, reception, \u2026) in the United Kingdom for six to nine weeks. In special workshops they will be prepared for their jobs regarding language acquisition, job relevant activities and organization management accompanied and assisted by the project team, teachers of diverse subjects and our language assistant-teacher. Later on the experiences will be passed on to a larger target group in different formats (peer-to-peer activities, reports, presentations,\u2026). In the second year of the project the number of internships will definitely will be raised. There is a tangible interest of students and relevant traineeships so that we expect that the internships for 2017 can be fixed in time.Implementation:The Absolventenvereinigung der Handelsakademien Klagenfurt (Association of graduates of the business college Klagenfurt) as the applicant body is responsible for the processing of the project and cooperates intensively with the business college in Klagenfurt. For this reason a separate account was opened. An optimal coordination is guaranteed through close personal interrelations. Our English assistant teacher Lewis Hamilton is intensively involved in our project and he strongly supported us in finding adequate companies and suitable accommodation facilities and he will also coach and assist our trainees on site. Further stakeholders, such as parents, will regularly be implicated.The application of instruments on the Europass and ECVET-basis will also assure the quality of the execution and the internships.Expected results and consequences:Mainly the learners will profit from the projects directly, as their professional, social, language and cultural skills will certainly be advanced. With a highly regarded internship abroad they will obviously have great advantages on the labour market that looks for motivated, open-minded and well-educated applicants.Also the participating institutions will have the opportunity to share the experiences of the trainees (respectively the involved partners) who will improve their competences in international project organizations. The teachers will benefit from this projects by expanding their experiences through post-proceeding activities and by passing them on to their other students.Moreover, the region will profit from higher qualified young people in economic and social respects.Long-term benefit:Our project is just at the beginning. We want to extend it in the course of the next years and we would like to create a sustainable culture of internationality in education. We hope that we will be able to inspire motivated young people for this opportunity and to make contributions that our region will also be able to unfold its potential in Europe in a better way.", "http://www.englishsteps.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016446_5"], ["4LD", "EU - grenzenlos sozial", "Meanwood CofE Primary School", 31412.0, "With this project we want to give our students the possibility to fulfill their obligatory internships within the EU.

The actual tasks that each volunteer will be involved in will vary depending on where they are based, but each placement will involve an element of service to others.
