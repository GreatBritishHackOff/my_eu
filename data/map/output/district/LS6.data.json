The goal is to increment the number and success rate of initiatives that use collective awareness approaches to respond to high-impact societal challenges. To do so, the project will:- engage a large base of organizations, networks, and programs that already operate successfully in the areas of social innovation, entrepreneurship, early stage business incubation, service design, and creativity. This CHEST Community has been started with 18 important organizations already involved as  supporting partners;- create a liquid information and social deliberation platform, based on a cooperative awareness approach and implemented on top of a broad spectrum of social media, which gives voice to communities bearing interests about hard-to-solve, high-impact social problems. The platform promotes the emergence of innovative solutions and allows a transparent and collective testing and selection of social innovation experiments;- launch and manage three rounds of open calls to distribute a consistent part of our project budget (around 2,5 Million euro); these funds will be allocated with a public competition for ideas with social innovation, and measure the effectiveness of proposed responses to social problems.  This evaluation and co-funding scheme includes public assessment of proposals with  crowdfunding and crowdsourcing (for optimal combination of expert/stakeholders input).The beneficiaries of the project are individuals, companies and organizations that want social innovation projects, and need to have their original ideas field-tested by an intelligent ad hoc crowd of experts and stakeholders.", 46780.0, 3011734.0, "CHEST", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110594_919022330"], ["3DP", "Management Of Networked IoT Wearables \u2013 Very Large Scale Demonstration of Cultural  Societal Applications", "Yorkshire County Cricket Club Limited", "The SoundCity Project MONICA aims to provide a very large scale demonstration of multiple existing and new Internet of Things technologies for Smarter Living.

Volunteers will develop their professional skills and knowledge as well as their intercultural experience. Each RO is involved in activities that benefit local communities, so volunteers will be directly aiding these communities with their service.\r\n\r\nThe project is designed to meet the following objectives:   \r\n1) Challenge young people to become actively involved in society by \u2018being there\u2019 and caring for others, especially those on the edge of society\r\n2) Give the volunteer new skills and work experience through volunteering\r\n3) Develop the volunteer\u2019s capacity to work, and/or live in, groups/teams\r\n4) Get to know the British culture, people and language \u2018from the inside\u2019\r\n5) Promote intercultural dialogue between young people (in the volunteer group, but also in the local community of which the volunteer is part)\r\n6) Challenge the volunteer to reflect critically on his/her spirituality and be open to other religions & ways of life\r\n7) Benefit the Receiving Organisation with the enthusiasm and cross cultural experience of a volunteer, who is able to augment the work of paid staff members with energy, new perspectives and time to build relationships with the community/ client group being served. \r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that this project will involve 20 volunteers, who will have a range of socio-economic backgrounds.
