GNSS Augmentation Systems like WAAS (in United States), MSAS (in Japan) and EGNOS (in Europe) has been a consistent attempt to overcome these GNSS problems and improve the positioning applications attributes, such as accuracy, reliability, and availability. These systems have reached today a quite mature state, however related technology and algorithms on the applications side have being certified and used with efficiency only in niche areas like the air navigation systems. Still the significant technological know-how of embedding EGNOS (in Europe) functionality in positioning applications, has prevented European SMEs, developing location based applications, from adopting these new technological opportunities, thus not getting them in a position to be able to exploit the accuracy, reliability, and availability offered by EGNOS (and future GALILEO) in their applications. This fact also prevents them from presenting new pioneering positioning applications, as it would require a huge EGNOS/GALILEO technology investment, which usually is outside of the core business of such companies.  The MAGNA project aims to provide a viable solution to the aforementioned SME problems, by supplying the software libraries and tools required for the design and validation of EGNOS/GALILEO aware positioning applications, targeting SMEs who are seeking to improve their existing positioning applications, and launch new applications making full utilisation of the EGNOS/GALILEO technologies.", 5989.0, 1312874.0, "MAGNA", "Unleashing new global positioning technologies", "Researchers have created a simulation environment to boost the development of more powerful satellite navigation applications. The new software will be instrumental in the development of new products and markets.", "During the last decade, satellite navigation and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-related technologies have become commonplace in consumer products. There is now a huge demand for more sophisticated positioning-based applications for work and leisure.\n\nBut this next generation of applications needs greater reliability and integrity than that provided by the global positioning system (GPS), the satellite system upon which most current GNSS receivers rely. This signal has limited accuracy and can be unreliable in urban environments, in bad weather or in the presence of other wireless signals.\n\nAlthough the European satellite navigation system Galileo will greatly improve GNSS services, it will not be fully operational until around 2020. In the meantime, the European Space Agency (ESA) has developed the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), an augmentation system that provides the necessary improvements for the GPS signal. However, so far the only commercial applications to take advantage of the improved capabilities have been those related to civil aviation.\n\nThe 'Methodologies and tools advancing the design and validation of EGNOS/Galileo aware applications' (MAGNA) project developed software libraries and tools to enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to design and validate EGNOS/Galileo-aware positioning applications.\n\nTeam members analysed the requirements of diverse applications and adapted algorithms currently in use by the air sector. Three key parameters had to be incorporated: the receiver, the local telecoms network and surrounding physical environment, and the EGNOS system itself.\n\nEstimates put the global market for positioning technologies at EUR\u00a0160 billion by 2020, with applications in areas as diverse as maritime, fleet management, assisted living, and air quality and traffic monitoring.
