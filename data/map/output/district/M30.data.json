This therefore has to be our key priority as without competent, confident teachers our mission to improve language development across the board cannot come to fruition. \r\n\r\nObjectives Being given the responsibility of MFL lead, its been my ambition and aim to raise standards of language in school and improve the language provision. This is why the main objective of our intended project is to increase competence in our teachers and LSAs language ability. By involving teachers across both key stages as well as LSAs means we can have a greater impact in school. This key set of trained staff can then inspire and coach other staff in school and create a much stronger Spanish provision in school. \r\n\r\nWe have a range of participants from both Lewis Street and Christ Church primary that wil be working together through the project sharing ideas. \r\n\r\nWe hope to improve General linguistic improvement through updating teachers' knowledge of Spanish, acknowledging the fact that Spanish is a changing language and discovering new vocabulary and expressions. The effect of this will be to modernise the teaching of Spanish in their school and provide more motivating materials for pupils thereby improving attainment. Outcomes can be measured through tools such as 'Europass'.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Bringing a real purpose to language learning for your children through establishing regular communication with your partner school (weekly or even daily!) This could be done through eTwinning tools, ICT applications (email, skype, video conferencing, social media), letters and exchange of resources. Classes could upload work they are doing in different curriculum areas so that they can compare and comment on what they have produced. This will raise attainment in school by providing strong motivation for pupils to use the foreign language, allow teachers to exchange best practice and share their ideas and could also provide motivation for children in other curriculum areas. Regular communication with native speakers will raise children's attainment in language learning and enhance bilingual projects. The recognised outcome would be the establishment of regular communication between partner schools and could also be the establishment of a platform through which schools can communicate and share resources.\r\n\r\n\u2022 For schools who have some children who don't speak English as their first language, their project could be based on improving provision for these children. This could be done through staff from schools in Spain and England sharing ideas and expertise through observation of each other's teaching, professional discussions and resource sharing. It could lead to the production of materials that can be used in both countries to welcome new arrivals and improve the attainment of children with English as an additional language. Teachers could also improve their understanding of children's home cultures and look at ways of celebrating cultural diversity in their classrooms. This could lead to outcomes such as celebration days/ weeks involving parents and the local community.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Comparison and sharing of teaching methods. Teachers can experience each other's educational systems and take part in classes. They could focus on e.g. language teaching in the early years, observing best practice and bringing ideas back to their own classroom thus improving attainment. Other possible things to focus on could be; behaviour management, cooperative learning (e.g. KAGAN), promoting independence, improving boys' writing, handwriting, teaching languages across the curriculum, sport (the possibilities are endless!) Schools could focus on an area that they are already involved in (e.g an area in which they specialise or something that is on their school development plan). The outcomes could be a measured improvement in attainment in that area and maybe the development of a training package that could be used within our school and beyond.", null, "Lewis Street Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036288_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["7NB", "STREETGAMES UK", 15245.0, "Developing the European dimension in sport (15.02.03)", "fts_2016_32523", 2016], ["7NB", "STREETGAMES UK", 116588.0, "Developing the European dimension in sport (15.02.03)", "fts_2016_33532", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "M30"}
