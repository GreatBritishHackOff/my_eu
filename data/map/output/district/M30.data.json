Children who attend our school come  from a range of backgrounds with a higher than average proportion experiencing some deprivation. They do not have access to many enrichment opportunities and are not exposed to a diverse cultural upbringing. We feel it our responsibility to give our children opportunities to see how other cultures live, to give them aspiration and to equip them with life skills from an early age.\r\n\r\nSpeaking French will give our children confidence and an understanding that there is a whole world of life out there waiting for them in the future. \r\n\r\nOur project objectives are to develop the skills of the teachers who will deliver the lessons to the children. We will do this using Erasmus+ funding to give members of staff the opportunity to take part in short combined language and methodology courses in France.\r\n\r\nThere will be 6 direct participants but the impact through cascading the training of other staff will be for 34 people and 240 (net capacity) children in total. \r\n\r\nThe activities will include auditing staff prior knowledge, school resources and the general opinion of the children and parents. This will give us a baseline to develop from. Staff will then be invited to apply to attend the immersion training course. The successful candidates will attend an eight day course in France, in pairs.\r\n\r\nThe courses will improve language skills, consolidate language and allow the school to create links with a French school. Following the course, teachers will be timetabled to teach in classes together to share their skills and learning. Children will make progress in their French speaking and this will be clear from assessments and comparison from the base line data. \r\n\r\nParents, School Governors, staff and children will be included in the the project through initial consultation, regular ongoing communication through Skype, Blog and email, information on our school website and a final presentation to a range of stakeholders including links in the community.\r\n\r\nThe work will be sustained long term by staff who will continue to share their knowledge and skills with colleagues and build upon them year on year, with a connection with a French speaking school, there are future possibilities for travel for the children themselves.\r\n\r\nOur vision is that our children grow up to be well rounded, tolerant and accepting people who through a broad and balanced education are equipped with skills for life.The work will be sustained long term by staff who will continue to share their knowledge and skills with colleagues and build upon them year on year, with a connection with a French speaking school, there are future possibilities for travel for the children themselves.", "http://holycrossandallsaints.co.uk", "Holy Cross & All Saints RC Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012711_coordinator"], ["7NB", "FAIR PLAY: An European Goal", "STREETGAMES UK", 21330.0, "Over the years, SISU and BSJ gained a lot of experience in international youth work using the EU-funding opportunities.

This therefore has to be our key priority as without competent, confident teachers our mission to improve language development across the board cannot come to fruition. \r\n\r\nObjectives Being given the responsibility of MFL lead, its been my ambition and aim to raise standards of language in school and improve the language provision. This is why the main objective of our intended project is to increase competence in our teachers and LSAs language ability. By involving teachers across both key stages as well as LSAs means we can have a greater impact in school. This key set of trained staff can then inspire and coach other staff in school and create a much stronger Spanish provision in school. \r\n\r\nWe have a range of participants from both Lewis Street and Christ Church primary that wil be working together through the project sharing ideas. \r\n\r\nWe hope to improve General linguistic improvement through updating teachers' knowledge of Spanish, acknowledging the fact that Spanish is a changing language and discovering new vocabulary and expressions. The effect of this will be to modernise the teaching of Spanish in their school and provide more motivating materials for pupils thereby improving attainment. Outcomes can be measured through tools such as 'Europass'.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Bringing a real purpose to language learning for your children through establishing regular communication with your partner school (weekly or even daily!) This could be done through eTwinning tools, ICT applications (email, skype, video conferencing, social media), letters and exchange of resources. Classes could upload work they are doing in different curriculum areas so that they can compare and comment on what they have produced. This will raise attainment in school by providing strong motivation for pupils to use the foreign language, allow teachers to exchange best practice and share their ideas and could also provide motivation for children in other curriculum areas. Regular communication with native speakers will raise children's attainment in language learning and enhance bilingual projects. The recognised outcome would be the establishment of regular communication between partner schools and could also be the establishment of a platform through which schools can communicate and share resources.\r\n\r\n\u2022 For schools who have some children who don't speak English as their first language, their project could be based on improving provision for these children. This could be done through staff from schools in Spain and England sharing ideas and expertise through observation of each other's teaching, professional discussions and resource sharing. It could lead to the production of materials that can be used in both countries to welcome new arrivals and improve the attainment of children with English as an additional language. Teachers could also improve their understanding of children's home cultures and look at ways of celebrating cultural diversity in their classrooms. This could lead to outcomes such as celebration days/ weeks involving parents and the local community.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Comparison and sharing of teaching methods. Teachers can experience each other's educational systems and take part in classes. They could focus on e.g. language teaching in the early years, observing best practice and bringing ideas back to their own classroom thus improving attainment. Other possible things to focus on could be; behaviour management, cooperative learning (e.g. KAGAN), promoting independence, improving boys' writing, handwriting, teaching languages across the curriculum, sport (the possibilities are endless!) Schools could focus on an area that they are already involved in (e.g an area in which they specialise or something that is on their school development plan). The outcomes could be a measured improvement in attainment in that area and maybe the development of a training package that could be used within our school and beyond.", null, "Lewis Street Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036288_coordinator"], ["7NB", "N\u00fd verkf\u00e6ri - n\u00fd reynsla", "STREETGAMES UK", 13803.0, "New tools - New experience is a site visit to Manchester, England. \r\nThe educational program is part of a larger project by the UMSK working group, which is looking for ways to increase the diversity of sports and youth in the UMSK community and reduce the dropout of young people.

The educational program is based on lectures by StreetGames employees and on-field tours in Manchester to different projects. Also, participants get the chance to meet young people who are involved in the work of the Manchester association and discuss with them what they think about the job. The results of the trip will be utilized in the ongoing work of the participants at home and hopefully deliver a more power- and meaningful approach in the jobs handled by young people in clubs all around Iceland.", "http://www.streetgames.org", null, "erasmus_2018-2-IS01-KA105-038844_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "M30"}
