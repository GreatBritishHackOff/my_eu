For example the Tensile strength of a single walled nano tube is ~ 1TPa. The thermal conductivity at room temperature for single Multiwalled CNT was measured to be greater than 3000 W/m\u2022K and perfect CNT are also able to conduct electrons without heat loss. Most of the known properties related to CNT&apos;s come from the investigation of a single CNT while the main goal remains to exploit those properties in the macro scale through the use of highly oriented and aliened CNT&apos;s. It is possible to exploit the exceptional properties of CNT by producing fibres which are based on CNT&apos;s as building blocks. These kinds of fibres may be called CNT fibres or CNTF. One approach to produce CNTF is the process of spinning from a CVD process. This process was selected as a potentially applicable process for industrial scale production of CNTF. It has been proved that scale up of the process is feasible while maintaining an affordable and stable process suitable for large scale manufacturing. In order to cross the gap between feasibility in the lab scale and industrial pilot a research effort needs to be carried out in this field. The CNTF by itself is a material suitable for various engineering applications. This is achieved due to the fact that in the CNTF all the remarkable characteristics of CNT&apos;s are expressed. Another route to exploit the material properties of the CNTF&apos;s is to incorporate them in a polymeric matrix to result in a CNTF based composite material. Since we are dealing with a new and innovative fibre type further research is needed in order to find and optimize the polymeric matrix type for the various applications suggested. These applications are: structural and conductive composites, composites for the automotive industry, composites for the aviation industry and even as an armour material.", 14299.0, 559742.0, "CNTF COMPOSITES", null, null, null, null, "http://www.q-flo.com/", null, "fp7_95820_986258656"], ["3UE", "Coordination Action to enable an effective European 450 mm Equipment & Materials Network", "Future Horizons Ltd", "5 major global semiconductor companies Intel, Samsung, TSMC, IBM and Global Foundries, have decided to work closely together to bring 450 mm semiconductor processing  to a mature level, within a consortium called G450C. This operation, based in Albany N.Y., is currently ordering and installing the first wave of 450 mm systems. The major drivers of this effort are Intel and TSMC, which have provided roadmaps towards full 450 mm production. European semiconductor Equipment & Materials (E&M) companies have decided that to secure their global activities, being the major part of their business, they should take an active part in these developments. Therefore in 2009 a European E&M 450 mm initiative was established: EEMI450, to bring the European interested E&M companies and institutes together and to initiate activities in this innovative direction. This Coordination Action will support the activities of this initiative and further 450 mm activities in Europe, for instance the establishment of a 450 mm pilotline. Strong links to existing 450 mm funded projects: ENIAC EEMI450, Catrene SOI450 and NGC450 plus ENIAC EEM450PR are required. Inputs from the recent EU funded study SMART2010/0062, concerning 450 mm production in Europe, have to be taken into account. Much importance will also be attached to tighten the link to global activities and expertise, especially of course with G450C  in Albany. Intensive contact with the driving semiconductor companies is key part of the project; one of them, Intel Ireland, is a consortium member. An Advisory Board seated with accepted experts in the field will supervise and guide the European applicability of the solutions. In addition related Standards will receive special attention. The dominating aspect of this Coordination Action is of course dissemination and instruments like studies, workshops, a dedicated website and seminars will be used to provide an effective network and basis for European 450 mm E&M developments.", 112783.0, 988658.0, "ENABLE450", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_106496_955142123"], ["3UE", "Support Action for 450mm topics establishing a Bridge between European EM entities and IDMs, Foundries and Entities Worldwide", "Future Horizons Ltd", "Five major global semiconductor companies are working in the G450C consortium based in Albany N.Y. to introduce 450mm wafer semiconductor processing and are now installing the first wave of 450mm prototype systems.

Most of these companies decided that to secure their global markets they would take an active part in 450mm development and participated in cooperative 450mm projects. The ENIAC project EEMI450 is complete and projects in CATRENE (SOI450 & NGC450) and ENIAC (EEM450PR & E450EDL) are proceeding, the latter two targeting a 450mm pilot line at imec. Further projects are planned and Europe can feel proud its E&M companies are striving for leadership in each of their fields.The ENIAC Coordination Action Enable450 began in 2012 to assist European 450mm programmes with data collection, standards, G450C liaison, dissemination of 450mm topics and other activities. The Bridge450 Support Action seeks to run in parallel with Enable450 to expand its scope with more focus on Asian semiconductor manufacture. Bridge450 will support the European E&M companies and specially the SMEs to become aware of and understand Asian technical requirements and to develop solutions to address this market. To assist the information flow, a Semiconductor Board will include Samsung and TSMC.A second objective of Bridge450 will be to establish the possibilities of 450mm semi-manufacturing in Europe and what would be needed to facilitate such an operation, which will be vital for the future of advanced nano-electronics in Europe.", 80976.0, 459660.0, "Bridge450", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110973_955142123"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["3PG", "RJZ", "KINGS @ SEVENOAKS HOSPITAL"], ["3PG", "RPA", "SEVENOAKS HOSPITAL"], ["3PG", "RPC", "SEVENOAKS HOSPITAL"], ["3PG", "RWF", "SEVENOAKS HOSPITAL"], ["3PH", "RXY", "SEVENOAKS HOSPITAL"], ["3PG", "RYY", "SEVENOAKS HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TN13"}
