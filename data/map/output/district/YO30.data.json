All these network evolutions lead to enormous investments in independent network infrastructures (billions of \u20ac). In terms of usage, the difference between fixed and mobile access tends to diminish with more and more video streaming and the willingness of users to use fixed (Wi-Fi) interface on their mobile device. All these elements strengthen the motivation of operators to integrate fixed and mobile networks and make them converge in the perspective of 5G networks.Today, Fixed and Mobile Convergence (FMC) is mainly implemented at service level with all IP services and IMS, allowing a converged service control layer. Fixed and mobile networks themselves have been optimized and evolved independently from each other and the current network deployments are still reflecting this independent evolution.In contrast, COMBO will allow the convergence of fixed and mobile networks themselves. To achieve this objective, COMBO will define, develop and technically assess network scenarios organized around the concept of Next Generation Point of Presence (NG-POP) and which embody the most promising directions for FMC at network level. These proposals will lead to networks with a more effective distribution of essential functions and improved utilisation of equipment and infrastructures. So as to show experimentally the high potential of FMC for future networks, COMBO will develop proof of concept demonstrations including both a unified access / aggregation network and a Universal Access Gateway (UAG), the key elements to implement NG-POP concept. These proof of concept demonstrations will include the necessary hardware and software development required to show key FMC network functions and converged network.The overall project targets of COMBO will be to:\u0095\\tDefine and develop FMC architectures for future networks, which will be technically assessed with respect to FMC use cases defined by the project;\u0095\\tDemonstrate experimentally key FMC network features to show the feasibility of proposed architectures;\u0095\\tInfluence standardization bodies with respect to FMC architectures to push COMBO concepts.", 45139.0, 7175292.0, "COMBO", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_106522_954758488"], ["7DR", "York: City of the Past, City of the Future", "York Museums and Gallery Trust", "York is an incredibly exciting, vibrant and diverse city, rich in heritage, discovery and an overriding sense of curiosity \u2013 in short a city where ideas spring to life and flourish and where collaboration is celebrated.

In particular, water is used as a cleaning source, conveyor of raw materials and cooling agent for quickly perishable commodities. Recently, the food industry is facing increasing pressure to ensure company activities follow environmentally sound protocols, but there is also pressure to increase profitability against competition. A primary concern of the food-industry is consumer safety. The use of alternative control means other than chemicals to reduce water microbial contamination and postharvest decay of fruit and vegetables is becoming increasingly important to enhance food safety and minimise residue levels in fresh produce while preserving water. Although water will always be an integral part of food processing, environmentally sound technologies for pollution prevention and water preservation have potential for cost-effective resource reduction practices.\n\nWe have developed an innovative technology, biowater, for sustainable food processing and sanitation. The patented biowater process combines environmentally sound technologies for treatment, sanitation and recycling of wash water for postharvest fruit and vegetable processing. AQANAT\u2019s innovative water treatment technology allows efficient sanitation of process waters in a closed system (zero discharge) allowing for substantial water savings.\n\nFollowing successful product development and commercial launch in the citrus packinghouse market, AQANAT LTD objectives include the development of further product prototypes for pilot commercial testing and commercial launch in other postharvest applications.

The iCIRRUS C-RAN introduces the use of Ethernet in the fronthaul/midhaul (for radio signal transport), to minimise cost and make available pluggable and in-device monitoring, and intelligent processing to enable self-optimizing network functions which maximise both network resource utilisation and energy efficiency. To exemplify the attractiveness of the proposition, iCIRRUS focusses on D2D communication in the wireless domain, an important work area in current standardisation, where low latency is known to be a significant factor. The latency and jitter in the iCIRRUS Ethernet-based C-RAN will be an important focus of the research work in the project, with current 5G performance targets in mind; for D2D communications, the task will be to minimise control latency and overhead. A major obstacle for C-RANs is the bit-rate of the digitised radio signals that would be required for 5G \u2013 of the order of 100 Gb/s and iCIRRUS will examine the architectural and technological questions surrounding this requirement. Wireless resource management will be investigated, together with mobile device caching and mm-wave D2D mesh networks, to reduce latency as well as load on the infrastructure.
