While the implementation of restorative justice practices in Europe has essentially been victim-oriented, it is now increasingly focused on the moral and social rehabilitation of the offender. The capacity of restorative justice interventions to impact positively on offenders desisting from crime opens new perspectives for these practices in prisons - an area which has been very little researched. Moreover, prisons differ significantly from other social institutions in which restorative justice has been practised. Prison environments induce deprivations or 'pains' -  negative psychological effects - and have their own specific culture and structures that influence their practices and the behaviour of all those present.

There is room for improvement, especially through the use of antennas able to more accurately steer the emitted beams.

A series of in-house catheter designs were tested alongside specially-designed holders for the catheters and tissue.\n\nAdditionally, researchers evaluated the skin friction behaviour and tensile strength using ex vivo human skin, human dermis and tissue-engineered skin.

A crucial element in this change is the evolution of the crops upon which agriculture is founded. This proposal seeks to understand the selective pressures driving the this evolution through an investigation of the key phenotypic traits associated with crop domestication, providing insights into the ways in which plants were changed by human exploitation, as well as non-human environmental factors. This research programme brings together experimental ecology, molecular biology, and archaeobotany to address the three key elements for understanding the selective pressures acting on early crop evolution: (1) the relationship between human and environmental pressures and plant ecological characteristics, (2) early genetic trait selection in crop plants, and (3) the temporal and spatial location of trait selection. DNA methods will be developed for establishing the order in which traits were selected during domestication, and experimental ecology will investigate the reasons behind plant trait selection, for example whether through conscious selection for increased seed size or unconscious selection for associated traits related to the competitive ability. Improved morphometric measurement of archaeobotanical material will permit precise pinpointing of the appearance of domestication traits, and so identify the primary selective pressures driving the evolution of crop plants in different time periods and geographic locations.

To understand circuit computations a different approach is needed: to elaborate realistic spiking networks and use them, together with experimental recordings of network activity, to investigate the theoretical basis of central network computation. As a benchmark we will use the cerebellar circuit. The cerebellum is supposed to compare expected and actual activity patterns and to reveal their congruence with respect to stored memories. By these means, the cerebellum takes part to control loops regulating movement and cognition. Experimental evidence has revealed that cerebellar circuits can dynamically regulate their activity on the millisecond time scale and operate complex spatio-temporal transformation of signals through non-linear neuronal responses.

Short- to mid-term solutions are a fully synthetic jet fuel (FSJF) and a synthetic fuel produced from the Fischer-Tropsch process based on synthetic paraffinic kerosene (FT-SPK). Blends of FT-SPK with 50\u00a0% naphthenic cut or 20\u00a0% hexanol (oxygenated fuel) are being evaluated for the mid- and long-term solutions, respectively.\n\nScientists assessed fuel characteristics, production, storage and distribution. They also conducted lab-scale tests to evaluate ability to produce the biofuels in a way that meets aerospace constraints and with yields compatible with up-scaling for industrial production.\n\nDetailed studies were then carried out to assess the suitability of the fuels for aircraft. Scientists tested injection and combustion properties. They also investigated compatibility of engine parts with which the fuel comes in contact, as well as effects of biofuels on air conditioning systems.\n\nFinally, investigators addressed new standard requirements of biofuels related to emissions and engine performance, and conducted a comprehensive economic analysis. The latter covered not only scientific and technical considerations, but also the economic impact related to policies and meeting regulations.\n\nALFA-BIRD is expected to have important impact on the sustainability and competitiveness of the EU aerospace sector.

More specifically, it seeks to (1) develop a hybrid systems based modelling framework for networked cyber-physical systems, (2) formally synthesize correct, robust, reactive control protocols for cyber-physical systems from high-level, rigorous specifications that are pertinent to the safe, reliable, and more autonomous operation of cyber-physical systems, and (3) validate and demonstrate the correct-by-construction methodology with numerical simulations and experiments using autonomous mobile robots.

To reduce the outdoor traffic noise to a sufficiently low level for a good acoustic environment is a major challenge of high need. Here, we will focus on noise propagation abatement for the outdoor environment. Following the EU Directive on environmental noise, a series of major action have been taken in noise abatement, but the sustainability has rarely been paid attention. The main idea of our project is to optimize the use of green areas, green surfaces and other natural elements in combination with artificial elements in urban and rural environments for reducing the noise impact of road and rail traffic. The project offers a variety of powerful abatement strategies that will make a cost effective improvement by its combination of approaches concerning: ground and road surface treatments; trees, forests and tall vegetation; greening of buildings and other surfaces; and innovative barriers.

First, the causative relationship proposed between the intensity of sexual selection and the disparity in parental care between the sexes is ambiguous. Using a large dataset on reproductive behaviour, ecology and life history of birds and new directional comparative methods I will test whether evolutionary changes in intensity of sexual determines parental care patterns or vice versa.

Second, I will conduct new analyses on how sexual selection affects (or is affected by) brain size evolution, including tests to explore causative relationships between these traits and also between brain size and parental sex roles. Finally, I will investigate how sexual selection affects the rates of phenotypic changes, that is important for the understanding of basic evolutionary processes (e.g. speciation) but has been rarely estimated empirically by comparative studies.

This revealed that conventional sex roles (e.g.; female caring for offspring) occur in species with female-biased ASR. However, when there are more males than females, there is sex-role reversal. Competition is high for males among mating females and the males care more for the brood.\n\nThe research team found that there was a higher 'divorce rate' in socially monogamous bird species with a female-biased sex ratio.

Instead, male contribution to care decreased with increased paternity outside the nest and increased with male-biased ASR.\n\nUsing theoretical models, researchers demonstrated that sex role specialisation can stabilise parental cooperation. This would promote the evolution of bi-parental care even when there is strong sexual selection.\n\nSocial environment such as sex ratio has an impact on the role of the sexes in brood care.

We have today significant knowledge regarding dissolution of uranium oxide in the laboratory. However, uncertainties remain regarding spent fuel dissolution under realistic conditions. Two main questions stand out as necessary to address: First, the synthetic groundwater used in the experiments to date does not contain all of the chemical elements that occur in natural groundwaters. Some of the trace elements may produce radiolysis products that are more aggressive than those produced in the synthetic groundwaters. Second, the fragments used in laboratory experiments contain sharp edges and defects generated by the crushing process. These sites contain atoms that have fewer bonds than the bulk material and constitute high-energy sites. As dissolution occurs, these sites dissolve faster than lower energy sites, such as plane surface sites. As the high-energy sites disappear through dissolution, the dissolution rate decreases.

REDUPP research focused on a series of materials with similar fluorite structure, including cerium oxide and calcium fluoride. Extensive laboratory dissolution experiments were performed using fragmented or powdered samples that contained sharp edges and defects. During dissolution, the fragments became more rounded.\n\nAmong the project goals was to determine how this gradual change of the sample surface affects the dissolution rate. By integrating their experimental results with computational modelling, REDUPP scientists developed a theoretical model of how the solid surface structure interacts with water during dissolution of spent nuclear fuel in groundwater.\n\nThe effect of the presence of trace elements was studied using real groundwater in dissolution experiments with UO2. Previous experiments used synthetic groundwater having a different chemical composition than natural groundwater. The lack of all the chemical elements that appear in natural waters introduced a non-trivial uncertainty in past modelling efforts needing to be reduced.\n\nExtremely low solubility of some of the materials used required careful and precise analyses of the solutions. Highly specific analytical data was obtained by means of high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. The improvement of databases for spent fuel dissolution was another outcome of the REDUPP project.\n\nThe results of REDUPP research are of interest to both research departments throughout the world and stakeholders in the nuclear waste management industry.

This will generate two-component luminescence (blue, from the Ir/Pt unit; green or red, from the Tb or Eu unit, respectively) in which the two luminescence components have lifetimes that differ by three orders of magnitude (microsecond for d-block luminescence; millisecond for lanthanide luminescence).  These different emission components can be selected at the detection stage using time gating such that purely one or the other, or a desired combination of both, can be detected in a given time window.\n\nIn addition to providing two luminescence outputs with different colours and lifetimes, each luminescence component is independently sensitive to different species in cells and can therefore be used for imaging.  The lifetime of Pt or Ir-based emission, from an 3MLCT excited state, is sensitive to quenchers such as dioxygen and variations in the luminescence lifetime in different parts of a cell can be used to visualise this.  In contrast the relative intensity of Eu-based emission bands varies with the concentration of chelating anions such as citrate and hydrogen carbonate, allowing ratiometric intensity-based sensing of these species.

Developing such a user-friendly framework to enable non-experts to transfer cutting-edge data and models from academia to industry is the goal of the EU-funded project http://www.biopredyn.eu (BIOPREDYN) . BIOPREDYN will include the very important regulatory and dynamic information required for more accurate predictive capabilities.\n\nResearchers are developing the tools and methodologies needed to handle time- and space-dependent biological data. User-friendly graphics will facilitate data analysis and model development. The team will apply the techniques to the complex pathways involved in metabolism, gene regulation, cellular signalling, developmental gene regulation and biotechnology production processes related to transgenic microorganisms.\n\nCollaborations are now in place to address the four main test-case problems. Work regarding data and visualisation as well as algorithm development are progressing well and has already resulted in several publications. A data and workflow model for the integrated software suite exploits 'Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language' (SED-ML).

The overall architecture will exploit an already established immune system simulator as well as several discrete and continuous mathematical methods for the modeling of the processes critically involved in the onset and progression of T2D. The crucial validation work will compare simulation predictions with actual biological and clinical data. MISSION-T2D aims at paving the way for translating validated multilevel immune-metabolic models into the clinical setting of T2D.

Following this, researchers would determine whether the markers could be useful for the early diagnosis of osteoporosis.\n\nThe project team identified 45 new loci, or genetic markers, that predicted bone mineral density (BMD), including 14 loci that were associated with fracture risk. The project also looked at gene\u2013environment interactions, showing that both age and sex had an effect on the prevalence of genetic risk factors.\n\nDue to the complex nature of the disease, scientists have not been able to identify genetic risk factors for osteoporosis until now.

Because they are not stopped easily, they carry unique information about the processes that have occurred in the far reaches of the Universe and in the core of stars. This means that what is inaccessible to telescopes 'only' able to look at the surface of celestial bodies becomes accessible to neutrino detectors.  \n\nTo open a new window to probe the Universe with neutrinos, physicists initiated the EU-funded http://laguna.ethz.ch/laguna-eu/ (LAGUNA) project. So that neutrinos are not confused with cosmic rays (sub-atomic particles that do not penetrate the Earth), a detector much larger and more sensitive than those presently used will be installed underground.  \n\nThe first phase of the project involved studying seven pre-selected potential locations in Spain, France, Poland, Romania, Finland and the United Kingdom. For each site, a detailed geological assessment of underground caverns was carried out to identify the most appropriate to host instruments with a total mass around 100 000 to 500 000 tonnes.   \n\nThree different types of neutrino detectors were considered: Memphys, Glacier and Low energy neutrino astronomy (LENA).

The partners include two small to medium-sized enterprises, two research institutes and six universities. They aim to introduce new genetic circuits into cyanobacteria.\n\nThese aquatic microorganisms can generate hydrogen as a side product of photosynthesis. However, the produced hydrogen quickly degrades before it is released from the cells. To produce larger quantities at faster rates, cyanobacteria need to be engineered to prevent the chemical conversion of the produced biohydrogen.\n\nSynthetic biology approaches, therefore, have a central role in the CYANOFACTORY project. By exploiting the knowledge of well-established biochemical processes and gene functions, highly specific genetic modifications were introduced to the photosynthetic organisms to produce biohydrogen. As cyanobacteria will carry foreign genes, particular attention was paid to safety.\n\nCYANOFACTORY partners have inserted genes encoding more efficient enzymes and down regulated genes for the unnecessary chemical conversion of the produced hydrogen. Strains were acclimatised to increase their tolerance to the chemicals they produce and the fluctuating growth conditions to which they will be exposed in outdoor photobioreactors.\n\nFor the case of accidental leakage of cyanobacteria from photobioreactors into the environment, a suicide mechanism was introduced. This programmed cell death is based on pairs of toxins and antitoxins existing in the cells of these aquatic microorganisms. The toxin moiety, acting only within the cyanobacteria cells, is harmless to humans.\n\nThe final step of the CYANOFACTORY project will be the construction of a network of interconnected 100-litre photobioreactors that are flat enough for microorganisms to get enough light. This system will enable project partners to validate hydrogen production parameters determined so far in the small-scale laboratory experiments. Also, potential manufacturing bottlenecks will be identified.\n\nMany research groups around the world are investigating potential new sources of biofuels.

These organelles require exquisite maintenance processes to keep them intact and prevent potentially catastrophic disruption. Failure in mitochondrial homeostasis is strongly linked to age-related conditions such as neurodegeneration.\nThis subject has garnered intense interest recently with emergence that two genes linked to Parkinson's disease, PINK1 and parkin, regulate the autophagic degradation of mitochondria (mitophagy).

As a consequence, search system quality is degrading: users of bespoke systems expect a Google-like experience of swift high quality retrieval; instead they commonly get slow sub-standard results. The key reason for this failing is the profound lack of testing resources that capture the unique and complex environments different retrieval systems are deployed in. The cost of building test resources is prohibitively expensive. Consequently, researchers are unable to assess the effectiveness of new ideas in such environments, search engine vendors struggle to tune their systems to the particular needs of their customers, customers looking to choose between competing search products do not have the resources to measure which system will better serve their needs. This project will address this problem by developing a new evaluation paradigm for search, which will, (1) establish an efficient and reliable test resource construction methodology, (2) develop a framework to adapt such resources to a wide variety of retrieval scenarios, and (3) extend the current evaluation paradigm to incorporate additional information about the different retrieval scenarios and users&apos; activities.

Hence, human women life-history is enigmatic. One possibility is that older women increase their fitness by directing resources to already produced offspring rather than having more. Thus, although women gain most grandchildren from own reproduction, they also gain more by helping offspring. This has fascinating implications. All animals must split their energy between reproduction vs. self-maintenance. Most continue to reproduce until death and produce maximum grandchildren by optimising investment between current vs. future reproduction. Human women must also optimise investment between mothering and grandmothering. How this is done and affected by ecological, social and demographic factors is unknown, but is essential to understanding the ecological and genetic basis of reproduction, senescence and lifespan. My project has 5 aims: 1. How does reproductive effort affect reproductive and post-reproductive senescence? 2. What proportion of grandchildren is gained post-menopause and how is this modified? 3. Is there heritable variation in life-history traits and their senescence, and how do genetic correlations affect evolution? 4. How do patterns of fitness acquisition account for menopause, prolonged post-reproductive lifespan and age of death in humans? 5.

Thus, drug development in ALS, including trial design, patient selection, and outcome measures must be re-engineered to break the current impasse. Nerve cell death in ALS is associated with inflammation, which contributes to cell damage, and is a logical target for therapy. Although therapeutic attempts to modify this have failed so far, the discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as key players in controlling inflammatory processes opens new possibilities since defective Treg function is important in ALS. In fact, Treg numbers and function predict rates of disease progression and survival. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS.

Although new technologies, such as Fibre Reinforced Polymers (FRP), are effective for strengthening substandard structures, their high material cost is an obstacle for their widespread application, especially in developing countries. This project aims to develop an innovative and economic strengthening solution by using a novel mortar-based composite (R-SRG), which comprises of recycled high strength steel cords, by-product of tyre recycling, embedded in an inorganic grout matrix. This novel technique can be efficiently used for flexural, axial and shear strengthening of reinforced concrete (RC) members and it is cost effective (more than 40% cheaper than using FRP), fire resistant, sustainable, and has low environmental impact. While proof of concept studies by the applicant have demonstrated the efficiency of the SRG technique, this project bridges the knowledge gap by developing fundamental understanding, design-oriented models and performance-based design guidelines so that this new technique can be introduced in practice.

This traffic growth presents a huge challenge to both the mobile industry and to academic researchers.\n\nAlong with increased spectrum efficiency, spectrum bandwidth expansion and traffic offloading through WiFi, small cell deployment is regarded as one of the most promising ways to meet the use of broadband mobile service in both outdoor and in particular indoor scenarios in the next decade. The deployment of small cells in a macrocell coverage area leads to a multi-tier heterogeneous network (HetNet), in which a mix of access node types, such as macrocell, femtocell and relay, will co-exist. Despite the current research and development on small cell/HetNet from both industry and academia, there are still many challenges to be addressed and questions to be answered for successful small cell and HetNet deployment. These challenges range from the lack of fundamental understanding of HetNet network capacity to the need of Radio Access Network (RAN) Planning and Optimisation (PO) tool for HetNet deployment involving both indoor and outdoor scenarios.\n \nThe DECADE project adopts the scheme of Research and Innovation Staff Exchange (RISE), with the effect of inter-sectorial efforts and knowledge integration to tackle the challenges in HetNet planning and optimization. The research consists in fundamental capacity analysis, system modeling, algorithm development, and performance engineering for HetNets.

The counselor will help the apprentices get settled in the host country and visit all the participating companies to ensure that the content and processes fulfill the learning agreements and objectives. Contact persons at the receiving institution and IFA will be available to support the participants throughout their entire stay abroad.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, within the framework of the project, 64 training officers from companies and vocational schools as well as vocational training experts will participate in a week-long workshop to exchange their experiences in order to learn about VET systems in other countries, compare them with the Austrian system and exchange ideas amongst each other and with colleagues from abroad. The goal is to promote the quality, innovation and the European idea in vocational education and training through cross-border exchanges. The participants are multipliers and can share their experiences in companies, schools and throughout Austria and thus contribute to a Europeanisation of the Austrian VET system.\r\n\r\nWhile abroad, the participants will acquire technical, linguistic, social, intercultural and personal skills and expand their personal and professional horizons. An internship abroad contributes to the strenghtening of important key skills such as teamwork, independence, personal responsibility, flexibility and much more. Experiences abroad promote career opportunities and ensure the future career of the participants and thus the competitiveness of Austrian companies. \r\nInternational exchange increases the overall quality of the Austrian VET. \r\n\r\nIFA is a non-profit association that has been organizing internships abroad since 1995 for apprentices, professionals and training officers. Since 1995, IFA has helped more than 6,500 people take part in an EU-funded stay abroad. As the applicant and co-ordinating institution, IFA will be responsible for ensuring the quality and proper organization of the project. \r\n\r\nIFA works with a network of experienced partners in the target countries with whom partnership agreements (Memoranda of Understanding) defining the conditions and quality criteria already exist. IFA has been successfully working together with most of the partner institutions for many years.\r\nThroughout the entire stay abroad, there is always someone from the receiving institution, the host company or IFA at the participant\u2019s side to supervise their progress and ensure the quality of the internship. \r\nUpon completing the internship, all the participants will receive a \u201cPersonal Transcript\u201d outlining the activities completed and knowledge and skills acquired with confirmation from the receiving institution and host company. \r\nAll internships will be recognized as part of the vocational training in Austria.", "http://www.kes.sheffield.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-AT01-KA102-000266_7"], ["2TN", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "THE UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD", 984866.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.shef.ac.uk", "THE UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000179_coordinator"], ["2PW", "Internship Abroad - Mehr als nur ein Praktikum", "King Edward VII School", 9778.0, "Student:\r\nIn order to finish the HTL Hallein it is necessary to do internships for a min. of 8 weeks. The HTL Hallein and it's partner schools will provide work placements abroad. These internships should give the students the opportunity to learn for their future careers and also to do a lot for their individual development. Managing their everyday life abroad is a new experience for most of the students . Organizing living, food, public transport, etc. is a great challenge for them.\r\nIn the summer holiday 2014, 10 students of the HTL Hallein will do their interships abroad. Therefore the HTL Hallein established partnerships with different schools in England and the Netherlands. Every partner has to organize the internships for the students coming from abroad. HTL Hallein looks for companies which can provide internships in the greater area of Salzburg. In June/July and September/October students from Sheffield and Drachten will come to Hallein and teachers of the HTL Hallein will support these students during their stay here in Hallein. \r\nThe cooperation between the schools from Sheffield, Drachten and Hallein was established in the last years during different Comeniusprojects. The partnerships have become very stable in the meantime. We organize the projects and keep in touch mostly by e-mail. During the last years we have got the possibility to hold conversations face to face a few times. During these meetings it was possible to discuss all the problems and fix up the strategies for the future.\r\nOn the basis of these internships the students should learn to cope with the problems that arise from living abroad and can realize the chances of going abroad. The employees of the different companies are forced to use English for communication.  Most of them need not  speak English at work or at home. During the internships the students have to communicate in English. So they will lose the inhibition of speaking English and get in contact with foreign people.\r\nThe first days abroad the students will be integrated into the everyday life at school. So they should become acquainted to schools abroad. After that first phase they will work for 3 to 4 weeks at different companies. During their interships the students should frequently report about their expierences and jobs. At the end of the interships the students will write summaries and will be able to have presentations at school and for the local press.\r\nIn the future the HTL Hallein will try to organize longer stays abroad for our students. They should attend schools abroad for minimum of 6 months. But untill now we have not built up the basic conditions. Also, students have a lot of concerns about going abroad for a longer period of time. We therefore have to built up an organisation and have to make much more of experiences to send students abroad.\r\nTeacher:\r\nThe Higher Technical School in Hallein, Austria set its aim to get in contact with other national and international schools. Therefore it became a member of the EACD and is also doing educational work in that case.\r\nBesides teacher development, the school\u00b4s goal is to improve the teaching standard and to offer teachers the opportunity to get a closer look at the working techniques and themes of stonework in other European countries.\r\nTeachers should give their best to do their work and they should be able to pass the exam for European Master of Craft. This title will be presented in public and should be a standard for the high qualitiy of this education at the HTL Hallein. With this project teachers should have the possibility to get in contact with other international schools and pupils should be put in contact with other schools as well to do an intership in other countries. Therefore pupils should get the chance to find a place for their individual needs.\r\nFor that purpose a teacher is sent, who has successfully passed the stonemason exam in Austria and the sculptor qualification in Laas, South Tirol in Italy. Attending the international stonemason festival and sculpture symposium he was able to collect lots of experience in that matter. Due to his educational studies at the PH Salzburg he was qualified to teach at the HTL Hallein.\r\nThe EACD Tour takes place at 6 different places within 2 years. There will be written a report about each place as well as a kind of diary for craftsmen where all the experience will be documented. During the tour there will be held meetings. The 3 topics will be published in a specialised book. Currently 7 people from Germany, Finland, Swizerland, Austria and Israel are attending the tour.\r\nAt school there should be offered a plattform for economy  which should support the communication between national and international schools. The exchange of knowledge should young people help to get better educated in the stonemason field and furthermore they should have better chances at the job market.", "http://www.kes.sheffield.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-AT01-KA102-004688_4"], ["2TN", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "THE UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD", 669969.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.shef.ac.uk", "THE UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-012599_coordinator"], ["2TN", "EuroPubHealth Plus", "UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD ROYAL CHARTER", 2492205.0, "Six European universities collaborate to deliver EuroPubHealth Plus (EPH+), an innovative, integrated 2-year Master course (120 ECTS) for students wishing to engage in a public health career.
