The need for this aim was raised during a meeting of the Pool of Trainers of YEU International, a network of organizations. The authors of this document were present and decided to organize a training on the matter, which found immediate positive response. All young people understand we are living in Europe, yet \u2018Europe\u2019 remains an abstract notion. The European Union and the Council of Europe aim to strengthen European citizenship, but what does that mean? Do youth workers have a responsibility here? This training course for youth workers will start from the beginning, with asking ourselves what could be understood by \u2018Europe\u2019, followed by exploring the idea of citizenship. We will take a look at the four aspects of citizenship: societal, cultural, political and economic factors. Then another core part of the training will start: developing and testing tools to promote active citizenship so they could be implemented in the local realities of the youth workers.\r\n\r\nAs said, the aim is to raise understanding of the concepts of \u2018Europe\u2019 and \u2018citizenship\u2019 and to develop tools for youth workers on these themes.

The main characteristics of the project are to be found in its simplicity and positive approach. It is created by members of the Danish youth organization Stop the violence in 2000 and it is now operational in more than 60 countries. The Human Library is a public event, where interested people can come to challenge their prejudices. The idea is to have a conversation with a Human Book: a person who has experienced prejudices due to issues such as race, sex, age, disability, sexual preference, gender identity, class, religion/belief or lifestyle choices. Just like a real book, it is important to watch over the safety of the Human Book. Many volunteers could be involved, as 'Matchmakers', 'Librarians', 'Matchmakers' and 'Dictionaries'. \r\nThis training promotes the Human Library  in youth organizations and to train youth workers from youth organizations to empower youngsters to organize it their local realities. There is a clear need to gain expertise to work locally with subjects such as diversity in the society. Aim of the project: to provide youth workers with skills and knowledge and attitudes to organize a Human Library.\r\nObjectives: \r\n\u2022 To transfer training skills on intercultural learning, with a thorough understanding of key-concepts such as \u2018stereotypes\u2019 and \u2018prejudices\u2019;\r\n\u2022 To explore the situation in different countries regarding prejudices;\r\n\u2022 To introduce and promote the Human Library as a tool to promote dialogue and understanding;\r\n\u2022 To learn how to organize a Human Library (minding skills, knowledge and attitudes);\r\n\u2022 To use and promote non-formal education and creative learning techniques.\r\nHalfway the training, JUB will organize the third Human Library in Groningen. In that way, we continue the legacy in Groningen and the participants of the project will also experience the Human Library themselves first, before they organize it. \r\nOn local level, key competences of youngsters will be improved, as they will organize a Human Library in their environment. By gaining organizing skills and developing the right attitude for organizing a public event, they will gain competences which are valued highly by employers.

The objectives of the exchange are to provide a forum for diverse cultures to come together and have a recognition for similarity and appreciation of difference, foster and encourage personal and social development through interaction on an inter-cultural level, empower young people to be active citizens and have an increased sense of belonging to Europe.The project is aimed to bring together project leaders,  youth workers and youngsters from  6 programme countries to discuss working experiences and strategies of NGOs in their work with youth within the field of European Citizenship Education and Youth participation in order to give new impulses, to share possible ways to break the issue down and to come up with creative ideas and support for practitioners in the international youth field.  The YE will provide the occasion to share experiences, to foster sustainable and equivalent partnerships, to support capacity building, to contribute towards inventive projects by exploring new working methods and strategies, to improve the quality of future projects and to develop further activities.

Distinctions are made because of skin color, ethnic background, sexuality or religion. The current refugee / migrant crisis in Europe adds another dimension. Many people fear the arrival of newcomers. People get treated in a certain different way, without thinking. Usually it is based on stereotypes and prejudices. There is a clear lack of knowledge and interaction between different people, who just move around in their own \u2018circles\u2019. With this training course we want to promote an exchange of personal stories, to overcome prejudices. During the training, the attending youth workers will first learn what the root causes of prejudices are in our societies and analyze the situation in different countries. The next phase is about exploring and mastering online tools to promote an exchange of information between different people. One particular example will be given: publishing articles and matching photographs at \u2018Humans of \u2026\u2019 pages on Facebook and Instagram. The idea originates from the hugely successful \u2018Human of New York\u2019 page, which has gathered over 16 million likes on Facebook by now. It presents street portraits and interviews, collected on the streets of New York. With the initiative, the subscribers of the page can read short stories of people they would perhaps normally never speak to. It offers a unique insight into the lives of others, broadening your own viewpoint. The power of social media is that it can reach a lot of people quickly, and it offers an easy space for interaction afterwards as well. Moreover, as most young people are active on social networks, it is good way to reach them. In this training course the youth workers will learn the basics of publishing such articles, including interviewing people, writing the story and shooting matching photographs on the street. The focus would be on subjects with a particular minority background, with a certain interest to tell their story. By the end of the training, every participating city should have a page. In case a page of a city already exists, we count on that the forces can be joined. In the weeks after the training, the youth workers should transfer the skills to the youngsters in their organizations, creating more impact and ensuring a sustainable flow of articles on the pages, written by youngsters. The main aim of the project is to empower youth workers with essential competences to promote exchange and understanding, using online tools. The objectives are:\u2022 To understand the root causes of prejudices and its role in our societies;\u2022 To analyze the situation in different countries regarding prejudices and minorities, with special attention to migrants and refugees. \u2022 To explore \u2018Humans of \u2026\u2019 pages on Facebook and Instagram as a contribution to promoting exchange and understanding;\u2022 To acquire competences (attitude and skills) to do street interviews, to make a short article about it and to shoot and edit street/portrait photographs;\u2022 To brainstorm and to investigate more online tools to promote an exchange of ideas;\u2022 To learn how to maximize the impact via online tools; \u2022 To gain skills on transferring competences to youngsters. There will be in total 25 youth workers involved, and a team of 5 trainers and organizers will guide the process and manage the logistics. The working methods are based on non-formal education, with brain storms, group discussions, inputs, learning by doing, theatrical methods etc. The project will have a big impact on several target groups and fields: on the participating youth workers, on the participating youth organizations, on the youngsters in those organizations and on the general public. The participants will learn about prejudices, about the situation in Europe, about setting up online activities and on transferring knowledge and skills to youngsters in their organizations. The youngsters will be actively contributing to the society (and acquiring very useful skills and attitudes) by going on the streets to interview persons from a certain minority background, shooting photographs, writing articles and publishing them, with the knowledge on how to create a maximum impact.
