We want our teachers to be able to communicate in Spanish to schools abroad, not only in Spain but other Spanish speaking countries. By achieving this, we will be increasing the global dimension of our school and create greater community cohesion. The aims of the project are to develop the learning of a new language and embed it in to our curriculum to make sure it is broad, balanced and inspiring.  We aim to learn about the educational system in Spain,  to learn new methodologies and to develop a link with a Spanish school that will continue after the completion of the projects funded by Erasmus. We want to develop the use of Spanish so that we and our pupils can communicate with other schools. This will have a positive impact for raising achievement and community cohesion. We aim to run more projects related to languages in the school to give language learning a greater context and give children an idea of what it means to be part of Europe. The aim of both projects is to make staff more aware of what it is to be European, what life is like in a different major European city and share this with the children. \r\nThe project 'Bonneville goes to Spain' will run for 2 academic years. During this time, we will have 24 members of staff attending a language and cultural course for 5 days where we expect them to experience the Spanish life style while being immersed in the cultural and social aspect of Spanish life. This immersion will enhance the learning of the language and will also facilitate the use of language within context which will give a bigger impact then if they learn the language here. We expect our staff to return more enthusiastic about speaking a foreign language and more confident to deliver and embed Spanish in our curriculum. During the language courses, participants will also have the opportunity to visit a market of a park in order to use their language skills in a practical manner as well as seeing the language written in the form of signs. This again will have a greater impact on their lessons as they can use real life photos of the market and park as well as provide children with a greater idea of what it feels like being there. It will also provide the teachers with different ideas for using and embedding the language.  \r\nThe Job shadowing element of 'Bonneville goes to Spain' will consist of 4 visits across the 2 years involving 3-4 members of staff in each visit. The first visit will consist of the head teacher, the language tutor, me and the creative curriculum leader. The aim of this visit is to make introductions at the Spanish school and to strengthen the links between the schools. We will take this opportunity to look for similarities and differences between the schools and use these to assess how the project will continue. The next 2 visits will take place to strengthen the school link and enable the teachers to work more closely with colleagues in the partner school. By having 2 visits we can assess and re assess the impact of the project so far, amend the project if needed and then plan new projects. Whilst teachers are visiting the partner school they will observe teaching and learning, speak to staff and look at specific areas of classroom management. They will also look how different areas of responsibility are  managed and delivered. We will compare roles with our Spanish colleagues and looking at timetables, staff meetings, policies and the curriculum to name a few. On return we will identify areas at Bonneville for improvement to grow, to develop, to amend. Participants will run staff meetings and will disseminate the outcomes of each mobility to members of staff and the wider school community including the governing body.\r\nThe outcomes of the project will be to develop our global dimension resulting in us having a greater confidence in teaching Spanish, a greater understanding of European life especially for our EU children, improving the welcome package for non English new arrivals and forge greater links with families in our community. The EAL lead will be part of the management team and can use findings to support with projects such as Walcott. We look to improve provision to teach languages in school and improve teacher competencies to teach a foreign language which will be measured through lesson observations, action plans and book scrutiny. We will use etwinning which is new to the school and will help to establish communication with students and teachers. We will be able to share projects with organisations and schools worldwide. \r\nWe will finally create a school open to the challenges that being a European school has and provide the children with the resilience to face the changes Brexit will make to their futures.", "http://www.bonneville-primary.lambeth.sch.uk/", "Bonneville Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036262_coordinator"], ["6QD", "Pr\u00e1cticas en Europa Erasmus +, fp grado medio, FCT y titulados.", "WINES OF URUGUAY", 35304.0, "For this project we are requesting  for 10 mobilities for students and graduates from IVT training degrees   , they will complete their FCT period or they will do an internships as graduates in companies of UK, France,Italy and Malta.\r\n\r\nAt the same time we are requesting for 4 mobilities for staff, two of them will be job shadowing in British companies, another one will be also a job shadowing in a French company ant the last one will be a teaching mobility for Norway.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMOBILITIES QUALITY :\r\n  \r\nAlways there will be only one participant in each company except in the case of students in the electricity companies, they have enough workload and the tutor 's ability to accommodate two students.\r\n  \r\nWe have enough partners host  to ensure maximum utilization and improve the integration of the participant in the company and the destination city and to deal with any unforeseen change   that may arise.\r\n\r\nWe have the experience and infrastructure necessary based on experience from previous years in different European programs to carry out this project , facing any unforeseen problems that might arise during  his development.\r\n\r\n  \r\nApplicant Organization : Public IES Alonso de Avellaneda of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares will manage all aspects of project completely autonomously .\r\n  \r\nHost partners in the UK ( 6) , France (3 ), Italy ( 4) Malta(1) and Norway (1).\r\n  \r\nNEEDS :\r\n \r\n- Improving training for IVT trainees with the completion of the FCT in European companies.\r\n- Increase the employability of these students and graduates of these degrees.\r\n- To enable participants to learn to work in a European business environment.\r\n- Expand their business horizons , self-sufficiency and ability to work in an international team .\r\n- Improve their professional and linguistic skills.\r\n-To involve the staff into European programs and to contribute to their learning and foreign language improvement.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES :\r\n- Increase the possibility of  mobility of  IVT students.\r\n- Raising the quality of the FCT .\r\n- Improving the employability of these students and recent graduates .\r\n- Learn new techniques used by European companies in each of the specialties.\r\n- To facilitate this learning experience to people who otherwise would have no chance , promoting equal opportunities for different types of students.\r\n- Increasing the prestige of the IVT and interest of the general population in order to follow these studies.\r\n- Promote the use of  IT's in IVT and teaching \"on line\"\r\n- Encourage the use of our virtual platform through internet based Moodle \"Pr\u00e1cticas en Europa Erasmus +, fp grado medio FCT y titulados\".\r\n- Expand our network of companies and partners  \r\n--To involve the staff into European programs and improve their foreign language skills.\r\n\r\nRESULTS : Increasing interest in studying an IVT degree ,learning languages in order to do  FCT's in another country, or doing an internship  as graduates, increasing their motivation , improving the social image of the IVT\r\n  \r\nWHERE : \r\nParticipants will do the internship in companies in the UK, France, Italy, Malta and Norway.\r\n  \r\nWHEN:\r\n- 72 days  between March and June 2018 for students who have to complete FCT and between June and August(in case of leftover scholarships).\r\n-The staff will carry out their mobilities between February and July 2018 depending on their personal avalilability.", "http://winesofuruguay.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037112_13"], ["9JS", "Platform collaboration:Tool for the development of youth mobility", "Momentum World Community Interest Company", 10270.0, "Our organization is a member of the international network Platform Network (www.platform-network.com).

The professionalism in youth work effects all levels engagement with young people and has filtered down to volunteers with an increased level  of responsibility and commitment   new child protection legislation child first part 3 mandated reporter will place the volunteer in the same position of responsibility as the paid trained professional youth worker . Is professionalism damaging volunteering ?  \r\n\r\nAlso the levels of expectation around all services delivered has risen to an extra ordinary level , evidenced by huge rise of  professional coaching now being delivered to young children in the GAA .The comparisons now between professional sport and amateur are not as whimsical as a decade ago. This writer recently observed a funny anecdote that makes this point quite eloquently   \r\na friend of mine while volunteering , with no children involved himself a qualified strength and conditioning instructor was   \r\n\r\n2. The internet and mobile phone technology is continuing to revolutionise the way we interact with each other. This phenomenon is more apparent among young people where simple communications now appear in the form of images, icons have replaced the written word, emoji icons used to describe emotion, snapchat has replaced the text message of yesteryear. Groups of young people can now gather in virtual youth clubs for social interaction . How do we make the youth club relevant to them ?  \r\n\r\n\r\n3. Irish society now has a diversity in its communities than did not exist in the past .How do we reach out to these new communities how do we make them feel welcome to volunteer . \r\n\r\nThis is further evidenced by the dramatic rise is Microvolunteering*  a\u201c bite-size volunteering with no commitment to repeat and with minimum formality, involving short and specific actions that are quick to start and complete\u201d which is many ways is the antithesis of what young work needs where relationship building, commitment, time and patience are the watch words . \r\n\r\nThe event will be delivered through a programme of  presentations,  discussion, events, actions, activities, conversation in relation to art in youth work.

The project will place the young migrant and local agencies working with them at the centre of the collaborative enquiry.

Research links will be developed through the project with local agencies entrusted with the integration/management of migrants, municipalities, health authorities, education, etc\u2026 these will be engaged at a small regional level (NUTS 3). The academic partners will oversee the research within their countries, ensuring the integrity of the research and also putting the action research into a broader theoretical context. The academic institutes will also have responsibility for ensuring consistency in the transnational dimension of the research.         \r\nPotential Transnational Partners\r\nThe scope of the research will seek to assess the interventions made by agencies prior to the departure of migrants from their home countries, as well as during the process of arrival, reception, transit and resettlement. The research collaboration will include partners from a country of origin for migrants (Ethiopia), countries of arrival (Grease, Italy), Countries of resettlement (Ireland, Sweden Germany, Netherland). The research will also include a third country into which there is a recent experience of youth migration from the participating countries, (Canada).  The rational for this is to create a shared \u201cfirst person\u201d learning context for the local agencies and civil society partners.  The inclusion of Ethiopian/Eritrean researchers will also ensure that the research focuses on the realities and urgencies of the contemporary migrant crisis. \r\nUnique Characteristic of this Project\r\nThis project combines principles of youth and community work with academic research in order to encourage reflective evidence based practice.

It is about giving young people a voice on issues of global and local importance. For this project, the issue we will focus on is migration.\r\n\r\nWhen busy people have a cup of tea, they stop and think for a moment. Our leaders are no different. So what would you like them to think about while they drink their tea?  Groups of young people or children from different countries imagine a short message/slogan on the migration issue. They decide who they want to hear their message. Then they buy some tea, and design the most original and creative box or packet for it. They put their message inside the special packet, and find an interesting way to deliver the message to the leader they have chosen. All they are asking is that the leader should spend 5 minutes having a nice cup of tea and thinking about something which young people say is important. Finally, they tell the story of what they have done, using film, photos, blogs or other creative media.\r\n\r\nThis non-formal education project will extend the international collaboration of Time for Tea to several more countries and promote the concept around Europe, creating the foundations for future links. The project will bring together 38 young youth workers / volunteers from 14 very different countries (Armenia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Georgia, Italy, Jordan, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, UK) for a training course about how to set up and organise a Time for Tea activity at the local or national level. Participants will first practice the activity together, and then make a detailed action plan for running Time for Tea with young people back home. They will also be trained on how to use video to report the activities.\r\n\r\nOn return home, participants will organise their own Time for Tea project. They will produce a film of their activities. These videos will all be uploaded and shared on the Time for Tea website.

The volunteers with the help of their own and acquired language skills introduce the community life, culture, customs and everyday events of the host region through photos, films and animations. Web coverage is enclosed to this project as well that is refreshed by themselves with the products they make with local volunteers. The volunteers participate in multicultural communication trainings together with local activists, which develop their sense of European cohesion and strengthen their European awareness. The team-works, the project planning and implementation improve the creativity and entrepreneurial skills of the volunteers. 7 volunteers participate in the project (from Italy, Germany, Spain, Macedonia and Romania), all of them for 12 months. The volunteers learn a new profession and a new language. Their self-esteem will improve and they become more open to new initiatives and inputs, the become more independent. They learn to live and work together with other youngsters with different cultural and social backgrounds. They meet new people (youngsters, NGOs, journalists, community people).", "http://www.momentumworld.org", null, "erasmus_2017-3-HU01-KA105-046733_6"], ["9JS", "Follow the wind in Nagyv\u00e1zsony II.", "Momentum World Community Interest Company", 21104.0, "We would like to organize a short-term EVS project, which takes 5 times, 59 days per rounds in Trans-Danubian region in Veszpr\u00e9m county in a small village, Nagyv\u00e1zsony. In our project, we will host 5 times 2 participants (altogether 10 volunteers) from eight countries. The aim of this project is to organize workshops, events and training courses for young families, young people, social workers, youth workers.  And also to help out in the Youth Center in our village, which is run by us. The main tasks for the volunteers will be the audiovisual support for our programmes organized by the association: making posters, photos, videos, upload pictures and videos on Facebook, Youtube, and our website. As part of the documentation, we will involve the volunteers to work with us on a short film. With this opportunity, volunteers will be able to gain experience in photo shooting and filmmaking and are then able to realize a film project on their own. This film project will have something to do with the young volunteers and with the community of the small village of Nagyv\u00e1zsony, therefore, both parties the community and the volunteers can gain from the film.\r\nThe Ruckenwind methodology is for engaging with young people from backgrounds of severely restricted opportunity in international work. This project has a proven potential opportunity to give a small group of young people facing significant challenges the chance to learn some new, practical skills at the same time as developing their appreciation of being citizens in a wider Europe. \r\nWe are applying without identified names of potential volunteers because from our experience in working with youngsters with fewer opportunities it mostly, that they decide about their participation within the last 4 weeks before the project starts. So it is important for us that we don\u00b4t have to name the volunteers in advance.\r\nAll of the volunteers will be drawn from backgrounds of very restricted opportunity and will come to learn a variety of practical \u2018shipwright-type\u2019 skills as well as the softer skills of team playing, team leadership and cross-cultural communication which will serve them well as they progress through the rest of their lives. The Youthpass will be used, not only as a recognition of the volunteer\u2019s non-formal learning outcomes  but also to structure and frame their individual learning plans. \r\nIn the beginning, we would like to host from each country 1 mentor and 1 EVS volunteer for our advanced planning visit (APV). For each 2 volunteers, we would like to make 1-day On-arrival training course to prepare them.  For the first 2 days we would like to host mentor as well to supporting their travel and integration.", "http://www.momentumworld.org", null, "erasmus_2017-3-HU01-KA105-046829_8"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["9JS", "MOMENTUM WORLD CIC", 48151.0, "Communication of the Commission Representations, Citizens' Dialogues and 'Partnership' actions (16.03.01.04)", "fts_2016_55523", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "SW4"}
