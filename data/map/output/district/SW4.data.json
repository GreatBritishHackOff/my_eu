Training will be provided on film making techniques for music videos.\r\n\r\nOn return home, participants will work with groups of young people with special needs, to produce one or more music videos with their groups. These videos will all be viewed at showcase events in each country, and also judged competitively through a Eurovision style audience and panel voting system.

The theme is professionalism in international youth work; the objective is to share our experience and develop best practice and high professional standards for leading groups of young people on international exchanges, by training the \"next generation\" of youth leaders. The course will take place in Cologne, Germany, with a duration of 8 days. There will be 32 participants (age 21+) from 11 countries (Bulgaria, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey, and UK).\r\n\r\nActivities will include presentations by participants, group discussions and practical hands-on simulation exercises designed to test knowledge and put learning into practice in a controlled but lifelike situation. The course will be based around outdoor (city) and intercultural learning so the planned simulations will enable participants to experience the kind of programme often applied to young people on exchanges, where issues of risk and welfare are most visible.\r\n\r\nThe training on a course of this kind is not covered by standard youth work courses, so most people learn about international work piecemeal from experience. We want to put in place something more systematic but also to share our own approaches which may differ from others active in this field elsewhere in Europe. The course will focus specifically on the skills, knowledge and professionalism of project managers and group leaders, and will set out the minimum standards for someone in this role. The objective of the One Step Ahead course is to share experience and adopt a common set of standards which all participants will take back into their organisations and adopt as an agreed code of practice. For this reason, there will be a follow-up requirement for multiplier training by all partners.\r\n\r\nThe methodology will be participatory and non-didactic, so everyone, including the organisers, can expect to learn and develop. It will result in participants understanding the regulatory and risk management framework needed in a well-managed exchange and adopting an agreed set of professional standards which participants and their organisations will adhere to in future.\r\n\r\nWe believe this course will contribute to the overall effectiveness and high standards of projects within Erasmus+.

In the course of these activities, we have found that the value of outdoor education is not always understood; the process of how to set up outdoor centres is not well documented; and local authorities, businesses and others do not always appreciate the potential economic and business opportunities associated with outdoor education services.

The aim of the project is to develop a network of outdoor education practitioners capable of becoming a resource for mutual sharing of knowledge and experience, providing further training and advice to others, organising international youth exchanges, and promoting high professional standards at a European level. The project will result in the publication of a multimedia resource pack for developing outdoor education centres, activities and programmes in different places and contexts.

A major focus of the course for the participants themselves will be the concept of \"personal branding\" and values-based leadership. There will also be a strong intercultural learning dimension.\r\n\r\nThere will also be a renewed emphasis on follow-up activity, with participants taking responsibility for delivering a simple global learning activity to youth groups in their home countries, thereby both putting leadership skills into practice and delivering benefits of international awareness to a wider audience. Participants will also become empowered as young ambassadors for Erasmus+ around Europe.\r\n\r\nApart from the Momentum team, trainers will include Paul van Casteren, an internationally respected management coach who works with senior executives of multinational companies, and the head of human resources from one of the UK's leading recruitment companies.\r\n\r\nParticipants will get a deep understanding of their own leadership style, their career ambitions and motivations, and the next steps they need to take in their career development.

It will deliver significant and sustainable practical benefits to ourselves and our partners from 16 other Programme countries, in terms of evaluation, process review, knowledge sharing, and forward planning. At the same time it will be an example of good practice in youth participation, empowerment and equal opportunity. It will provide valuable, constructive and creative feedback to the National Agencies of all the countries involved, and provide an excellent promotional opportunity for Erasmus+ after the first two years of the programme.\r\n\r\nThe theme of the project is international youth work and non formal education, with a focus on employability and inclusion - in other words, the core business of all the partners involved. The title of the project \"Milestones\" refers both to the measurement of the partners' achievements to date, which we will evaluate, and to the different stages of young people's personal development which different types of international projects can impact, using a progression of activities (youth exchanges, training courses, youth initiatives, EVS etc). The objective of the project is to review, reflect, evaluate and develop our international work together, making best use of all the available programmes and tools, and developing more effective partnerships, planning and project delivery processes.\r\n\r\nAll the project partners share the aim of making an impact on young people's personal development and their transition to the world of work, which is problematic in every part of Europe. We share the same type of methodology (youth participation through non formal education, creative projects and enterprise) and the same values (particularly in relation to cultural diversity). We also share a strong commitment to inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities. This is why we have chosen inclusion and employability as the core themes for the meeting.\r\n\r\nDuring this project we will examine all the different types of activity we have been involved in. We will also discuss how each type of project can be used most effectively at different stages of young people's development (for example, youth exchanges as a first step to international experience, or EVS as an opportunity for those who are more experienced or require a deeper level of engagement).\r\n\r\nBringing together participants from so many European countries and cultures will also be a celebration of cultural diversity. For the young people participating, this will be especially valuable. The project will help to develop their own active European citizenship and foster mutual understanding between them through cooperation, but it will also achieve this more widely through the longer term international project collaboration which is its main purpose.\r\n\r\nThrough sharing experience, best practice and evaluation of impact, the project will directly promote international cooperation in the youth field, and strengthen the ability and capacity of all the partner organisations involved.  It will deliver many of the key objectives Erasmus+ seeks to achieve.\r\n\r\nThe project will take place at the Glaramara Outdoor Education Centre in Borrowdale in the Lake District., and will last 5 days. There will be 40 participants from 17 countries. Activities will include ice-breaking and team building activities, presentations by all partners, structured discussions around the project theme, and outdoor \"Walk and Talk\" sessions which will enable participants to appreciate the outdoor education dimension of youth work as well as to have free ranging conversations. There will also be an information session on Erasmus for All, daily review sessions, and intercultural evenings. The project will end with an evaluation of the week. In order to give participants the maximum time for discussion, the programme will be structured quite loosely and the methods applied will be non-formal, non-didactic and highly interactive.\r\n\r\nIn parallel to the professional discussions, a separate youth strand of activity will see young people from each country working together to document the partner-building process through film, photography and online.

The course will take place in Buckinghamshire, UK, with a duration of 8 days. There will be 29 participants (age 21+) from 10 countries (Bulgaria, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey, and UK).\r\n\r\nActivities will include presentations by participants, group discussions and practical hands-on simulation exercises designed to test knowledge and put learning into practice in a controlled but lifelike situation.

We want to put in place something more systematic but also to share our own approaches which may differ from others active in this field elsewhere in Europe. The course will focus specifically on the skills, knowledge and professionalism of project managers and group leaders, and will set out the minimum standards for someone in this role. The objective of the One Step Ahead course is to share experience and adopt a common set of standards which all participants will take back into their organisations and adopt as an agreed code of practice. For this reason, there will be a follow-up requirement for multiplier training by all partners.\r\n\r\nThe methodology will be participatory and non-didactic, so everyone, including the organisers, can expect to learn and develop.

There will be 35 participants (including staff) from 9 countries (Croatia, Greece, Lithuania, Spain, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine and UK).\r\n\r\nThis project aims to address the issue that youth workers are often reluctant to get involved in international work. In the UK and many other European countries, international youth work is undervalued and misunderstood. Even at the best of times, it tends to lack support from policy makers; but in times of austerity, it becomes a low priority for funding and the first target of cuts. Youth workers are neither resourced, nor trained, nor encouraged to get involved in international work. They do not know how to get started; they may lack the confidence to do so, they may be too busy with day to day case work, or they may not appreciate the positive impact international experiences can have on young people. If they have not experienced this themselves, it is even harder for them to begin.\r\n\r\nOne of Momentum\u2019s aims is to increase young people\u2019s access to international projects. We cannot do this by ourselves, and so we need to encourage more youth organisations to \u201cgo international\u201d and get started in European projects. \u201cInto Europe\u201d is intended as a practical course, which will take youth workers to another country, in a very different cultural setting, and give them a first hand experience of their own. When they return home, they will have the confidence, motivation, knowledge and skills to pass on these opportunities to the young people they work with. Through Momentum and our European partners, they will also have access to support networks and partner projects (especially youth exchanges) which will be easy to manage. This will become a ladder of opportunities up to the point where they will start building their own partnerships and making their own Erasmus+ applications.\r\n\r\nThe course will be organised as a \"youth exchange for youth workers\" based on simple intercultural learning activities. Each day\u2019s activity will be followed by an in-depth review session so that participants can understand the methodology, benefits, risks and practical issues for every activity. There will also be an introduction to Erasmus+. At the end of the course, participants will go home with a simple action plan.

Projects couldn't overcome a certain point between mediocre and great results. This made us look more into this situation and after a 360 search, we captured the main issue, which became the main problem addressed by our project: The youth workers have low results and impact upon young people personal and professional development. From our analysis we concluded that the main problem has the following direct causes:-Youth workers have limited competences regarding deep and powerful educational/developmental approaches.-Many youth workers have a limited personal and professional vision upon their work with young people and lifelong mission. -Many youth workers lack transferability techniques and the usage of new educational concepts, tools and methods is limited.-Many youth workers have a project based approach which is limited and short term oriented.From this analysis we build our project, called \"Steps on the Wheel\", which AIMS TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF YOUTH WORKERS TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE RESULTS AND POWERFUL IMPACT ON PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF YOUTH.The project SMART objectives are:1.Developing competences that enable 27 youth workers to work with youth on complex personal challenges, thus enabling them to reach their full potential.2.Building and strengthening personal and professional vision, mission and values of 27 youth workers in order to act as responsible members of the world wide community for protecting the Earth and supporting authentic youth development.3.Developing the transferability and innovation capacities of 27 youth workers in order to use and adapt new educational concepts, tools and methods in their own working environments.  4.Increasing the strategic thinking of 27 youth workers in order to create long-term interventions for personal and professional development of young people.We will involve in our project participants who are over 21 years old, have at least 2 years of experience in youth work, participated in at least 2 international mobilities and have one of the following roles: youth workers, youth leaders, educational and career counselors, teachers, general educators, trainers, mentors, coaches, volunteers coordinator. One condition is that the people under these roles should work directly and constantly with young people. The group involved in the mobility is structured in 3 categories: the participants (27), the trainers (4), the support persons (2), in total 33 persons from 13 partner organizations. The project is called \"Steps on the Wheel\" because it is connected with a complex concept, the \"Wheel of Life or the Medicine Wheel\". The Wheel is a developmental tool which combines elements of psychology, holistic human development, nature, symbolism etc. used throughout the centuries by indigenous cultures. Our approach is innovative because there are very few youth workers who know and use the concept. The Wheel is create for youth development, with tasks and methods which can activate the full potential. We believe the Wheel is an excellent tool for addressing specific topic, such as employability, participation, active citizenship, environment protection, inclusion and many more. The Wheel represents the foundation of the course on top of which are placed specific methods, tools and activities which create bigger impact upon youth. Among these methods and activities are: group games for team building, atmospheric games, group discussions, therapeutic practices, mirroring, solution focused therapy, music therapy, nature observation, wandering in nature, rituals, ceremonies, working with symbols, Hero's Journey, building a traditional oven and sweat lodge, solo night, transferability methods, action planning, open space, reflection groups, presentations, peer to peer learning, community service, journaling etc.The project will create the following results:-27 transferability plans and 27 action plans; 4 weeks of individual mentorship; more than 40 non-formal learning methods (experienced during the course) will be available to 13 organizations; for Dreams for Life: two day dissemination seminar; collaboration with 15 local NGOs; one Handbook for eco-centric youth work; we expect and plan to develop with some of the participating organizations: 1 youth exchange, 1 seminar and 1 strategic partnership etc. Generated outcomes:-The youth workers have a higher efficacy and efficiency in their activities with young people; increased personal leadership; their professional paths and careers will flourish and they will expand their career opportunities; the youth workers\u2019 capacity to innovate will grow, higher life vision.", "http://www.momentumworld.org", null, "erasmus_2015-3-RO01-KA105-022816_4"], ["9JS", "Farming and fishing for our future", "Momentum World Community Interest Company", 31032.0, "The project seeks  to address the specific economic and geographical obstacles young people living in rural communities face, preventing their full inclusion in society and the labour market.

The applicant organisation (SVAG, The Netherlands) and the trainers involved in this proposal work in the Nonviolence and Conflict Resolution fields: their experiences made them realise the great need to promote a culture of peace among youth to help society to shift from a tradition of violence to new habits of understanding and inclusion. For these reason we are organising a Training Course to empower youth workers (trainers, facilitators, social workers, group leaders, teachers, activists, etc.), to learn methods and strategies on Nonviolence and Conflict Resolution in order to spread the world and facilitate young people on a path Toward a Nonviolent World. We aim at involving 26 participants who have no or basic notions on the topics.Objectives and methods. Participants will be offered the opportunity to reflect on the dichotomy violence/Nonviolence in their personal, interpersonal, and intercultural dimensions. With the help of non-formal learning methods (games, role plays, small group and plenary discussions, etc.) we will stimulate trainees to gain insights on their ways to cope with the kinds of violence they experience on themselves, with others, and in the relations within the wider society. Participants will learn new strategies to analyse conflicts and manage them, re-owning their responsibilities and the actual role they can play in their communities.Description of activities. We decided to hold the programme in London (Uk) because it is a country where there is much need to promote European projects; also, the multiculturality of the city offers many inputs for the discussion topics. The training course will be hosted in a venue that will develop participants\u2019 sense of community: trainees will be asked to contribute actively to the implementation of the programme and the care of the premises. Activities will alternate theoretical inputs to practical exercises to enable all trainees with their various learning styles to feel engaged and committed and reach their full potential. Participants\u2019 suggestions will be encouraged throughout the duration of the TC to enable a truly collaborative atmosphere.Results and impact. We foresee all participants to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of violence, to be able to deal with conflictual situations, to improve their competencies on non-formal learning methods, to become changing agents Towards a Nonviolent World within their organisations and communities. We will stimulate trainees to ideate new activities to be implemented in their own communities or through the networking they will develop during the days of exchange with the other participants.

In addition, the close connection in the region in which the Youth Center Blossin is located ensures on the one hand that the volunteers get a lot of information from the immediate rural area and on the other hand, that people from the region have a chance to come into contact and active communication with young people from Europe.

Originally established in Germany, EuroPeers is now expanding to a number of other countries. Our project \"Hands Up for EuroPeers\" aims to support and expand this process, starting from the UK where Momentum World is leading this initiative.The original and ongoing aims of the EuroPeers are:\u2022 To raise awareness of European issues and activities among young people\u2022 To make their peers aware of the importance of social commitment\u2022 To share experiences of Europe and being European citizens\u2022 To show how cultural diversity can be brought to life\u2022 To encourage young people to reflect critically on EU policy\u2022 To demonstrate courage, tolerance and entrepreneurial spiritThe project is important because of the current debates about the future of the EU and the limits of mobility - particularly in the UK with the forthcoming referendum. Although EuroPeers (and this project) is not political, we do see it as a means of encouraging a better quality of informed debate among young people, and of emphasising the youth dimension within the generaI public discourse on Europe.It is also highly relevant to the needs of young people: for those who have completed EVS or other projects, it provides valuable follow-up experience and a means of further transversal (employability) skills development; and it also provides accessible information to other young people and multipliers (teachers, youth workers, parents) who may not know about the opportunities Erasmus+ can offer.Our project thus has 4 aims:1. To promote Erasmus+ opportunities to more young people and potential beneficiaries in the participating countries2. To support the development of the UK network, and encourage and promote similar current or prospective initiatives in other countries3. To build shared strategies and share best practice for networking between partner organisations and directly between young people involved in EuroPeers or similar networks.4.

So what would you like them to think about while they drink their tea?  Groups of young people or children from different countries imagine a short message/slogan on the migration issue. They decide who they want to hear their message. Then they buy some tea, and design the most original and creative box or packet for it. They put their message inside the special packet, and find an interesting way to deliver the message to the leader they have chosen. All they are asking is that the leader should spend 5 minutes having a nice cup of tea and thinking about something which young people say is important. Finally, they tell the story of what they have done, using film, photos, blogs or other creative media.\r\n\r\nThis non-formal education project will extend the international collaboration of Time for Tea to several more countries and promote the concept around Europe, creating the foundations for future links.

The aims of the project are to develop the learning of a new language and embed it in to our curriculum to make sure it is broad, balanced and inspiring.  We aim to learn about the educational system in Spain,  to learn new methodologies and to develop a link with a Spanish school that will continue after the completion of the projects funded by Erasmus. We want to develop the use of Spanish so that we and our pupils can communicate with other schools. This will have a positive impact for raising achievement and community cohesion. We aim to run more projects related to languages in the school to give language learning a greater context and give children an idea of what it means to be part of Europe. The aim of both projects is to make staff more aware of what it is to be European, what life is like in a different major European city and share this with the children. \r\nThe project 'Bonneville goes to Spain' will run for 2 academic years. During this time, we will have 24 members of staff attending a language and cultural course for 5 days where we expect them to experience the Spanish life style while being immersed in the cultural and social aspect of Spanish life. This immersion will enhance the learning of the language and will also facilitate the use of language within context which will give a bigger impact then if they learn the language here. We expect our staff to return more enthusiastic about speaking a foreign language and more confident to deliver and embed Spanish in our curriculum. During the language courses, participants will also have the opportunity to visit a market of a park in order to use their language skills in a practical manner as well as seeing the language written in the form of signs. This again will have a greater impact on their lessons as they can use real life photos of the market and park as well as provide children with a greater idea of what it feels like being there. It will also provide the teachers with different ideas for using and embedding the language.  \r\nThe Job shadowing element of 'Bonneville goes to Spain' will consist of 4 visits across the 2 years involving 3-4 members of staff in each visit.

We will take this opportunity to look for similarities and differences between the schools and use these to assess how the project will continue. The next 2 visits will take place to strengthen the school link and enable the teachers to work more closely with colleagues in the partner school. By having 2 visits we can assess and re assess the impact of the project so far, amend the project if needed and then plan new projects. Whilst teachers are visiting the partner school they will observe teaching and learning, speak to staff and look at specific areas of classroom management. They will also look how different areas of responsibility are  managed and delivered. We will compare roles with our Spanish colleagues and looking at timetables, staff meetings, policies and the curriculum to name a few. On return we will identify areas at Bonneville for improvement to grow, to develop, to amend. Participants will run staff meetings and will disseminate the outcomes of each mobility to members of staff and the wider school community including the governing body.\r\nThe outcomes of the project will be to develop our global dimension resulting in us having a greater confidence in teaching Spanish, a greater understanding of European life especially for our EU children, improving the welcome package for non English new arrivals and forge greater links with families in our community. The EAL lead will be part of the management team and can use findings to support with projects such as Walcott.

The professionalism in youth work effects all levels engagement with young people and has filtered down to volunteers with an increased level  of responsibility and commitment   new child protection legislation child first part 3 mandated reporter will place the volunteer in the same position of responsibility as the paid trained professional youth worker . Is professionalism damaging volunteering ?  \r\n\r\nAlso the levels of expectation around all services delivered has risen to an extra ordinary level , evidenced by huge rise of  professional coaching now being delivered to young children in the GAA .The comparisons now between professional sport and amateur are not as whimsical as a decade ago. This writer recently observed a funny anecdote that makes this point quite eloquently   \r\na friend of mine while volunteering , with no children involved himself a qualified strength and conditioning instructor was   \r\n\r\n2. The internet and mobile phone technology is continuing to revolutionise the way we interact with each other. This phenomenon is more apparent among young people where simple communications now appear in the form of images, icons have replaced the written word, emoji icons used to describe emotion, snapchat has replaced the text message of yesteryear. Groups of young people can now gather in virtual youth clubs for social interaction . How do we make the youth club relevant to them ?  \r\n\r\n\r\n3. Irish society now has a diversity in its communities than did not exist in the past .How do we reach out to these new communities how do we make them feel welcome to volunteer . \r\n\r\nThis is further evidenced by the dramatic rise is Microvolunteering*  a\u201c bite-size volunteering with no commitment to repeat and with minimum formality, involving short and specific actions that are quick to start and complete\u201d which is many ways is the antithesis of what young work needs where relationship building, commitment, time and patience are the watch words . \r\n\r\nThe event will be delivered through a programme of  presentations,  discussion, events, actions, activities, conversation in relation to art in youth work. The programme will aim to connect different cultures and experiences of  youth work.

There appears to have been an enormous effort made at European and national level to understand and articulate the value of youth work in the context of inclusion and active citizenship.

The project will place the young migrant and local agencies working with them at the centre of the collaborative enquiry. The project will also encourage the establishment of interagency reflective (evidence based) collaboration at regional level within the participating countries as well as encouraging the establishment of learning networks at transnational level within specific sectors.   \r\nPotential local Partners\r\nThe research will be undertaken within youth groups or other community based civil society organisations working with migrants. Research links will be developed through the project with local agencies entrusted with the integration/management of migrants, municipalities, health authorities, education, etc\u2026 these will be engaged at a small regional level (NUTS 3). The academic partners will oversee the research within their countries, ensuring the integrity of the research and also putting the action research into a broader theoretical context. The academic institutes will also have responsibility for ensuring consistency in the transnational dimension of the research.         \r\nPotential Transnational Partners\r\nThe scope of the research will seek to assess the interventions made by agencies prior to the departure of migrants from their home countries, as well as during the process of arrival, reception, transit and resettlement. The research collaboration will include partners from a country of origin for migrants (Ethiopia), countries of arrival (Grease, Italy), Countries of resettlement (Ireland, Sweden Germany, Netherland). The research will also include a third country into which there is a recent experience of youth migration from the participating countries, (Canada).  The rational for this is to create a shared \u201cfirst person\u201d learning context for the local agencies and civil society partners.  The inclusion of Ethiopian/Eritrean researchers will also ensure that the research focuses on the realities and urgencies of the contemporary migrant crisis. \r\nUnique Characteristic of this Project\r\nThis project combines principles of youth and community work with academic research in order to encourage reflective evidence based practice.

Finally, they tell the story of what they have done, using film, photos, blogs or other creative media.\r\n\r\nThis non-formal education project will extend the international collaboration of Time for Tea to several more countries and promote the concept around Europe, creating the foundations for future links. The project will bring together 38 young youth workers / volunteers from 14 very different countries (Armenia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Georgia, Italy, Jordan, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, UK) for a training course about how to set up and organise a Time for Tea activity at the local or national level. Participants will first practice the activity together, and then make a detailed action plan for running Time for Tea with young people back home. They will also be trained on how to use video to report the activities.\r\n\r\nOn return home, participants will organise their own Time for Tea project. They will produce a film of their activities. These videos will all be uploaded and shared on the Time for Tea website. Finally, everyone will return to London for a second course which will include a public presentation of all the project results to key stakeholders and sponsors. The project will conclude with further dissemination and multiplier training events in each country.\r\n\r\nThe project will have impact on its participants (enhanced youth work skills and techniques, personal and professional competencies); on young people around Europe (youth voice, active citizenship, dialogue with policy makers); on partners and other organisations (open access materials arising from the project; global learning methodologies; networking); and on communities (engagement of young people). It promotes key objectives of Erasmus+ for youth mobility, youth work development and internationalisation. It embodies inclusion and multiligualism.

Moreover,  the situation is currently more intricate in regard to migrants and refugees.\r\nThe main objectives are to make participants understand broad concepts of cultures (their own cultures and foreign cultures) and being able to think critically about the knowledge we have and the information we receive and perceive. We would like to achieve that the participants are more open-minded and aware of diverse cultural contexts and unique effects of cultural heritage. Beside the main objectives, we would like to give space to the participants to increase their creativity through various activities.\r\nWe are planning to manage the project through thematic creative sessions ( workshops, playing a theatre, tandems, simulations, mind games\u2026) focused on history, traditions, values, languages, food habits, general lifestyle, and stereotypes. Most of the content in the learning process will be created from the big part by the participants  Moreover, we will involve in the process at least one cultural expert which can provide participants with an objective point of view and give a different educational input.\r\n8 leaders and 24 participants from 6 countries aged 18-23 from different backgrounds (some of them disadvantaged geographically of financially) are expected to take part in the project. We will invite local media (TV, newspaper) to inform about the project and make interviews with participants. One part of the project is a performance of theatre play \"Where the past meets the future\". On this occasion, we will invite also locals, mostly local youth, to watch the performance and afterward get in touch with the participants. We plan to spread the results (video, online poster, short messages, and photos) of the YE online through diverse social media using the #EuropeForCulture. \r\nIn a general range, we intend to devote the project to the creativity of participants and ability to express and understand themselves. We would like to achieve that they not only open their minds to other cultures but they are at the same time able to look at their own culture from a completely different point of view. \r\n*In the project is included an APV (an advance planning visit) which we are planning to realize - 01/06/2018-03/06/2018 - three weeks before the youth exchange will start.

On one hand, the digitalization of information allows us to use tools to compare and verify information sources. On the other hand, we are more and more apathetic and lazy and we base our knowledge in the information that we receive in viral news on social networks, without considering that it can be poor, manipulating and misleading. \r\n\r\nAs young people, we are worried about the situation that we perceive among our equals and ourselves, with this training course we want to create the opportunity to train ourselves with key-trainers in the field of youth work and journalism, and through activities designed to boost curiosity and desire of learning, to analyze the society of medias and information acquiring tools to detect when we are facing misleading information. With these activities we want to contribute to create a youth generation more responsible in the consumption and reproduction of news.
