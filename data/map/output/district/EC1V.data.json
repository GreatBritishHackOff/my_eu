As a counter-defense, viruses deploy viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs). Well-established in plants and invertebrates, the existence of antiviral RNAi in mammals has remained unknown until our recent findings (from my first postdoctoral studies) that undifferentiated mouse cells infected with Encephalomyocarditis virus or Nodamuravirus accumulate 22-nt long siRNAs. These derived from viral dsRNA replication-intermediates, incorporated into AGO2, were eliminated in Dcr knockout cells, and decreased in abundance upon cell differentiation.

We concluded that antiviral RNAi operates in mammalian cells. One of the key findings from this study was that antiviral RNAi operates in undifferentiated but not in differentiated cells. Our main hypothesis for this discrepancy is that, in mammalian cells, virus infection triggers other defense systems that are not sequence-specific by nature -such as the interferon (IFN) response- and that these defense pathway may mask the effects of RNAi. Accordingly long dsRNA-triggered RNAi is active in mESCs, which are known to be defective in their IFN response. Alternatively, DCR and/or its cofactors involved in dsRNA processing might be insufficient in differentiated cells. The aim of this proposal is, therefore, to establish whether antiviral RNAi can be revealed in differentiated cells genetically-deficient for different components of the IFN pathway and/or modified to express appropriate levels of factors involved in the processing of dsRNA.

In-depth analysis of tumour genomes is revealing evidence for branched evolution and cancer subclonal spatial and temporal intratumour heterogeneity (ITH). Drivers of ITH such as chromosomal instability (CIN) are associated with drug resistance and poor clinical outcome. However, despite increasing knowledge of tumour diversity, there is limited insight into the mechanisms driving genomic instability and ITH or the processes that shape cancer genome evolution over time and space. Many animal tumour models fail to recapitulate patterns of genomic instability witnessed in human tumours, limiting insight into the forces that shape tumour evolution in vivo. We have found evidence for parallel subclonal evolution, resulting in the same gene or signal transduction pathway being subject to distinct inactivating or activating somatic events in different regions of the same tumour (Gerlinger NEJM 2012). These data suggest that in-depth analysis of tumour evolution may help define routes through which tumours must progress, offering opportunities for novel therapeutic approaches. We will develop new animal models of ITH, by developing knock-out strains for two suppressors of replication stress and CIN, recently identified in our laboratory (Burrell Nature 2013).

With respect to EMT, partners found that it was a common process in CSC-enriched sub-populations and gave a better ability to form metastases. By identifying key pathways, transcription factors and epigenetic remodeling mechanisms that regulated EMT, scientists aimed to interfere with the process and impair transition to malignancy.\n\nInvestigation of the metastatic niches revealed a role for certain proteins (SAA1 and SAA3) in lymph node dissemination. Key players in any form of metastasis were bone marrow-derived cells that colonised pre-metastatic organs and primary tumours and, through the secretion of cytokines and proteases, facilitated the invasion by cancer cells.

Although the signals underlying this dichotomy are not fully understood, some are mediated by the induction of immediate-early transcription factors of the AP-1 family, a key regulator in crucial cellular events. AP-1 activity is regulated, in part, by the phosphorylation of its c-Jun component by the Jun N-terminal Kinases (JNKs). Recent work has confirmed the notion that c-Jun functions as the trigger of the axonal response during neuronal regeneration in the CNS and strongly supports the perception of c-Jun action as a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d promoting post-traumatic neuronal cell death as well as axonal regeneration. The goal of this project is to better understand the function of the JNK/c-Jun pathway during neuronal regeneration by generating and employing gain and loss-of-function transgenic mice models and to clarify the role of JNKs/c-Jun phosphorylation in the neuronal response to axonal damage.

Software practitioners can earn a certificate for expertise in a certain hardware or software technology. The maturity of crucial IT processes, such as software development, can be and is often certified. Even individual software systems can be certified as having particular non-functional properties, including safety, security or privacy. However, the latter type of certification (e.g. Common Criteria) has had only a limited use to this day. Current trends in the IT industry suggest that software systems in the future will be very different from their counterparts today, due to greater adoption of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs) and the wider spread of the deployment of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). These trends point to large-scale, heterogeneous ICT infrastructures hosting applications that are dynamically built from loosely-coupled, well-separated services, where key non-functional properties like security, privacy, and reliability will be of increased and critical importance. In such scenarios, certifying software properties will be crucial. Current certification schemes, however, are either insufficient in addressing the needs of such scenarios or not applicable at all and thus, they cannot be used to support and automate run-time security assessment.

A-T patients display immune deficiencies, cancer predisposition and radiosensitivity. The molecular role of ATM is to respond to DNA damage by phosphorylating its substrates, thereby promoting repair of damage or arresting the cell cycle. Following the induction of double-strand breaks (DSBs), the NBS1 protein is required for activation of ATM. But ATM can also be activated in the absence of DNA damage. Treatment of cultured cells with hypotonic stress leads to the activation of ATM, presumably due to changes in chromatin structure. We have recently described a second ATM cofactor, ATMIN (ATM INteractor). ATMIN is dispensable for DSBs-induced ATM signalling, but ATM activation following hypotonic stress is mediated by ATMIN. While the biological role of ATM activation by DSBs and NBS1 is well established, the significance, if any, of ATM activation by ATMIN and changes in chromatin was up to now completely enigmatic.\nATM is required for class switch recombination (CSR) and the suppression of translocations in B cells. In order to determine whether ATMIN is required for any of the physiological functions of ATM, we generated a conditional knock-out mouse model for ATMIN. ATM signaling was dramatically reduced following osmotic stress in ATMIN-mutant B cells. ATMIN deficiency led to impaired CSR, and consequently ATMIN-mutant mice developed B cell lymphomas. Thus ablation of ATMIN resulted in a severe defect in ATM function. Our data strongly argue for the existence of a second NBS1-independent mode of ATM activation that is physiologically relevant.

These findings also have important clinical implications as hALC1 was identified as the target oncogene within the 1q21 amplicon, a frequent genetic alteration in human hepatocellular carcinoma (Ma et al., 2008). Here, I propose to study the potential role of ALC1 in chromatin remodelling at PARP1 regulated promoters. In parallel, I propose to generate gain-of function and loss-of function ALC1 mouse mutants. On the one hand, I will generate mALC1 inducible transgenic mice to establish its potential role in tumorigenesis. On the other hand, I will generate mALC1 conditional knock-out mice to study its role in neurodegenerative diseases as already described for some SSB repair-response proteins.

However, it is unclear whether CD8alpha\\ DC fulfill unique and non-redundant roles in the immune system.

Finally, CD8alpha\\ DC have not been identified in humans, greatly restricting their use in immunotherapy. In this proposal, we exploit the recent finding that DNGR-1 (CLEC9A) acts as a new and specific marker for the CD8alpha\\ lineage to address these issues.

Second, a methodology was created to identify commonalities defined in terms of co-arrivals and co-jumps. While determined at high frequency, the commonalities were looked at as results of low-frequency macro-factors or predictors.

It was also discovered that foreign macroeconomic news mainly accounts for price jumps in these areas, largely influenced by markets in the United States.\n\nResearchers also conducted a focused analysis of the Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

Based on this in vitro RNAi library, transgenic Drosophila in vivo RNAi lines were created for nearly 12 000 genes and were made publically available through the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center (VDRC).\n\nThe CANCERPATHWAYS consortium developed novel bioassays for the screening of genome-wide RNAi and small molecule compound libraries and for assessing their impact on cell fitness and specific pathway activities. Large-scale RNAi screening led to the identification of novel therapeutic target genes. High-throughput compound screens resulted in the identification of novel candidate molecules that interfered with the activity of oncogenic signalling pathways.\n\nPhenotypic screening of cell lines was also performed by image-based techniques, which enabled the simultaneous analysis of multiparametric features. Analysis software developed in the project was made available as Bioconductor/R packages. Experimental work led for instance to the identification of novel mechanisms that control Notch signalling as well as transcriptional targets of the Drosophila JAK/STAT pathway as effectors of haematopoietic tumour formation.\n\nCollectively, the work conducted by CANCERPATHWAYS proved that Drosophila constitutes a valid model for rapid, high-throughput anti-cancer drug screening and target discovery. The powerful tools led to the identification of multiple novel key factors involved in cancer development that would not have otherwise been identified by traditional 'top down' approaches.

Furthermore, no animal model for the in vivo study of Rab7 is currently available. Therefore, the initial focus of my research project will be to generate novel mouse models, in which the activity of Rab7 is impaired.

Besides treating tumours by reversing the effects of oncoproteins through inhibition, another approach is to use therapies that target tumour-specific vulnerabilities caused by the oncogenic state. To investigate this possibility, an siRNA screen has been performed in order to identify new genes necessary for the RAS-driven oncogenic state. This approach has led to the identification of the matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) as a protein required for the survival of cells with an activated KRAS allele. MMP-7 is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family that has broad substrate selectivity against extracellular matrix components and some non-matrix substrates. MMP-7 is overexpressed in a variety of tumours and is associated with unfavourable prognosis. The main aim of this project is to study the mechanism underlying the dependency of cells with RAS activating mutations on MMP-7 expression. To determine this we will study four different pathways. MMP-7 can suppress apoptotic FasL/Fas pathway by cleaving FasL and reducing its efficacy in triggering Fas signals. Alternatively, MMP-7, by cleaving E-cadherin, can increase \u03b2-catenin-Wnt pathway, which is required by several tumour types. Moreover, MMP-7 proteolysis of IGFBP-3 plays a crucial role in regulating IGF-I bioavailability, thereby promoting cell survival. Finally, MMP-7 can process HB-EGF that will activate ErB4 signalling.

TGFb is a multifunctional cytokine which, in addition to cancer is also implicated in developmental disorders, fibrosis and autoimmune diseases. TGFb signalling has been implicated in both tumour suppression and progression. Although TGFb inhibits inhibits growth of early carcinomas, later in tumourogenesis, it can induce an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting an invasive, metastatic tumour phenotype. TGFb signals through the activation of Smad proteins. After activation, Smads accumulate in the nucleus where they regulate transcription, either positively or negatively. Although some recent advances have been made, exactly how Smads regulate transcription and how in turn the Smads are regulated during transcription is still remains unclear.

Of all human cell-types, brain-specific isoforms have the longest 3' UTRs and therefore their regulation is likely to be most complex. Moreover, mutations perturbing the mRNA secondary structure and sites of mRNA-miRNA interactions can lead to diseases such as neurodegeneration. Isoforms of variable 3' UTRs are engendered by alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (polyA) site selection. Of the many factors contributing to this process, both transcriptional and RNA regulatory interactions have been extensively studied. Yet the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the systematic tissue-specific polyA site selection remain largely unknown. Here I hypothesise that changes in transcription factors, RNA binding proteins, and polyA factors activities together regulate the condition-specificity of this process. Furthermore I hypothesise that the resulting 3' UTR sequence variation contributes to increased protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disorders such as motor neurone disease (MND), a common but incurable disorder in which mRNA metabolism and protein homeostasis are disrupted. Here using bioinformatic approaches I will integrate a variety of genomic measurements, and systematically identify tissue-specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory interactions underlying polyA site selection. I will develop linear models to characterise the genome-wide functional coupling between these regulatory interactions and study how these associate with MND in regulating alternative 3' UTRs.

We have an intuitive sense of how dependable a concept is, which is crucial when we decide whether to rely on the concept. It can underpin our decision to reject some concepts (e.g. RACE) and embrace others in our theorising (e.g SPECIES).

For some years now, we have run a number of international projects to develop our school and the training provided, and our experience is that it is a successful means to foster an international spirit to help make young people mobile and apt to actively seek a career or education in other European countries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe method to obtain the targets is to enable our teachers and students to develop their own learning as well as the learning of others through a greater intercultural understanding, improved lingusitic skills, stonger professional skills and an enhanced self-esteem. The international perspective provided by the project makes it possible to view oneself from a European perspective, which helps the individual to (also) take the step to work and live elsewhere in Europe. The participant teachers learn new methods to develop their teaching to make a greater number of students succeed in their learning. Thereby, our teaching staff help increase the students'  employability all over Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe add to our vocational students' opportunities by making them more attractive in their future work fields by making them develop entrepreneurial skills, their professional special skills as well as their cultural know-how and understanding.  We do this by developing the entrepreneurial learning by  focusing on ICT pedagogy, collaboration between education and enterprises (big and small in various fields of work), increased student influence and tutoring/mentoring as well as by by adding to their linguistic competences and sense of democarcy as a result of inclusion in an international environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this stage, sixteen of our teachers in vocational training will perform work shadowing and study how teachers in carefully chosen schools work with a strong development in the chosen fields of interest.

The students critically need experience to deepen their academic learning. They need this for several reasons: to give value and meaning to their academic work; to strengthen their CVs; to improve their employability skills, to help them network with potential employers; to help them decide on optimal career paths for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe work placements will provide these students with practical experience and increased work-based skills and knowledge that are fundamental to their programmes of study.

All these highlighted the generalised use of the traditional methods of teaching-learning \u2013assessment process, the lack of multimedia teaching aids, teachers\u2019 routine and lack of interest to motivate and stimulate students, not using  ICT or other attractive teaching materials or tools such as Google.Doc, Google Tools, Microsoft Onedrive, Dropbox, etc. Also, it has been noticed that human and material resources are not used efficiently and although the results in the national examinations, contests and olympiads are apparently satisfactory, students do not qualify for the national phase of these competitions.       The aim of this project is developing competences of 18 teachers to use modern, innovative methods in their teaching-learning \u2013assessment activity in order to enhance students\u2019 performances. This will be achieved by participating in structured learning courses, over a two-year period, in European context.        The objectives of this project are: 1.Developing the abilities of using modern teaching-learning-assessment methods for 18 teachers from our school, in different curriculum areas, over a period of 2 years. 2.Developing the abilities, knowledge and competences of 14 teachers to use the new technologies(ex. Web 2.0, blogging, social networking, Google tools, Microsoft Onedrive) over a period of 2 years.3. Improving  linguistic competences in a foreign language for 18 teachers over a period of 2 years.4.Raising the interest of 18 teachers in disseminating European good practices in our school, over a period of 2 years.          The main activity of the project consists of structured courses with 3 phases: pre-course preparation, mobility and follow-up, and the themes of these courses meet the needs of the teachers selected for mobilities in areas such as pedagogy, innovative teaching methodology, new technologies and learning resources.          There are 18 teachers, aged 28-52, to undertake mobility, in the following areas: Mathematics-2,English-3; French-2; Romanian -1; History-1;Biology-1;Chemistry-1;Geography-2; ICT-1; Art-1;Social sciences-3.The team is made up of 2 men and 16 women. There will be 5courses as follows:4 courses of 5 days each \u2013 8 hours/day and 1 course of 14 days, out of which 10 days of 4 hours/day.           In order to coordinate the project activities, a team has been established in which each member is in charge of a certain aspect: implementing, disseminating, monitoring, assessment, financial activity.To ensure the quality of the project management, a supervisor has been appointed, having clear responsibilities and deadlines. This project is expected to have a positive impact on the teachers who will develop their personal and professional competences becoming more motivated to experiment, to develop and apply innovative, interactive teaching methods ( the number of lessons to use such methods will increase by 80%);they will become more creative in their teaching activity and will be able to create new teaching aids, and increase students\u2019 motivation. 14 out of the 18 teachers will become skilled at using the new technologies Web 2.0 and will create cross-curricular digital lessons once a week; they will become professionals in education and will be able to  exchange \u201cknow \u2013how\u201d with other teachers(53 teachers in our school will benefit from innovative teaching materials).             The widespread use of the new methods will influence 430 students of the upper secondary school who will be more motivated to attend classes thus reducing truancy rate; who will do better in their exams, contests and olympiads and get at least 1 first prize in the county phase in all school subjects and at least 3 prizes in the national phase; at least 50 % will develop their linguistic competences; more than 400 students will be able to create virtual learning environment with the help of the new technologies.              The reputation of our school will increase in the local or larger community, as well as its European value by establishing connections between the teachers from our school and other European countries.

Our school has the task and mission to develop an intercultural teaching practice supported by inclusive, innovative methods and entrepreneurship to achieve a more entrepreneurial learning for the benefits of our students. For some years now, we have run a number of international projects to develop our school and the training provided, and our experience is that it is a successful means to foster an international spirit to help make young people mobile and apt to actively seek a career or education both in Sweden, other European countries as well as in the global community. The method to obtain the targets is to enable our teachers and students to develop their own learning as well as the learning of others through a greater intercultural understanding, improved lingusitic skills, stonger professional skills and an enhanced self-esteem. The international perspective provided by the project makes it possible to view oneself from a European perspective, which helps the individual to (also) take the step to work and live elsewhere in Europe. The participant teachers learn new methods to develop their teaching to make a greater number of students succeed in their learning. Thereby, our teaching staff help increase the students'  employability all over Europe. Our plan to use ECVET to safeguard the quality of our work experience will enhance the impact expected on the participants and their future aspirations.We add to our vocational students' opportunities by making them more attractive in their future work fields by making them develop entrepreneurial skills, their professional special skills as well as their cultural know-how and understanding.  We do this by developing the entrepreneurial learning by  focusing on ICT pedagogy, collaboration between education and enterprises (big and small in various fields of work), increased student influence and tutoring/mentoring as well as by by adding to their linguistic competences and sense of democarcy as a result of inclusion in an international environment.At this stage in our development, twenty of our teachers in vocational training will perform work shadowing and study how teachers in carefully chosen schools work with a strong development in the chosen fields of interest.  Our partners for work shadowing are Newton Abbot College, South Devon College, Galway Technical Institute and Amisto Porvoo Vocational College. In addition, 244 of our vocational students, will do a three-week work experience with numerous organisations and enterprises in England, Scotland, Ireland, Italy, Spain, France and Poland. Most organisations to receive students have had vocational students from us in previous projects, which ensures that they will take on our students in the very best way and provide them supervision, relevant work as well as plan, carry our and assess to what degree the learning outcomes have been reached in the time of work placement. The participants will be selected upon submission of an application, and they will then prepare for the time abroad linguistically and culturally as well as professionally. We will use documents provided by the commission and also create learning agreements an formulate learning outcomes for all participants, i.e. both students and teachers. Students also receive a Euopass. ECVET will be our new standard upon completion of the necessary work.The Bromangymnasiet project group - a principal, an administrator and a coordinator - organises all activities that relate to the work shadowing, work experience and ECVET. The group is in charge of and responsible for selecting participants, communicating with partners, establishing various agreements/contracts, bookings, economy, insurance, evaluation and dissemination of the project results.By partaking in this project, we expect of participating teachers to develop their teaching practice to a more entrepreneurially featured kind that supplies the students with tools to succeed in their field of training. We know from experience that vocational work experience abroad generates increased vocational competences, a greater intercultural understanding, improved lingusitic skills and an enhanced self-esteem, which also makes them dare take the step onto the international field of work.Teachers who participate in work shadowing will share their experiences and learning outcomes with colleagues upon their return, which will further the progression in the eduactional development. The students who engage in work placements elsewhere in Europe will inspire other students to do the same in the future.

As a backdrop to the project, in recent years Europe has had to come to terms with high rates of unemployment in all age groups, but most particularly among young people and among adults with low levels of qualification. To coincide with this, the European labour market shows ever-increasing competitiveness related to specialised competence and knowledge and to the involvement of new technologies. In social terms, recent months have been characterised by a negative economic impact on inclusion and on social justice, exacerbated by the refugee crisis and the simultaneous increase in the threat of terrorism, often originating from inside the EU itself. European values and principles appear to be at a crossroads as cohesion weakens. It is within this kind of context that projects such as this one can make a difference, by contributing at grass-roots level towards an upturn in growth, based on the principles of equal opportunities and inclusion, gradually leading to a new increase in prosperity and wellbeing. This will be achieved through local and transnational co-operation and by means of the mobilities we intend to promote, which together will provide important added value to all involved and will represent another step forward in achieving these goals. At the level of the organisations involved (the members of the consortium, the intermediary and the receiving organisations), there is a valuable opportunity to become more competitive though the processes of innovation, of co-operation and of internationalisation implicit in the execution of the project, which will also include the application of several elements of the ECVET system. This will permit the full integration of these elements into the curricula of some of the courses offered by the organisations involved, and the integration of mobility into the training plans of these courses.In practical terms, the project will provide 2-month mobility experiences for 55 participants who will have completed vocational training related to sectors which reflect the training offered by the members of the consortium, with a emphasis on those from economically, financially and socially underprivileged backgrounds. The mobility opportunities will be distributed according to the needs of each organisation and will take into account the number of trainees completing courses each year. The co-ordinator, CEL, will attribute 16 mobilities to students completing vocational training in translation and interpreting, and in language teacher training, given the average total of 50 per year. The CML training department will benefit from 10 mobilities given their average annual total of 30 trainees who complete courses in gardening and paving. The Education and Development Centres at CPL will benefit from 29 mobilities distributed among 16 training areas, which include a variety of sectors, such as management, fashion design, tourism, IT, electricians, arts and audiovisuals. Every year, more than 500 trainees complete training at CPL. As a result of their mobilities, the participants will gain the knowledge, skills and competence which are fundamental to obtaining enhanced employability, both on a personal and on a professional level, in terms of both language skills and cultural awareness, and in terms of both social and civic skills. The project will also provide 12 2-week mobilities for staff (professionals working at the organisations of the consortium), in areas related to vocational education, training and integration, with a view to improving their skills so that they may better contribute towards the common strategy of international co-operation.With the aim of ensuring that these goals are achieved with high levels of quality, the project will include 29 partner organisations (intermediary and receiving organisations). The considerable quantity of PIC numbers belonging to receiving organisations demonstrates the commitment already consolidated between them and the intermediary partners, a clear indication of commitment to the aims of the project.  The project is therefore the result of co-operation between the consortium and its partners, and its design and structure reflect this co-operation in terms of the organisation and management of the project, in terms of the selection and preparation of the participants, the supervision of the mobilities, the evaluation, certification and validation of the skills acquired, and the dissemination of the results.

The operational objectives will be a superior knowledge of the relationship between the sensory dominance, the development of multisensory perception and the occupational area; exploring, experimentation and creation of methods/ exercises of testing the basic dominant system, of developing the sensory culture and of occupational guidance; the development of proactive behavior by designing and applying two programmes: Smart teaching and Smart career guidance.We planned a 11 day mobility activity at Voronet which will involve 31 youth workers. They will attend a training course on the topic of (multi)sensory learning and occupational guidance. The methods were chosen according to the objectives of the project and to the expected results of the training.

The youth workers will have the necessary competences to council the youngsters on the basis of the sensory culture, the youth will have a bigger chance to get involved in (multi)sensory learning activities and choose correctly their job/to develop the proper business, the organizations will enrich their area of expertise and educational offer, and a proactive behaviour towards the occupational guidance on the basis of multisensory culture will be developed.SCOP anticipates a significant impact. At the local level the participant organizations will be able to have a positive influence upon the youth work by putting into act the occupational counselling program designed during the course. At least 100 youths will be counselled in the occupational area on short term and on long term this number will grow. SCOP will sensitise the nonformal and formal educational systems as well as other interested educational actors in order to develop common actions and programs of occupational counceling.

In these conditions, gadgets addiction is installing very easily, especially among the youngsters. The causes are diverse: the society consumerism model, the stress, the need of freedom, control and self-trust, moments of existential crisis, or helplessness in changing the course of things. On long term, the effects of gadgets addiction are the dysfunction of movement abilities and biorhythm, a lower ability of self-control, the decrease of self-esteem, hyperactivity, exhaustion, loneliness, depression, anxiety, the decrease of focus ability, psychosis. At school level, missing classes, low school results and school dropout are alarming.Either it is a behavioral problem (according to the common point of view) or an illness (as many doctors and researchers in neurology state), opportunities for these youngsters or their families to receive help must be created. The help we can offer is an educational one. This is a reason why 15 organizations (NGOs, schools, parents associations, from 12 European countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain and United Kingdom) conceived the project \u201cGadget addiction in teenaged\u201d, whose goal is to familiarize 30 youth workers with a non-formal educational \u201ctherapy\u201d so as to be able to help the gadgets addicted teenagers find alternative solutions to their problem.GATE objectives are: developing the knowledge in the field of gadgets addiction, finding out and experimenting solutions used in psychology/ psychotherapy which exist in a non-formal education or can be adapted to it, creating non-formal solutions (activities, exercises, instruments) to diminish the gadget addiction problem, planning and applying a Support-programme at local level for teenagers and their families/ community which will consist in informing and raising awareness of the community, creating GAF-Net (Gadget Addiction Free Network), educational counseling activities.

There are youth groups in different organisations that are very interested tin meeting young people from other countries and seeing and learning how do they live their daily lives. Especially for young people placed away from home and living in an institution, it is very hard to find a way to do this. In some instances, it is impossible. Through Euromet \u2013 an alliance for European child protection organisations -we have gathered nine youth groups from seven different countries for this exchange.\r\n\r\nThe concrete goal of this exchange is to find out how European young people feel about nature and its\u2019 importance. The idea of a nature-centered exchange was started by the youth group of the organizing organization. The other groups see this as a good idea as well. The young people especially want to learn how to survive in the wild and how to preserve nature. In setting their own goals for the exchange the young people emphasize that they want to find out how the everyday life is in other countries, what do people do in their free time, what do they eat and what are the for example the salaries like. The young people also would like to find out about the lives of other young people in similar circumstances as themselves, i.e. young people in child protection services. One of the wishes of the youth groups is that there should be a joint project for the whole exchange, one that would leave a permanent mark.\r\n\r\nNature is the Future is a youth exchange between nine European youth groups. The members of the groups are, or have been, in child protection services or need other kinds of support to face their daily challenges. Most of the young people attending live in closed institutions, some of them live in foster homes and some of them are in after care. They have different kind of challenges in their lives. Some of them have faced domestic violence, substance misuse and mental health problems. Some of them have experienced violent and other crime as perpetrators and/or victims. Some of them also have learning difficulties, problems in controlling their behavior and anxiety in social situations. 49 young people will be attending the exchange. Because of the background of the young people and legislation and court decisions concerning the young people there are also relatively many adults present in the exchange. Altogether 79 persons will be attending the exchange. The exchange will happen 19.9.2017 \u2013 23.9.2017 (+travel). The preparatory meeting will be held at 18.3.2017 (+travel).\r\n\r\nThe working methods used in the mobility project are games, playful contests, discussions, teamwork and learning languages through games. Young people will learn important skills in surviving in the wilderness: how to make a fire, how to navigate in nature, what you can eat and what you cannot. As the youth groups wished, there will be a joint project that leaves a permanent mark in the world for the whole exchange. One of the possibilities is the troll path near the venue where the exchange is held, we could build trolls or totems.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the young people attending will get empirical experience about the importance of nature. We hope that the attendees experience the positive mental and physical effects of nature. We also get information on about how young people feel about nature in different parts of Europe. The young people will gain knowledge on how people live around Europe, and especially how do young people in similar circumstances as themselves live. For some even traveling outside their own country is an experience that gives them readiness to act in unfamiliar situations.\r\n\r\nA sense of community and participation in the actions of the exchange give the young people resources to act in new situations. Spending time together, getting to know new young people and adults from different countries creates a possibility for friendships and cooperation.

The theme of the project is supporting young people in vulnerable positions. It is a cooperation between two European organisations that work with and support young people belonging to this target group. \r\n\r\nThe theme is adressed via three sub-themes. These sub-themes are: Education, Employment and Justice.  Both organisation see that these are fundamental themes when supporting young people belonging to the target group of the project. Low levels of education or the lack of formal education altogether predict poor progress in the working life, problems with ones livelihood and also poor mental and physical health. If the young person does not get into the working life, the opportunities to support him/herself diminish and prolonged unemployment leads into all kind of problems.  If the young person gets in trouble with the law as a perpetrator of crimes, that predicts unemployment and a lack of prospects. Problems in these beforementioned themes can lead to a point where the young person feels as he/she is outside of the rest of the society and has no power over his/hers own affairs. These are complicated and interwoven affairs, where problems in one sector can lead to problems in other sectors too.\r\n\r\nBut. We can also turn this upside down (or downside up in this matter). If the young person completes an education that suits him/her, the possibilities of employment improve and the likelihood of committing crimes diminishes. Likewise, if a young person finds employment his/her financial situation improves and the possibilities of getting an education improve. If the young person can stop doing crime, the possibilities for getting an education or finding work improve dramatically. There are many possibilities in helping young people in vulnerable positions.\r\n\r\nThe project is a study visit that will be actualized from 28th to 30th of March (plus travel days). The action part of the project will last for three days and there will be twelve Finnish youth workers visiting the English partner. There is a theme for every action day and these themes are Education, Employment and Justice. During these days the sending organisation will get to know operations that support young people in vulnerable positions. \r\n\r\nIn this project we are looking for new ways of working and new ways of thinking about how we can work with and support young people in vulnerable positions. This a very important topic on a time when youth unemployment is high and some of young people feel like they are outside of the society. It is essential for democratic and cohesive societies that all of the members of the society feel like they are a part of that society and that they also feel like they have genuine possibilities in influencing their own affairs. Through this project we gain new insights on how it is possible to help young people with participatory and community-centered methods.\r\n\r\nNew ways of  thinking are really important at the moment in Finland and in Europe as well. The Finnish social and health sector is going through a complete overhaul and there is a need to find new ways of supporting young people in vulnerable positions.

This is why teenagers, more than other ages, need a healthy nutritional style. At the same time, they are the persons who, very often, have bad eating habits and are most exposed to the risk of eating disorders, because they don\u2019t usually feel confortable enough with themselves. The unhealthy alimentary eating style (which leads towards overweight, obesity, anoxeria, bulimia, binge eating), becomes a habit and it associates very serious physical and psychological problems which, in extreme cases, can lead to death. More than other ages, teenagers need support for giving up the excess and disorder in eating and for preventing the eating disorders.\r\n\r\nThe project Disordered Eating and Eating Disorders (DEED) aims the development of the youth workers\u2019 competences and key-abilities in the field of nutritional culture through a training course run with the means of nonformal education so as to be able to support teenagers to increase the quality of their lives. \r\nWe established the following operational objectives of the project which address a main target group ( 30 youth workers from 15 organization from 13 countries: 11 Programme Countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Italy, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain and UK) and 2 Partner Countries (Albania, Armenia): empowering a profound knowledge of nutritional problems in order to motivate the teenagers to give up the unhealthy eating habits and to prevent the eating disorders, developing the competences in youth work by learning and experimenting alternative solutions (nonformal methods/ exercises/ learning activities; basic entrepreneurship) to support teenagers\u2019 healthy eating habits, the development of a proactive attitude and behavior by designing and applying a support-programme, YES (I Eat Smart!) in the local communities, which will involve other interested actors (family \u2013 friends- teachers/ collegues \u2013 psychologist \u2013 nutritionist).\r\n\r\nWe planned one mobility activity which will be run for eleven days at Voronet, Gura-Humorului, Romania, in May 2017.\r\n\r\nThe methods were chosen according to the particularities and objectives of the project, the expected learning results and the eterogenous age of the participants. They are specific to nonformal education and will develop the trainees\u2019 creativity and involvement: knowledge and trust exercises, reflection exercises; a lecture, PP presentations; open space, round table, workshops, learning caf\u00e9; roles play, simulations; watching short movies; study visits; trip; designing and editing a miniguide CODE, an informative and raising awareness material, a movie and a blog.\r\n\r\nBoth on short and long term, significant results will be reached: youth workers will gain the necessary competences for helping teenagers to develop a nutritional culture; organizations which will enlarge their expertise area and educational offer; communities will develop a proactive behavior towards the teenagers with alimentary problems.\r\n\r\nDEED project forsees a significant impact upon different target-groups. At the local level, the participant organizations will positively influence the youth work by applying a support program for teenagers with alimentary problems.

The ambition of the two-year, 120-ECTS programme is to: (a) Reflect the contemporary issues of global journalism, the new technological possibilities as well as different areas of journalism research; (b) Explore the way in which changes in global technology, politics, economics and business and culture, have impacted upon the profession of journalism; (c) Combine theory and practice to produce a more global analytical journalism fit for the changed media environment (including internships). This Consortium is currently offering a joint degree that attracts around 400 applicants of which we enrol 80 high-quality global students. Based on a solid structure of cooperation we aim to move the scheme forward to be a global benchmark in terms of both teaching and research. Three pathways have been identified for this: (1) the development of collaborative research projects in close cooperation with relevant industries and actors and incorporating these projects into the delivery of central course elements; (2) the establishment of a series of innovation workshops or incubator hubs bringing together the industry, students and staff in order to develop new ideas about journalism in a global setting; (3) the development of innovative cross-cultural teaching methods and their integration into the programme. To reach these goals we will launch three joint initiatives: a Global Journalism Research Centre; a Global Journalism Ideas Generator and a Global Multicultural Teaching Benchmarker. These initiatives, anchored in three distinct bodies under the Board of Studies, will facilitate the further development and integration of research, industry links and cross-cultural teaching. Our capacity to reach these goals is verified by experiences gained from ten years of successfully dealing with the issues of developing an integrated scheme and joint degrees. A substantial part of this success is linked to the development of an efficient and transparent governance structure for the joint degrees. Looking forward we will build our new three new initiatives on research from the partners, experiences from the media industry as well as the global network of over 400 alumni.

The project builds strongly on the shared experience with these colleges over time and incorporates several innovative elements to improve the student experience: evolved preparation especially language preparation; enhanced and innovative selection processes; longitudinal integration with academic curriculum to embed the experience within the academic career of the students and provide for continued experience in Tenerife and elsewhere.  The latter achieved through development of international collaborations particularly in the tourism sector which bring together both college partners and critically their students and organisations in Tenerife in long term promotional activities.\r\n\r\n The work placements provide opportunities for complementary sector-specific training unavailable to students in the UK but readily accessible in Tenerife.  The roles include working as research guides on whale watching boats, giving talks to tourists on nature and cultural activities in Tenerife, working at the Visitor Centre in Puerto Colon, with animal rescue centres and shelters, liaising with tour operators and hotel groups, developing contacts with specialist culture, nature and activity tourism providers on a local level and supporting them in accessing the global tourist market, both in Tenerife and through the internet.\r\n\r\nStudents receive comprehensive pre-departure training in the UK and in-country orientation on arrival in Tenerife and receive pastoral support throughout the mobility to ensure success. \r\n\r\nSignificantly, the students will gain relevant subject-specific knowledge and practical experience that is directly relevant to their formal programmes of study and have exposure to alternative work environments and processes that are unavailable to them in the UK.  \r\n\r\nMany of the students come from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds and generally opportunities for them to gain work experience that provides a broader perspective of the wider world and employment possibilities beyond their immediate region are limited.  The project will add value to their college programmes and aims to support students to broaden their horizons: personally and professionally. \r\n\r\nScholarship funds, set aside by the AWDF to provide ongoing support to students showing particular ability and or enthusiasm, will be deployed to facilitate continued participation where it is perceived to be of value.\r\n\r\nLonger term benefits of participating in this mobility are that, in addition to obtaining work-based skills and knowledge, students will also benefit from an intercultural experience and personal development that strengthens their position in the labour market and their workplace readiness.    \r\n\r\nParticipants will develop personal and professional confidence, an understanding of the labour market in another European country, a set of transferable skills and an international outlook that better prepares them for employment, giving them a competitive edge when seeking employment.   \r\n\r\nThey will also be able to self-accredit on a special qualification for the European labour market, \u2018TransCSR\u2019, which recognises corporate social responsibility within the tourism industry.

The latter achieved through development of international collaborations particularly in the tourism sector which bring together both college partners and critically their students and organisations in Tenerife in long term promotional activities.\r\n\r\n The work placements provide opportunities for complementary sector-specific training unavailable to students in the UK but readily accessible in Tenerife.  The roles include working as research guides on whale watching boats, giving talks to tourists on nature and cultural activities in Tenerife, working at the Visitor Centre in Puerto Colon, with animal rescue centres and shelters, liaising with tour operators and hotel groups, developing contacts with specialist culture, nature and activity tourism providers on a local level and supporting them in accessing the global tourist market, both in Tenerife and through the internet.\r\n\r\nStudents receive comprehensive pre-departure training in the UK and in-country orientation on arrival in Tenerife and receive pastoral support throughout the mobility to ensure success. \r\n\r\nSignificantly, the students will gain relevant subject-specific knowledge and practical experience that is directly relevant to their formal programmes of study and have exposure to alternative work environments and processes that are unavailable to them in the UK.  \r\n\r\nMany of the students come from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds and generally opportunities for them to gain work experience that provides a broader perspective of the wider world and employment possibilities beyond their immediate region are limited.  The project will add value to their college programmes and aims to support students to broaden their horizons: personally and professionally. \r\n\r\nScholarship funds, set aside by the AWdF to provide ongoing support to students showing particular ability and or enthusiasm, will be deployed to facilitate continued participation where it is perceived to be of value.\r\n\r\nLonger term benefits of participating in this mobility are that, in addition to obtaining work-based skills and knowledge, students will also benefit from an intercultural experience and personal development that strengthens their position in the labour market and their workplace readiness.    \r\n\r\nParticipants will develop personal and professional confidence, an understanding of the labour market in another European country, a set of transferable skills and an international outlook that better prepares them for employment, giving them a competitive edge when seeking employment.   \r\n\r\nThey will also be able to self-accredit on a special qualification for the European labour market, \u2018TransCSR\u2019, which recognises corporate social responsibility within the tourism industry. Additionally, participation will provide two UCAS point for university applicants.\r\n\r\nThrough participation in the mobility project, colleges will have the opportunity to develop long term relationships with host organisations in Spain, with whom they can work to develop closer ties and possibly expand the fields in which mobility opportunities are offered. From a college perspective also, the programme will enhance their course offerings making them more marketable to potential students.\r\n\r\nAt a local and regional level, this provides young people with an enhanced training programme, providing them with experience they could never gain in local work placements, and thereby a better chance of attaining employment in the sector.  It supports drives to reduce youth unemployment and build the confidence and capacity of young people.\r\n\r\nThe anticipated impact for participating host partners is their European networks and international outlook will be developed and strengthened, so they are able to offer similar opportunities to future students and are more engaged and connected to the European labour market.", "http://www.candi.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-046941_4"], ["0HB", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "CITY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON", 198849.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.city.ac.uk ", "CITY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-047067_coordinator"], ["1NG", "Transforming Educational Practice in Autism: enhancing the skills, knowledge and understanding of teachers in the UK, Italy and Greece.", "Autism Education Trust", 353679.0, "With rising numbers of children and young people being diagnosed on the autism spectrum, there is a pressing need to i) increase the awareness, knowledge and skills of the school work force and ii) improve the capacity of settings to meet the needs of children with autism. The objectives of this project are therefore to cohere a strategic partnership of researchers, policy and practitioner organisations in the UK, Greece and Italy to i) share educational practices in the vocational education and training (VET) of teachers who work with children with autism aged between 5 and 10; ii)  develop the skills, knowledge and understanding of educational professionals in each country; iii) adapt a UK programme professional development programme  in a manner that enables the development of ecologically valid materials  for these educational contexts and standards of practice; iv) create a framework for international collaboration and a method of delivery that can be applied to other countries to research/evaluate and develop their own educational practice in autism and to v) create a website with Open Educational Resources developed from the project to support the education of children with autism internationally. There are six partners in this project, consisting of Universities, non profit organisations, a school district and a private creative agency. These partners recognise the importance of strong links between higher education, the policy community and school practitioners. They will work together through planned regular communications and activities such as project meetings; seminars and workshops with policy makers and practitioners; and conferences in each partner country to jointly develop and deliver a range of training resources. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will reflect and build on current autism VET training programmes in the partner countries, and will specifically draw on the experience and expertise developed through the creation of the AET partnership programme, which is the largest ever face-to-face autism training scheme for schools across England. This programme was developed through an innovative partnership model that included individuals on the autism spectrum and a creative agency, all of whom developed a shared ethos and a vision for autism education, which linked the public, private and voluntary sector together. It has received excellent evaluation, with clear evidence of enhancing the knowledge, understanding and practice of autism practitioners (Cullen et al., 2013). We will establish a similar professional development programme in Italy and Greece consisting of three levels of training in autism education for school staff; a set of Quality Indicators for self-evaluation by settings and a Competency Framework to enable professionals to plan their Continuous Professional Development. This programme will aim to show i) sensitivity to the local and national delivery context, ii) have a sense of shared ownership, and iii) will provide the basis for further organic development. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy learning from the processes and experiences of the AET programme, this partnership will employ an innovative and participatory methodology that integrates the use of ICT in novel ways.

We will carefully examine the UK partnership model and analyse how it has been delivered to over 27,000 people since February 2012 in over 100 local authorities in England. We then consider whether aspects of this methodology can be employed to the development of similar professional development programmes in Greece and Italy and to the construction of a website with Open Educational Resources, which will be targeted at school staff who work with children with autism internationally. Through an iterative developmental approach involving feedback from training deliverers and other stakeholders throughout the creation of the materials, we will ensure that all content is clear and accessible, and relevant to the local educational context and practitioners in partner countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe anticipate positive and long lasting effects on participant organisations and policy systems as well as on the individuals directly or indirectly involved in the project.

In the vision paper on open education 2030 J. M. Pawlowski stated that education is\r\n\r\ndistributed on a global market. Therefore, he argued it is crucial for Europe to engage a broad\r\n\r\ncommunity in cross-border collaboration to be successful in this field. In the vision paper \u00b4Open\r\n\r\nEducation 2030\u00b4 he comes up with six recommendations: (see Pawlowski, p. 78)\r\n\r\n1. to create an inventory of OER and OEP\r\n\r\n2. to integrate existing communities\r\n\r\n3. to integrate curricula\r\n\r\n4. to create regional networks\r\n\r\n5. to create global outreach programs\r\n\r\n6. to support open education policy building !\r\n\r\nOne aim is, that like in a huge store, online learning resources and open learning should be\r\n\r\nprovided all over Europe for free. Although it is a big chance to make education available for a\r\n\r\nbroad European group of interested learners, teachers, and trainers, there is no quality assurance\r\n\r\nof the courses, learning resources, and open measures.\r\n\r\nPedagogical material and education will be risky, if there are no standards to make sure that the\r\n\r\ncontent is correct and didactically well-prepared concerning the aims of the project, the didactical\r\n\r\nmethods, the structure, the level of difficulty, the provided information and tasks as well as\r\n\r\nconcerning the needs of the target groups. In former educational concepts experts were\r\n\r\nresponsible to design the curriculum, courses and the learning materials.\r\n\r\nNowadays, with unstructured and widely varying creation of content we have to create standards\r\n\r\nand guidelines to ensure these quality aspects and foster quality to fight social disadvantages,\r\n\r\nwhich can occur via wrong, unstructured or misleading information and knowledge. Especially\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged and marginalised groups in European society can suffer from misleading\r\n\r\ninformation due to the fact that they face lots of challenges. For example it might be possible that\r\n\r\nthey have fewer chances to identify problems and quality deficits of provided open educational\r\n\r\nresources themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is the point where EU-StORe comes into action. It is based on the recommendations of\r\n\r\nPawlowski and the EU and builds an inventory of online learning resources. Moreover, experts\r\n\r\nanalyse these materials and courses and create standards for open learning activities, which\r\n\r\nprovide a high quality. This leads to guidelines and standards that can be used (a) to create open\r\n\r\nlearning scenarios in the future and (b) to rate existing open learning activities and resources. To\r\n\r\nintegrate this information in the European learning community the standards are provided on an\r\n\r\nonline platform where the inventory is also accessible.

The challenge facing the world today is to make education meaningful and more inclusive to this set of young people around the globe (UNICEF). Education is widely recognized as one of the most critical means of defeating the challenges of development.  However, the focus is on rote learning and the education system does not actively encourage students to think on their own and take on responsibilities. It neglects the importance of developing a creative mindset among children, which means that the significance of education as a tool for personal development is severely hampered by such a form of education. Although report of European Commission's Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry states that entrepreneurship is included in the national curricula for vocational education in a majority of European countries, at least to some extent, the report also points out programmes and activities included in those figures differ greatly in intensity and effectiveness and the general perception that there is still a gap to be filled. .

This is particularly true in post-secondary education and research. It is therefore surprising that the level of information literacy of students is low in many cases, as existing studies (some of them conducted at the University of Graz and University of Zadar) report.There might be several explanations for this: In many cases college curricula do not include content aiming at the development of information literacy. Often libraries are involved in teaching information literacy, in some cases academics embed some information literacy elements in their courses. However, since the concept of information literacy is widely unknown outside the information science community, a broad basis that can be used in courses but also by teachers and students on their own should be provided. Accordingly, the main outcome of our project will be a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) for developing information literacy focusing on higher education students. A MOOC will provide opportunities for a very broad audience. MOOCs are online courses with no entry barriers aiming at unlimited participation. As open source software solutions are available for MOOCs, the project can focus on developing the content of the course and the accompanying research. Although information literacy consists also of subject-specific elements (for instance, different disciplines usually use different information resources), our MOOC will concentrate on information literacy elements which are relevant for all subjects/disciplines. Examples for such general information literacy elements are Boolean operators, basic principles in knowledge organization, or basic knowledge in copyright law. Accordingly, the first main task of the project will be the joint agreement on the detailed (non-subject specific) content of the MOOC. After having agreed on the content, the MOOC will be implemented in five (six) languages (English, German, Spanish and Catalan, Slovenian and Croatian). Addressing three of the largest language groups in Europe, the MOOC will be available to many citizens with different native languages. Moreover, it will be one of the first MOOCs available in Slovenian and Croatian and as such provide a new innovative model for MOOC development in these two languages/countries. The fact that we will start the implementation in the different languages after having agreed on the common content, will enable us to investigate cultural and language specific differences of the various realizations. Research findings stress the existence of different learning and teaching styles in different cultural and linguistic environments. At the moment research on addressing these factors with MOOCs developed in several languages is lacking.Currently, there are already several information literacy teaching materials available on the internet. However, probably one of the main shortcomings of these information literacy courses is that they usually do not provide (self-) assessments. Therefore, a central innovative approach of our MOOC will be the implementation of technology based assessment components. Right now,  lecturers and librarians who teach information literacy skills are investing resources in creating very similar materials on topics such as Boolean operators or plagiarism that could be built and shared collaboratively. The MOOC would allow them to take advantage of the economies of scale by using a common tool useful for all of them.As mentioned above, information literacy also covers subject-specific elements. For instance, there are other information resources relevant for business administration than for medicine.

Dramatic changes in work structures and social organization have occurred that are placing demands on adults to rethink their careers on an on-going basis. Added to this, are current EU policies that emphasize the need for continuous education for future economic and social mobility in an increasingly competitive global environment.The ACUMEN project consortium are of the opinion that traditional career guidance, although still relevant and important as a school-based or institution-based service, is wholly unsuitable to meet the needs of adults already in the workforce and that there is a considerable gap in the market for freely available and easily accessible career management training resources to help adults take control of their own career trajectory. Career management is a continuous process that occurs throughout one's career and not just at discrete times. It may be helpful to think of career management as a philosophy and set of habits that enable adults achieve career goals and develop career resiliency. Career management skills are like 'labour market literacy'. Adults in the workforce who have developed the necessary skills should be able to assess where the labour market is going; consider new skill areas that are appropriate to their own strengths and preferences; develop a personalized learning plan and map-out their career pathway to sustainable and rewarding work based on an understanding of potential future skill needs. Successful career management is accomplished through regular habits of building relationships, engaging in career development conversations, updating your career development plan, and setting new goals as life and career needs change. Being proficient at career management also means possessing basic skills related to job searching and managing change in a resilient manner.The Career Management Skills Framework for Scotland, published in July 2012, describes career management skills set around 4 themes of Self; Strengths; Horizons; Networks. This framework will be the basis for the ACUMEN project and consortium partners will develop a complete suite of tools and resources that address each of the above themes and support adults within the workforce or those seeking employment to identify an appropriate career progression pathway. The ACUMEN project will develop these new resources for adult learners in the UK, Ireland, Cyprus, Italy, Austria, Czech Republic, Germany and Finland. It will be the first project to comprehensively address career management skills in a European context and will provide tools and resources that are localized to meet the needs of adult learners in each partner country.

The DipE was designed almost 20 years ago and is missing elements of education that lead to lifelong learning. Therefore, pillars 2 and 3 bring innovations to optometic education, enhancing the standard even further, beyond DipE.
