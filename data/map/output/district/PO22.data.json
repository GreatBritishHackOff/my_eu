It will also take advantage of the positive results of TransNEW and MARKET-UP FP7 projects and, to avoid duplication of efforts, will make use of existing data and information, collaborating with the TRKC (Transport Knowledge Research Centre) and CORDIS PS.\nThe overall objective of ETNA Plus is to foster innovation in trans-national cooperation in Transport with a focus on promoting the active participation of new actors and regions in EU research calls and projects. Transport NCPs will be key players in this mechanism, but their role will be complemented and enhanced thanks to the contribution of other relevant stakeholders, which will bring to the project a real added value both in terms of knowledge and expertise.\nETNA Plus will also seek the active involvement of 56 Associated Partners (APs) nominated officially as Transport NCPs.\nETNA Plus will target transnational cooperation through different activities, following a two-fold approach; on one side, specific initiatives to raise awareness on the EU transport R&I landscape will be carried out, on the other side, efforts to improve the level of expertise on EU funding (e.g. Horizon 2020) will be undertaken both at NCP and researcher level.\nTo this end, the proposal foresees: the development of a web tool on EU funding opportunities, both public and private; an analysis of innovation strategies implemented in the industrialized Countries; the support to stakeholders to build trans-national consortia and the reinforcement of Transport NCPs\u2019 and researchers\u2019 expertise through ad hoc training and twinning measures; networking with other initiatives relevant to transport R", 141706.0, 1503221.0, "ETNA PLUS", "Working together on transportation", "A follow-up EU project furthers international cooperation on transportation, inviting new players to the dialogue.

A successor project is building on ETNA's achievements and expanding the former goals to reflect new priorities set by Europe\u00a02020 and the Innovation Union.\n\nThe follow-up project is the EU-funded 'European transport network alliance' (http://www.transport-ncps.net (ETNA PLUS)) . The ambition is to foster innovation in transnational cooperation in the transportation sector, focusing on promoting participation of new actors and regions in EU projects. The 19-member initiative began in 2013 and will conclude in June 2015.\n\nConsortium members have designed and implemented a searchable web-based tool, enabling users to identify relevant transportation research and funding sources. The tool contains appropriate information, drawn from existing databases. Testing has also been performed.\n\nThe research identified the innovation strategies of various industrialised countries, listing respective weaknesses and strengths. Country reports have been drafted based on the results of this work.\n\nProject members helped national/regional research stakeholders identify and link with new partners for participation in new projects planned under Horizon\u00a02020. The work tailored the IDEALIST partner search system to a transportation purpose. ETNA PLUS also organised several brokerage activities in conjunction with other EU groups.\n\nThe project's input to professional development includes 11 factsheets and 2 training sessions. A training accreditation procedure was created, intended for the establishment of a body of certified trainers who will train researchers and other stakeholders. A selection procedure has been agreed upon.\n\nDissemination includes development of communication materials, two periodic newsletters and an overhaul of the previous project's website. The project has organised several events to date.\n\nETNA PLUS will result in greater innovation in transnational transportation.

ETNA will facilitate the improvement of the overall quality of NCP services across Europe in the area of transport \u2013 thereby making future calls more accessible for all stakeholders and contributing to an improvement in the average quality of proposals submitted. This will be accomplished by carrying out a series of well-coordinated tasks and measures. The project will benchmark the activities of the Transport NCPs with the goal of identifying best practice and pinpointing existing weaknesses within the NCP network. Identified weaknesses will then be addressed by a multifaceted training programme aiming at efficient eradication of deficits and an overall improvement of the performance of NCPs \u2013 on both the individual and network levels. ETNA will also develop effective tools and activities for the entire Transport NCP network aimed at raising awareness about the network and the services it offers as well as increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of efforts to support potential participants in their search for qualified partners. Finally, the project will work to improve contacts and communication with other networks and organisations with the ultimate goal of securing a sustainable flow of information of benefit to the European transport research community.
