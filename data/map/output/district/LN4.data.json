Our school is organised into 14 classes with 2 classes in each year group.  The majority of our children are of White British ethnicity and a significant number of our children are \u2018forces families\u2019 with one or more parent serving in the Royal Air Force. With such a high proportion of \u2018forces families\u2019 mobility of our children is quite high. We are a Church of England school and have strong links with our local church and community. The Church School values we teach the children are the foundations to our school and underpin our curriculum. \r\n\r\nOver the last three years our school have grown in size and we have experienced a high volume of staffing changes. The school has generous grounds but due to these staffing changes are not being used to their full potential to impact on learning for the children. Our Senior Leaders are concerned that although we have a new and well designed outdoor learning area, few of our staff are confident to use it to encourage learning. Additionally, 50% of our teaching staff are within the first 3 years of their careers, the chance to train in different teaching methods and strategies which would encourage them to use the resources we have available with greater impact on pupil outcomes. To benefit our pupils, we need to increase the flexibility, creativity and confidence that \r\nour staff have when  approaching  their teaching.\r\n\r\nObjective 1: To lead and deliver a creative curriculum within our school.\r\nObjective 2: To develop teacher confidence and proficiency in leading outdoor learning.\r\nObjective 3: To increase the language proficiency within our school to fully meet the needs of the curriculum. \r\n\r\nTo meet our objectives, we will send 7 of our learning leaders to Sweden and to Portugal on outdoor learning courses. This will allow them to learn new strategies in different educational settings, which can be used in our school. These strategies will then be delivered as in school training and twilight sessions to the rest of our teaching staff. In addition, we will send 7 teachers in the first year of our project to France during October half term on French immersion courses.  The French Immersion Course providers have been offering similar training for teachers from London, Essex and Warrington for several years and they have been recommended by British Council Ambassadors supporting our school.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this training by 2019 we aim to have a creative curriculum, which all children in school can access and benefit from. Our staff will feel more confident in delivering creative lessons and will have gained experience in different teaching strategies and methods to employ within their own lessons. All children will be able to regularly participate in outdoor learning, which compliments the teaching of the national curriculum and makes the most of our new outdoor environments. We also expect evaluations to show that our  teaching of French has much improved and that as a school, we have not only a much more confident and creative approach to learning but that we have significantly increased our reputation as a  learning school with a Global outlook.", "http://www.coningsbyprimary.co.uk", "Coningsby St Michaels C of E Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036015_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LN4"}
