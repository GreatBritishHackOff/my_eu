The establishment of Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks and installing Offshore Wind Farms (OWF) are important ways to achieve these goals. The protection and management of marine biodiversity has focused on placing MPAs in areas important for biodiversity. This has proved successful within the MPAs, but had little impact beyond their boundaries. In the highly populated Mediterranean and the Black Seas, bordered by many range states, the declaration of extensive MPAs is unlikely at present, so limiting the bearing of protection. The establishment of MPAs networks can cope with this obstacle but, to be effective, such networks must be based on solid scientific knowledge and properly managed (not merely \u201cpaper parks\u201d). OWF, meanwhile, must be placed where the winds are suitable for producing power, but they should not have any significant impact on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, or on human activities. The project will have two main themes:\n1 - identify prospective networks of existing or potential MPAs in the Mediterranean and the Black Seas, shifting from a local perspective (centred on single MPAs) to the regional level (network of MPAs) and finally the basin scale (network of networks). The identification of the physical and biological connections among MPAs will elucidate the patterns and processes of biodiversity distribution. Measures to improve protection schemes will be suggested, based on maintaining effective exchanges (biological and hydrological) between protected areas. The national coastal focus of existing MPAs will be widened to both off shore and deep sea habitats, incorporating them into the networks through examination of current legislation, to find legal solutions to set up transboundary MPAs.\n2 - explore where OWF might be established, producing an enriched wind atlas both for the Mediterranean and the Black Seas. OWF locations will avoid too sensitive habitats but the possibility for them to act as stepping-stones through MPAs, without interfering much with human activities, will be evaluated.\nSocioeconomic studies employing ecosystem services valuation methods to develop sustainable approaches for both MPA and OWF development will also be carried out, to complement the ecological and technological parts of the project, so as to provide guidelines to design, manage and monitor networks of MPAs and OWF.

COCONET will also produce a wind atlas of both basins in preparation for establishing OWFs in the MPA networks.\n\nThe project started by analysing whether MPA networks will be feasible in these seas, based on literature reviews, workshops and interviews.  Researchers also looked at the environmental impact of OWFs and how to minimise it.\n\nMPA networks offer improved biodiversity conservation; therefore, project partners are identifying a set of locations that are connected with each other, sharing common ecosystem features.

The iCIRRUS C-RAN introduces the use of Ethernet in the fronthaul/midhaul (for radio signal transport), to minimise cost and make available pluggable and in-device monitoring, and intelligent processing to enable self-optimizing network functions which maximise both network resource utilisation and energy efficiency. To exemplify the attractiveness of the proposition, iCIRRUS focusses on D2D communication in the wireless domain, an important work area in current standardisation, where low latency is known to be a significant factor. The latency and jitter in the iCIRRUS Ethernet-based C-RAN will be an important focus of the research work in the project, with current 5G performance targets in mind; for D2D communications, the task will be to minimise control latency and overhead. A major obstacle for C-RANs is the bit-rate of the digitised radio signals that would be required for 5G \u2013 of the order of 100 Gb/s and iCIRRUS will examine the architectural and technological questions surrounding this requirement. Wireless resource management will be investigated, together with mobile device caching and mm-wave D2D mesh networks, to reduce latency as well as load on the infrastructure. Finally, the intelligent network functions in ICIRRUS can interact with mobile cloud processing, and further offloads of infrastructure communications can be realised through virtualising mobiles in the cloud as clones, and performing communication tasks between clones.", 338709.0, 3079332.0, "iCIRRUS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_194215_945047818"], ["5RE", "Datacenter EURECA Project", "Data Centre Alliance Limited", "The EURECA project tackles the lack of knowledge and awareness of how to identify and procure environmentally sound and greener data centres.

The progress achieved so far reassure us the path we have taken is on the correct diretion  as it is responding positively to the quality and prestige needs detected, as reflected in our Strategic Plan 2015-2020. Connecting with schools, professionals and companies from other European countries, especially Italy, France and the UK, is encouraging BELE to have a bigger and better presence in the sector. \r\nThe initiatives taken in the line of student and teacher mobility through KA102 actions and the strategic partnerships carried out with other European organizations through the KA202, are leading us to improvement and innovation, creation and transmission of knowledge, demonstration of our work and the recognition of our training quality. Today we can say that thanks to all this the training of our students is better, as it is their recognition abroad, promoting their employability. \r\nWe are knitting a network of relationships between professionals, training centers and companies, based on the reliance among the people responsible for them,as we share the same interests on improvement and growth, quality and efficiency, favoring the sector and improvement of the response to the market needs.
