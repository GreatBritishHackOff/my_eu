CASAGRAS2 provides the necessary conduit for taking the next steps in international collaboration.CASAGRAS2 identifies a much broader base for international cooperation, with partners from Brazil, mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia and USA. The European partners are from Belgium, France, Germany, Russia and the UK. CASAGRAS2 also identifies a group of experts to participate in the project that will target stakeholders based in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, China, Denmark, Germany, India, Italy, Korea, Netherlands, USA and Russia.The coordination and support action plan for CASAGRAS2 draws upon the outcomes of CASAGRAS1 and the recommendations that specifically align with the targets identified in Objective ICT-2009-1.3: ICT Internet of Things and Enterprise environment. Moreover, it seeks to contribute to the European research cluster for IoT development represented by CERP-IoT, offering an important holistic input characterised by the generic nature of the work packages in respect of architecture, identification and data capture protocols, applications and services framework, R&amp;D roadmap, education and training and the important multi-dimensional features of governance; all with respect to international deliberation. Each component of these work package activities will be developed in cooperation with international partners through the international platform work package.

The liberalization is expected to increase competition and thus increase cost-efficiency in energy production, transmission and distribution with the result of decreasing electricity prices. The efforts of Member State governments to create a more competitive and sustainable electricity sector are currently clouded by a major economic downturn in Europe\u00b4s economic activity. Such economic hardship often triggers reluctance to change which is becoming visible in particular in the electricity sector, where measures to protect jobs and national industry start to compete with market liberalization. The affordability of sustainable electricity is questioned.\n\nThere is a strong need for innovative business models for Renewable Energy Source (RES) electricity generation in the long and mid-term because support schemes will fade out in the long term pushing renewables on the market at no marginal costs which then in particular for strongly correlated generation as wind and PV leads to price deterioration during production hours. Already today many Member States have drastically reduced measures to further support the development of the RES sector, so that new investment is not possible without tapping new revenues with new business. \n\nThe aim of the BestRES project is to identify best practices business models for renewable electricity generation in Europe and to improve these further taking into account new opportunities and synergies coming along with changing market designs in line with the EU target model. Business models investigated in this project shall make use of the aggregation of various renewable sources, storage and flexible demand. The improved business models will be implemented during the project in real-life environments, depending on the market conditions, to proof the soundness of the developed concept.", 122156.0, 1715619.0, "BestRES", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_200557_935199893"], ["1HS", "Preventing and responding to conflict: developing EU CIVilian CAPabilities for a sustainable peace", "Transparency Solutions Limited", "The goals of preventing the outbreak of conflict and promoting sustainable peace remain a fundamental challenge to policymakers and analysts alike.

The project will gather, synthesise, further develop and disseminate knowledge and learning on civilian conflict prevention and peacebuilding.

But faced with the failure of the application of traditional methods, what solutions can be found ? And how can we motivate teachers exposed to the failure of a minority of students often relegated to the margins of institutions, even absentees, dropouts and in the end out of school? \r\nIt is not enough to declare that no pupil should be left out: motivation, school dynamics, teamwork and innovative practices will be much more useful.  Great mind openness and constantly renewed mobilization are necessary  to ensure the investment of as many teachers as possible for the success of all students.\r\n\r\nHow do our fellow European countries fight against school dropping ? How do they help the pupils with special needs? Which successful methods can we share? How can we target and fully understand our respective under-achievements?\r\nThese are pivotal questions whose answers will help teachers to enhance the efficiency of their daily teaching practice and professional tasks.\r\n\r\nThis project offers to work on and share these answers as part of the exchange program with the 3 partner-schools. The mobilities (13 teachers or school staffs) will be scheduled on the basis of 4 steps. The training sessions will focus on the exchange of good practice. The dissemination of the tools created will be done not only in the schools but also in the other schools of the basin, in primary schools and lyc\u00e9es, with simple tools (exchanges, PowerPoint, free resources on the internet) and training.\r\n\r\nIn light of the present project, the next step will be a KA2 project (pupils and teachers\u2019 mobilities).
