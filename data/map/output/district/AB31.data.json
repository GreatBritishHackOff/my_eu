Some classes may only have one term a year where they have access to a French specialist so we need to upskill our class teachers so that they have the necessary skills and confidence to teach languages within the classroom.\r\nThis is especially relevant due to the Scottish Government Policy \u20181 + 2 for languages\u2019 which aims to introduce modern languages at an early stage and requires teachers to be using a modern language within the class from P1 \u2013 P7.  \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to increase teacher confidence when teaching French and provide them with appropriate learning and teaching methodologies to embed French into the classroom routine.  Our hopes for the course are for the participating teachers to gain confidence speaking and teaching French through improved language competency and teaching skills.  We hope to improve their methodological expertise and gain new ideas and resources including resources on ICT and the Internet. This new knowledge and skills will then be shared to all other staff members the impact of which will be increased teacher confidence throughout the school and the upskilling of all teachers.  This will also allow Hill of Banchory to embed French as part of everyday school routine.  We also aim to develop a cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary France.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve this we plan to send three members of staff to a LFEE immersion course in Salignac for one week to allow the teachers to gain teaching methodologies, skills and confidence which can be shared throughout the school on their return.  The teachers involved are a teacher currently teaching at second level, another currently teaching at first level and a visiting specialist who teaches at the Banchory cluster schools.  \r\nThe course will allow the teachers to:\r\n\u2022 improve methodological expertise in the teaching of French to young learners\r\n\u2022 be provided with materials and ideas suitable for the teaching of French at primary level\r\n\u2022 develop cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary France\r\n\u2022 improve their use of the Internet and other ICT resources when teaching French\r\nThis will allow the teachers to deliver more relevant and appropriate lessons within the class and allow them to embed the French language within the classroom \u2013 not just in standalone French lessons. \r\n\r\nThe expected impact is that the participating teachers will have greater confidence and ability to teach a foreign language.  They will also have improved teaching methodology which will allow teachers to use French in the classroom more frequently rather than as a stand alone lesson once a week.  The participating teachers will then be mentors to other staff members offering support and ideas to allow colleagues to develop confidence in this area too.  Any resources or ideas that were gathered from the course will be shared to all staff members on the shared drive within school to help learning and teaching throughout the school.  We believe that this will help us to embed French within our school and help us to achieve the target on our School Improvement Plan.  We hope to have more cultural awareness which can be transferred to our pupils through whole class assemblies and learning together sessions.\r\n\r\nOur goal for the end result of this project is to have increased confidence when teaching French for all staff (not just those attending the course) thanks to the sharing of skills and knowledge at stage meetings.  This will then ensure our pupils get a better experience in the classroom \u2013 new ideas and teachers more willing/confident to use French in the classroom - while developing their cultural awareness and knowledge of contemporary France.  Parents will see the improvement in the teaching of French through a parent information session, their child sharing new knowledge at home and through the \u2018sharing the learning\u2019 assemblies.  Cluster schools will also have the option to develop new skills through CPD sessions, the Languages Working group working with Language Ambassadors from cluster schools and our visiting specialist teacher sharing his knowledge.   We have the potential to impact on the 450 pupils at Hill of Banchory School and over a thousand pupils cluster wide while upskilling over 50 teachers.", "http://hillofbanchory.aberdeenshire.sch.uk/", "Hill of Banchory School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035580_coordinator"], ["4EH", "Language Training", "Banchory Primary School", 1888.0, "Banchory Primary School is a state, public funded primary school and nursery. We take children from 3-12 (and vulnerable twos) We also offer enhanced provision which offers an equity of support to all children with additional support needs, to be included in mainstream education. The school has approx 440 pupils and 80 in Nursery. Our vision is of an exceptional and inclusive school where powerful learning is attainable through quality teaching. We aim to provide the best possible education for all learners, enabling them to reach their personal best. As part of our vision, we aim to equip all learners with the knowledge, skills and attributes they require to thrive in a changing and challenging world. We aim to employ digital skills (ipads and social media) to be able to do this. We will make videos of the children learning French and upload to be more widely shared. We will record the pupils and staff teaching classes and the Nursery pupils and share across Aberdeenshire. These will also be uploaded as a teaching resource onto Education Scotland to be more widely disseminated. We aim to be a leading school for language teaching. We aim to increase the children's awareness and positive appreciation of other countries, cultures and embrace the richness of a multi-cultural society.\r\n\r\nAs part of our 2017 strategic plan we aim to ensure that pupils are able to access quality teaching of a second language (French) This also helps us to fulfill our commitment to the government's 1+2 plan.\r\nVision & Aims of Project\r\n1. Language learning is life enhancing. It opens the doors to possibilities and\r\n   experiences which are not available to those who are restricted to the knowledge of\r\n  one language. Learning an additional language also facilitates a deeper\r\n  understanding of the possibilities of language and of communication, including those\r\n  relating to the learner\u2019s mother tongue.\r\n2. We aim to teach the pupils at school, then roll out to cluster schools - our teacher participant will really be a representative for our school, and three other schools. This will increase the sustainability of the project.\r\n3. We already have an online platform training/teaching tool, but this would really bring it to life - to meet the needs of all learners.\r\n4. Potential long term benefits would be increased confidence for P7s during transition to secondary school - raised attainment in MFL.\r\n5. Support from the wider parent forum towards language learning & future capacity of school to meet the needs of the 440 learners.", "http://www.banchory-pri.aberdeenshire.sch.uk/", "Banchory Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035777_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "AB31"}
