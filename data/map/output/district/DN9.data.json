As an example, in some areas boat transit may be fully prohibited, in others fishing and anchorage, in others night anchorage, etc.\nIn order to limit and control the access to restricted areas, very often parks management organisations force users to request for a permit (e.g. daily or weekly, free of charge or not) without which the boats are not allowed to enter the marine park. In compliance with the different ways for accessing the park, also permits are different (e.g. transit and anchorage, shore fishing, sea fishing, scuba diving\u2026).\nThe main objectives of the Meduse Project can be summarised as follows:\na)\tTo develop a prototype service infrastructure for the delivery of location based services within restricted access maritime areas (parks, reserves) to the following customer categories:\ni.\tInstitutional \u2013 Marine parks and restricted marine areas management institutions;\nii.\tPrivate - Marine parks and restricted marine areas users (leisure boats);\niii.\tCommercial \u2013 Commercial operators acting within restricted areas (e.g. cruise boats);\niv.\tLaw Enforcement \u2013 Maritime police authorities (Coast Guard).\nb)\tTo demonstrate a subset of services and applications (with limited functionality) that shall be enabled by the service infrastructure for all the above listed customer categories;\nc)\tTo analyse commercial sustainability of the service infrastructure in order to identify and characterise the critical mass of applications and services that shall bring sustainability and define associated service models towards the different customer categories.", 23064.0, 430140.0, "MEDUSE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.anesti.it", null, "fp7_208252_959144343"], ["3GA", "Innovation Technologies and Applications for Coastal Archaeological sites", "Anesti Limited", "The ITACA (Innovation Technologies and Applications for Coastal Archaeological sites) project aims to prove a management system for underwater archaeological sites in coastal regions.

The resulting data fusion will be processed using shape detection algorithms specific for archaeological items.\n\nThe availability of the above remote sensing data, combined with innovative processing techniques and optimized for archaeological site, enable the provision of a location and monitoring service for underwater archaeological sites in coastal zones.\n\nThe new algorithms, the physical modelling and the computational capabilities will be integrated into the Web-GIS, together with data recorded from surface (2D and 3D modelling) and from underwater surveys.. Additional specific archaeological layers will be included into the WebGIS to facilitate the object identification through shape detection techniques and mapping.\n\nThe system will be verified and validated through an extensive on-ground (sea) campaign carried out with both cutting edge technologies (side-scan sonar, multi beam echo sounder) and traditional means (submarine exploration with professional scuba divers).", 62590.0, 1710356.0, "ITACA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.anesti.it", null, "fp7_188817_959144343"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DN9"}
