Training on entrepreneurial skills and employability skills with work-based training will make young people more employable in Italy and Europe.\r\nThe project also aims to make the participants more modern, innovative, flexible and attractive to the labor market. This formal, non-formal and work based training, triggers positive changes in terms of self-esteem, language skills, flexibility and organizational skills.\r\n\r\nThe project tackles the reduction of  young people being unemployment and gives the participants entrepreneurial skills increasingly required by the labour market and to obtain a qualified job and the understanding of continuous learning.\r\nThis project will improve, strengthen and expand the skills and competences acquired in theory, with a work-placement of 46 days in a company in England or Spain. Whiles being abroad on a mobility they  will improve their language skills and understand new ways to make them more flexible, open-minded and open towards innovation and modernisation. The training will start in Italy, with a preparatory stage where the participant obtains competences on how to present yourself in an interview, some coaching on addressing difficult situations and some communication techniques to better deal with their experience abroad. Also, a Personal Development Plan (Individual development plan -IDP) will be created that identifies the aspirations and objectives of the participants including an action plan to achieve them. The group of participants will have at their disposal a Coacher, a Placement Coordinator, a Company Tutor and a Mobility Manager.\r\nThere will be 3 flows, of which 2 groups for Spain with 6 participants + 1 Accompagning person and 1 for the UK - 7 Participants + 1 Accompanying person. The flows will be of 46 days, in the fields of broadcasting, media and visual sector. The mobility is preceded by a period of training in Italy. The admission requirements: to have completed secondary education, age between 18 and 29 years, inclusive, possibly to be enrolled in one of our VET courses, mainly residents in the province of Chieti or in other neighboring provinces of Abruzzo.  They should be willing and able to spend 46 days abroad and open\r\n to learn new skills. \r\nThe Accompagning Person will be present for the first week of the mobility period and together with the Placement Coordinator will monitor and check that all the learning outcomes of the participant are achieved. Each participant gets ECVET credits at the end of the placement, these can be used in other VET courses at EQF level 3. At the end of the placement the skills and competences are registered in the Regional personal assessment booklet as per D.lgs. 13/13 and the ECVET credits are registered in the Europass Mobility Certificate.\r\nWe want to create professional vloggers who are aware of their skills and professionalism and are able to enhance their work chances, reducing, thus, youth unemployment and creating new job opportunities. The foreign experience also encourages collaboration between different countries and the value of European citizenship.\r\nThe project promotes collaboration between the different agencies and also offers a period of training for the staff, with job-shadowing. The hope is to also create skilled staff who are comparable to the different European training systems and create new training programmes and projects in the future, where the inclusion of cultures, religions, socio-cultural aspects and needs of the labour market are based on the innovative training methods.\r\nThe impact on the territory is expected to be on different levels, producing benefits to the participants, their families, the place where they live and training institutions, and therefor will contribute to the understanding of the importance of life long learning and the benefits of European citizenship.", "http://www.aidemdigital.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005794_7"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B12"}
