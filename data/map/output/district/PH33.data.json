We are aware that learning languages open doors to possibilities and experiences which are not available to those who are restricted to the knowledge of one language, it also allows a deeper understanding of language construction and formation - even in their mother tongue. Having a knowledge of additional languages provides children with skill for life, learning and work as the growth of business and travel continue to grow.  Positive language learning experiences contribute to young people\u2019s development as successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens. \r\n\r\nCurrently Lundavra Primary staff have been rolling out 1+2 from Nursery to Primary 7. Many staff members have attended Power Language Platform training sessions and have cascaded to colleagues during CAP sessions and additional resources accessible from the PLP have been used to enhance French language learning and increase engagement. In order to develop strong European links, make learning more tangible and put their learning into a context, Lundavra Primary School is in the process of partnering with a school in Versailles and although this is at an early stage it is hoped that this will allow children to become even more engaged with learning French language and customs. \r\n\r\nAlthough some staff have attended MFL training others with little or no background in the French language are still lacking in confidence when delivering 1+2. It is hoped that by attending the LFEE immersion course staff members will be able to share more knowledge and ideas to be used in the classroom. \r\n\r\nLFEE Europe is team of experienced and fully qualified native teachers are committed to promoting French, Spanish and English language and culture throughout Europe.\r\nThe aims of the immersion courses:\r\n\u2022 To provide participants with materials and ideas suitable for the teaching of Modern Languages\r\n\u2022 To explore various methods of teaching of Modern languages\r\n\u2022 To develop cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary France\r\n\u2022 To improve participants\u2019 competence and performance in French\r\n\u2022 To use Internet and other ICT resources in your class", null, "Lundavra Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036016_coordinator"], ["7AB", "Language Training", "Ardgour Primary School", 1888.0, "As a result of the Scottish Executive's decision to follow the Europen Union's strategy for 1 + 2 language introduction in primary school, Ardgour Primary school have identified a need for further training. This would allow them to successfully provide pupils with meaningful and interesting learning experiences in French.\r\nArdgour Primary is a very small school in the Scottish Highlands with 24 pupils. The school is part of a cluster of three schools and a wider associated schools group. They already have a close working relationship with these other schools and so it is estimated that the project would have an impact on 98 pupils from primary one to seven and eight members of staff. This covers a large geographical area in the Arnamurchan Peninsula. \r\nThey have identified a member of staff to undertake the training as part of their own personal development and this staff member will utilise the experiences gained by attending a LFEE Europe immersion course to establish a working group to improve French language learning throughout the cluster. \r\nResources will be shared with colleagues and professional discussion will enhance evaluation of learning. \r\nWithin Ardgour Primary school, pupils will benefit from the new resources, pedagogies and increased confidence in teaching French. They will be able to learn more about French culture and have access to higher quality learning materials. The teacher will also be more skilled in utilising ICT to enhance learning languages and throughout the rest of the curriculum. \r\nThe school seeks to establish an etwinning project to develop links with a school in France. It aims to do this in conjunction with the local authority and the course provider LFEE Europe. It is hoped that the school and cluster will benefit from the experience of teachers from elsewhere in Europe that have also attended the LFEE Europe immersion course and that this will lead to a greater understanding of different cultures for pupils.", null, "Ardgour Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036323_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PH33"}
