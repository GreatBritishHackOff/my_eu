Currently the design of medical implants with porous structures is limited by production technologies not being able to implement complex 3D structures. These complex structures are used to improve the initial fixation strength and the long term osteointegration properties of implants which lead to better quality of life for the patients. However, many patients undergo revision surgery within five years of receiving the original implant. The objective of HiResEBM is to produce an efficient manufacturing process that will allow any designed porosity to be incorporated into any part of an implant \u2013 giving complete freedom to design the \u2018optimum\u2019 implant. The consortium is composed of several companies with resources and experiences in different fields relating to the technical barriers to be overcome during the project, such as:\n-\tExpertise in electron beam gun design, to produce a new high precision EB system\n-\tR&D experience in additive manufacturing with fine powders\n-\tCoating processes used for the medical implant market\nThe advantage of the new EBM system are that any theoretically designed medical implant with complex 3D porous structures will be able to be cost effectively manufactured using the EBM system. Current systems are capable of producing ~3000 parts per year and are able to recycle unused powder for further processing. The ever increasing mean population age and the prevalence of degenerative bone diseases means that the demand for implants is going to increase significantly and place an even greater burden on our EU health care systems.

The powder is then melted with an electron beam to produce complex geometries in near-final form, eliminating the need for post-processing and finishing techniques. HIRESEBM researchers are modifying a partner electron beam fabrication system to minimise beam spot size and enhance the distribution of the finer powders required for the medical implants.\n\nScientists worked on the design of novel high-intensity electron beam gun electrodes and gun column. Models of the gun and beam parameter characteristics enabled a design concept that can operate over a wide range of beam voltages. Finite element analysis has been successfully employed to design lenses and beam deflection coils to minimise aberration and improve positional accuracy.\n\nThe team has evaluated selected fine powders for medical use, and established safety protocols for fine powder storage, handling and use. The modified powder delivery system is under development with a focus on improving the density of packed powder and its flatness on the build plate.\n\nHIRESEBM manufacturing technology will enable the production of optimised bone ingrowth structures for titanium medical implants.

These include reliable and cost-effective access to space from Earth, robust spacecraft, shielding from cosmic rays and solar flares, power generation, and efficient and reliable propulsion systems.\n\n'High power electric propulsion: A roadmap for the future' (HIPER) project aimed to address the last two points as it worked to conceive a roadmap for future space exploration and transportation. These activities stand to benefit from technological advancements in electric propulsion (EP) technologies as well as from related advancements in power generation in space.\n\nHIPER interdisciplinary team,  comprising 20 partners from 6 EU countries, brought together specialists in EP and power generation in space. With the backing of existing know-how and expertise, project partners chose to focus only on three different EP systems and related high-power generation. This decision was also justifiedby the intrinsic advantages of EP technology as compared with traditional chemical propulsion (i.e. rocket engines).\n\nState-of-the-art specific impulse capabilities and related overall efficiency are at least an order of magnitude higher for EP systems than for chemical propulsion. This means that by using EP huge propellant savings can be achieved. On the other hand, chemical propulsion requires less electric power than EP and performs better in terms of thrust and transfer-time. HIPER aimed at bridging that gaps, and at making EP systems more and more appealing for any kind of space mission.\n\nThe division of project work into five main areas covered mission analysis, propulsion system requirements and recommendations; in-space power generation; high-power Hall effect thruster development; high-power gridded ion engine development; and development of a magnetoplasmadynamic thruster (MPDT).\n\nBeyond technological advances, the project team also considered major technological efforts in the framework of political and social scenarios, in relation to both European states and non-European partners. As such, discussions and meetings were held with National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and other major American organisations to share project results and harmonise future roadmaps. This is a matter of strategic importance. As a result, a large group of research centres, universities, private companies and enterprises came together for the first time to actively discuss steps that need to be taken to define a roadmap for the future development and exploitation of high-power EP.\n\nProject efforts proved highly successful, leading to fruitful cooperation among all partners involved. HIPER approach promises to pave the way for successful and widespread usage of high-power EP in space. From an economic perspective, high-power EP applications will greatly reduce the overall mission cost, both of access to space by strongly reducing propellant consumption for near-Earth orbit (NEO) transfer, interplanetary travels, orbit raising, and spacecraft orbit control.", "http://www.alta-space.com/hiper", null, "/docs/results/images/2011-04/54225.jpg", "fp7_89121_999497701"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7JL", "Training  Courses on Creativity & Social Inclusion", "The Brit Learning Academy", 69673.0, "This is a large scale youth worker training project (Erasmus+ - Key Action 1 \u2013 Youth Mobility) designed for developing the capabilities of youth workers and staff of civil society organisations working with youth in fostering social inclusion using creative tools and methods, through a series of three (3) trainings and an evaluation meeting. \r\nParticipants will have the know-how or the interest in working with young people from disadvantaged backgrounds (unemployed, marginalised etc.); they will all be in the early stages of their careers and will have an active interest in using creative tools in youth work (arts, theatre etc.).
