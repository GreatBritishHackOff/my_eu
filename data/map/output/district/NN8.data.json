It is one of the most variable human diseases with complex, multi-systemic and progressively worsening clinical manifestations. Despite the huge impact of DM1 on the daily life of both patients and their family members, DM1 patients fail to receive the quality of healthcare that is available as they are not assertive users of the health care system.\nThere is no cure for DM1. The aim of treatment is to relieve impairments, reduce limitations and support participation in everyday activities. Based on our DM1-specific model which shows that physical activity and experienced fatigue are main determinants of DM1 health status (Kalkman 2007), OPTIMISTIC investigates the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in combination with exercise training  to improve functional capacity and to stimulate an active lifestyle.\nOPTIMISTIC compares the outcome of a treatment regimen with regular management in a multi-centre, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial, designed to 1) result in evidence-based clinical guidelines on exercise and cognitive behavioural therapy in DM1, 2) capture clinically meaningful changes in existing and novel outcome measures, and 3) identify both individual and composite biomarkers as surrogate treatment outcome measures that are reflective of the disease state.\nThere is an urgent need for an European clinical trial infrastructure for DM1. High prioritization of this is required to enhance the speed of clinical development of new putative DM1 therapeutics approaching the market. OPTIMISTIC will provide this and safeguard the rapid uptake of the developed clinical guidelines ensuring improvements in DM1 care and quality of life.", 26603.0, 3092868.0, "OPTIMISTIC", "The trials of muscular dystrophy", "For the first time ever, the EU is funding a multi-centre clinical trial in Europe to develop evidence-based clinical management guidelines for patients suffering from myotonic dystrophy type\u00a01 (DM1).", "DM1 is a form of muscular disorder affecting over 75\u00a0000 people in Europe alone. This chronic, inherited, progressive and multi-systemic disease has no cure. DM1 symptoms include severe muscle weakness and cardiovascular disorders.\n\nCurrently, treatment focuses on alleviating symptoms through exercise training and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). However, health care facilities for DM1 patients and their families are often sub-optimal as the disease is rare.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.optimistic-dm.eu (OPTIMISTIC) project is working on improving clinical management of DM1 patients through the development of standardised outcome measures and guidelines. For this purpose, 286 patients will be recruited.\n\nBesides evaluating the efficacy of treatment intervention, efforts will also be made to identify relevant predisposing genetic factors and other potential biomarkers. Fatigue reduction and increase in physical activity will be used as outcome measures.\n\nProject members already achieved significant progress with regard to obtaining requisite approvals, CBT therapist training, harmonisation of outcome measures and developing standard operating procedures. Patient recruitment has already started and trials are in progress in three out of the four sites.\n\nOptimising interventions that combine exercise with CBT should improve patient adherence and enhance their quality of life through better mobility and reduced fatigue. This data could also be extrapolated for research and clinical care of patients suffering from other neuromuscular disorders such as Parkinson's disease.\n\nTrial outcomes will provide enough scientific proof for optimising DM1 management in the clinic. Moreover, the necessary infrastructure for faster assessment of promising putative therapies for DM1 such as antisense oligonucleotide therapies will also be established.", null, "http://www.catt-sci.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/157334.jpg", "fp7_106243_954827843"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1AH", "BRITISH FOOTWEAR ASSOCIATION*", 1080.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_18677", 2016], ["1AH", "BRITISH FOOTWEAR ASSOCIATION*", 334.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_20405", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "NN8"}
