The consortium will explore already existing poplar and N. glauca genotypes in parallel with innovative state-of-the-art translational research from the model organism Arabidopsis to genetically engineer metabolic pathways to advance qualities of wood fibers, and long-chain fatty acids. The modulation of fiber and long-chain fatty acid quality in both poplar and N. glauca will be examined through a multidisciplinary analytical platform that will optimize for key industrial values. An extensive cross-talk between the analytical platforms, biorefining and field trials will provide the basis for industrial determination of N. glauca and poplar varieties as new multi-purpose feedstocks. Importantly, residual biomass, e.g. suberin in poplar bark, that normally is considered waste products will also be analysed for its potential to yield long-chain fatty acids with important characteristics for new bio-materials and for biorefinery purposes. Both poplar and N. glauca may readily be grown in areas that are sub-optimal for food crop-species, and field-trials within the MultiBioPro project will further evaluate the environmental sustainability of the obtained poplar and N. glauca genotypes. Attributes that are advancing biorefinery and bio-material properties will be further exploited for marketing, demonstrating the industry-driven nature of the MultiBioPro consortium. Dissemination and training events will constitute an integral part of the project, and will include training modules in using different analytical platforms, industry-lead product-developing courses, management training and communication through the development of corporate and scientific dissemination toolkits.", 291437.0, 5836021.0, "MULTIBIOPRO", "Exploiting tree tobacco and poplar for green bioproducts", "Researchers are using varied feedstocks for biorefining to produce high-value bioproducts that have industrial applications.", "Fossil fuels are diminishing and their use causes severe environmental damage. With a focus on ecological compatibility, biorefining has stepped into the spotlight to sustainably produce biofuels and other bioproducts.\n\nOne way to advance the quality and output of this process is to improve the primary source materials. The EU-funded http://www.multibiopro.eu/ (MULTIBIOPRO) project was established for this purpose.\n\nIt aims to exploit the natural resources from tree tobacco and poplar varieties to produce novel industrial end-products. These plants hold many other advantages: they are non-food crops, grow in sub-optimal regions, require relatively few resources and can be used to accumulate heavy metals from contaminated ground.\n\nThe project has successfully characterised numerous plant genotypes with altered material properties to use as multipurpose feedstocks. Researchers have also established technology platforms to assess the chemical and structural profiles of these modified plants for performance and functionality.\n\nAdvanced extraction methods are providing feedstocks for a pilot biorefinery, which will be up-scaled in the near future. Through these advances, MULTIBIOPRO has boosted the marketability of biomass for biorefining, prompting industry partners to develop business strategies and models to unlock economic value.\n\nThis project will provide new insight into the enhanced use of renewable and sustainable energy sources.

There are several signs, however, that computer and consumer technologyindustries are faced with major challenges in delivering improved performance and innovation for futureentertainment devices. First, game developers have argued that while GPUs are increasing in performance, thisis not leading to visual quality improvements because GPUs fundamentally restrict their flexibility. Second, thereare signs that GPUs are approaching a 'power wall', and architecture innovation is required now to circumventthis wall. Third, there is a lack of GPU tools available to compare multi-core processors (CPUs) to GPUs and toperform GPU program transformations to optimize for performance and power. To address these challenges, thisproject brings together commercial tools, applications and GPU designers, with academic researchers to analyzereal-world mass-market software on comparable graphics processor architectures. The project results willhelp the design of next-generation GPUs, games consoles, and mobile phones, and help software developersproduce graphically innovative software in the future.European companies lead in the design of mobile phone CPUs and GPUs, and are world leaders in video-gamestechnology. These companies need to make large investments in R&D for graphics, for which it is vital that theyhave reliable information.The main market areas for increased processor performance over the next few years are graphics andvideo-games. Therefore, the companies in the consortium are world leaders in real-time lighting for computergraphics (Geomerics), video game AI (AIGameDev.com), power-efficient GPU design (Think Silicon) and GPUtools (Codeplay), and the universities in the consortium are leading experts on low-power computer architecture(Uppsala) and parallel applications and multi-core architectures (TUB).The project seeks to achieve: power and bandwidth reductions of 2x or more on real-world software onnext-generation GPUs, as well as GPU architecture designs that are capable of advanced real-time graphicstechniques (such as radiosity and game AI) at power levels suitable for battery-powered devices.", 416037.0, 2998814.0, "LPGPU", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_99827_996463153"], ["3HF", "Correct and Efficient Accelerator Programming", "Codeplay Software Limited", "In recent years, massively parallel accelerator processors, primarily GPUs, have become widely available to end-users.

Accelerators present a serious challenge for software developers. A system may contain one or more of the plethora of accelerators on the market, with many more products anticipated in the immediate future.

It is imperative that such architectures can be fully exploited without starting from scratch with each new design.

PEPPHER will advance state-of-the-art in its five technical work areas:(1)\\tMethods and tools for component based software; (2) Portable compilation techniques; (3) Data structures and adaptive, autotuned algorithms; (4) Efficient, flexible run-time systems; and (5) Hardware support for autotuning, synchronization and scheduling.PEPPHER is unique in proposing direct compilation to the target architectures. Portability is supported by powerful composition methods and a toolbox of adaptive algorithms. Heterogeneity is further managed by efficient run-time schedulers. The PEPPHER framework will thus ensure that applications execute with maximum efficiency on each supported platform.PEPPHER is driven by challenging benchmarks from the industrial partners.

With this ubiquity has come a wider range of applications exploiting low-power GPUs, placing ever increasing demands on the expected performance and power efficiency of the devices.  Future low-power system-on-chips will have to provide higher performance and be able to support more complex applications, without using any additional power.\n\nThe strict power limitations means that these demands cannot be met through hardware improvements alone, however, but the software must better exploit the available resources.  Unfortunately, programmers are hindered when creating low-power GPU software by the quality of current performance analysis tools.  In low-power GPU contexts there is only a minimal amount of performance information, and essentially no power information, available to the programmer.  As software becomes more complex it becomes increasingly unmanageable for programmers to optimise the software for low-power devices.\n\nThis project proposes to aid the programmer in creating software for low-power GPUs by building on the results of the first LPGPU project to provide a complete performance analysis process for the programmer.  This project will address all aspects of performance analysis, from hardware power and performance counters, to a toolchain that processes and visualises information from these counters, to applications that will be used as use-cases to drive the entire design.  To access the new hardware performance counters a standardisable API will be produced to interface to a prototype hardware implementation.  This will let the analysis and visualisation tool connect to any GPU driver that implements the API.  The consortium's expertise will be used not only to drive the initial design of the API and analyses, but also multiple application use-cases will be developed to demonstrate the efficacy of the toolchain.", 572809.0, 3359713.0, "LPGPU2", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_200553_996463153"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SE19"}
