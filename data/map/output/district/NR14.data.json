In this context, the development of high efficiency motors using a limited amount of permanent magnets or completely new magnet-free motor designs is crucial. A promising option for this new generation of electric motors could be reluctance technology, which has been left out of the first line up to now due to its lower power density when compared to PM motors. On the other hand, the use of axial-flux configurations has proved recently in PM motors that power density can be increased in a relatively cost-effective way. The combination of both approaches, reluctance motors in axial-flux configuration, could lead to power densities comparable to those of PM motors in current EV-s while minimizing (PM assisted synchronous reluctance motors, PMSynRM) or avoiding (switched reluctance motors, SRM) the usage of scarce magnet materials. The aim of this project is to develop both axial-flux SRMs and PMSynRMs in parallel (meeting EV power density requirements), exploiting their commonalities and synergies in the design and prototyping phases, to further opt for the most suitable solution to be integrated in commercial EV-s. Being the combination of reluctance technology and axial-flux configuration a completely novel approach for EV applications (SRMs) and for any kind of application in general (PMSynRMs), one of the main challenges of the project will be to get a cost-effective and high efficiency motor design, considering a potential large scale manufacturing and industrialization of this new generation of motors.'", 35254.0, 2293915.0, "VENUS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110532_960580234"], ["8FB", "Demonstration of integrated smart water supply solutions at 4 sites across Europe", "Syrinix Limited", "European water utilities face many problems related to their 3,5 million km\u2019s of distribution networks.

In many countries, water quality needs improvement in order to reduce health risks and resources for water production and distribution must be used more efficiently. The European Innovation Partnership on Water has established priority areas related to the challenges in water supply distribution networks, focusing on resource efficiency, Smart Water Management and decision support systems. Although the technology components for Smart Water Management are available, the route to application is still uncertain. The main hurdles are: lack of integrated and open solutions; difficulty to comply with user and integration requirements; lack of clear and validated business cases for solutions; lack of business intelligence awareness and lack of political and regulatory support.\nProject aims\n1) To integrate and demonstrate 12 innovative solutions\n2) To demonstrate 4 integrated solutions\n3) To establish and guard integration and standardisation aspects\n4) To establish business cases, deployment potential and market uptake routes\nSolution\nThis project will overcome the hurdles by developing and demonstrating in 4 important Smart Water Management themes (water quality management, leak management, energy optimization and customer interaction).  12 innovative theme oriented solutions and 4 integrated (technological, financial, ICT, organisation, management) solutions will be demonstrated at 4  well-scaled and real-life demonstration sites in France, United Kingdom, Spain and The Netherlands.

The outcomes of this project will enable both these imperatives to be achieved simultaneously.  The project aim is to establish production lines in Europe that manufacture components for lightweight complex-shaped automobile body structures that are significantly lighter and of comparable strength and stiffness to those currently available.\nThis will be achieved by exploiting a new patented thermo-mechanical processing technology (HFQ) for sheet aluminium alloy that enables, for the first time, parts in heat treatable alloys to be produced to net-shape with maximum attainable mechanical properties. The life-cycle energy consumption of automobiles will be reduced; in the production stage, by the low energy requirements of HFQ, which is enhanced by the potential use of low cost recycled raw material and in the driving stage, by the reduced fuel consumption associated with lightweight vehicles. Reduced pollution is a natural corollary of low energy consumption.\nExploitation of this groundbreaking technology will be achieved through refinement of its laboratory scale development by university, research institution and manufacturing SME collaboration, leading to production lines being established in Tier 1 companies. Two such lines are anticipated as an outcome of the project. In 8 year period, over 30 production lines will be established in Europe and over 1000 jobs could be created. It is expected that new Al-alloy body and chassis structures will be produced in a mass-production scale, with weight saving of over 40% for the Classes C&D and above segment vehicles (which are currently made of steel).

Consequently devices made from these materials can handle more current and thus power compared to Si based ones. However, increasing operating temperatures compromise the performance and reliability of other components in the power electronic system, including capacitors and inductors, interconnects and packaging, and therefore  complex cooling systems are required which adds complexity and volume to the device design.\n\nThis proposal directly addresses the specific technological challenges of the Call JTI-CS-2013-03-SGO-02-087 entitled \u201cTechnology development and fabrication of high-temperature high-frequency capacitors for power switch integration\u201d, in which a thorough programme of work is proposed to develop optimized ceramic formulation and fabrication to provide highly reliable multilayer ceramic capacitors for high-temperature high-frequency capacitors for power switch integration.\n\nThe 24 month project will use as its base a new high-K ceramic material (SBFT - Strontium-Bismuth-Ferrum-Titanate) which extends power electronics operating temperature up to 200 C.
