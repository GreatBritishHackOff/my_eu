However, in spite of the improvements, modern body armours still have some of the same drawbacks as the old ones, as they are mostly heavy, bulky and rigid. Therefore they limit the wearer\u2019s mobility and agility and are impractical for use on joints, arms, legs, etc. Moreover, body armours have traditionally been designed to protect the wearer against ballistic threats and, thus, they provide only a limited level of protection against knives, sharp blades or sharp-tipped weapons. Recent studies, however, reveal that stab and puncture have become a main cause of police officers' injuries. Therefore, there is an obvious need to develop materials that combine stab and ballistic protection, while retaining their flexibility and low weight.\nIn this context, the proposed project aims to develop optimized ballistic textiles (both woven and spacer knitted fabrics) and apply innovative surface treatments (e.g. shear thickening fluids, ceramic coatings) to improve their performance on an areal density basis. Thus, fewer fabric layers will be required, which is expected to result in increased flexibility and reduced weight of the armour. Main parameters to consider also include physiological comfort and ergonomic design.\nAdditionally, smart functions, including positioning systems, will be integrated to further increase the efficiency of the body armour, eventually leading to reduced casualties.\nFinally, while a main limitation is that existing protective gear is usually limited to the body armour, innovative solutions are herein proposed for the protection of vulnerable body parts other than the torso.'", 213079.0, 3053066.0, "SMARTPRO", null, null, null, null, "http://www.bcbin.com", null, "fp7_185484_952326601"], ["0AB", "Treatment of Adrenal Insufficiency in neonates- Development of a Hydrocortisone Preparation for the treatment of Adrenal Insufficiency in neonatesand infants", "Diurnal Limited", "The aim of TAIN is to develop a neonatal formulation of hydrocortisone, a drug included in the EMA priority list that needs specific evaluation in the age range 0 \u2013 2 years (neonates & infants).

TAIN involves European leaders in neonatology, paediatric pharmacology, methodology and SMEs that will establish links with ethical bodies and regulatory authorities.  The programme will perform in silico experiments and evaluate formulations for neonates.  The phase 3 clinical trial comparing the neonatal hydrocortisone versus current (unlicensed) therapy will be optimized using age-appropriate state-of-the-art methods adapted to neonates (including in silico experiments and pharmacokinetics) to validate the components of a Paediatric Investigation Plan. It will be performed by neonatologists trained in paediatric pharmacology and clinical research in line with guidelines on Good Clinical Practice.

Results will be reported in order to allow a PUMA application to be submitted and to improve neonatal and infant care. Therefore, TAIN will validate the appropriate use of hydrocortisone in neonates and infants which will be of direct benefit to children, their families and health professionals.

Patients are unable to produce sufficient amounts of the hormone cortisol which is essential for physiological responses to challenges such as infection, injury or surgery.\n\nThe most common type of adrenal insufficiency in children is due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia where a genetic mutation blocks the production of cortisol. Although the glucocorticoid hormone hydrocortisone (the synthetic version of cortisol) has been successfully used as a replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency, the drug formulation is not suitable for young children.\n\nSeeking to address this issue, the http://www.tain-project.org (TAIN) project has developed a new hydrocortisone formulation that can be used in children from birth and up to six years of age. The formulation will be registered under the name Infacort and its characteristics have been adapted specifically to paediatric use, namely dosage, taste-masking and shelf life.\n\nGiven the very young target patient group of Infacort, the consortium will evaluate drug behaviour using computational models to minimise patient testing.

Understanding cell polarity requires knowledge of the molecular players involved and a quantitative description of their biochemical interactions, as well as the mechanical processes underlying polarity establishment.
