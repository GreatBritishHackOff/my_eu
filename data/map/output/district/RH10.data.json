It involves heating biomass in the absence of oxygen to a temperature of 200 to 320 \u00b0C. As a result, the biomass looses all its moisture and becomes easy to grind and water resistant, which reduces the risk of spontaneous ignition and biological degradation and permits outdoor storage. By combining torrefaction with pelletisation or briquetting, biomass is converted into a high-energy-density commodity solid fuel or bioenergy carrier with superior properties in view of (long-distance) transport, handling and storage, and also in many major end-use applications (e.g., co-firing in pulverised-coal fired power plants, (co-)gasification in entrained-flow gasifiers and combustion in distributed pellet boilers. Moreover, torrefaction-based bioenergy carriers may form a good starting point for biorefinery routes.\n\nThe current SECTOR project is focussed on the further development of torrefaction-based technologies for the production of solid bioenergy carriers up to pilot-plant scale and beyond and on supporting market introduction of torrefaction-based bioenergy carriers as a commodity renewable solid fuel.

In such a scenario cones may be the only protection a road worker has from traffic. Due to the maturity of Europe\u2019s road network and the rapid deterioration as a result of heavy traffic and weather conditions, temporary road work is increasing.

CESAR focuses on post-combustion as it is the only feasible technology for retrofit and current power plant technology. Moreover, analysis of the current R&D in Europe shows that there is yet no follow-up to the post-combustion work in the CASTOR project while R&D aimed at other types of carbon capture technologies have been accommodated for.  The primary objective is to decrease the cost of capture down to 15\u20ac/tCO2. CESAR aims at breakthroughs via a combination of fundamental research on Advanced Separation Processes (WP1), Capture process modelling and integration (WP2) and Solvent process validation studies (WP3) with duration tests in the Esbjerg pilot plant.   CESAR will build further on the successes and high potential ideas from the FP6 integrated project CASTOR. Moreover, the pilot built in this project will be used for CESAR. Novel activities and innovations CESAR focuses at are:  -Novel (hybrid) solvent systems -New high flux membranes contactors -Improved modeling and integration studies on system and plant level -Testing of new solvents and plant modifications in the Esbjerg pilot plant   In the Esbjerg Pilot novel technologies are assessed and compared with mainstream techniques to provide a fast track towards further scale-up and demonstration.   CESAR unites leading organisations within the field of CO2 capture, covering the whole value chain from research institutes to end-users. The consortium consists of 3 research organizations, 3 universities, 1 solvent supplier, 1 membrane producer (SME), 3 equipment suppliers, 2 oil and gas companies and 6 power generators (= industrial commitment).", 29004.0, 5711507.0, "CESAR", "Preventing emissions from reaching the atmosphere", "Scientists developed cost-effective technology to capture the carbon dioxide (CO2) produced when fossil fuels are burned for electricity. Preventing release into the atmosphere will have significant positive impact on global climate change.", "Power plants that burn fossil fuels to produce electricity are responsible for the vast majority of man-made CO2 emissions worldwide. The role of CO2 in global warming and climate change is now widely accepted and the EC has set ambitious targets for emissions reduction.\n\nPost-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the best way to accommodate existing (via retrofit) and new fossil fuel-based plants in curbing emissions during the transition to alternative sources of fuel. Although technically feasible, a major obstacle to widespread implementation has been the cost of capturing CO2. A large European consortium developed technology to overcome this barrier with EU funding of the 'CO2 enhanced separation and recovery' (CESAR) project.\n\nPost-combustion CO2 capture exploits amine-based solvent solutions. An amine-CO2 complex is formed which can then be decomposed with heat to produce high purity CO2 and the regenerated amine. The latter can be recycled for use in the capture process.\n\nCESAR investigated a number of potential solvents and capture process models through experimentation and modelling. Calculations suggested that the CESAR process could reduce the costs of CO2 capture by approximately 20 % compared to the benchmark capture process. The most promising combinations were tested at pilot plant scale paving the way for large-scale demonstrations.\n\nIn addition, scientists conducted pioneering work in the field of emissions measurements. It enabled them to provide significant input to the European Technology Platform for Zero Emission Fossil Fuel Power Plants (ZEP), supporting CCS to combat climate change. CESAR is one of the projects helping to set the research agenda on this pivotal topic.\n\nCESAR provided technology for the post-combustion capture of CO2 from fossil fuel-based power plants with a significant cost savings compared to current processes.
