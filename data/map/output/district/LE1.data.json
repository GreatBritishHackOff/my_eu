To achieve this, EPAD will also provide the analytical infrastructure to make correct observations regarding an intervention\u2019s value as an agent for secondary prevention. All this must exist in the right ethical, legal and social context. It must also be sustainable by being of value to numerous partners and stakeholders in the long term. The EPAD Consortium has been carefully designed to achieve the aim of secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nCurrent and recent drug development programmes in AD have been limited through the collection of heterogeneous samples of patients with advanced brain disease and an inability to measure effectively an index of disease course modification.\nRecruiting participants from clinics and the community for AD prevention trials with limited clinical background is both a risky and cost-inefficient strategy. Creating a disease register of people consented to enter secondary prevention trials delivers a degree of readiness that ensures better knowledge of a participants suitability and a more rapid throughput of screening for the trials. The EPAD Consortium has the necessary reach and influence from its partners to develop such a \u2018readiness\u2019 cohort.\nBy delivering an earlier, risk stratified population with run-in data in the EPAD Cohort across both clinical and biological domains; we can ensure a more homogenous population for study. We can also track changes in disease status as the basis for deciding on an intervention or combination of interventions likelihood of success in larger Phase 3 confirmatory trials.\nMost of the scientific community still consider A\uf062 dysregulation as central to AD so targeting this pathological process is a rational first step in what will be a standing trial. Other disease processes can be targeted when candidate interventions and intermediate phenotypes to reflect success are available.\nEPAD High Level Structure:\nThe IMI-EPAD Consortium will form the third part to a proposed IMI\u2013AD Platform (with IMI-EMIF-AD and IMI-Aetionomy) to produce a globally important superstructure for the secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nIMI-EPAD brings together all the major cohorts in Europe purposed for the exploration of disease processes and risks for dementia. In drawing from over 40 cohorts with almost 250,000 participants in 11 countries we have the basis for the EPAD Register from which we can draw the EPAD Cohort. Expertise in basic neurodegenerative sciences, epidemiology, statistics and trial design ensures that the standing proof of concept adaptive trial will have the optimal chance of delivering meaningful and definitive answers on an interventions likely success in confirmatory trials.\nIn establishing the International Scientific Synergy Group (ISSG) we have ensured that our work is visible to similar international initiatives and vice versa hence, through pooling know how and sharing data we can collectively overcome this devastating global disease.\nEPAD Work Packages and National Leadership:\nWe have created 8 work packages with 4 of these bound together in the EPAD Delivery Cluster which includes the scientific bedrock (WP1), the statistical engine room (WP2), the aggregation of suitable subjects (WP3) and trial delivery (WP4). These trial delivery activities are supported by project management (WP5), dissemination (WP6), business model and sustainability (WP7) and ethics, legal and social implications (WP8).

EMIF aims to address this by developing a common Information Framework that enables improved access to these data sources, enhancement through linkage of the different sources and collection of additional new information. EMIF will focus on two specific research objectives in order to guide the development of the Information Framework:  identification and evaluation of biomarkers i) of the risk for metabolic complications in obesity; ii) of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease onset in the preclinical and prodromal phase, which in both cases will identify high-risk individuals for future intervention trials. To achieve this, a variety of data sources ranging from small-scale information-rich disease cohorts for biomarker discovery to large EHR data for population characterisation and biomarker validation will be utilised. An extreme phenotype approach will utilise the subpopulations at the extremes of a particular trait distribution using large-scale metabolomics and proteomics for biomarker evaluation.

However, assessing the expected future value of the medicines when used in \u201creal world\u201d clinical practice requires additional information next to traditional (pre-authorisation) clinical trials.  Regulatory, HTA agencies and other healthcare decision makers have to make decisions on authorisation and access under conditions of uncertainty.  Currently, data packages which aim to minimise uncertainty on safety and efficacy may leave significant uncertainty in assessments of real world effectiveness of new medicines.  This results in further research commitments required post-authorisation (PASS, PAES, Reimbursement with Evidence Generation), and wide variability in access to medicines between countries. \nThe subsequent uncertainty relating to the reimbursement, and thus market implementation of new medication once approved by regulatory authorities, is negatively affecting the value of the drug development pipeline. The costly clinical developments to get to market approval, no longer seem to be a guarantee for market entry. This new risk presents a serious additional hurdle for drug developers that already face pipeline attrition. It also affects the speed and level of patient access, and therefore the extent to which patients and society might benefit from new medicines. \nIn recent years there has been considerable attention paid to the post-authorisation evaluation of treatments in real world clinical practice: study design and analytical methodology for assessing relative effectiveness; and use of registries and electronic healthcare data.  It may be possible to improve the value of information available at initial market authorisation by incorporating these techniques into pre-authorisation drug development.  HTA bodies, regulators, will become able to make better-informed decisions, and developers of new medicines will be able to direct development efforts to areas where value is most likely to be delivered to patients and health care systems, improving the efficiency of the whole medicine development chain. \nHowever, the adoption of real world / relative effectiveness objectives in a pre-authorisation development strategy has many operational, methodological, regulatory, and ethical issues and Pharmaceutical R&D organisations need more certainty as to: the impact of development choices on the regulatory review process; the value of different programmes to HTA bodies and other decision makers; the best balance of pre-launch and post-launch effectiveness research and the coordination of various post-authorisation commitments.

This rise can be attributed, at least in part, to overconsumption of so-called junk foods, which are highly palatable and densely caloric. These foods, in particular, drive activity in the brain's mesolimbic circuitry. The mesolimbic system - primarily comprising dopamine cells in the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens cells that they project to - responds to environmental stimuli, especially rewarding stimuli, to generate appropriate behaviour. These circuits are heavily implicated in drug addiction and, accordingly, obesity is increasingly being conceptualized along similar lines as other addictions, e.g. as involving dysfuncyion of reward processing. With respect to food responses, what is currently unclear is how the post-ingestive consequences associated with food, i.e. their caloric and nutritional content, interacts with the sensory qualities to drive mesolimbic activity and associated behaviours. In this proposal, I will use a behavioural model known as flavour-nutrient conditioning to explore the precise role for post-ingestive signals in motivated behaviour. This form of conditioning uses direct infusion of nutrients into the stomach to vary the caloric load associated with different taste/food stimuli. In Aim 1, real-time dopamine measurements will be made with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry while rats respond and/or receive rewards that have previously been conditioned with either intragastric nutrient (CS\\) or intragastric water (CS-). In Aim 2, ex vivo tissue slices will be taken from rats at various times after the induction of flavour-nutrient conditioning so that the cellular correlates of this process can be determined using whole cell electrophysiology.

Our objective is to understand the cause of differential centromere activity and hence failure of regular alien chromosome segregation in such lines. Centromere function requires loading of centromere-specific histone H3 (CENH3) to centromeric nucleosomes at epigenetically competent DNA sequence tracts; incorrect binding of CENH3 leads to chromosome elimination. Using comparative analysis of parents and wheat-barley addition lines carrying stably and unstably inherited barley chromosomes, we will measure the time course of CENH3 loading on the different centromeres, modification of DNA by methylation, differences in specific DNA sequences in the centromeres, contrasts between mitotic (from the embryo and adult) and meiotic cells where loss may occur, and differences or modification of nucleosomal proteins between wheat and alien chromosomes. We will answer how chromosomal and molecular organisation of barley centromeric DNA and its interaction with wheat CENH3 influences chromosome stability, elucidating the role of epigenetic control mechanisms in DNA-protein interactions.

The term \u201cflight upset\u201d indicates a situation when an aircraft in flight unintentionally exceeds the parameters normally experienced in line operations or training. Loss of control due to unsuccessful upset recovery is considered an important factor in civil aviation accidents. There is a clear need for the simulation of unusual flight attitudes, as a means to train pilots recovery procedures. Exercising these conditions in the real world is unsafe, expensive and, if performed in smaller aircraft, not representative of the situation in transport aircraft. Therefore, ground-based simulation of these extreme conditions is the only viable option for pilot instruction. However, at present, hexapod-based flight simulators used for pilot training are not equipped for this purpose, due to limitations of the mathematical aircraft models, and restricted simulator motion capabilities.  We believe that ground-based simulation of upset recovery is feasible when innovations in different research areas will be adequately combined. To demonstrate this, real flight tests will be performed with transport aircraft in unusual attitudes. The recorded motion profiles will serve to extend mathematical aircraft models with engineering tools. In addition, current motion cueing software will be innovated to reproduce the high G-loads and extreme attitudes representative to upset recovery. Then the simulator concept will be evaluated on a new generation flight simulator (DESDEMONA) with advanced motion capabilities, and compared to hexapod-based flight simulators. The final outcome will be a set of requirements for successful ground-based simulation of upset recovery, which will contribute to better pilot training to identify and recover from flight upsets.

These extreme conditions include aviation 'upsets' such as a high roll angle of more than 45 degrees, where the pilot inadvertently allows the situation to become critical. With plans to make upset recovery training mandatory, the EU is looking at new, effective ways to train pilots in overcoming these potentially fatal events.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'Simulation of upset recovery in aviation' (SUPRA) worked on advancing flight simulations in upset conditions. As current simulation technology is not capable of such modelling, the project team furthered the state of the art of flight dynamics modelling and motion cueing to address shortcomings in ground-based simulators.\n\nSUPRA based its work on previous modelling efforts that involve wind tunnel techniques to predict the behaviour of fighter aircraft in flight using novel computational fluid dynamics. It also developed motion cueing improvements and investigated numerous flight regimes not typically encountered during normal flight operations of commercial aeroplanes. Another important achievement involved the correct replication of physical strain on the human body during an upset using centrifugation as a simulator solution.\n\nIn effect, SUPRA successfully developed a generic model to capture the key aerodynamic behaviour of transport category aircraft in high incidence flight. It brought in expert test pilots to evaluate the concept and validate its viability. The research was disseminated to stakeholders through the project http://www.supra.aero/home.htm (website) and through a symposium that attracted aeroplane manufacturers and operators as well as aviation authorities.\n\nOnce the technology is exploited to improve pilot flight handling skills, it will help pilots re-establish stable control of the aircraft after upsets.

It is now well established that infants reach pain to a conscious level and also exhibit physiological and behavioural responses to pain.\n\nCurrent management of neonatal pain is far from optimal and is usually given in less than 30 % of cases undergoing painful procedures. Emerging experimental evidence indicates that prolonged pain in the neonatal period may lead to cognitive, behavioural and neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n\nThe most common analgesic treatment entails the use of morphine and fentanyl. However, their long-term safety has not been extensively explored.\n\nBased on this, scientists on the EU-funded 'No pain during infancy by adapting off-patent medicines' (http://www.neoopioid.eu (NEOOPIOID)) project evaluated the impact and safety of opioid treatment in preterm and full term newborn infants. The goal was to develop more personalised sedative/analgetic (S/A) drug therapy for neonates.\n\nThe NEOOPIOID consortium performed a questionnaire-based study with about 6 700 participating patients from 18 EU countries. Results showed that most centres used either morphine or fentanyl without practicing any kind of pain assessment of ventilated neonates.\n\nTo test the safety and efficacy of analgesic drugs, researchers performed a clinical trial where pain levels were evaluated using an optimised scoring system. Particular emphasis was given to the impact of these drugs on the neonatal brain.\n\nBlood taken from newborn babies was analysed by specialised methods for the presence of opioids and their metabolites.\nThis helped to study the pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic properties of morphine and fentanyl and implement the appropriate dosage according to developmental stage.\n\nThe study concluded that bolus rather than continuous administration of S/A drugs should be given to infants. Researchers were also interested in the relation between polymorphisms in candidate genes (COMT, KCNJ6) and the pain relieving effect of analgesic drugs.\n\nOverall, the NEOOPIOID study provided recommendations on how to assess and treat neonatal pain with S/A drugs.

Despite major improvements in care since the early 90s, it is still related to a poor prognosis, an impaired quality of life and high health care costs. Many new therapies have failed to improve outcome further. One obvious reason is that the response to treatment is not homogenous. Treatment may need to be tailored to the individual patient. BIOSTAT-CHF aims to identify patients with a poor outcome, despite currently recommended therapy using information on demographics, gender, existing biomarkers, genetics and proteomics. Both genomic and proteomic analyses recently underwent major technical improvements, resulting in genome-wide analyses and detection of low abundance proteins. In BIOSTAT-CHF an index cohort of 2500 patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure, will be recruited after initial stabilization. Treatment will be optimized according to the heart failure guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology with diuretics, ACE-inhibitors, betablockers and aldosterone antagonists. When patients are optimally treated, any change in symptoms and exercise tolerance will be evaluated. Patients will then be followed up for a mean of 18 months, and mortality and heart failure hospitalizations will be recorded. By using a systems biology approach, incorporating information from demographic, biomarker, genomic, proteomic, and the initial response to therapy, a risk prediction model will be designed, identifying patients with a poor outcome on currently recommended therapy. This model will then be validated in a real-life cohort of 2500 chronic heart failure patients. BIOSTAT-CHF will therefore be a major step towards personalized medicine.

This hope awaits clinical confirmation, since the strategies that are currently under investigation to target Myc function or expression have yet to enter the clinic. Myc proteins are global regulators of transcription, but their mechanism of action is poorly understood. \nMyc proteins are highly unstable in normal cells and rapidly turned over by the ubiquitin/proteasome system.

Work by us and by others has shown that stabilization of Myc is required for tumorigenesis and has identified strategies to destabilize Myc for tumor therapy.

The national coordinators in these countries (AONTAS, SIAE and NIACE DC) have outstanding experience in the areas we want to learn about during the coming project year, namely\r\n- Encouraging businesses and labour & learn offices to take part in the Festival\r\n- The use of role models or learning ambassadors during and beyond the Festival Week as part of a strategy to motivate specific target groups to join adult learning and/or to keep learning\r\n- Strategies for involving politicians and policymakers in lifelong learning and in the Festival, in order to make lifelong learning and (non-formal) education more visible for them and to put this issue on the political agenda \r\n- Offer professional development to educational workers from the local lifelong learning communities through the Festival, for example by offering seminars\r\n\r\nIn this project three groups of four persons each will follow a staff training in the countries mentioned above. The training sessions will take place during the Adult Learners Week in the country, which offers our staff, board members and volunteers who are already working for years for the Festival, an excellent opportunity to learn \u2018on the spot\u2019. During three or four full working days our workers will follow an intensive training consisting of study visits, presentations and structured discussions with local and national festival organisers, learning ambassadors, employers, politicians and other stakeholders. \r\n\r\nDuring the preparation period, personal learning objectives and organisational targets will be described in a learning agreement. The progress of the whole project will be followed using a monitoring and evaluation document, designed for this occasion. For the participants, the project will provide a rich and varied learning process, in which they obtain concrete knowledge and tools they can use in their daily work. The acquired expertise will lead to innovation of local Learning Festivals and national activities in the coming years: more businesses and labour & learn offices will take part in the Festival, learning ambassadors will play a significant role during and after the Festival, more politicians and policymakers will be involved in the Festival and local educational workers will be able to increase their expertise. Through this project the Learning Festival will get a significant impulse, that will be beneficial to people for whom learning is not obvious. \r\n\r\nThrough this project, Learn for Life also wants to contribute to the implementation of a number of European and national policy goals, namely: new challenges in a changing world and demonstrate that learning not only takes place at school (Europe 2020 Strategy), making lifelong learning and mobility a reality, creating creative and innovative learning surroundings and promote social cohesion, active citizenship and equal rights for everybody (European Agenda for Adult Learning and the Dutch SER document Making Work of Education).", "http://www.niace.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-NL01-KA104-000183_3"], ["7GE", "FORPROEURO", "THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ADULT CONTINUING EDUCATION (ENGLAND AND WALES) LBG", 12675.0, "This project is supported by the head of the GRETA network of the Pays de la Loire Region (group of local secondary schools involved in adult education and vocational training) named GIP FCIP EXPERIENCE, a public body of the Acad\u00e9mie of Nantes - the local administrative entity specific to the French national public education service.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to build a European network gathering both adult education organizations and partner companies, in order to organize future reciprocal exchanges of trainers or trainees, and to co-develop strategic partnerships on the topic of lifelong learning.\r\n\r\nAs a first step, 12 lifelong training advisors from the GRETA network of the Acad\u00e9mie of Nantes will visit European education organizations in order to launch and deploy a process of good practice sharing, based on periods of job shadowing, interviews and immersion in the training sessions organized by these partners.\r\n\r\nThis will aim to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Place the lifelong training action in a European context ; foster and increase the sense of belonging to the European Union, improve knowledge and develop euro-citizenship\r\n\r\n\u2022 Improve the skills of the lifelong training advisors in terms of pedagogical engineering (new methods, new organizations, new tools), and fight the digital divide (open and distance learning)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sectors which are addressed are the following:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Industry\r\n\r\n\u2022 Renewable marine energies\r\n\r\n\u2022 Digital pedagogy\r\n\r\n\u2022 Building and public works sector / Eco-construction\r\n\r\n\u2022 Health and social sectors ;  disability sector\r\n\r\n\u2022 Hotel, catering and tourism sector\r\n\r\n\u2022 Services and International trade\r\n\r\n\u2022 Guidance\r\n\r\n\u2022 Key competences\r\n\r\n\u2022 Education in prison\r\n\r\nThe following activities will be carried out:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Prepare the mobility periods (taking contacts, defining the program and expected results)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Visit the education organizations\r\n\r\n\u2022 Meet the training institutional stakeholders and prescribers\r\n\r\n\u2022 Meet local economic actors (companies, clusters, competitive clusters, associations, \u2026)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Reflect on cooperation projects\r\n\r\n\u2022 Organize workshops with training managers and trainers\r\n\r\n\u2022 Take part in the workshops and classes, and exchange with trainees\r\n\r\n\u2022 Observe on-site learning sequences (tools and pedagogical methods)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Study the organization of distance learning (digital tools and pedagogical support)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Undertake a comparative study of existing regulations (training, employment, certification)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Undertake a comparative study of Quality standards\r\n\r\nContacts have already been established with German, English, Belgian, Dutch and Swedish adult education organizations and the programs of the visits are now being finalized.\r\n\r\nRegarding the management of this project, several steps have been identified, such as a kick-off seminar, mobility periods and a closing seminar.

In 2010, the Riders formed a partnership with Charnwood Community College to provide the Charnwood Riders Academy, and became one of the first institutions in the UK to deliver the Advanced Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (AASE) framework on behalf of Basketball England. AASE is a unique sporting vocational qualification for young people who have the realistic potential to achieve excellence in their sport by competing on the world stage or securing a professional contract. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this project is to further enhance and improve the vocational training and development of Apprentices at the Charnwood Riders Academy. Working with Obradoiro in Spain, the project will also aim to provide greater exit and progression opportunities for students upon completion of the Academy programme. The project will have 3 overarching strategic objectives: \r\n\r\n1) Facilitating the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into both the Charnwood Riders Academy programme and Apprentices.\r\n\r\n2) Exposing the students to the European opportunities in both sport and other careers so these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.\r\n\r\n3) Embedding Lifelong Learning Principles into the training and development programme and working cultures in order to equip students with the aptitude and skills to pursue employment, either within sport or outside of it, throughout their career.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nParticipants will be selected from the circa 50 (male and female) Apprentices undertaking the Charnwood Riders Academy programme in the 2015/16 academic year (i.e. the 2014 and 2015 cohorts). These Apprentices are selected primarily on the basis of their basketball ability and therefore incorporate a wide range of academic abilities, socioeconomic circumstances and ethnic backgrounds.\r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe majority of the work placement activities will take place at Obradoiro, including:\r\n- Regular training sessions to address the defined sports performance targets. \r\n- Games versus high quality Spanish youth teams.\r\n- Daily feedback and evaluation sessions to confirm goal setting/reflection.\r\n\r\nObradoiro has outstanding links at a local, regional and national level which will enable Leicester Riders to enhance the work placement activities of participants. For example:\r\n- Access to high quality local and regional basketball clubs with activities to include training sessions and games at world class training facilities.\r\n- A visit to the Spanish Basketball Federation to undertake work shadowing, observe the professional practices and explore exit pathways.\r\n- Observation of a live ACB League Basketball game. \r\n\r\nMETHODOLGY\r\n\r\nLeicester Riders will use the principles of the European Quality Charter for Mobility to set goals and define tasks for the key elements of the project:\r\n\r\n1) INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE: production of clear and accessible resources.\r\n2) LEARNING PLAN: clearly defining the project objectives and the role of each partner in achieving them.\r\n3) PERSONALISATION: pre-visit assessment of participants' desired learning outcomes.\r\n4) PREPARATION: a structured preparation programme tailored to individual needs.\r\n5) LANGUAGE: provision of formal and informal language training.\r\n6) LOGISTICS: a formal contract to be signed by both parties outlining practical and logistical responsibilities.\r\n7) MENTORING: provision of suitably qualified staff to facilitate achievement of individual goals and ensure integration.\r\n8) RECOGNITION: delivery of formal instruments to recognise individual learning outcomes.\r\n9) EVALUATION: comprehensive and objective evaluation of all aspects of the project.\r\n10) RESPONSIBILITIES: agreement by all parties on their roles and responsibilities in the successful delivery of the project, formalised in writing via a Memorandum of Understanding and individual participant Learning Plans. \r\n\r\nIMPACTS\r\n\r\nThe impacts on participants are expected to include:\r\n- Achievement of recognised qualifications (e.g. BTEC L1 Work Skills). \r\n- Development of life skills and experience that can be utilised throughout participants' education and careers.\r\n- Enhanced cultural and linguistic skills, facilitating openness to new opportunities both in the UK and Europe.\r\n- Improved knowledge and understanding of the European opportunities in sport and other careers.\r\n\r\nThe impacts on Leicester Riders are expected to include:\r\n- Enhancement of the Academy programme both in terms of improved technical sporting quality of students and coaches, and also student achievement rates. \r\n- Implementation of best practice across the Academy programme and also the wider organisation.\r\n- Improved exit and progression opportunities for Apprentices, both within sport and outside of it, and in the UK and Europe.", "http://www.leicesterriders.co.uk", "Leicester Riders Foundation", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012957_coordinator"], ["5XY", "Integration Through Action", "Global Hands Leicester (CIC)", 16746.0, "Our planned project will influence the participants by motivating and inspiring them to take actions in their local societies.

We are looking for new ways to influence, inside and outside the framework of the Festival.\r\n\r\nThrough this EISEL-project, the foundation aims to acquire expertise from European countries in the field of regional strategic partnerships, including: key conditions for a sustainable partnership, organization of cooperation at management level and at the level of concrete work practices, expected bottlenecks and how to handle these.\r\nIn addition, LFL wants to gain expertise to better strengthen the position of (non-formal) adult education, bringing results of (non-formal) adult education to the spotlight. LFL wants to learn from good practices about policy influencing and recognition & validation of non-formal learning.\r\n\r\nThe expertise gained by employees through EISEL has a dual purpose: renewal of the Festival through the formation of sustainable regional strategic partnerships and strengthening the position and support of non-formal education at national level (due to greater visibility of work practice and greater clarity about the contribution of adult education to central 21st century issues). Via EISEL, the participants will reinforce relevant competencies, which will enable them to work better on these two goals. In the end, this should lead to reach adults for who learning is not obvious better in the region and should lead to improvement of the conditions to participate in lifelong learning for employment, social inclusion and personal growth.\r\n\r\nBased on previous international cooperation, we know that we will find relevant expertise in Ireland, Slovenia and Wales. We are still talking with three other countries. We will also collect relevant expertise at the annual meetings of EAEA and EBSN.\r\n\r\nStaff, board members and volunteers will take part in EISEL. A large number of our volunteers work in regional partner organizations, such as learning & work offices, libraries and ROCs. They are involved in LFL through the Festival Team. They have in depth insight in lifelong learning issues and reaching specific target groups. They have skills in building and maintaining relational networks and general campaign skills and organizational talent.\r\n\r\nDuring 2018-2019, job shadow visits will take place by a total of 24 persons. In addition, 4 x 2 persons will participate in the annual conferences of EAEA and EBSN. During the three-day job shadow visits, the staff will learn on-the-spot from good regional practices and from presentations and structured conversations with festival organizers, ambassadors, companies, politicians and other stakeholders. At the umbrella organizations, they also will learn from innovative projects and gain expertise in current policy issues in adult education.\r\n\r\nDuring the preparation period, personal learning objectives and institutional goals will be defined in a learning agreement. The progress of EISEL is monitored through a monitoring and evaluation document. For the participants, the whole project will provide a rich learning process. They get concrete instruments for their daily practice. The acquired expertise will lead to more successful regional partnerships where all relevant partners cooperate in a sustainable way for the benefit of adult learners with a distance to lifelong learning.\r\n\r\nThrough this project, LFL also wants to contribute to the implementation of a number of European and national policy goals, namely: new challenges in a changing world and demonstrate that learning not only takes place at school (Europe 2020 Strategy), making lifelong learning and mobility a reality, creating creative and innovative learning surroundings and promote social cohesion, active citizenship and equal rights for everybody (European Agenda for Adult Learning and the Dutch SER document Making Work of Education).", "http://www.learningandwork.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-NL01-KA104-038513_2"], ["5SN", "Freedom of expression: the right or the duty?", "Global Hands (Leicester) CIC", 20024.0, "Aim of \u201cFreedom of expression: the right or the duty\u201d is to empower youth workers, youth lieders and trainers, equip them with the competences necessary to recognize and act against human right violations, especially hate speech, and provide them with different tools and methods which they can use in the work with young people in their local communities and NGOs.\r\n\r\nThis project will have one main activity, 7-days training course which will be implemented in Leicester, from 19-27 March 2018 (including travel days).

This is particularly true for the United Kingdom where only in 2014 languages were made a statutory requirement in primary schools in England. Whilst language teaching in primary schools is the foundation for a successful language strategy at all levels of education, research has shown a strong decline in motivation for pupils once they enter secondary education. Two of the main factors for this are the lack of assessment of learning progress in the UK and traditional, de-motivating testing methods in other member states. \r\n\r\nMindful of the need for urgent action regarding this issue, educational organisations with a stake in the improvement of language learning provision have decided to enter a strategic partnership under the Erasmus + programme. Their main aim is to combine primary language learning with a method of assessment which motivates young learners to continue learning languages. The participating organisations aim to improve language teaching and the assessment of linguistic competencies in primary schools by producing an assessment tool in the format of a computer game. The game will use a common core of curricula from Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK as its foundation and \u2013 with its seven language versions - create opportunities for converging standards on a European level. \r\n\r\nThe ten partner organisations were chosen for their expertise in promoting languages, research, teaching primary languages, assessment, translation, e-learning and language games. The Goethe-Institut London, a supporter of language teachers in the UK and all EU member states, is project lead. Together with its British and other European partners, it identified and developed the project idea. Both the Spanish Embassy in the UK and the British language teachers network, ALL, have been extremely helpful and influential in discussing the need to address the imbalance of language learning in the UK and other member states. The Universities of Reading and Leipzig were identified as leading primary language research experts while the University of Perugia was chosen as assessment expert. In order to ensure the necessary practical focus, the Education Ministry of Tenerife supports the development of the tool for Spanish and together with the Education Ministry in Rioja will conduct the piloting in its regions. The University of Siena with its e-learning centre  joined the partnership to provide the basis for the development of the language game for Italian. The University of Westminster will add it translation and localisation expertise for French in the UK. \r\n\r\nAs the project progresses, this tool will to be tested in schools in four countries and the outcomes will be evaluated using standard quality criteria. In order to support the anchorage of the assessment tool in state schools, a specific training of teachers is required which will be done exemplarily at the Education Ministry in Rioja. Teachers can take home course methodology to be implemented in their schools. Project partners taking part in the course will draw on this experience for their own teacher training courses.\r\n\r\nThe design of the game will be based on intensive research to provide insight into assessing progress in language learning. Parts of the programming of an existing computer game developed by the GI's headquarter in Munich in cooperation with the software company OVOS will be used to develop the new tool. The game will then be piloted to calibrate the e-learning content to ensure validity of content and construct. The feedback of pupils, teachers, parents and external educators will be recorded, analysed and implemented. Once the game is used in various classroom situations, the obtained data will show the pupils\u2019 progress. The results will be compared with traditional pen and paper tests.\r\n\r\nThe project benefits all participants. Schools and teachers will become \u201cinnovators\u201d. Students will find language learning more enjoyable. Their learning outcomes will be better and their acquisition of transversal skills will be enhanced. Teachers will be able to develop their professional skills further using innovative methods and digital integration. They will derive great personal and professional satisfaction from improving their students\u2019 learning outcomes. Universities will benefit from research and data analysis from the assessment tool. The GI and the public authorities will be strengthened regarding their work to promote languages. \r\n\r\nIn the longer term, this project should yield strong evidence to convince national authorities to endorse the assessment tool and actively promote it.

The STRAIGHTEN BASIC SKILLS project offers a multiperspective view and pools the successful indicators in a comprehensive strategy to effectively promote work related basic skills training for adults.\r\n\r\nBased on these observations, 6 organizations from Austria, France, Germany, Norway, UK and Romania, gathered together in order to develop the concept and methodologies at stake, and do adapt this model in their countries, approaching it through implementation of 6 pilot projects focusing on 2 of the success indicators defined in previously.\r\n\r\nIn order to realize this, the project can rely on a solid partnership made of organizations which are expert VET providers in the field of work-based training, large-scale lifelong learning promotion bodies, and academic institutions, which all focus on the developement of lifelong learning access to low-qualified adults.

As public sector accounting in Europe is currently very heterogenous, professionals and academics in Europe face tremendous challenges. In particular, there will be a large need for university graduates that are knowledgable in public sector accounting and that are aware of the differing public sector accounting regimes accross Europe. In order to account for this development, this project aims to develop an academic module for Bachelor's or Master's degree programmes that concentrates on European Public Sector Accounting.DiEPSAm (Developing and implementing European Public Sector Accounting modules) is a cooperation between  the Johannes Kepler University Linz (Austria), the University of Tampere (Finland), the University of Rostock (Germany), the University of Leicester (UK) and the University of Coimbra (Portugal). Each key personen of the strategic partners has significant expertise in the field of public sector accounting, thereby complementing each other in unique ways with their experience.The aim of this strategic partnership is to develop a university module on European Public Sector Accounting, test and evaluate it in the strategic partner universities and transfer it to other universities accross Europe.  Thereby this project keeps track of the harmonization of European Public Sector Accounting and the respective EPSAS. Yet, there is no academic module in this theme integrating comparative views. The strategic partners of this project represent diverse national public sector accounting traditions thereby enriching the project by contradicting views, leading to the dicussion of alternative approaches and contributing to a cohesive European society. Thus, project can only be successful as a transnational approach.The outcomes of this project are in line with the objectives and priorities of ERASMUS+ strategic partnerships and will be: Creation of an academic module with a European-wide perspective on a topical theme, labour market relevance and extension of employment possibilities by integrating a highly relevant and still neglected topic in higher education, improved foreign language (English) and culture competences through cooperation with fellow students abroad, enhanced digital competences by using ICT in web conferences, online seminars and online forums with fellow students in partner institutions abroad and improved structured and long-term cross-border cooperation with partner institutions.Methodologically,   the   strategic partnership will   contain   the   following   elements:   (1)   labor-market relevant, scalable curriculum  that  enables the transnational  dialogue with lecturers and fellow students,  (2)  the  development  of  teaching  material  that  makes  use  of ICT and blended  learning  concepts and is relevant across EU member states,  (3) the development of a textbook that is of use for students als well as professionals across the EU.In order to achieve the project goals, the following main activities are realized:   a) development of \"European Public Sector Accounting\" curriculum including module contents and open-access materials, b) module implementation and evaluation,                  c) revision, enhancement and second implementation of the module, d) transfer of the curriculum to other European universities,      e) development of a textbook.

Firstly, there is a clear need to increase participation in adult education across Europe; and secondly, new ways of sharing best practices among European adult educators must be found. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe want to address this need in an innovative way: through the medium of videos. We will produce professional high-quality videos on adult learning that target adult educators, general public and policy makers.  A video aimed at the adult educators will tell the story of an adult educator and offer practical ideas and share good practices for professional development for European adult educators. The video for the general public and policy makers tells the positive growth story of an adult learner, inspires to learn and freshens the image of adult education and furthers knowledge about its benefits. The videos will be produced in five partner countries with partners experienced in video production: Finland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Portugal. The sixth partner, EAEA, will lead the dissemination activities of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHD video are an effective, time-economical medium speaking to both people\u2019s intellect and emotions. For example, showing good educational practices instead of writing about them is much more effective. Another example: a European citizen is much more likely to be inspired into adult education through the filmed story about a fellow learner than a brochure on learning benefits. Also, videos reach that segment of the population who, for various reasons, do not like to engage with written text. This includes for example special learners such as dyslexics.  In other words videos fulfil accessibility criteria better than text. Our project would pioneer and pilot cross-European video production in the adult education sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProduction team, consisting of a camera man, sound operator and a journalist, will travel to each selected location and shoot material based on the research and script developed by the partners. After shooting the material will be edited and post-produced by the production team. The videos are disseminated as an open educational resource in adult education media (LLinE, website of EAEA, with social media sharing options), Erasmus + dissemination platform, and potentially in European national television channels. In adult education media the videos will be complemented by written analysis of the methods and practices filmed, with the possibility to comment and discuss the content online. This analysis, written by education experts and scholars, is, on its part, a bridge between education research and practice.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will produce innovative adult education promotional material for the use of adult educators and adult education advocators. It thus aims at bringing positive and long lasting effects to the adult education professionals to support their work and also bring adult education closer to the general public in an understandable and easy-access form. The videos produced will be integrated into project partners\u2019 existing communications and they will be made available for different advocates of adult education throughout Europe. By introducing a variety of European examples of adult education issues the project outcomes, the videos, can be utilized in countries with different adult education history and perspectives. The videos produced in this programme will serve as advocacy and training tools for many European organisations. Through the dissemination networks of EAEA (an umbrella organization for 116 adult education organisations in Europe) the videos will reach the main European adult education organisations and policy-makers on education. High quality videos will contribute also to the profile of smaller adult education organisations that wouldn\u2019t have the resources to produce such videos themselves but can exploit the videos in their own work.", "http://www.learningandwork.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FI01-KA204-000843_5"], ["7GE", "OER uptake in adult education institutions", "NATIONAL LEARNING AND WORK INSTITUTE", 153547.0, "OERup! takes up the need of promoting and fostering successful implementation of practices with OER in adult learning institutions in Europe, with the aim of raising awareness of the value to be derived from OER, as well as supporting an OER-friendly environment in education institutions to increase participation in Open Education.

Many disadvantaged people have few possibilities to escape the low skills trap, and they often lack the know-how to access social services, proper health care that goes beyond urgencies, and democratic participation. Refugees need to learn the host language, but also acquire the knowledge on how to make a home in their new countries. Additionally, too many of the native population of Europe respond aggressively to refugees through xenophobic and violent actions.The learning of these groups should combine basic and digital skills with problem solving, critical thinking and interaction with other people as well as information and support on how to access health and social services, developing family competences and fostering intercultural dialogue and active citizenship.

Daily practice shows that the structural embedding of the Literacy houses concept requires an extension of the concept to include not only language skills but all essential skills. Essential skills are the skills needed for life, learning and work. They provide the foundation for learning all other skills and enable people to evolve and adapt to change. \r\n\r\nOur main question is: 'How can we extend our current Literacy houses concept to include all essential skills and transform it into a centre of development?' We will focus on participation in its broadest sense. In doing so, we have selected two main themes which are relatively new to the Netherlands. \r\n\r\nCreation\r\nBesides the more classical methods for the transfer of  knowledge, we intend to research other - more creative - methods of acquiring language and  essential skills or methods that lead to a better embedding of lessons learned.  \r\n\r\nEmployment\r\nOver 50% of the people in the Netherlands with low essential skills is employed. Consequently, employers are a very important partner in the improvement of essential skills. In practice, however, they are hardly ever involved in our current Literacy houses concept. Secondly, Literacy houses can play an important role in helping people with low essential skills find a job. Within this project, we intend to research which approaches, styles and methods are possible. \r\n\r\nThe following partners will take part in the project: Cubiss Brabant, Public Library Breda, ROC West-Brabant, Stichting Lezen & Schrijven, Bergen Offentlige Bibliotek, Ulmer Volkshochschule, Learning and Work Institute and SPK vzw. They will all bring their specific knowledge, expertise and experiences related to the abovementioned themes to the project. All partners have also submitted their own learning questions and desired outcome of the project in order to further develop their own approach. \r\n\r\nWe want to make sure that everyone can successfully participate in our society. In order to be able to do so, they need to be equipped with certain essential skills. The proposed activities are directly related to the main challenge of the consortium in West-Brabant to extend its current Literacy houses concept so that it can become the centre of development that our society so desperately needs (a centre of life long learning). \r\n\r\nThe project will be kicked off during an international conference in September 2017, during which we will share the results and experiences of our KA1 project 'Extending the Literacy houses approach'. The day prior to the conference, we will plan a transnational project meeting with all new project partners to make further arrangements relating to our KA2 project. The results of our KA2 project will be presented to a wide audience during an international conference, which will probably take place in June 2019. Again, we will plan a transnational project meeting with all project partners on the day prior to the conference in order to evaluate the project and determine possible follow-up activities. All Dutch project partners will make study trips to the project partners in Norway, Germany, Wales and Belgium. During these study trips, we want to learn from their specific knowledge, expertise and experience.\r\n\r\nWe will process our findings in a case study concerning creation, a case study concerning employment and a toolkit related to Essential skills houses. The obtained  insights will be translated to fit the specific situation in West-Brabant; how can they successfully be incorporated in our current approach? \r\n\r\nThese intellectual outputs will be shared both nationally and internationally, e.g. through the existing networks and communication channels of all project partners as well as networks such as the Erasmus+ Project Results Platform and EPALE (online platform for adult education in Europe).

The labour force in Europe is projected to decrease by an average of two million every year between 2010 and 2030. This represents a loss of 1% of its current size per year for 20 years. Yet, in many countries, most workers still retire (relatively) early. They often do so not because they want to, but because they feel compelled to (or) that they do not have other options. Solutions need to be found to make work more sustainable, and to extend working lives in order to avoid old-age poverty and to reduce state expenditure on pensions and welfare. (Changing places: Mid-career review and internal mobility, Eurofound Report January 2017)\r\n\r\nRecent OECD research has highlighted that there are many millions of adults in Europe with low levels of functional literacy and/or numeracy skills and that the majority of these are in employment (OECD Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) 2016). This has negative implications for their employment potential and longer term career prospects.\r\n\r\nThe concept of the Mid Life Career Review (MLCR) is one which is gradually gaining favour in many countries and the role of social partners in both lobbying for and delivering elements of this is one that could be critical to its success (Eurofound 2017). A MLCR is a holistic engagement designed to cover many topics such as retirement planning, finance, pensions and central to all models of a MLCR - skills. \r\n\r\nIn the UK John Cridland\u2019s very new report on pensions (published 23 March 2017) includes a recommendation to have a mid-life 'MOT' at 50 for skills and pensions. L&W Institute and TUC can take some of the credit for their campaign for everyone to have this mid-life entitlement at 50. This is the perfect time for this project, which can make a real and lasting impact.\r\n\r\nOur project will develop a suite of new materials to support the delivery of a Mid Life \u2018Skills\u2019 Review \u2013 with the emphasis on reviewing skills and competences and targeted at adults (at or around 50 years of age) with low levels of basic skills in literacy, numeracy and digital literacy. We will create new materials specifically designed for use both by Europe\u2019s social partners and others in the workplace carrying out similar 'skills review' functions. These materials will include new online \u2018gamified\u2019 skills assessment tools in a variety of languages and new online learning modules for the reviewers/assessors. Where there is a learning need identified, learners will be signposted to existing training materials. A platform for hosting these materials will be developed and the materials themselves translated into partner languages. We will also explore with partners how these new resources can be combined with the kind of holistic offer needed for a full MLCR. Further, the reviewers across the partnership will be encouraged to become \u2018mid-life skills champions\u2019, with the support of online tools and a virtual e-network. This network will support its members and share ideas and experience.\r\n\r\nAs well as a new suite of materials and in keeping with the European priority for prioritising the recognition of skills and qualifications, we will accredit learning through a new online digital badge and explore linking this into the Europass CV Programme. Badging of this kind is increasingly valued and is an innovation which the lead partner has some existing expertise in using. \r\n\r\nWe will gain further sustainable impacts by: delivering a series of events in each partner country to highlight the new materials and support available; developing a series of employee case studies to highlight some of the positive outcomes from the mid-life skills reviews e.g. progression, promotion, career change etc; and building on or utilising existing learner tracking systems to carry out a longitudinal study of the impact of mid-life skills reviews (going beyond the length of the project) which will focus on 3 key perspectives: workplaces/reviewers/employees.\r\n\r\nThe partners have been selected as all have existing close working relationships with trade unions and all have significant experience in working in the adult education and skills sector.

A better understanding of the representation of women on the boards of directors in European sporting organizations could identify what gender policies can be proposed and existing ones improved, both by the EU and by individual member countries, to increase women participation in leadership positions of sports organizations. Making visible the experiences of women, their roles on the boards of directors, the corporate governance practices in their sports organizations, and the problems and the limitations they face in their daily professional lives, can help other women to better manage their careers in the contexts where the decision-making process is generated.", null, null, "erasmus_590521-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-SPO-SCP_2"], ["9BH", "De Montfort University Politics of the European Union Module", "DE MONTFORT UNIVERSITY", 24354.0, "This project will develop, promote and evaluate the teaching resource through the 2nd year module \u2018Politics of the European Union\u2019 (POLEU) through a multi-disciplinary remit.
