It will develop assessment methods and a Decision Support Framework (DSF) for management of marine resources and thereby enhance the capacity to provide integrated assessment, advice and decision support for an EAFM. Enabling comparisons between relevant 'what-if' scenarios and their likely consequences, DSF will support the implementation of the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). The project SMEs, together with RTD institutions and stakeholders, will develop and demonstrate the use of innovative decision support tools through training actions, role-play and workshops. Indicators of Good Environmental Status (GES) will be developed along with models for ecosystem-based management. The models will take multi-species approaches into account and be developed and compared through seven datasets of six European regional seas. The models will draw on historical data sets and data from new analytical methods. Model performance will be compared and evaluated using a simulated ecosystem as an operating model. Learning from the experience of previous and on-going research, MareFrame integrates stakeholders at its core using a co-creation approach that combines analytical and participatory processes to provide knowledge that can be applied to policy-making, improving management plans and implementation of EAFM. The project dissemination will use innovative ways to ensure effective usage of project outcomes. The work packages and the allocation of roles have been designed to ensure effective collaboration through the project\u2019s lifetime. MareFrame liaises with other national and international research projects and is of high relevance to the future management of living marine resources in Europe in a changing environment, taking a holistic view incorporating socio-economic and legislative issues.'", 111983.0, 6233260.0, "MareFrame", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_111485_952236585"], ["7TQ", "100% recovery and RECYCLing of construction vehicle crAwler TRACKs into constituent rubber andsteel for sustainable raw material supply", "Aquablast Ltd", "Aquablast Limited, www.aquablast.co.uk, are pioneers of Ultra High Pressure (UHP) waterjet technology with operating pressures up to 60,000 psi, which is now an industry standard for steel and concrete surface preparation and cutting.\nWe are now introducing UHP water techniques to the recycling industry through Recyclatrack- a process that recovers and recycles end-of-life rubber crawler tracks using UHP water-jets.\n\nRecyclatrack has been developed so that construction equipment Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEMs), Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul (MROs) and plant hire companies can dispose of growing numbers of decommissioned steel/rubber composite crawler tracks safely and cost-effectively with a sustainable and environmentally compliant process.\n\nRecyclatrack is a patent-pending \u2018green\u2019 solution for this problematic waste stream , achieving 100% recycling of scrap crawler tracks to recover high grade ferrous scrap and rubber crumb, both of which are readily integrated back into the market.", 39196.0, 55994.0, "Recyclatrack", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_200471_927382081"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NR34"}
