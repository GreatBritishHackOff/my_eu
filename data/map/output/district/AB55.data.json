Norway is very similar to Scotland when it comes to fishing, climate, and the landscape surrounding the rivers. Norway has larger salmons in the rivers, but is nevertheless not in any way able to compete with Scotland when it comes to salmon fishing tourism.\r\n\r\nWe want to bring our students to Scotland to watch and learn about the ways in which the Scots manage their waterways in order to observe how they facilitate and organise for both the salmon and the fishing. We will also use two of Scotland\u2019s most well-known instructors, Gary Scott and Ian Gordon, as we enter the fly fishing instructor certification program. This certification is unique in that it is the only one to be found in such a course of study in the world, and in order to achieve immediate recognition for our certification in the world of fly fishing we depend on having well-known names associated with our academy. Gary Scott and Ian Gordon will assist in arranging our participation in seminars, conversations, and practical exercises with professionals in relevant areas within tourism and management in relation to salmon fishing in river Spey and river Tay.\r\n\r\nDuring the next 2 years, we wish to bring a total of 37 students and 6 teachers to the areas surrounding the 2 rivers for 2 weeks in spring 2015 and 2016. In the rivers, we will meet ghillies and the local biologists. We will also visit a large hatchery in river Tay.\r\n\r\nIn each of the rivers, the students will gain knowledge about how the entire system surrounding salmon fishing tourism is constructed. We imagine that this project will be the basis for future additional knowledge and competence in several of the students\u2019 subjects during their three-year studies in the sport-fishing academy. The main objective for this project is therefore to learn as much as possible from the Scottish way of meeting the same challenges related to salmon fishing as we see in Norway. This involves, for instance, river management, fishing rules, accommodation and hospitability, and marketing. \r\n\r\nIn the course of this project, the students will, besides the competence we are working to build up, participate in commercialised practical fishing, practice and develop their language skills, and expanded their contact network. Previous experiences from such trips are that the students increase their self-confidence and develop a new attitude towards the challenges we are facing through becoming acquainted with people and cultures previously mostly unknown to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth and social care project:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag we cooperate closely with local companies in education and practical work within the health and social care services. Our wish is that our students also will have the opportunity of gaining international experiences.\r\n\r\nWe wish to strengthen the students\u2019 attitude, approach, and behaviour when the aim is care and user development, regardless of culture, religion, way of life, and functional level.  By travelling to Derry, the students gain insight in and knowledge about the culture, history, and society development in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nNorthern Ireland and Derry has a unique history that most people have heard about but do not have much insight in and understanding of. We have an intentional agreement with Foyle international school. This school has high competence in facilitating and organising visits and exchanges. Their representatives will be out contact persons and will be able to organise and prepare each of our visits and organise practical matters involved in all visits. Through cooperating with Foyle we will be able to offer our students:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 Visits to different kindergartens with different pedagogical approaches\r\n\r\n\u2022 Visits to a year 1-3 school\r\n\r\n\u2022 Visits to a municipal mother-child project focusing on early intervention\r\n\r\n\u2022 Visits to institutions for the functionally disabled / daytime activities for the functionally disabled\r\n\r\n\u2022 Visits to institutions for dementia / inpatient care institutions\r\n\r\n\u2022 Visits to day care centres for elderly persons\r\n\r\n\u2022 Work experience for 2-3 days in one of the work places we have visited\r\n\r\n\u2022 2-3 days of language learning at Foyle international school focusing on English expressions relevant for health and social care students\r\n\r\n\u2022 Social activities related to culture and history\r\n\r\nFor our school it is an important objective that the students throughout the trip and subject exchange develop thoughts and ideas about internationalisation and the importance of cooperation between European countries. By having such a project running for several years, we wish to increase what our school and we can offer our students and strengthen the school\u2019s position and reputation, as well as increasing the number of applicants to health care studies.", "http://www.speyonline.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-NO01-KA102-000210_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "AB55"}
