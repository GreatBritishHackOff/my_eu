An EU project is making the process more efficient and cost effective by developing and testing a calcium wire for addition to the melt.", "Steel production uses light, easily oxidised metallic elements  to change the melting point  of insoluble materials in molten steel and thus improve flow properties. Calcium is ideal, but current methods of adding it to the melt result in evaporation and inefficient  reactions, representing high costs.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.injectionhotwire.com (HOT-WIRE) project aims to find ways of slowing calcium melting, thereby lessening evaporation, during the injection process. The method will involve a calcium wire clad in steel, which can be fed into the melt. The seven-member consortium will run through the entirety of 2013 and 2014.\n\nWork during the first reporting period involved research into controlling the evaporation of calcium, first via literature review and then experiment. Testing determined whether evaporation time can be extended, and explored techniques for retarding melting of the calcium wire. Additional experiments determined optimum methods of injecting the wire into liquid steel.\n\nAs a result, the best techniques have been selected. Outcomes included documentation of the most effective combinations of wire-coating materials, and methods for applying the system industrially. Preliminary designs are nearly complete. The project also developed detailed designs for injection mechanisms.\n\nThe legacy of the HOT-WIRE project will be methods for reducing loss of calcium during the steelmaking process. Thus, less calcium will be needed, meaning a more profitable process and greater international competitiveness for European business.", "http://www.injectionhotwire.com/", "http://www.indestructible.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/145802.jpg", "fp7_106835_953580326"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1LU", "Positive Futures: Supporting Economic Growth in Disadvantaged Communities through Sustainable Employment", "Ashiana Community Project", "Ashiana Community Project (as lead applicant) and its third sector delivery partners (comprising Aspire and Succeed Birmingham, Games4All Ltd, Narthex Sparkhill, Northstar Community and Economic Development Services Ltd, and The Muath Trust) have formed a consortium, which with the support of ESIF funds, will unlock the economic potential of disadvantaged cohorts, by developing and embedding a fast, responsive, and integrated community-facing employability and skills development eco-system.", "ESF", 710026.0, 1420052.0, "esf_england_600"], ["1AR", "AEGIS in Communities: Catalysing Skills Development in Deprived Neighbourhoods", "The Muath Trust", "In recognition of the above challenges and wishing to make a measurable improvement to the economic circumstances of the most disadvantaged groups (as defined in the national ESF Operational Programme 2014-20 and local GBSLEP ESIF Strategy, January 2014), we propose to establish a comprehensive community facing employment and skills service where all activity (including mainstream) can be better channelled for the benefit of disadvantaged client groups.
