An EU project is making the process more efficient and cost effective by developing and testing a calcium wire for addition to the melt.", "Steel production uses light, easily oxidised metallic elements  to change the melting point  of insoluble materials in molten steel and thus improve flow properties. Calcium is ideal, but current methods of adding it to the melt result in evaporation and inefficient  reactions, representing high costs.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.injectionhotwire.com (HOT-WIRE) project aims to find ways of slowing calcium melting, thereby lessening evaporation, during the injection process. The method will involve a calcium wire clad in steel, which can be fed into the melt. The seven-member consortium will run through the entirety of 2013 and 2014.\n\nWork during the first reporting period involved research into controlling the evaporation of calcium, first via literature review and then experiment. Testing determined whether evaporation time can be extended, and explored techniques for retarding melting of the calcium wire. Additional experiments determined optimum methods of injecting the wire into liquid steel.\n\nAs a result, the best techniques have been selected. Outcomes included documentation of the most effective combinations of wire-coating materials, and methods for applying the system industrially. Preliminary designs are nearly complete. The project also developed detailed designs for injection mechanisms.\n\nThe legacy of the HOT-WIRE project will be methods for reducing loss of calcium during the steelmaking process. Thus, less calcium will be needed, meaning a more profitable process and greater international competitiveness for European business.", "http://www.injectionhotwire.com/", "http://www.indestructible.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/145802.jpg", "fp7_106835_953580326"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2NE", "BH Roots - Promoting European Values", "Bosnia and Herzegovina UK Network", 20034.0, "The European citizens included our target group of young people with immigrant background, are finding themselves in a situation where they are struggling to embrace other cultures only worsened by the current immigration trends. Therefore, the immigrant families in the European countries are facing issues with properly integrating into countries in Europe while keeping a sense of belonging to their own culture.  \r\n\r\nSome of these immigrant families come from Bosnia and Herzegovina who were forced to leave their country in the early 1990s due to the Bosnian Civil War.
