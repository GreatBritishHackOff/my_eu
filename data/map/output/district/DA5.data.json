This is of particular concern, as a much wider range of air pollutants are found at high levels indoors than outdoors. Indoor air quality is a major concern to businesses, building managers, tenants, and employees because it can impact the health, comfort, well being, and productivity of building occupants, as most Europeans spend up to 90% of their time indoors and many spend most of their working hours in an office environment. Studies conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and others show that indoor environments sometimes can have levels of pollutants that are actually higher than levels found outside. In spite of the obvious need to better control and manage the quality of indoor air, no European legislation or norm currently defines indoor air quality auditng and management systems, leaving it to the member states' responsibility to define air quality targets and risk levels, certification procedures and audit management processes. AIRLOG proposes a web-based Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Audit Management platform that will save specialized SMEs up to 40% of the cost of performing audits, helping auditors improve their audits and clients better understand the IAQ process. AIRLOG\u2019s Decision Support System will learn from past experiences and propose the most effective Best Practice mitigation actions to ultimately improve IAQ control and healthier conditions in EU buildings. The link between sustainable building design, energy-efficient management and green procurement will be actively fostered by AIRLOG, through the development of a unique knowlegde base at EU level on successful indoor air management practices for various building types in various EU areas.", 189986.0, 1233772.0, "AIRLOG", null, null, null, null, "http://www.greenairmonitoring.co.uk", null, "fp7_101121_965986335"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2AW", "PREMIERS PAS VERS L'INTERNATIONALISATION DE NOS JEUNES BRETONS EN MFR", "SLADES STABLES CIE HOUSE CERTIFICATE", 93201.0, "First steps towards the internationalization of our students from Brittany in the MFR schools\r\n\r\nWe wish, as the MFR from Brittany network, to boost mobility activities in order to promote students formal, non formal and informal skills in an international and European economic context.\r\n\r\nThe Regional Federation of the MFR in Brittany (FRMFR) is involved in the Erasmus program and leads 5 schools all over the Breton territory.  61 young students are concerned by the European program, they will leave to 9 different countries: Denmark, Croatia, Poland, the Netherland, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Finland and Greece for a four week- work experience in Spring 2018.\r\n\r\nThis training is a part of their vocational or technical A level studies specializing in farming; Personal help and Territory support, Agronomy and sciences.\r\n \r\nThe mobility project aims to improve the youth employability, by getting abroad new professional skills as part of a reciprocal approach of sharing the knowledge whilst respecting the diplomas framework. Moreover the training masters and the teachers in charge of the mobility project in each school write the work experiences \u2018purposes in order for each student to discover the business, its way of working, the work progresses and the responsibilities assigned.\r\n\r\nThe MFR are associative schools which have contracts with the government and the Breton council. They suggest an alternative way of learning (students are part time at school and part time in a business) and they work for the youth social and professional integration. So a stay in a European country should allow young students to adapt themselves to their future jobs. Getting a new experience with different professional tasks (according to the chosen country) and discovering foreign cultural aspects are a guarantee to be more confident and open-minded. It should also allow a higher creativity to grow up in our European and citizen society.\r\n\r\nThe European mobility is accessible to all vocational or technical A level students and should allow them to: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Practice a foreign language and to improve it\r\n\u2022 Gain new Professional skills\r\n\u2022 Meet new people and discover their culture, their way of life  and their traditions\r\n\u2022 Push themselves\u2019 limits and to take responsibilities\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the students could, after their studies become involved and proud European citizens able to create their future jobs and to increase the European competitiveness.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA116-035440_30"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DA5"}
