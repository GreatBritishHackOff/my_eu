This is of particular concern, as a much wider range of air pollutants are found at high levels indoors than outdoors. Indoor air quality is a major concern to businesses, building managers, tenants, and employees because it can impact the health, comfort, well being, and productivity of building occupants, as most Europeans spend up to 90% of their time indoors and many spend most of their working hours in an office environment. Studies conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and others show that indoor environments sometimes can have levels of pollutants that are actually higher than levels found outside. In spite of the obvious need to better control and manage the quality of indoor air, no European legislation or norm currently defines indoor air quality auditng and management systems, leaving it to the member states' responsibility to define air quality targets and risk levels, certification procedures and audit management processes. AIRLOG proposes a web-based Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Audit Management platform that will save specialized SMEs up to 40% of the cost of performing audits, helping auditors improve their audits and clients better understand the IAQ process. AIRLOG\u2019s Decision Support System will learn from past experiences and propose the most effective Best Practice mitigation actions to ultimately improve IAQ control and healthier conditions in EU buildings. The link between sustainable building design, energy-efficient management and green procurement will be actively fostered by AIRLOG, through the development of a unique knowlegde base at EU level on successful indoor air management practices for various building types in various EU areas.", 189986.0, 1233772.0, "AIRLOG", null, null, null, null, "http://www.greenairmonitoring.co.uk", null, "fp7_101121_965986335"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DA5"}
