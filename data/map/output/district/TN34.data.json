This project broadens out to  three new occupational sectors providing one months work placement for students in Spain. The project targets students from more disadvantaged backgrounds seeking to enhance their employability and broaden their view of the world of work through the internationalisation of thier curriculum and the work placement.\r\n\r\nThe VESI 2 objectives are to; \r\n- provide exceptional learning opportunities to some of the most deprived young people in the south east\r\n- enhance the development of both hard and soft, employability skills for sectors with a higher than average representation of students from disadvantaged communities,\r\n- enhance and develop linguistic ability,\r\n- building a stronger, more flexible workforce for the future,\r\n- encourage UK learners to develop European identities and broaden their cultural horizons,\r\n- enhance employment experience opportunities for VET learners through the provision of high quality 4 week work placements in either Spain (Seville),\r\n-use European models, frameworks and tools to improve and refreshen learning thereby internationilising these occupational sector curriculums,\r\n- make learning more relevant to the local regional national and international work place.\r\n\r\nThe Consortia College Partners are; Mid Kent College, West Kent College and Sussex Coast College Hastings. The project will select 252 VET learners, to take part in a 4 week mobility placement in Spain. Learners are drawn from deprived communities across the south east,  and are at risk of being;\r\n-educational under-achievers, \r\n-having limited experience of working, \r\n-dependent on state support, \r\n-prone to chaotic, unpredictable home lives, \r\n-in or leaving care, \r\n-vulnerable. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to provide a motivational experience for our learners by offering them an opportunity to attend a mobility placement with an employer in the Hospitality, Leisure,  Sport, Construction and Business Admin sectors. The project will provide linguistic support and cultural orientation as part of its preparatory training. Support and guidance will also be made available to students through workplace supervisors and buddies, and our receiving host partner, 3SI, will provide addition support to all learners during their period of mobility. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to address the needs of all its learners and the creation of Individual Learning Plans, will be used to guide the expectations of each work mobility placement. This document alongside the Europass is central to ensuring that the overall aims and objectives of our learners are met. The project will evaluate the data collected post each mobility, verifying the experience of our learners, employers, and those of our consortia partners. The results of this work will feed into our mobility timetable, and will ensure that quality development runs throughout project delivery with learning points worked into operational plans. Use of the Europass framework will ensure that skills acquisition of learners can be adequately captured. Distance traveled frameworks will also be used through the project to ensure that participants are able to see their growth in personal development. Students will have a significant role to play in the design and delivery of the programme with Student Ambassadors taking an active role in monitoring placements, promoting the programme and disseminating the results through social media avenues.\r\n\r\nThe project anticipates that UK learners will develop their employability skills, will acquire additional technical skills and soft skills,  and develop their linguistic ability through involvement in this mobility project. We anticipate that this experience, whilst also demonstrating important employment experience on CVs, will aid employability outcomes for our learners. This will be considered within our Evaluation Strategy. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that involvement in this VET mobility project this will be the starting point for greater transnational working across our partnership consortia, to find new partners with European colleges building even stronger links with both the UK and EU economy(s). The project also hopes to stimulate more innovative practice across the partnership, and more time for peers and practitioners to reflect on current methodologies, share good practice and provide support in a range of curriculum related areas by using the Europass tools  and platforms such as EPALE.", "http://www.sussexcoast.ac.uk", "Sussex Coast College Hastings", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-035506_coordinator"], ["1HL", "Ouverture Sur l'Europe", "The Work People", 6577.0, "Magenta Vocational High School was granted the title of Lyc\u00e9e des M\u00e9tiers des Services Administratifs (BO N\u00b0 29 of July 19th 2012). This title was renewed last December. Our High School prepares its pupils to their diploma of Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel (Level IV, the equivalent of the BTEC National) in Office Management and Administrative Work (around 390 students at the start of the academic year in September 2016). The proportion of scholarship holders is of 62% and it is increasing. Our school includes two European sections: one in Italian, the other one in English. These 2 sections concern all the levels of our high school: from the fifth year to the final year. It also hosts a ULIS section for mentally handicapped pupils as well as pupils with autistic troubles and a few disabled pupils .\r\n\r\nThe OSE 2017/2018 programme aims at sending 14 pupils in their final year of Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel in Office Management and Administrative Work on a four-week work placement, out of the 22 compulsory weeks spent on placement. We plan to send 6 students in the UK, in Eastbourne and the surrounding towns and 8 other students in Italy, in Rome. The concerned pupils will essentially come from the 2 European sections the high school counts: the one in English and the other one in Italian. The 14 mobilities will take place in a single flow of 4 weeks, during the last placement of final year of high school, from Monday, 15/01/2018 till Friday, 9/02/2018 or from Monday , 26/02/2018 till Friday, 23/03/2018.\r\n\r\nFor the students of English, the placements will take place in the town of Eastbourne (UK) or in the towns nearby.  Our new English partner since 2015/2016, Breakaway Agency (intermediary organisation) will welcome our students, supply host families with full board and places of internship in companies situated in the county of Sussex. We are asking for scholarships for mobilities in England for 6 students in their final year. The collaboration with this new intermediate partner started with the 2015/2016 OSE programme. A preparatory visit took place between December 14th and December 18th 2015. Then,10 pupils benefited from mobilities in Sussex in March 2016. This partnership was renewed for the current 2016/2017 OSE progamme which provides 5 mobilities in England partly financed by 2 ERASMUS+ grants for learners and 1 grant for an accompanying adult (we were on the waiting list in 2016 and we have been granted only a very small part of the funds we expected.\r\n\r\nFor 2017/2017, we are thus asking for grants in England for 6 final year students of vocational high school preparing their Baccalaur\u00e9at in Office Management and Administrative Work \r\n\r\nAs for the students in Italian,  the partnership with the Xarxa FP network has been set up since 2012/2013. A  preparatory visit was done in May 2012 by Mrs Tournier \u2013 the former chef de travaux and Mrs Ozanne, a DNL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) teacher in Italian. It allowed them to understand how the Xarxa FP network works and how important it is to go through this association which is very helpful for the students' mobility. Indeed, it looks for placement and accommodation places, proposes adapted means of transport and public transport tickets. Moreover, it is present in case problems may occur.  The teacher in charge of the European Section in Italian (Mrs Ozanne) also made a second preparatory visit in October, 2014 to specify the conditions of the mobilities in the city of Rome. In 2014/2015, 5 pupils of the European section in Italian did their mobilities in Rome. Then, in 2015/2016, 5 other pupils performed their last work placement in Rome in March 2016. We are very often in contact with the persons who are responsible for the Xarxa FP network in Rome : thus Mr OSTUNI came to Lyon last December 2016 to meet the future applicants for 2017/2018.\r\n\r\nWe are thus asking for grants in Italy for 8 final year students preparing their Baccalaur\u00e9at in Office Management and Administrative Work, including a student with an autistic profile who has been integrated in a form of Baccalaureat Professionnel in Office Management and Administrative Work for two years. \r\n\r\nThis experience in an English or in an Italian company will be of great importance for our students who will later have to adapt themselves professionally to constant changes in the field of economy. Such a professional and linguistic experience will allow the students to discover and develop their own skills, mature their European consciousness and to prepare them to go on with their studies. It is a key programme in the strategy of our school . It will reinforce our commitment in developing the integration of underprivileged students (important number of scholarship holders and pupils with handicaps among our population of students), in promoting equalities of opportunities between boys and girls and in developing the learning of foreign languages", "http://hastingsworks.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-035750_2"], ["1BA", "Formation en R\u00e9seau Europ\u00e9en Collaboratif pour une H\u00f4tellerie d'Excellence III", "Sussex Coast College Hastings", 86391.0, "FRECHE II PROJECT SUMMARY 2017-2018\r\nFRECHE II PROJECT FRECHE: European Collaborative Network Training for Quality Hospitality, third edition.\r\nOBJECTIVES: Placing 38 hospitality students in European establishments for an acquisition of professional, linguistic, intercultural and behaviour skills in order to assist their professional integration. \r\nDURATION: 12 months from 06/01/2017 to 05/31/2018. \r\nMANAGEMENT: Pilot committee: 2 headmasters, 1 overseer, 1 manager, 8 language and professional education professors, \r\n1 highly experienced coordinator (9 Leonardo, 2 Erasmus+).  PARTICIPANTS: 3 determined groups: September \u2013 October 2017 (Graduating professional BAC chefs and waiters, 7 weeks), Jannuary-February 2018 (Graduating technological BAC hospitality, 5 weeks) and April-May 2018 (Reception, 7 weeks) It is of dire necessity that they gain experience moving around in order to ensure their professional and language proficiency as well as gaining other skills while being true European citizens who can immerse themselves in local cultures as future European workers. It is also essential that the students realize the benefits of gaining work experience abroad. They will be discovering and analysing a new culture through immersion and a quality support program and encountering local young people through European partners which will help them acquire intercultural experience and behaviour essential to their ultimate satisfaction. They need to master behaviour codes and language registers as well gain self-confidence in the work environment. The various beneficial professional, linguistic, cultural, professional, and personal factors make this an enriching experience that reinforces their skills and ensures their professional success. After two successful projects (2013-2014 and 2015/2017), the program would like to lean away from expertise to focus more on exchanges and European mobility in order to portray an attractive and enriching experience while using an international approach in teaching and educational practices. The initiation project depends largely on international openness and the installation of solid partners willing to facilitate students\u2019 mobility in order to foster best practices among European teachers and make the most of the students\u2019 training. Thus language is giving top priority (ETOILE label, Cervantes, Cambridge et Goethe language certifications). We are registered in the touristic development of the Languedoc-Roussillon region where there is an increasing need for highly qualified hospitality professionals to meet growing needs in the tourism industry.\r\nPARTNERSHIPS: The project depends on quality partnerships among secondary schools, a university, various companies, and educational institutions that have experience hosting, training, supporting, and evaluating students. Hosting companies offer high quality service as intermediary establishments assuring connections. These top quality cultural environments allow an exceptional cultural preparation plan (i.e. saffron culture, Le Greco, Cervant\u00e8s, Don Quichote in Toledo, Mir\u00f3 and Barcel\u00f3 in Palma, Dal\u00ed and Picasso in Catalonia, Guiness's distillery in Dublin, William the Conqueror and the hastings's battle...) \r\nDESTINATIONS: Spain: Toledo (Castilla la Mancha), Palma de Mallorca (Balearic Islands) and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Canarian Islands). Poland: Lublin (Lublinie). England: Eastbourne and Hastings (East Sussex). Ireland: Dublin. \r\n EVALUATION: We can ensure that we will achieve our anticipated results using post-mobility assessment meetings, questionnaires to be completed by students and companies, debriefing interviews, oral language exams, and specific exams conducted in european courses.", "http://www.sussexcoast.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036137_13"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["3UY", "CHART (Connecting Hastings and Rother Together) Phase 2", "Hastings Borough Council", "Promoting self-employment, small business start-ups, supporting micro-businesses, attracting inward investment as key contributions to creating new jobs and securing economic benefits.
