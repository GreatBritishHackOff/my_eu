One expected consequence of these on new tyres will be the slow decreasing of the interest on retreaded tyres in the market. This will compromise the future activity of SMEs working in the field, and also determine a fatal risk for the smallest enterprises.\nTherefore, it is of vital importance for the retreaded truck tyre sector (400 companies, of which 95% SMEs and 14 SME associations/groupings in Europe who allow 50% of European trucks to drive on retreaded tyres) to find a scientifically sound and cost effective methodology for classification of retreaded truck tyres in order to comply with future environmental performance and safety requirements.\nTo maintain the standard in a long-term prospective, and hopefully even increase the market for retreaded tyres, it is necessary to provide clear statistic and reproducible results on the retreads performances. Only in such a way it would be possible to compete with the new tyre market.\nThe concept is to investigate all relevant parameters related to casings, retreading process and treads applied and to determine the influence thereof on the tyre performance. And to find a scientifically sound and cost effective methodology (important aspect of the methodology is that it is self supporting/developing) for classification of retreaded truck tyres in order to comply with future environmental performance and safety requirements.\nThe overall objective is to find a scientifically sound and cost effective methodology for classification of retreaded truck tyres in order to comply with future environmental performance and safety requirements.\nThe outcome of the test will determine the impact of certain parameters making clear the predictability of the environmental and safety performances before manufacturing.", 32625.0, 2122119.0, "RETYRE", null, null, null, "http://www.retyre-project.eu/", "http://www.bandvulc.com", null, "fp7_103151_971460433"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PL21"}
