One expected consequence of these on new tyres will be the slow decreasing of the interest on retreaded tyres in the market. This will compromise the future activity of SMEs working in the field, and also determine a fatal risk for the smallest enterprises.\nTherefore, it is of vital importance for the retreaded truck tyre sector (400 companies, of which 95% SMEs and 14 SME associations/groupings in Europe who allow 50% of European trucks to drive on retreaded tyres) to find a scientifically sound and cost effective methodology for classification of retreaded truck tyres in order to comply with future environmental performance and safety requirements.\nTo maintain the standard in a long-term prospective, and hopefully even increase the market for retreaded tyres, it is necessary to provide clear statistic and reproducible results on the retreads performances. Only in such a way it would be possible to compete with the new tyre market.\nThe concept is to investigate all relevant parameters related to casings, retreading process and treads applied and to determine the influence thereof on the tyre performance. And to find a scientifically sound and cost effective methodology (important aspect of the methodology is that it is self supporting/developing) for classification of retreaded truck tyres in order to comply with future environmental performance and safety requirements.\nThe overall objective is to find a scientifically sound and cost effective methodology for classification of retreaded truck tyres in order to comply with future environmental performance and safety requirements.\nThe outcome of the test will determine the impact of certain parameters making clear the predictability of the environmental and safety performances before manufacturing.", 32625.0, 2122119.0, "RETYRE", null, null, null, "http://www.retyre-project.eu/", "http://www.bandvulc.com", null, "fp7_103151_971460433"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9JL", "Eurojoven Castilla y Le\u00f3n", "Endsleigh Garden Centre", 250547.0, "Eurojoven Castilla y Leon is a project born of the need to join forces on the part of the public body competent in matters of youth in the region and the educational centers of different provinces. Both agents want to offer an answer to increase the employability of their young people as well as to improve the level of English. 60 young people with VET diplomas in different professional fields carry out a 90-day mobility to a company in another country: United Kingdom, Ireland, Czech Republic or Poland. In the company he/she follow a itinerary of learning with the support of the companies and the contact from the consortium. 22 VET educational centers in all provinces of Castilla y Leon are part of the national consortium promoted by Instituto de la Juventud de Castilla y Leon. The beneficiaries are young people between the ages of 18 and 25 who have recently graduated in a VET. Their level of English is between A2 and B1. It is a matter of facilitating this step between their educational pathway and professional life, acquiring with this experience a greater autonomy, security, learning techniques, English, values of tolerance, respect, identity and cultural diversity. The project pursues objectives such as the following:\r\n- To facilitate the young people of Castilla y Leon an experience outside their comfort zone to develop their comepetences, abilities and attitudes related to autonomy.\r\n- To create a learning space in a safe working environment related to the training field in which the participant is entitled. To promote knowledge of methods and work styles in other countries.\r\n- To enhancement the employability of 60 young people in Castilla y Leon, adding to the CV of the young people and the participants a remarkable work experience, as well as the establishment of contacts within the companies in which they practice.\r\n- To guide the graduates in the region in the design of a training and work plan that allows them to meet their expectations according to their competencies.\r\n- To promote the use of the Europass CV and the system of recognition of credits and qualifications not only through studies, also experiences such as certification of Europass mobility.\r\n- To provide a response to people with difficulties in continuing their studies in insertion in the labor market for fewer opportunities (for this application 16 people with this profile have been submitted).\r\n- To offer a learning beyond the contemplated in the classroom, in the line of the educational plans of the formative cycle.\r\n- To increase the attractiveness of the centers of the region as well as their institutions, their recognition in the effort to respond to the demands of young people.\r\n- To improve the level of foreign languages, mainly English, beneficiaries and the national institutions partners of the project.\r\n- To learn more about the European labor market, which is constantly changing.\r\n- To put into practice the flexibility and adaptability of public centers and organizations in their decision-making and implementation. To facilitate collaborative work and remove administrative barriers.\r\n- To strengthen the cooperation between different organizations with the same user profile: the young person recently graduated in VET in Castilla y Leon and thus respond with more quality and use of resources to their needs.\r\n- To improve the image of the educational system and the measures in place in Spain on youth issues.\r\n- To bring institutions closer to young people and vice versa.\r\nThe results of the project focus on the profile of youth and project partners at local, regional and national level, as the improvement of situations that concern all levels related to youth: youth unemployment. At local level, with the return of the majority of the participants and their placement in companies where knowledge and acquired skills are turned over, a medium-term increase in quality of work is noted. Unemployment levels fell in the region and, therefore, at national level.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037606_13"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PL21"}
