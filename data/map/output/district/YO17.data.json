CVT is a UK charity comprised of two communities which subsist through sustainable agriculture,  production of a variety of handcrafts and being a place of shared living and learning for people of all cultures and abilities. Both of our communities\u2014the Grange Village and Oaklands Park\u2014are situated in England\u2019s outstandingly beautiful Forest of Dean. Together, the Grange and Oaklands serve as live-in communities for more than sixty people with special needs, include biodynamic, organic farms and gardens, wood workshops, a bakery, pottery, basketry, a fully functioning theatre and communal celebration space, and will be home to our 12 EVS volunteers.\r\n\r\nCVT has a long and successful history of hosting international volunteers, as, in Camphill culture, volunteering is understood to be a rewarding way to make a positive impact on the lives of others, as well as being a wonderful opportunity to develop new skills and abilities. On a deeper level, the central principle of volunteering\u2014that labour is offered free of a monetary evaluation of its worth\u2014is understood to be inherently ennobling and an ideal of the human relationship to work.\r\n\r\nThis will be the 3rd edition of our \u201cCamphill Life Sharing EVS project\u201d. It will be a 10-months volunteering placement for 12 volunteers from Germany, Hungary, Italy, Croatia, Spain and Portugal.\r\n\r\nVolunteers at CVT provide support to vulnerable adults in working with them in our gardens and craft workshops, while developing knowledge and practical skills that will be useful to them for the rest of their lives. They also participate in artistic and cultural events, including concerts, theatre performances, and festival celebrations and are supported to initiate their own projects, in line with their personal aspirations. \r\n\r\nThe presence of young, international volunteers contributes immeasurably to the cultural enrichment of the Villagers, and helps them to realise their full potential in workshop activities. The volunteers, meanwhile, benefit from. developing meaningful friendships with people with learning difficulties, which opens the minds and hearts of young people to an understanding of true human worth. The volunteers are inspired by the wisdom and patience of those who have spent their lives managing or overcoming a variety of disabilities. \r\n\r\nThe volunteers benefit as well from the intercultural experience provided at CVT. through undertaking many cultural and leisure activities together with local and European volunteers. They form close, lasting friendships with one another and in the process, develop intercultural sensitivities and perspectives on their own identities in relation to the UK and the EU.\r\n\r\nLong-term benefits to young volunteers are the development of language and interpersonal communication skills, perspective on the realities of running an active charity and many other hands-on skills, all of which enhance their employability and expand their options after this project\u2019s completion. Volunteers\u2019 personal development is also enhanced with the maturation of their self-worth, happiness, physical, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing. Individual mentorship is established to support the growth of each individual.\r\n\r\nLong-term benefits to CVT include the smooth running of workshop activity and the continuation of the volunteer tradition that is an integral aspect of Camphill culture.\r\n\r\nParticipants in this project have the opportunity to forge important connections within the global context of the Camphill movement. From their response to this experience and their desires for their future, each participant will be individually supported to identify and pursue opportunities for further study in formal and non-formal education, biodynamic apprenticeships, craft apprenticeships, short or long-term volunteer placements and employment within the Camphill movement in twenty-three countries in Europe, North America, Africa, and Asia. This stands to generate important wide-reaching, long-term benefits to both the Camphill movement and the Erasmus+ programme, which both gain international visibility from participants continuing to represent them in subsequent placements abroad.", "http://www.cvt.org.uk", "The Camphill Village Trust Ltd.", "erasmus_2017-2-UK01-KA105-036961_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "YO17"}
