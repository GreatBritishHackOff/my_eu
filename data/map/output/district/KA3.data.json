This problem is far from being solved. The main challenge encountered is that most autologous skin grafting techniques are based on transplanting split-thickness skin (the today\u2019s gold standard). Split-thickness skin contains all of the epidermis, but only remnants of the dermis. This lack of dermal tissue, frequently leads to significant scarring. Consequently, a true dermal substitute is required, which instantly exerts the cell-instructive properties of a neo-dermis. The partners of EuroSkinGraft can now offer 2 dermal substitutes, Novomaix and denovoDerm, plus the dermo-epidermal skin substitute denovoSkin. The development of all 3 substitutes was significantly supported by the FP6-program (EuroSTEC). The envisaged clinical studies are aiming strictly at a one-step surgical procedure (instead of the common two-step procedure, using Integra Artificial Skin).This is to be reached with the following protocol:\nClinical application of Novomaix\n1.\tExperimental arm 1: split-thickness skin on Novomaix applied on full-thickness wounds\n2.\tReference arm 1: split-thickness skin applied directly on the wound bed\nClinical application of denovoDerm\n1.\tExperimental arm 1: split-thickness skin on denovoDerm applied on full-thickness wounds\n2.\tReference arm 1: split-thickness skin applied directly on the wound bed\nClinical application of denovoSkin\n1.\tExperimental arm 1: denovoSkin applied on full-thickness wounds\n2.\tReference arm 1: split-thickness skin applied directly on the wound bed\nThe strength of this project lies in: the high degree to which real regenerative medicine is translated into the clinic, the innovative and highly functional character of the 3 products to be tested, the central contribution of the 3 SMEs, and the excellence of the 3 clinics.", 322878.0, 6310609.0, "EUROSKINGRAFT", "Optimised grafts for severe skin defects", "A European research initiative is continuing development of the skin substitutes Novomaix, denovoDerm and denovoSkin. Clinical studies are testing a one-step surgical procedure.", "Large full-thickness skin defects resulting from burns and tumour removal, for example, still present significant clinical problems. Use of split-thickness skin, taken from the patient, can result in significant scarring due to possible lack of dermal tissue. Another option, acellular artificial skin available to date, involves at least two operations.\n\nThe project http://www.euroskingraft.eu (EUROSKINGRAFT) (A novel generation of skin substitutes to clinically treat a broad spectrum of severe skin defects) is bringing the three novel skin-reconstitution products through clinical trials and then to European and international markets.\n\nNovomaix is an acellular off-the-shelf product that EUROSKINGRAFT expects will improve the pliability of the split-thickness skin grafts. It is slated to provide adequate patient care when the option of a bioengineered graft is not available. Novomaix has received Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (CE) certification and the safety analysis has been completed.\n\ndenovoDerm is also designed to be used in conjunction with split-thickness skin in one procedure only. The dermis-like properties of denovoDerm instantly and significantly support the overlying split-thickness skin. The result is a smooth pigmented product that grows with the patient.\n\nAt the high end, denovoSkin doesn't need split-thickness skin apart from the small biopsy itself. As a result, considerable trauma for the patient is avoided. For use with both paediatrics and adults, it also grows with the patient and produces excellent cosmetic and functional results.\n\nPhase I of clinical trials for denovoDerm and denovoSkin commenced in June 2014. The first clinical studies suggest that scarring and shrinking are minimal with both products. For production of denovoSkin and denovoDerm, five compression devices are now ready for the plastic compression of collagen type\u00a0I hydrogels under good manufacturing practice conditions. In addition, development of packaging and sterilisation has been completed.\n\nIn parallel, six types of accessory disposable devices have been extensively tested, packaged and sterilised. Some of these devices are compression-associated; others are cell culture-associated. For the rest of the project term, histological, biochemical and genetic analysis of the products prior to and after transplantation will be ongoing.\n\nThe bio-engineered skins are all highly functional and represent the pinnacle of regenerative medicine as applied in the clinic. Generally, the quality of life for a large group of patients requiring skin grafts will be significantly improved. The skin substitutes can be used for treatment of burns, plastic reconstructive surgery and aesthetic procedures. In particular, denovoSkin may be used for chronic wounds such as ulcers and vitiligo where the skin pigment has disappeared.", "http://www.euroskingraft.eu/", "http://www.medicaldevice.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/161094.jpg", "fp7_101996_968950170"], ["5DB", "Development of novel composite material for safety helmets, boat hulls and lifeboat containers that has self-repairing and visual inspection features", "Culzean Textile Solutions Ltd", "Our idea is to develop the novel composite material that contains microencapsulated polymer spheres containing coloured resins.

The students coming from this school  belong to families with low socio-cultural level, limited economic resources and at risk of social exclusion.On the other hand, our school belongs to the net of plurilingual schools of Valencian Community and is a pioneering centre in our Community on teaching through two foreign languages (English and French) simultaneously. This allows some  of our pupils complete their studies in Secondary Education knowing four European languages: The two-cooficial and two foreign.Federica Montseny School wants to do the project \u201clanguages a motor of inclusion\u201d to include all our students in the Educative system and also in the European reality through the learning of languages, favouring their personal development, social inclusion and feeling of European Citizenship.Our main objectives focus on the improvement of all the students\u2019 linguistic competence in foreign languages, increase the multilingual courses on offer (levels and subjects), update / upgrade teacher\u2019s expertise  in didactics and methodology as well as their own language proficiency, applying new ICTs  in the classroom, getting to know at close hand an educational system with a different way of grouping students which allows us lay the foundations for a more inclusive future, increase the number of teachers involved in European projects, enhance our institution\u2019s capacity for international cooperation, increase our contacts network and contribute to develop  a European citizenship awareness in our students and institution. From all the teaching staff, the selection panel will choose 7 teachers who best meet the established profile for each mobility according to the scale set out in the project. Participants will carry out the following activities:1. Job shadowing at \u201cGrange Academy\u201d in Kilmarnock, Scotland:two teachers, one in the scientific, technical field and another in the sociolinguistic field will visit a school in the Spring of 2017 in order to get to know the Scottish educational system, its curriculum and institutional linguistic policies. They will analyse/ how this policy is applied and how ICTs are used in the classroom.2. Study visit to secondary schools and Training seminars in Belgium. 2 teachers will do job shadowing and training activities for 7 days, from 12 to 18 February, 2017. Its aim is  to take a close look at how different subjects are taught in English, to exchange professional and cultural experiences and discuss problems found at schools, educational systems and students regarding the topics mentioned. 3. Course on CLIL methodology in England: 1 teacher during 12 days from 18 to 29 July 2016 will take part in a course which aims to learn the fundamentals, develop and evaluate didactic resources and design didactic units which will help promote integration of all the students in the multilingual approach. 4. Course for teachers of  English in Ireland: \u201c\u201cExploring English and Culture in Ireland: Inquiry based methodology for Teachers of English\u201d 2 TEACHERS of English will do a 12 day training course in July 2016 the aims of which are to create an active  Portfolio, analyse Irish culture and literature, share didactic resources with other teachers, literacy across the curriculum,  promote the European dimension in education through strategies likely to lead to future KA2 partnershipsThe teachers taking part in the project will round out their teacher training in different points. Once the project has been accepted and after the selection panel has chosen the suitable teachers, each one will sign an agreement with the school, commiting to accomplishing the task program and the settled schedule for the mobility, and also to all the activities that will be carried out while the project is on. We expect the project \u201clanguages a motor of inclusion\u201d will motivate our students, increasing their self-esteem and encouraging their adaptation to school. A distinguishing mark of our school is our concern about offering our students a high standard in foreign languages. Thanks to this project, we will improve and increase our multilingual courses on offer, so that it reaches the most students at our school.The language training and direct watching of the methodology used by other schools will let us address high quality plurilingual programs.We mean to get the training needed to integrate all the students in the educative system and in the European reality, through language learning, favouring their personal development, their social inclusion and awareness of European citizenship.", "http://Www.east-ayrshire.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA101-023329_1"], ["7DF", "Language Immersion Course", "Kilmarnock Academy", 3207.0, "Whilst this application is for one secondary school teacher from James Hamilton Academy to take part in a Spanish language immersion course, our whole staff team are committed to raising attainment in language learning, in line with the Scottish Government\u2019s 1+2 Languages Approach and the national curriculum. The training course selected would allow Fiona to be sent on a 3-week course run by LFEE, which would complement the learning of Spanish that she has already undertaken through a local University. \r\n\r\nThe course activities will include learning Spanish vocabulary and grammar with native speakers, gaining greater understanding of Spanish culture, learning about the Spanish education system, developing new methods of teaching languages and using ICT to motivate and assist learners. The activities, resources and materials received will be shared with school colleagues and across East Ayrshire.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this project we anticipate an increase in language capacity, improved confidence when teaching Spanish, the acquisition of teaching ideas to provide stimulating and engaging language lessons and ICT being used more fully in language learning. This will allow our learners to access foreign languages more fully and provide scope for links to be made with European schools. In the longer term, we hope to raise attainment in language learning, ignite enthusiasm for learning about other languages and cultures and therefore see an increased uptake of languages in the senior school.
