This problem is far from being solved. The main challenge encountered is that most autologous skin grafting techniques are based on transplanting split-thickness skin (the today\u2019s gold standard). Split-thickness skin contains all of the epidermis, but only remnants of the dermis. This lack of dermal tissue, frequently leads to significant scarring. Consequently, a true dermal substitute is required, which instantly exerts the cell-instructive properties of a neo-dermis. The partners of EuroSkinGraft can now offer 2 dermal substitutes, Novomaix and denovoDerm, plus the dermo-epidermal skin substitute denovoSkin. The development of all 3 substitutes was significantly supported by the FP6-program (EuroSTEC). The envisaged clinical studies are aiming strictly at a one-step surgical procedure (instead of the common two-step procedure, using Integra Artificial Skin).This is to be reached with the following protocol:\nClinical application of Novomaix\n1.\tExperimental arm 1: split-thickness skin on Novomaix applied on full-thickness wounds\n2.\tReference arm 1: split-thickness skin applied directly on the wound bed\nClinical application of denovoDerm\n1.\tExperimental arm 1: split-thickness skin on denovoDerm applied on full-thickness wounds\n2.\tReference arm 1: split-thickness skin applied directly on the wound bed\nClinical application of denovoSkin\n1.\tExperimental arm 1: denovoSkin applied on full-thickness wounds\n2.\tReference arm 1: split-thickness skin applied directly on the wound bed\nThe strength of this project lies in: the high degree to which real regenerative medicine is translated into the clinic, the innovative and highly functional character of the 3 products to be tested, the central contribution of the 3 SMEs, and the excellence of the 3 clinics.", 322878.0, 6310609.0, "EUROSKINGRAFT", "Optimised grafts for severe skin defects", "A European research initiative is continuing development of the skin substitutes Novomaix, denovoDerm and denovoSkin. Clinical studies are testing a one-step surgical procedure.", "Large full-thickness skin defects resulting from burns and tumour removal, for example, still present significant clinical problems. Use of split-thickness skin, taken from the patient, can result in significant scarring due to possible lack of dermal tissue. Another option, acellular artificial skin available to date, involves at least two operations.\n\nThe project http://www.euroskingraft.eu (EUROSKINGRAFT) (A novel generation of skin substitutes to clinically treat a broad spectrum of severe skin defects) is bringing the three novel skin-reconstitution products through clinical trials and then to European and international markets.\n\nNovomaix is an acellular off-the-shelf product that EUROSKINGRAFT expects will improve the pliability of the split-thickness skin grafts. It is slated to provide adequate patient care when the option of a bioengineered graft is not available. Novomaix has received Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (CE) certification and the safety analysis has been completed.\n\ndenovoDerm is also designed to be used in conjunction with split-thickness skin in one procedure only. The dermis-like properties of denovoDerm instantly and significantly support the overlying split-thickness skin. The result is a smooth pigmented product that grows with the patient.\n\nAt the high end, denovoSkin doesn't need split-thickness skin apart from the small biopsy itself. As a result, considerable trauma for the patient is avoided. For use with both paediatrics and adults, it also grows with the patient and produces excellent cosmetic and functional results.\n\nPhase I of clinical trials for denovoDerm and denovoSkin commenced in June 2014. The first clinical studies suggest that scarring and shrinking are minimal with both products. For production of denovoSkin and denovoDerm, five compression devices are now ready for the plastic compression of collagen type\u00a0I hydrogels under good manufacturing practice conditions. In addition, development of packaging and sterilisation has been completed.\n\nIn parallel, six types of accessory disposable devices have been extensively tested, packaged and sterilised. Some of these devices are compression-associated; others are cell culture-associated. For the rest of the project term, histological, biochemical and genetic analysis of the products prior to and after transplantation will be ongoing.\n\nThe bio-engineered skins are all highly functional and represent the pinnacle of regenerative medicine as applied in the clinic. Generally, the quality of life for a large group of patients requiring skin grafts will be significantly improved. The skin substitutes can be used for treatment of burns, plastic reconstructive surgery and aesthetic procedures. In particular, denovoSkin may be used for chronic wounds such as ulcers and vitiligo where the skin pigment has disappeared.", "http://www.euroskingraft.eu/", "http://www.medicaldevice.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/161094.jpg", "fp7_101996_968950170"], ["5DB", "Development of novel composite material for safety helmets, boat hulls and lifeboat containers that has self-repairing and visual inspection features", "Culzean Textile Solutions Ltd", "Our idea is to develop the novel composite material that contains microencapsulated polymer spheres containing coloured resins.

This will allow our learners to access foreign languages more fully and provide scope for links to be made with European schools. In the longer term, we hope to raise attainment in language learning, ignite enthusiasm for learning about other languages and cultures and therefore see an increased uptake of languages in the senior school.
