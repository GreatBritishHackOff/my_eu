Many factors influence urban security, from the physical layout to the social and economic makeup of urban zones, from the political and economic landscape on a national level to the daily practices of public services that are active in the area. Seemingly unrelated events may trigger sudden escalation of unrest in neighbourhoods that have been under social tension for a prolonged period of time. Europe has seen many severe instances of urban unrest in recent times, but also the rapid expansion of new urban environments, and new types of communities due to migration, economic tension and social developments. These developments demand a better understanding of urban security throughout Europe, and more sensible policy development to create safer urban environments, and prevent undesirable security scenarios.\n\n\n\nPolicy makers need to know and understand which factors directly or indirectly impact urban security and safety. This includes an appreciation of security status (such as threat levels and potential for crime) as well as public perception of safety and security. A failure by policy makers to timely recognise and mitigate such threats may allow unrest to develop, and consequently affect the prosperity and functionality of the area. Policy makers need to become aware of the interdependency of factors, and define policy based on that comprehension. However, in reality, most decisions are made on the basis of local, long-standing best practices. Given the universal importance of urban security, it is vital to share knowledge and practices among stakeholders throughout Europe, and to jointly work on a common understanding of urban security.\n\n\n\nThe project \u2018Best practice Enhancers for Security in Urban Regions\u2019 (BESECURE) will work towards a better understanding of urban security through examination of different European urban areas. By examining 8 urban areas throughout Europe, BESECURE will build a comprehensive and pragmatic set of indicators, and a pragmatic risk assessment model that can provide cues about the development of certain scenarios. BESECURE will improve urban security policy making by sharing best practices that are in use throughout Europe, and by providing visualisation and assessment tools and guidelines that will help local policy makers to assess the impact of their practices, and improve their decision making.", 91742.0, 3525343.0, "BESECURE", "Best practices for urban security", "Policymakers are being given the right tools to help foster more secure urban environments.", "Urban security in Europe is a crucial process that also varies from country to country in terms of both approach and focus. Therefore, finding a methodology that works and supports the common goal of creating safer living conditions and resilience is key.\n\nThis is one of the main aims of the EU-funded project 'Best practice enhancers for security in urban environments' (http://www.besecure-project.eu (BESECURE)) . The initiative seeks to support local policymakers in their efforts to heighten and apply advanced urban zone security measures.\n\nThe project identified a need for finding and handling the primary symptoms that impact urban security in order to prevent any escalation in threatening scenarios. Utilising a best practice approach by combining interlinked datasets to function as a warning system is the most effective method to cover all needs across countries. BESECURE groups its four main objectives in the categories knowledge, understand, develop and transfer, which appropriately describes the pattern of what achieving urban security entails.\n\nWhen policymakers have the right tools based on background material as well as innovative data, they can create the appropriate policies to effectively instil measures of urban security. Thus, key project activities involve not only research but also the creation of a support tool and eight case studies in order to arrive at an integrated policy design support platform.\n\nA prototype of the platform has been created and this has propelled the internal project development plan.

All projects aim at helping small VET schools which lack the means or the experience to put forward an individual mobility project to take part in an Erasmus + KA1 VET project.

It is made up of 23 VET programmes belonging to 18 vocational fields.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at meeting the needs of its members, in particular:\r\n-Modernize the schools and boost the appeal and quality of their Intermediate VET \r\n-Acquire the necessary skills to implement the dual learning apprenticeship model\r\n-Initiate or consolidate internationalization \r\n-Incorporate the European dimension in the curriculum\r\n-Improve the participant\u2019s global competences \r\n-Ameliorate key competences in students and boost professional competence in teachers.\r\n\r\nThese needs would translate into the following project objectives:  Contribute to lowering school drop out rates. Diversify the educational offering of the dual learning apprenticeship model. Give educational institutions a global dimension while fostering transnational mobility. Raise employability of Intermediate VET graduates and increase the number of students going on to study Higher VET.\r\n\r\nWith a means to achieve these objectives, two types of mobilities are being considered:\r\n- Mobility of 74 students to take their 5 week on-the-job training in companies in Germany, UK, Italy and Finland \r\n- Mobility of 44 CFGM teachers and members of the Department for Education, with a view to do job shadowing for the dual learning apprenticeship model in Germany the United Kingdom and Findland.\r\n \r\nIn order to make these mobilities a reality, there are 11 European VET shools acting as partners, all of them of considerable size, with international experience and most of them with previous experience of cooperation with the Department for Education. Agreements are celebrated for the exchange of teachers and students. The latter will be sent for internships to the companies with which agreements have been entered. The students will be also mentored by the VET institutions at their destination. The cooperation consists of visits, phone calls and emails.\r\n\r\nParticipants are selected at each educational institution, following a call and based on specific common criteria. Each school takes care of preparing for the visit on different dimensions: pedagogical, cultural, health and safety, trips, protection, etc. This preparation can also be done in cooperation with other schools be it a face to face cooperation or via the Moodle platform created to this effect. The students use the OLS and specific language courses,  and an online course is created for the staff at the Department for education. All participants sign learning agreements/work programs before the mobility takes place. \r\n\r\nThe sending institutions in close cooperation with the host partners organize travel arrangement, lodging and boarding, insurance, and offer the necessary advice to obtain the necessary documentation.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of skills and its communication to members is done using Europass and national instruments (credits for teacher training, recognition of on-the-job training hours, certificate of participation).\r\n\r\nThe assessment plan includes the proposal, methodology, learning results, impact, objectives, dissemination and statistics. It includes questionnaires and/or statistics analysis from the Department of Education and it caters for contingencies or poor quality of activities. \r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes are: \r\n-Increased interest by teachers on European projects \r\n-Growing number of institutions offering the dual learning apprenticeship model; \r\n-Improvement in management of transnational mobility\r\n-Better academic outcomes \r\n-Network creation; \r\n-Decrease in early school leaving rates\r\n-Changes in the Administration to facilitate these projects and their participation in KA2 and KA3;\r\n-Awareness of institutions and regional companies. \r\n\r\nThe impact is measured with numerical indicators calculated from statistical data and questionnaires.\r\n\r\nThe dissemination plan  and achieved results disseminates on traditional, social media and on the Web: the assignment and results of the project, the experiences of participants (reports on the website, dual VET educational sessions); sessions about organization of mobility in Erasmus + FP projects; debriefings to potential participants; hosting of  foreign participants; electronic posting at the end of the project with the results and experiences of participants.
