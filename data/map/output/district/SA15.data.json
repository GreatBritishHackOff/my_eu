Centuries old. A place of searing beauty. A cosmopolitan university town located on the west coast of Wales between the Irish Sea and a mountainous hinterland of isolated farms and loose-knit villages. A natural crucible of colliding worlds, where history, myth and tradition come face to face with the modern and contemporary. But its panoramic vistas and quaint facade hide a multitude of sins - this is a place that lives according to its own rules, a place where grudges fester, where the secrets of the past are buried deep.Into this world steps DCI Tom Mathias. On the run from his past, our thirty-eight year old hero is a brilliant but troubled man. Having abandoned his life in London, he finds himself holed up in a trailer park on the outskirts of town - a place filled with secrets as dark and destructive as his own. His partner in crime DI Mared Rhys. 33 years old, Mared is intelligent and complex with demons of her own to conceal. Together, enigmatic outsider Mathias and hometown girl Mared form an engaging partnership.Mathias is at the heart of every story. He is a man we instinctively trust, a man who knows that the key to solving that ultimate anti-social crime, murder, lies not in where you look for truth, but how you look. From the windswept sand dunes of the coastline to the badlands of the hinterland and beyond, this is a detective drama with pace, poetry and scale.

We are talking about students between the ages of 17 and 25.\r\nThis project is also addressed to the faculty of the Department of Training Cycles of Sports Activities for the realization of observation and shadowing job practices in host companies and partner centers that we have as project partners.\r\nIn addition, with this project, we want to make it easier for the students and the teachers involved to approach and integrate in Europe, while facilitating the learning of other languages and cultures.\r\nWe want and are prepared to exercise direct control over mobilities, including mentoring, follow-up, direct contact with the host partners and training agreements.\r\nIn the project 2017 Son Rullan Practices in Europe, in addition to the management team and the coordinators of FCT and the mobility committee, is involved all the teachers of FP and especially the tutors of FCT of the professional family that has the center: Physical activities Sports\r\nOur center has an important cultural diversity, due to the varied origin of our students. Through the project 2017 Son Rullan Practices in Europe we want to strengthen the capacity for lifelong learning of our students and teachers to create in them a sense of European citizenship, based on understanding and respect for human rights and fostering tolerance with other countries and cultures. In the same way, we pay particular attention to the participation of groups that, due to their characteristics (special educational needs, socio-economic disadvantage, etc.) have risk being discriminated .\r\nThe mobility will last 4 weeks for the students and five days for the teaching staff and will be held, mainly, during the months of June and July of 2017 and 2018 which is when the practices in their specialty are realized. The countries of destination are Poland and Germany for pupils and Poland, Germany and Wales, United Kingdom for teaching staff, although this relationship may be extended due to the constant contacts we are making with centers in other countries.\r\nThe selection of the company is made through our contact with the host partner, who will be responsible for, among other things, finding a suitable placement for each student and follow up on them. Such collaboration is essential for the preparation and execution of the project and guarantees the reliability and sustainability of the project. The fact that we have collaborating partners with those who have worked previously, makes the quality of the mobility we offer is assured. Each of us knows what needs to be done in each moment and we are aware of the importance it has for the future of our students, that the training stays in the companies are really of quality and help to promote creativity, competitiveness, employability and also the promotion of entrepreneurship.\r\nThe fact of living on an island often makes it difficult for the students to make the decision to take a formative stay away from home. We want to break this. With the project 2017 Son Rullan Practices in Europe we want our students to travel and open their horizons to new experiences with people with other languages and companies from other European countries, so we respond to the operational objectives of the Erasmus + Program. With these experiences we hope to boost the possibility of finding their first job by being more competitive in the labor market adding a value to the practices. The real need for training has a direct link with the tourism sector, the main component of GDP of the Balearic Islands.\r\nThe expected impact of the practice on our students will be considerable by increasing employment opportunities, languaje improving and personal  madurity..\r\nThe teachers participants will have a clear of the forms of work in the host companies and partner partner centers of our project making the relevant modifications in the curriculum of each module in order to adapt and improve it", "http://www.colegsirgar.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-035275_1"], ["4DN", "PR\u00c1CTICAS DE FP: DEL SUBURBIO A EUROPA", "Coleg Sir Gar", 31902.0, "IES Jun\u00edper Serra is one of the focal points of Vocational Training of the Balearic Islands counting with a total enrollment of 1378 students. In difficult times such as these, vocational training is seen by the young and the elderly as a chance to compete in seeking and obtaining a workplace. Students place their expectations on their on-the-job training period,  therefore we have proposed this project to achieve the following targets:\r\na) That the students acquire a different vision of ways of working and customs having to deal with cultural and linguistic situations that are not known to them.\r\nb) Give an added value to the on-the-job training period and to the students\u2019 curriculum and improve their employability.\r\nc) Provide language skilled workers for those sectors in which the knowledge of languages is essential.\r\na) That teachers apply in the school the knowledge acquired as to good practice.\r\nb) To improve the students\u2019 preparation through the knowledge that teachers and tutors have acquired during job shadowing.\r\nc) Ensure that teachers integrate cultural and linguistic knowledge acquired in their lessons\r\nd) Ensure that teachers feel more involved and motivated in the process of student learning.\r\nIn total we request 14 student mobilities, 4 for teachers in job shadowing and two escorts for the eventuality that having underage students is given.\r\nStudents are young people who are attending the last year of electromechanical, kitchen and catering services. They are highly motivated students with very good skills and attitudes for the workplace. They are usually low-skilled at foreign languages which can make them feel unsafe in situations such as those we propose but we hope their self-esteem will increase at the time that they improve their skills in this area.\r\nRegarding the teachers\u2019 profile, the project is designed for teachers who are on-the-job training tutors, vocational training teachers who plan to be responsible for the  FCT, on-the-job training period, on-the-job training coordinator, European Programmes coordinator, FOL teachers and teachers that provide a subject in English.\r\nThe project will last 24 months. Activities take place throughout the entire program and will include the preparation phase in which the project will be spread to all levels. There will be a calendar in which the deadlines, meetings, seminars and briefings will be planned during this phase. Special emphasis will be placed on cultural, linguistic and health and safety matters as well as on the logistical aspects of mobility (travel, accommodation, insurance). During the mobility, participants will carry out the scheduled training activities and shall complete the follow-up documents agreed and will prepare those activities included in the dissemination plan of the project. When they return to Palma, previously agreed documents will be delivered. At this point an assessment of the activity will be carried out to be included in the evaluation process. There will be a mid-term evaluation of the programme so that improvements may be implement the following year. At the end of the programme a final evaluation of all processes will be done.\r\nICTs will be used throughout the entire program together with all the resources identified in the draft in order to reach the largest audience. All activities will follow a review process according to the quality standards of the school system.\r\nWe hope that career opportunities will expand for both teachers and students, they will improve in language and social skills and will be able to apply the benefits of their mobility experience for the benefit of their environment. We want the project to have a multiplier effect through the dissemination process in accordance with our possibilities. We would also like the project to result in the vision of our center as a benchmark of modernity and good practice at local and regional level. We also hope that our partners value the quality of teaching we provide and that they may see in our school the kind of institution that is also willing to share their resources to result in the training of other European citizens. We hope that in the long term, this project will lead to other collaborations with our partners in the various activities offered by the Erasmus + programme.", "http://www.colegsirgar.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037113_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SA15"}
