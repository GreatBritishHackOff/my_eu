Centuries old. A place of searing beauty. A cosmopolitan university town located on the west coast of Wales between the Irish Sea and a mountainous hinterland of isolated farms and loose-knit villages. A natural crucible of colliding worlds, where history, myth and tradition come face to face with the modern and contemporary. But its panoramic vistas and quaint facade hide a multitude of sins - this is a place that lives according to its own rules, a place where grudges fester, where the secrets of the past are buried deep.Into this world steps DCI Tom Mathias. On the run from his past, our thirty-eight year old hero is a brilliant but troubled man. Having abandoned his life in London, he finds himself holed up in a trailer park on the outskirts of town - a place filled with secrets as dark and destructive as his own. His partner in crime DI Mared Rhys. 33 years old, Mared is intelligent and complex with demons of her own to conceal. Together, enigmatic outsider Mathias and hometown girl Mared form an engaging partnership.Mathias is at the heart of every story. He is a man we instinctively trust, a man who knows that the key to solving that ultimate anti-social crime, murder, lies not in where you look for truth, but how you look.

The Welsh government has funded these posts and have developed policies and strategies across a number of sectors (including education) in order to increase the number of fluent Welsh speakers in Wales. The Basque country has faced similar problems to Wales in that they have seen a significant decrease in the number of people who can speak Basque, over recent centuries, and have successfully increased the number of fluent speakers to 32% (in 2011), compared to previous years (29.5% in 2001, 27.7% in 1996 and 24.1% in 1991). The most recent census in Wales saw a decrease in the number of Welsh speakers (down from 21% in 2001 to 19% in 2011), there is an opportunity here (in terms of added value) to share practices, methods, policies, strategies and for two countries with similar linguistic backgrounds to be able to support each other to develop within the Further Education sector. These developments are essential in order to create a successful workforce in Wales that can compete in difficult economic circumstances - research has shown that individuals with Welsh language skills are more likely to gain employment and perform better at higher qualifications in Wales. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives of Project:\r\n\r\nTo raise the profile and share good practice of post-14 bilingual and Welsh medium provision in the Basque country.\r\n\r\nTo learn about the strategic direction set out by the Government in the Basque country in order for them to be able to increase the number of fluent speakers in the country.\r\n\r\nTo establish whether working in partnership (and with which organisations) is crucial to achieving a substantial increase in the number of fluent speakers (of the Basque language).\r\n\r\nTo understand how the Government in the Basque country monitors objectives set out in policy and strategy documents to increase the number of fluent speakers (of the Basque language).\r\n\r\nTo observe good practice in relation to practitioner  training (Professional Graduate Certificate in Education) in Higher Education establishments, in particular, aspects of delivering post-14 provision bilingually or through the medium of a minority language.\r\n\r\nTo create new partnerships and understanding between Further Education establishments in Wales with Further and Higher Education establishments in the Basque country in order to develop a wider communication network.\r\n\r\nTo continue to improve the quality of Welsh medium and bilingual post-14 provision through the consideration of adopting practices and policies currently being implemented within educational establishments in the Basque country. \r\n\r\nTo share good practice in Welsh post-14 education with key individuals and establishments in the Basque country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\n\r\nFour Further Education Colleges and CollegesWales (the body that represents Colleges in Wales). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of activities:\r\n\r\nVisits with Government officials to learn about Basque language planning.\r\n\r\nVisit with a University to learn about Teacher Training in terms of bilingualism.\r\n\r\nVisit with a Vocation Education provider to learn about bilingual post-16 provision.\r\n\r\nShare good practices from Wales. \r\n\r\nLearn about effective partnership work and its impact on bilingualism and language planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults and Impact:\r\n\r\nNew skills and knowledge developed in minority language planning and bilingual post-16 provision and delivery.

This funding would enable apprentices to undertake two to three week work placements in Europe. The application was successful and subsequent centralised applications for funding in 2012 and 2013 have also been successful and have attracted funding between them of over 400,000 Euro enabling 138 participants(the project has included apprentices and IVET  learners since the 2012 application) to undertake short tem work placements in various European countries.  This is the first year that CollegesWales has submitted a centralised application for funding for staff mobility - the focus on improving teaching and learning within the FE sector in Wales has proved to be the catalyst for submitting a consortium application for funding in 2014 under Erasmus+ for staff mobility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project\r\n\r\nThe Erasmus+ guidance specifies procedures for bids to be entered on behalf of VET consortia - CollegesWales has adopted this methodology of applying for funding since its first Leonardo learner mobility application in 2011.

Through the project 2018 Son Rullan Placements in Europe we want to strengthen the capacity for lifelong learning of our students and teachers to create in them a sense of European citizenship, based on understanding and respect for human rights and fostering tolerance with other countries and cultures.  We also would like to improve the labour oportunities. In the same way, we pay particular attention to the participation of groups that, due to their characteristics (special educational needs, socio-economic disadvantage, etc.) have risk being discriminated .\r\nThe mobility will last 4 weeks for the students and five days for the teaching staff and will be held, mainly, during the months of June and July of 2019 which is when the practices in their specialty are realized. The countries of destination are Poland and Germany for pupils and Poland, Germany and Wales, United Kingdom for teaching staff, although this relationship may be extended due to the constant contacts we are making with centers in other countries.\r\nThe selection of the company is made through our contact with the host partner, who will be responsible for, among other things, finding a suitable placement for each student and follow up on them. Such collaboration is essential for the preparation and execution of the project and guarantees the reliability and sustainability of the project. The fact that we have collaborating partners with those who have worked previously, makes the quality of the mobility we offer is assured. Each of us knows what needs to be done in each moment and we are aware of the importance it has for the future of our students, that the training stays in the companies are really of quality and help to promote creativity, competitiveness, employability and also the promotion of entrepreneurship.\r\nThe fact of living on an island often makes it difficult for the students to make the decision to take a formative stay away from home. We want to break this. With the project 2018 Son Rullan Placements in Europe we want our students to travel and open their minds and horizons to new experiences with people with other languages and companies from other European countries, so we respond to the operational objectives of the Erasmus + Program. With these experiences we hope to boost the possibility of finding their first job by being more competitive in the labor market adding a value to the practices. The real need for training has a direct link with the tourism sector, the main component of GDP of the Balearic Islands.\r\nThe expected impact of the practice on our students will be considerable by increasing employment opportunities, languaje improving and personal  madurity..\r\nThe teachers participants will have a clear of the forms of work in the host companies and partner partner centers of our project making the relevant modifications in the curriculum of each module in order to adapt and improve it.
