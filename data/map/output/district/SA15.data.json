Centuries old. A place of searing beauty. A cosmopolitan university town located on the west coast of Wales between the Irish Sea and a mountainous hinterland of isolated farms and loose-knit villages. A natural crucible of colliding worlds, where history, myth and tradition come face to face with the modern and contemporary. But its panoramic vistas and quaint facade hide a multitude of sins - this is a place that lives according to its own rules, a place where grudges fester, where the secrets of the past are buried deep.Into this world steps DCI Tom Mathias. On the run from his past, our thirty-eight year old hero is a brilliant but troubled man. Having abandoned his life in London, he finds himself holed up in a trailer park on the outskirts of town - a place filled with secrets as dark and destructive as his own. His partner in crime DI Mared Rhys. 33 years old, Mared is intelligent and complex with demons of her own to conceal. Together, enigmatic outsider Mathias and hometown girl Mared form an engaging partnership.Mathias is at the heart of every story. He is a man we instinctively trust, a man who knows that the key to solving that ultimate anti-social crime, murder, lies not in where you look for truth, but how you look. From the windswept sand dunes of the coastline to the badlands of the hinterland and beyond, this is a detective drama with pace, poetry and scale. A series made up of 8 one-hour films with stories that are orignal and local, yet timeless and universal.", null, "HINTERLAND FILMS 3 LIMITED", "creative_567578-CREA-1-2015-2-UK-MED-TV_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SA15"}
