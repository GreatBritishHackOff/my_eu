The SignaStir system will determine the unique and holistic weld quality \u2018signature\u2019. There is currently no capable inspection system available on the market either as a stand-alone unit or integrated with a welding machine to perform this task. Welding is an enabling manufacturing technology for joining materials, which directly affects cost, safety and reliability and therefore has significant economic impact. Production and supply of flawed or defective welds is unacceptable and may result in unsafe products of low structural integrity. To overcome the technical barriers to development of such an inspection system an SME partnership will require the services of research and technology providing organisations to deliver precompetitive research leading to the development of the product. There is a need for a low cost welding method, which can overcome the limitations of conventional fusion welding techniques. FSW has many economic, environmental and safety advantages over conventional welding but is a relatively new development and potential users require added confidence to make the initial capital investment required. The full benefit of the FSW process can only be achieved through application where weld quality is guaranteed to be correct each and every time. When developed the SignaStir system will give European manufacturers added confidence in their welded products and reduce costly off-line inspection of production parts. Scrap and re-work rates will be reduced as quality issues will be detected immediately after welding by the SignaStir system.", 162615.0, 1010769.0, "SIGNASTIR", "A new spin on welding inspection", "Friction stir welding (FSW)  is positively impacting industries in the aerospace, marine and automotive sectors. Previously lacking in-line quality inspection technology should enhance market penetration.", "FSW is a solid-state technique. The frictional heat of an FSW tool rotating between the two pieces to be joined softens the materials. Precisely controlled forging pressure is also applied by the tool as it passes to produce high-integrity welded joints at temperatures below the melting point.\n\nDespite its economic, environmental and technical advantages, FSW\u2019s full potential has not been realised as no reliable quality inspection system exists. Faulty welds, although rare, affect the performance and safety of welded parts.\n\nAn unprecedented real-time FSW laser-ultrasound inspection system with a user-friendly interface promises to enhance penetration in existing markets and open new ones. EU-funding of the project 'Development of an in-process quality assurance system for friction stir welding' (SIGNASTIR) brought the concept out of the lab and into the production environment.\n\nThe SIGNASTIR system is mounted on the trailing side of the welding tool to have optical access to the newly formed weld as the tool moves along its path. Using a holistic weld signature created from a database of weld parameters, the non-contact technology assesses the quality of the weld. It is designed to detect and report the presence and location of defects. A modified lab prototype was also able to detect the size of voids of interest to industrial FSW users.\n\nScientists are currently optimising the SIGNASTIR system based on outcomes of trials in a real production environment. The technology promises to boost the competitive position of the numerous small- and medium-sized enterprises active in the FSW sector. Commercial implementation will not only enhance the quality of welds and boost confidence in the technique but also decrease expensive off-line inspection, scrap and re-work rates.", null, "http://www.inspectahire.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/144729.jpg", "fp7_98008_984032215"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7EW", "Language Training", "Hermitage Primary School", 1888.0, "Based in Edinburgh, LFEE Europe\u2019s teaching team comprises several French speakers, all of whom are experienced and fully qualified teachers committed to promoting French language and culture throughout Europe. The LFEE courses have a strong focus on teaching methodologies and encourage the use of engaging and stimulating resources (which would support our school\u2019s delivery of the \u201c1+2\u201d language initiative). We consider that the participation of our teachers on the LFEE immersion course in France is an important step in working towards our goal of improving the teaching and learning of languages in our school. The aims of the LFEE Europe immersion courses are as follows -\r\n\u2022 To provide participants with materials and ideas suitable for the teaching of Modern Languages\r\n\u2022 To explore various methods of teaching of Modern languages\r\n\u2022 To develop cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary France\r\n\u2022 To improve participants\u2019 competence and performance in French\r\n\u2022 To use Internet and other ICT resources in your class\r\nIn 2013, Argyll and Bute Council introduced a new initiative with the objective that every child in primary education learns two foreign language (in addition to their mother tongue). This initiative is in response to the Scottish Government report and guidelines on the teaching of languages in Scotland (which, itself, is based on the \u201c1+2\u201d model recommended by the European Union and adopted by many countries in Europe and beyond). The main goal of the initiative is to create a new model for language acquisition in Scotland. This is an ambitious and challenging pursuit, however, we believe that with the right approach and resources, it is achievable. \r\nWe plan to send one participant (fully trained primary teacher) to the LFEE 1 week immersion course in France. The LFEE immersion course is a foreign language training course for primary school teachers. The course focuses on teaching methodologies and use of innovative resources in the classroom. The course encourages participants to fully immerse themselves in French culture and to speak the language at every opportunity, thus furthering their own language skills whilst developing knowledge of a different culture. The LFEE course allows participants to meet teachers from other European countries and therefore results in access to a wide network of European teachers (as well as providing opportunities to make links with a partner school). The participation of our teacher on this course will equip them with the skills and knowledge to support and train other staff members, effectively improving the teaching and learning of foreign languages in our school. This will support our school in delivering the  \u201c1+2\u201d language strategy, as advised by our local authority.\r\nThe chosen participant has shown a particular interest and commitment to the teaching of languages within the school both on a personal and professional level. The participant is a qualified teacher with 8+ years of experience teaching at various stages and is delivering weekly French lessons to classes in line with the \u201c1+2\u201d language strategy. The participant is very keen to enhance their skills and increase their confidence in teaching French and, prior to applying, the participant fully researched the chosen course and attended the relevant information evenings. Currently,  this participant is working within a staff who have little to no experience of the French language or culture. By training this member, it is intended that the innovative teaching methodologies / resources and knowledge digested will thereafter be applicable for all learners (and, of course, staff) in our school.  \r\nAfter the week of intensive training (and in a French environment), the participant will be more confident and comfortable in the spoken language of French. The participant will spend their entire training communicating in French and in the company of French nationals, which will give them an enhanced (and less artificial) experience.  The participant will then assist directly in reaching the French targets in the school\u2019s strategic Improvement Plan. With the experience gained by the participant being fully shared amongst colleagues, the whole school community will work together to promote the school vision of appreciating other cultures and delivering the \"1+2\" Language strategy successfully. This vision will be embedded in the everyday running of the school. Upon return from the LFEE training course, the participant will also lead in-service training for other staff members and share teaching resources / strategies via regular peer observations and CPD opportunities.  \r\nFinally, we plan to establish a French working party, which will be led by the participant, to develop our interdisciplinary approach to modern language learning, by hosting  a whole school French Focus Afternoon. This will provide ample opportunity to invite the whole school community together to appreciate the French language and culture.", "http://www.hermitageprimaryschool.org/", "Hermitage Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035590_coordinator"], ["7BU", "Ergotherapie im europ\u00e4ischen Vergleich - Eine Erweiterung beruflicher Kompetenzen und Perspektiven", "Integrated Care Team NHS Highland", 10413.0, "The project offers the opportunity to absolve an abroad vocational placement in a medical resp. therapeutic institution in Cheltenham and Wyboston (England, UK), Llantristant (Wales,UK), Helensburgh (Scotland, UK), Strassengel (Austria) and  Mosta (Malta) and Enniscorthy (Ireland)  to seven students of the vocational college of Occupational Therapy Guenzburg. Apart from Ms Mann's placement they are additional four-week-placements to the four regular placements in context of their vocational training. Ms Kaulisch is going to absolve an eleven-week- placement as regular part of her vocational training. The participants have the opportunity to experience their profession,  Occupational Therapy, in a different healthpolitics-related context other than in Germany under the supervision and mentoring of their tutors, who all are occupational therapists with several years of professional experience. The role of occupational therapists in the host countries varies strongly from the German pendant. In this context the students get the opportunity to extend and amplify their professional competences in the practical treating of different kinds of clients. All of the students have the opportunity to use and amplify their skills of professional English (subject of their first year of vocational training), as well as to confirm their skills of everyday English and (partly) learn new languages (Welsh). The placements, they're about to visit in summer/ autumn/ winter 2016 work according to current international guidelines (ICF) and frameworks of Occupational Therapy (OT models like MOHO, CMOP) as well as selected occupational therapy concepts, like sensory integrative therapy, in which the participants will get an insight in. All over Europe occupational therapy shows itself to be a profession in an ongoing dynamic change. In Germany there is a reinforcement of the dualism of vocational college and university studies. For our students this means that they have to compete not only with other graduates from vocational colleges but also with the graduating students from the universities. Our students shall practise their competences, gained during their vocational training at the vocational college of Occupational Therapy Guenzburg in working practically in an abroad occupational therapy institution resp. department. By this they should realize as well as recognize their own competences and value as well as extend them.  Being on their own in an unknown environment in a foreign country the young adults will rise their personal competences and gain more independence, flexibility and personal maturity. \r\nIn addition the language skills of the participants in speaking, comprehension and writing in a foreign language will extend during their stay in the English or Spanish speaking countries.
