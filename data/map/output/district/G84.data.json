Ltd", "The SignaStir project will develop an effective in-process quality assurance system for the inspection of friction stir welds (FSW) predominantly used in the manufacture of aluminium rolling stock and marine vessels. The SignaStir system will determine the unique and holistic weld quality \u2018signature\u2019. There is currently no capable inspection system available on the market either as a stand-alone unit or integrated with a welding machine to perform this task. Welding is an enabling manufacturing technology for joining materials, which directly affects cost, safety and reliability and therefore has significant economic impact. Production and supply of flawed or defective welds is unacceptable and may result in unsafe products of low structural integrity. To overcome the technical barriers to development of such an inspection system an SME partnership will require the services of research and technology providing organisations to deliver precompetitive research leading to the development of the product. There is a need for a low cost welding method, which can overcome the limitations of conventional fusion welding techniques. FSW has many economic, environmental and safety advantages over conventional welding but is a relatively new development and potential users require added confidence to make the initial capital investment required. The full benefit of the FSW process can only be achieved through application where weld quality is guaranteed to be correct each and every time. When developed the SignaStir system will give European manufacturers added confidence in their welded products and reduce costly off-line inspection of production parts. Scrap and re-work rates will be reduced as quality issues will be detected immediately after welding by the SignaStir system.", 162615.0, 1010769.0, "SIGNASTIR", "A new spin on welding inspection", "Friction stir welding (FSW)  is positively impacting industries in the aerospace, marine and automotive sectors. Previously lacking in-line quality inspection technology should enhance market penetration.", "FSW is a solid-state technique. The frictional heat of an FSW tool rotating between the two pieces to be joined softens the materials. Precisely controlled forging pressure is also applied by the tool as it passes to produce high-integrity welded joints at temperatures below the melting point.\n\nDespite its economic, environmental and technical advantages, FSW\u2019s full potential has not been realised as no reliable quality inspection system exists. Faulty welds, although rare, affect the performance and safety of welded parts.\n\nAn unprecedented real-time FSW laser-ultrasound inspection system with a user-friendly interface promises to enhance penetration in existing markets and open new ones. EU-funding of the project 'Development of an in-process quality assurance system for friction stir welding' (SIGNASTIR) brought the concept out of the lab and into the production environment.\n\nThe SIGNASTIR system is mounted on the trailing side of the welding tool to have optical access to the newly formed weld as the tool moves along its path. Using a holistic weld signature created from a database of weld parameters, the non-contact technology assesses the quality of the weld. It is designed to detect and report the presence and location of defects. A modified lab prototype was also able to detect the size of voids of interest to industrial FSW users.\n\nScientists are currently optimising the SIGNASTIR system based on outcomes of trials in a real production environment. The technology promises to boost the competitive position of the numerous small- and medium-sized enterprises active in the FSW sector. Commercial implementation will not only enhance the quality of welds and boost confidence in the technique but also decrease expensive off-line inspection, scrap and re-work rates.", null, "http://www.inspectahire.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/144729.jpg", "fp7_98008_984032215"]]}}, "outwardCode": "G84"}
