The visit will enable her to discover more about the innovative educational practice of the preschools in Reggio, in particular their attitude to children's rights and responsibilities, citizenship and democracy. This learning will form the basis of an exciting project which will take place in school during January - March 2018. During the project children in school will be taking part in collaborative creative learning activities which will explore and develop their knowledge and understanding of rights, responsibilities, citizenship and democracy. Staff in the school will take part in ongoing professional development to support the project work. The children's and adults' learning will be written up and published as a booklet and film which will be available in July 2018. The project will feature on a dedicated page on the school's website and will also be featured on www.sightlines-initiative.com .The work of the project will be disseminated to the Rural Eden Cluster of 11 schools of which Kirkoswald C of E School is a part. The project is part of a wider school development programme aimed at promoting an innovative, exciting curriculum in which children learn creatively and collaboratively. It will enable teachers to become skilled at running long-term creative projects in their schools and will generate future learning and discussion in Cumbria and more widely. It will also strengthen the links between schools in Cumbria and other countries.", "http://kirkoswald.cumbria.sch.uk/", "Kirkoswald C of E School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036340_coordinator"]]}}}}
