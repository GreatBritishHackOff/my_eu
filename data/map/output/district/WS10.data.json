Batteries Limited", "The COLABATS project will provide new industrial processes for the recycling of the critical metals Cobalt and Lanthanides and key economic metals Nickel and Lithium, from waste batteries, significantly improving recycling efficiencies and metal purity from existing recovery routes. Primarily Li-ion and NiMH will be targeted using novel task specific ionic liquids (TSILs) to selectively extract the metals. These batteries are found in everyday consumer products such as mobile phones, portable media players, etc., as well as other industrial equipment, and are prevalent in hybrid and electric vehicles, which are becoming increasingly widespread on our roads.\nTSILs are molecules covalently tethered to a functional group. Targeted species will be low-cost, non-toxic, environmentally benign, and will require minimal or no processing to reuse them.\nThe battery recycling processes will be up-scaled to a pilot system using standard hydrometallurgical equipment and will include other novel concepts to further improve the process. The pilots will be operated in an industrial setting at battery recycling plants and demonstrated to the wider recycling and battery communities.\nThe technology will result in:\n\u2022 Substantially reducing landfill waste by recovering recyclable metals of high purity\n\u2022 Reducing critical metal consumption by increasing recycling efficiencies of spent battery waste. Hence, high purity recovered metals can be recycled into new batteries rather than landfilling or in the case of nickel, processed into lower value stainless steel.\n\u2022 Substantially reducing environmental impact by introducing more sustainable hydrometallurgical processing to replace current standard pyrometallurgical processes. This will reduce energy consumption and emissions of CO2 and other pollutants.\n\u2022 Increasing the capability of the SME community to carry out the complete recycling process, thereby taking advantage of the potential value chain of critical and high value metals markets.", 45821.0, 3590857.0, "COLABATS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.g-pbatt.co.uk", null, "fp7_111072_952962630"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WS10"}
