Ltd", "It is clear that group (batch) identification is not an adequate method to trace sheep movements across the EU, as the Foot & Mouth outbreak in 2001 demonstrated. Once animals move through different holdings, farms, or markets, it is very difficult to track where each animal is going without individual identification and recording. Should there be a disease outbreak the uncontrolled movement of animals could cause the further and rapid spread of disease over a large geographical area. Therefore the tracing of each individual animal is vitally important to control infectious diseases. However, compliance with the EC legislation for 100% assured tracking of livestock is difficult to deliver with the current mandated LF systems, having a reported recall of only 90% of tagged sheep in group movement situations. This non-compliance could potentially result in financial penalties of up to 50% of individual farm subsidies. The ROSEI project will develop an RFID tagging system offering a robust & reliable solution enabling 100% recall of tagged sheep in flock conditions. The proposed LF & UHF dual band solution  will have longer range & faster read rates for seamless flock and herd scanning enabling the farmers to comply with the strict legislation for Sheep monitoring & tracking. ROSEI will permit the implementation of advanced livestock management systems that utilise EID to accurately monitor the husbandry of animals in the food chain and will contribute to the EU integrated approach to food safety, \u2018Farm to Fork\u2019.", 210814.0, 1161686.0, "ROSEI", "Electronically tracking each sheep", "New legislation in the EU demands that individual sheep across Europe be tracked. Scientists are developing a reliable electronic identification system to help farmers and small businesses comply with these new laws.", "Tracking of individual sheep through farms, markets and holdings helps prevent disease epidemics such as the 2001 Foot and Mouth disease outbreak. However, current tracking systems that use low-frequency (LF) radio frequency ID (RFID) tags have a reported success rate below 90\u00a0% when groups of animals are moved.\n\nNow, the EU-funded 'Robust sheep electronic identification' (http://www.rosei.eu (ROSEI)) project is tasked with developing an RFID system with 100\u00a0% tracking efficiency. Project researchers hope to achieve this using a dual-band LF and ultra-high frequency (UHF) system.\n\nROSEI first completed a study of user needs in the sheep industry to inform a full analysis of system requirements. The design of the ROSEI database has been completed, and a combined UHF/LF passive RFID tag prototype has been built. \n\nResearchers developed and optimised the tag antenna through testing of different design variants on sheep. Additionally, a new type of RFID reader has been designed and built that can detect multiple RFID signals in a specific area.\n\nThe project will now focus on integrating the new RFID tag into an existing commercial tag design. Once complete, ROSEI will enable advanced livestock management in compliance with EU legislation to contain disease.", "http://www.rosei.eu/", "http://www.everysite.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140725527.jpg", "fp7_106210_953568880"], ["3SE", "Innovative tools and strategies for surveillance and control of dengue", "Twistdx Limited", "Current surveillance systems and control efforts are clearly insufficient to combat dengue in endemic countries and to prevent spread to previously uninfected areas (including Europe). We will focus on the following aspects of the call: better diagnosis, surveillance, prevention as well as prediction and/or prevention of the spread of Dengue fever to previously uninfected regions (including Europe) in the context of climate change. We will develop a rapid diagnostic assay for resource limited settings that can be used as point-of-care, is portable, provides rapid results and is inexpensive.  Novel tools for vector monitoring will be tested. We propose to develop a comprehensive,  early warning, laboratory-based sentinel surveillance system that integrates clinical, entomological, environmental, socio-economic,  and weather/climate indices to evaluate predictive capability for epidemic dengue. The aim is to translate this information directly into improved tools for surveillance (early diagnostic assays, early warning systems and predictive models, risk maps, improved tools for vector surveillance).  Furthermore, we will test the impact of a novel community-based strategy on the reduction of dengue incidence in school aged children. Lastly, the integrated information on trends of importation of dengue, global mobility patterns, and vector distribution under changing climate conditions will improve our current understanding of the risk of introduction into previously uninfected areas, in particular Europe. Web based predictive tools, models and maps will be produced.

In this context, European scientists have set out to develop diagnostic assays and implement a surveillance system for monitoring dengue fever.", "Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the dengue virus. Currently our understanding of how viral, ecological, environmental, and climatic factors affect disease transmission and outbreaks is limited. This carries the risk of disease introduction to non-infected areas including Europe.\n\nUnfortunately children are the most affected group in endemic countries both in terms of incidence and severity. This demonstrates the urgent need for effective control strategies to protect children. To prevent spread of dengue, the EU-funded 'Innovative tools and strategies for surveillance and control of dengue' (DENGUETOOLS) project has brought together leading experts in the field.\n\nAs a first step, the consortium set up a laboratory-based surveillance system in Sri Lanka, which includes hospitals, outpatient settings and households. Thousands of samples were analysed by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of the virus, including field-collected adult mosquitoes. Additional assays were also developed for point-of-care detection of dengue in endemic areas.\n\nAs an intervention against dengue transmission to school children, scientists proposed the use of insecticide impregnated uniforms. However, the repellent efficacy drops upon repeated washing indicating the need for further optimisation.\n\nConsiderable part of the project is dedicated to the understanding of vector density, capacity and the preferred breeding sites. In various European countries, the consortium studied the impact of insecticidal aerosols on mosquitoes. They are working on associating temperature fluctuations with the risk of a dengue outbreak. Ongoing work to evaluate the risk of transporting dengue should complete the disease risk mapping.\n\nUsing a well-designed population-based system, the DENGUETOOLS initiative proposed to monitor the spatial and temporal distribution of dengue. This is central for warning against epidemic transmission and identifying the priority areas for intervention. Furthermore, the generated predictive models and maps should help policymakers in Europe to better prepare for and control dengue in the future.
