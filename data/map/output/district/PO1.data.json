Since then, it has been empirically proven that Humans share common cognitive attributes but also exhibit complex cognitive skills not demonstrated by other primates. A crucial question in comparative cognitive research is whether these species differences in cognitive abilities correlate with differences in ecological and social factors. The social intelligence hypothesis suggests that an increase in social complexity drove the evolution of cognitive flexibility in primates. Comparisons using established cognitive tests between species that live in social systems of differing social complexity offer the strongest test of the social intelligence hypothesis but these comparisons are lacking. To fill this gap, \u00b4Macacognitum\u00b4 will challenge the social intelligence hypothesis and will use a unique approach by comparing the cognitive skills of macaque species of different social tolerance grades using a large comprehensive test battery for comparative cognition. According to the theory, we should observe different set of cognitive abilities between the macaques. In particular, given their similar life history and diet, but different social styles, we expect macaques with a greater social tolerance to display greater skills in the social domain. Here, the integration of comparative psychology and evolutionary biology will: 1) help understand the evolutionary history of cognitive traits in a primate monophyletic group and 2) examine the differential influence of social style on cognition of closely related species.

Additional impetus for such research activities is provided by the potential of such carriers to improve the therapeutic profiles of many of the widely used hydrophobic chemotherapeutants. Nowday, carrier vehicles for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs are associated with several disadvantages: conventional emulsions, micelles and liposomes are thermodynamically unstable; lipophilic carriers cluster in blood flow and are rapidly opsonized and massively cleared by liver and spleen; loading capacity of hydrophobic drugs into hydrophilic carriers is limited. Rationalised in the terms of thermodynamic stability, capability to move through blood capillaries, imrpoved drug loading capacity, surface-charged hydrophilicity, and capacity to effect controlled drug release, one of the approaches towards addressing these issues involves the use of superabsorbent polyelectrolytes-based nanogels with affinity for both water and organic liquids.

We also include a comprehensive assessment of the economic ramifications of the proposed optimized rearing. These measures are all aimed at improving productivity of the turbot farms leading to more cost effective production and better use of the resources involved.

This project brings together a balanced and integrated consortium of fish farmers and scientists, with wide project experience, in a number of interrelated disciplines; growth physiology, immunology/health, welfare, slaughter methods, quality aspects and fish economics; all concentrating on improving the culture of turbot.

However, in order to further expand the production beyond this figure, new bio- and technological solutions are required.\n\nThe aim of the MAXIMUS (Innovative rearing and stunning of farmed turbot and sole to meet future challenges regarding quality of production and animal welfare) project was to optimise conditions for farmed turbot. The consortium worked closely with fish farmers to ensure that the entire value chain was improved, from the input resources required to the final product.\n\nResearchers investigated the best lighting and feeding conditions to enhance fish development, yield and shelf life. They also assessed current vaccination strategies and the effect of different diets on fish immune response.\n\nBetter slaughtering procedures such as live chilling or stunning with electricity were also studied. Researchers worked closely with small and medium-sized enterprises to develop an electrical stunner for turbot and sole, which is now commercially available.\n\nAn important aspect of the project was ensuring that the welfare of the fish was properly monitored and controlled during husbandry and slaughter. To this end, the internationally recognised Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points (HACCP) quality assurance system was adapted to control food safety at the industrial and retail levels for selected fish species.\n\nImplementation of the project's results will greatly contribute to the utilisation of turbot and other flatfish species in Europe. This will promote growth in the European aquaculture industry and its related production chain, thereby generating employment opportunities. It will also lead to a more diverse supply of high-quality aquaculture products throughout the year, encouraging more fish consumption among European customers and contributing to increased demand for fish products.\n\nWith such strong focus on fish welfare, reduced production time, and cost and resource efficiency, MAXIMUS will significantly improve the competitiveness of European turbot aquaculture.

A framework was also developed for filling gaps in the current information in order to achieve reliable long-term management requirements. \n\nA number of case studies were chosen to reflect the different types of deepwater fisheries found in the North-East Atlantic. Two additional case studies were also selected to give a wider view on the management and monitoring of deepwater fisheries in other parts of the globe. \n\nFor each case study, DEEPFISHMAN identified management and assessment problems, developed and tested new approaches, and made relevant recommendations. The project also studied the socioeconomic profile of and predicted impact of the different proposed management strategies over the short and long terms for each fishery.\n\nStakeholders' involvement was a key part of the project's success, as they offer a unique perspective and source of information. They were engaged through a series of workshops where they expressed their views on the present and possible future management regimes. \n\nThe website and a http://deepfishman.hafro.is/doku.php (WIKI) were also launched. The WIKI facilitated communication and collaboration, and was used to conduct a survey and questionnaire aimed at external partners.\n\nProject partners also developed a new fish stock assessment model for species that become confined in a smaller area following exploitation.

Dark energy was, therefore, postulated to be responsible for causing the expansion rate to increase during the second half of our Universe's history.\n\nMINE BOSS scientists also used the signature left in quasar spectra by neutral hydrogen to constrain properties of neutrinos. In particular, the analysis of Lyman-alpha lines in quasar spectra allowed them to measure the 1D flux power spectrum that is related to the 3D matter distribution.\n\nThe impact of neutrino masses on the flux power spectrum was computed with high precision by hydrodynamical simulations. A comparison of these numerical predictions with observational data led to several constraints on neutrino masses and other cosmological parameters.\n\nNeutrinos have offered a possible means to resolve discrepancies between the expansion rate of the Universe in the first and second half of its history. Dark energy is thought to be produced as neutrinos are pulled apart; yielding a tension like that fuels the expansion of the Universe.\n\nMINE BOSS project results have paved the way for new measurements of BAOs as part of the extended BOSS set to measure the expansion history of the Universe up to back when it was less than three billion years old.

An attractive antimicrobial approach is to inhibit functions that are essential for bacterial virulence. This disarms the bacteria rather than killing them, reducing the selective pressure that leads to antibiotic resistance in the first place. Four small regulatory RNAs, the quorum regulatory RNAs (Qrrs), lie at the heart of the virulence pathway in V. cholerae. At low bacterial cell density, in the initial phases of infection, the Qrrs are abundant which leads to the expression of virulence genes, infection of the host and cholera. Post infection, when the cells are at high densities, Qrrs are no longer produced, which turns off virulence-gene expression and induces the release of the bacteria back into the environment for reinfection. The Qrrs function by altering the translation and/or stability of specific mRNA targets through base-pairing, which ultimately regulates the expression of the virulence genes.

There are remaining issues in developing theoretical frameworks for probing gravitational physics on cosmological scales. We construct modified gravity theories as an alternative to dark energy and analyse \u201cscreening mechanisms\u201d to restore GR on scales where it is well tested. We then develop better theoretical frameworks to perform cosmological tests of gravity that include non-linear scales by exploiting our theoretical knowledge of the models and our state-of-the-art simulations.\n\nThis grant will exploit and develop the world-leading position of the group initiated by Kazuya Koyama at the University of Portsmouth funded by the ERC starting grant (2008-2013).", 1446539.0, 1446539.0, "CosTesGrav", null, null, null, null, "http://www.port.ac.uk", null, "h2020_194467_999847871"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2UP", "UNIVERSITY OF PORTSMOUTH HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION*", 209211.0, "Securing sufficient supplies of safe and high quality food and other bio-based products (05.09.03.01)", "fts_2017_2130", 2017], ["2UP", "UNIVERSITY OF PORTSMOUTH HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION*", 197346.0, "Securing sufficient supplies of safe, healthy and high quality food and other bio-based products (08.02.03.02)", "fts_2017_7671", 2017], ["2UP", "UNIVERSITY OF PORTSMOUTH HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION*", 159382.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_13842", 2017], ["2UP", "UNIVERSITY OF PORTSMOUTH HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION*", 119943.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_15783", 2017], ["2UP", "UNIVERSITY OF PORTSMOUTH HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION*", 87225.0, "Promoting excellence in teaching and research activities in European integration through the Jean Monnet activities worldwide (15.02.02)", "fts_2017_49041", 2017], ["2GB", "PORTSMOUTH CITY COUNCIL*", 89.0, "Optimising the integration and interconnection of transport modes and enhancing interoperability (06.02.01.03)", "fts_2017_69912", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "PO1"}
