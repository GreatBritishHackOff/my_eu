Since then, it has been empirically proven that Humans share common cognitive attributes but also exhibit complex cognitive skills not demonstrated by other primates. A crucial question in comparative cognitive research is whether these species differences in cognitive abilities correlate with differences in ecological and social factors. The social intelligence hypothesis suggests that an increase in social complexity drove the evolution of cognitive flexibility in primates. Comparisons using established cognitive tests between species that live in social systems of differing social complexity offer the strongest test of the social intelligence hypothesis but these comparisons are lacking. To fill this gap, \u00b4Macacognitum\u00b4 will challenge the social intelligence hypothesis and will use a unique approach by comparing the cognitive skills of macaque species of different social tolerance grades using a large comprehensive test battery for comparative cognition. According to the theory, we should observe different set of cognitive abilities between the macaques. In particular, given their similar life history and diet, but different social styles, we expect macaques with a greater social tolerance to display greater skills in the social domain. Here, the integration of comparative psychology and evolutionary biology will: 1) help understand the evolutionary history of cognitive traits in a primate monophyletic group and 2) examine the differential influence of social style on cognition of closely related species.

Additional impetus for such research activities is provided by the potential of such carriers to improve the therapeutic profiles of many of the widely used hydrophobic chemotherapeutants. Nowday, carrier vehicles for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs are associated with several disadvantages: conventional emulsions, micelles and liposomes are thermodynamically unstable; lipophilic carriers cluster in blood flow and are rapidly opsonized and massively cleared by liver and spleen; loading capacity of hydrophobic drugs into hydrophilic carriers is limited. Rationalised in the terms of thermodynamic stability, capability to move through blood capillaries, imrpoved drug loading capacity, surface-charged hydrophilicity, and capacity to effect controlled drug release, one of the approaches towards addressing these issues involves the use of superabsorbent polyelectrolytes-based nanogels with affinity for both water and organic liquids.

We also include a comprehensive assessment of the economic ramifications of the proposed optimized rearing. These measures are all aimed at improving productivity of the turbot farms leading to more cost effective production and better use of the resources involved.

This project brings together a balanced and integrated consortium of fish farmers and scientists, with wide project experience, in a number of interrelated disciplines; growth physiology, immunology/health, welfare, slaughter methods, quality aspects and fish economics; all concentrating on improving the culture of turbot.

However, in order to further expand the production beyond this figure, new bio- and technological solutions are required.\n\nThe aim of the MAXIMUS (Innovative rearing and stunning of farmed turbot and sole to meet future challenges regarding quality of production and animal welfare) project was to optimise conditions for farmed turbot. The consortium worked closely with fish farmers to ensure that the entire value chain was improved, from the input resources required to the final product.\n\nResearchers investigated the best lighting and feeding conditions to enhance fish development, yield and shelf life. They also assessed current vaccination strategies and the effect of different diets on fish immune response.\n\nBetter slaughtering procedures such as live chilling or stunning with electricity were also studied. Researchers worked closely with small and medium-sized enterprises to develop an electrical stunner for turbot and sole, which is now commercially available.\n\nAn important aspect of the project was ensuring that the welfare of the fish was properly monitored and controlled during husbandry and slaughter. To this end, the internationally recognised Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points (HACCP) quality assurance system was adapted to control food safety at the industrial and retail levels for selected fish species.\n\nImplementation of the project's results will greatly contribute to the utilisation of turbot and other flatfish species in Europe. This will promote growth in the European aquaculture industry and its related production chain, thereby generating employment opportunities. It will also lead to a more diverse supply of high-quality aquaculture products throughout the year, encouraging more fish consumption among European customers and contributing to increased demand for fish products.\n\nWith such strong focus on fish welfare, reduced production time, and cost and resource efficiency, MAXIMUS will significantly improve the competitiveness of European turbot aquaculture.

A framework was also developed for filling gaps in the current information in order to achieve reliable long-term management requirements. \n\nA number of case studies were chosen to reflect the different types of deepwater fisheries found in the North-East Atlantic. Two additional case studies were also selected to give a wider view on the management and monitoring of deepwater fisheries in other parts of the globe. \n\nFor each case study, DEEPFISHMAN identified management and assessment problems, developed and tested new approaches, and made relevant recommendations. The project also studied the socioeconomic profile of and predicted impact of the different proposed management strategies over the short and long terms for each fishery.\n\nStakeholders' involvement was a key part of the project's success, as they offer a unique perspective and source of information. They were engaged through a series of workshops where they expressed their views on the present and possible future management regimes. \n\nThe website and a http://deepfishman.hafro.is/doku.php (WIKI) were also launched. The WIKI facilitated communication and collaboration, and was used to conduct a survey and questionnaire aimed at external partners.\n\nProject partners also developed a new fish stock assessment model for species that become confined in a smaller area following exploitation.

Dark energy was, therefore, postulated to be responsible for causing the expansion rate to increase during the second half of our Universe's history.\n\nMINE BOSS scientists also used the signature left in quasar spectra by neutral hydrogen to constrain properties of neutrinos. In particular, the analysis of Lyman-alpha lines in quasar spectra allowed them to measure the 1D flux power spectrum that is related to the 3D matter distribution.\n\nThe impact of neutrino masses on the flux power spectrum was computed with high precision by hydrodynamical simulations. A comparison of these numerical predictions with observational data led to several constraints on neutrino masses and other cosmological parameters.\n\nNeutrinos have offered a possible means to resolve discrepancies between the expansion rate of the Universe in the first and second half of its history. Dark energy is thought to be produced as neutrinos are pulled apart; yielding a tension like that fuels the expansion of the Universe.\n\nMINE BOSS project results have paved the way for new measurements of BAOs as part of the extended BOSS set to measure the expansion history of the Universe up to back when it was less than three billion years old.

An attractive antimicrobial approach is to inhibit functions that are essential for bacterial virulence. This disarms the bacteria rather than killing them, reducing the selective pressure that leads to antibiotic resistance in the first place. Four small regulatory RNAs, the quorum regulatory RNAs (Qrrs), lie at the heart of the virulence pathway in V. cholerae. At low bacterial cell density, in the initial phases of infection, the Qrrs are abundant which leads to the expression of virulence genes, infection of the host and cholera. Post infection, when the cells are at high densities, Qrrs are no longer produced, which turns off virulence-gene expression and induces the release of the bacteria back into the environment for reinfection. The Qrrs function by altering the translation and/or stability of specific mRNA targets through base-pairing, which ultimately regulates the expression of the virulence genes.

There are remaining issues in developing theoretical frameworks for probing gravitational physics on cosmological scales. We construct modified gravity theories as an alternative to dark energy and analyse \u201cscreening mechanisms\u201d to restore GR on scales where it is well tested. We then develop better theoretical frameworks to perform cosmological tests of gravity that include non-linear scales by exploiting our theoretical knowledge of the models and our state-of-the-art simulations.\n\nThis grant will exploit and develop the world-leading position of the group initiated by Kazuya Koyama at the University of Portsmouth funded by the ERC starting grant (2008-2013).", 1446539.0, 1446539.0, "CosTesGrav", null, null, null, null, "http://www.port.ac.uk", null, "h2020_194467_999847871"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1PJ", "Kompetentny Europejski Nauczyciel - kluczem do sukcesu m\u0142odych os\u00f3b na europejskim rynku pracy", "Training Vision Ltd", 19344.0, "There are 13 teachers who are going to take part in the project.

It is composed by a Technical school in technology branch and a Lyceum in applied sciences. The Technical school is then divided into four study courses: Chemistry and biotechnology, Electronics and electrical engineering, Computer science and telecommunications, Mechanics and mechatronics. The IIS, in its whole, is attended by about 1000 students belonging to the middle class. The hinterland of the school is rather poor, and many parents are unemployed. The low income doesn\u2019t allow students to travel abroad, giving them poor skills in the English language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROJECT\r\n\r\nThe project comes from the desire, that we have, to bring our students to Europe and to improve their English skills. This goal can be achieved by giving, to teachers, competences and methodologies about the CLIL joined to skills within the framework of Erasmus+ actions. Since knowledge makes collaboration easier, the project aims to provide administrative and accounting knowledge around Erasmus+ framework to the administrative staff of the school. This action will improve its collaboration with teachers that undertake one of the Erasmus+ actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nTo achieve the goals it is necessary to raise awareness and then train the teaching and administrative personnel. We will set up a group of 10 teachers, two for each of the four branches  of the Technical school and two teachers belonging to Lyceum. Each pair will consist of teachers that steadily teach technical subjects at school. Alternatively, the pair could be formed by a teacher of technical subjects and one that teaches scientific or humanistic subjects. Two units, belonging to the school\u2019s administrative staff, will complete the team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe twelve members of the group will attend courses, according to their skills.

Let's Go is coherent with the objectives set by the Europe 2020 Strategy and taken back by the Italian government document \"Italia 2020: piano di azione per l\u2019occupabilit\u00e0 dei giovani attraverso l\u2019integrazione tra apprendimento e lavoro\"; the project would promote the development of techniques skills (compared to the demand of enterprises) through the creation of an internship period, carried out during the course of the studies - as advocated by the Italian document - to develop the culture of work and enterprise, of language skills and citizenship skills and entrepreneurial spirit. Let's Go promotes 300 mobilities for the realization of internship in enterprises, pointed towards young people of the circuit of Education and Vocational Training. These young people come from the network CONFAP (National Entities for Vocational Training) and Professional Technical Institutes of the Province of Padua. The beneficiaries are: - the second and third annual paths of regional qualification (in some cases fourth annual path where required under regional regulation); - neo-qualified of qualification paths of not more than one year; - young of the4th and 5th class of technical professional institutes; - the graduates of not more than one year from the education pathways and technical professional. The young beneficiaries come from 17 Italian regions (from North to South Italy). Let's Go is a \"multi- sectorial\" project because it involves young people from different professional backgrounds (33% catering, 20 % mechanical, 17% agro-alimentary transformation, 7% of electricity, 10% of thermo-plumbing, 10 % well-being, 3% graphics). The correspondence between the type of beneficiaries, professional profiles and countries of destination is designed on the specific professional sectors in relation to the offer of the labour market of the European territorial contexts involved. The profiles of mechanics, electricity, thermo-plumbing will go in Germany, UK, Spain and Sweden. The profiles of the catering will travel to France, Germany, Spain and Malta. The profiles of agro-alimentary transformation will go to Spain. The profiles of well-being will travel to UK. The graphic profiles will go to Germany. The pedagogical approach of the project is intercultural because the internship activities foreseen are designed in function, on the one hand, of the reinforcement of learning already established by the beneficiary in Italy (strengthening of the starting situation), from another hand, in function of the learning to be acquired in the country of destination (differences-comparative learning; product/typical processes of the country of destination, the various laws of hygiene and safety in the workplace; different measurement techniques; different types of raw materials used for processing). Lets'Go project also provides for the use of ECVET tools (learning Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding) for the personalized design of transnational mobility, in view of the enhancement of learning outcomes, acquired in the individual experiences of mobility. The mobilities include the realization of internships in enterprise, being this a true learning context (Work-based Learning). The expected impacts are of long-term and  they are related to the design of mobility as an active investment of the promoter in social and employment integration policies. Let's Go intends to pursue: the integration of training and transnational mobility in the life project of the beneficiary (in recognition of the mobility in the formal learning pathway, awareness of enterprise\u2019s stakeholders to the value of learning mobility).", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-IT01-KA102-000123_15"], ["2SN", "Qualified Abilities Linked To TOURism III", "Language (Placement) Solution Limited", 393132.0, "Qu.A.Li.T._TOUR. III (Qualified Abilities Linked To TOURism III) project, is the result of two successful experiences carried out within the Leonardo da Vinci Programme. It is addressed to 150 students, 6 with special needs, in initial vocational and technical training, from Hotel and Tourist Secondary Institutes of the Province of Pescara and Teramo. In these schools, the preparation aims at transferring technical and professional competences linked to the field of tourism and hospitality, with particular attention to linguistic skills. However, these competences often do not meet the requirements of the labor market as they are acquired mainly from a theoretical point of view rather than a practice one. For these reasons, a programme of professional training, allowing participants to take part in a training experience in a local and  an European context; the training experience in the local context is performed thanks to the collaboration of the sending partners. That is an opportunity that scholastic courses are not able to offer and it is a possibility of linguistic, professional and individual enrichment. The project wants to be an opportunity of integration of the scholastic preparation because the theoretical acquaintances will be supported and completed with practical ones. The training will place students in various cultural and social contexts, encouraging them to develop adaptability and flexibility. All this will contribute to satisfy professional and cultural growth of participants, guaranteeing the development of technician-vocational competences that could be used in the future in the local labor context. The field of tourism and hospitality has a considerable importance in the local economic and occupational structure. For this reason, suitable professionalities working in this field are needed. The overall objectives of the project are: 1. Improve the competences and the occupability of participants in the tourist field, joining the training \"on the field\" with the traditional one. 2. Develop synergies between the partner, improving the quality of the management. The expected results are the training, vocational and individual growth of participants and the promotion on the territory of youth mobility projects.

There are just over 500 VET learners at the school, 20 permanently employed staff and around 60 employees who are contracted to work with teaching and education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project for staff is to gain more knowledge about EU cooperation and to obtain a greater insight into the overall objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy for Higher Vocational Education. More knowledge is needed about how ECVET should be applied regarding the transfer of credits & qualifications and also insight into how this is done in other parts of Europe concerning the professional roles that VET learners at Frans Schartau are educated for. Additional aims are to learn how the curriculum could better reflect the European dimension and the development of technology within teaching. The aim of the project for VET learners is to give them work experience abroad as well as an opportunity to strengthen their language skills, which is a request made by the labour market. As a result of mobility, employability increases and at the same time VET learners enhance their opportunities for working in an international labour market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will be organised by three members of staff who have previous experience of international cooperation.

Staff should be in a position that enables them to apply their new knowledge immediately for the benefit of VET learners and to support the school\u2019s own work with internationalisation. The 31 VET learners participating each year will be selected to achieve a good spread across these four areas of work. Learners should have good interpersonal skills and a clearly stated goal for what they hope to achieve in their future careers with the help of this new experience. Participants must also have good communicative skills to be able to convey what they have learnt after their period of WPL. After selection, the goals for mobility should be agreed and anchored with the host company or organisation and the Learning Agreement written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe anticipated result is that Frans Schartau will be at the forefront when it comes to internationalisation. There will be a greater understanding of professional roles seen from a European perspective. This knowledge will add an international dimension to the school\u2019s programmes and teaching. New knowledge will be generated concerning technology, not least the knowledge needed to continue providing relevant and high quality Work Placement (WPL) abroad.

The German company, WBS TRAINING AG, we have been cooperating since 2006, is our partner in this project. It is experienced in working with young people thanks to taking part in different projects of LdV, Socrates, etc. WBS TRAINING AG is a company with more than 30 years of experience. It is a leading provider of educational services famous for its versatile and qualitatively first-class range of vocational training. We will start the cooperation with Training Vision Company, which deals with the planning and management of international mobility projects for students, teachers, young workers and organizations in the framework of EU programs. After the training,  the beneficiaries will obtain certificates of WBS TRAINING AG and Training Vision as well as Europass-Mobility Documents to confirm their skills and experience gained and to  be additional advantages for young people in search of employment in the European labor market. In this way we help to improve the transparency and recognition of qualifications and the competence of future school-leavers, including those acquired through vocational training. Students learning to be economy specialists will have their training in Dresden from 4th to 17th April 2015; IT specialists ( Dresden) and the hoteliers (Leipzig) from 12th to 25th Sept. 2015; advertising techniques specialists in Dresden from 3rd to 16th Oct. 2015 and the hoteliers in London from 12th to 25th April 2015 (present 2nd year students) and from 3rd to 16th April 2016 (present 1st year students). As part of the project we want the present 1st year students, future hotel industry workers, to have the opportunity to complete their  internship in two different countries, get to know the functioning of the hotels in Germany and England. Only this profession in our school has eight weeks of training in the curriculum and this gives us the opportunity to share the training for 2 weeks in Germany and England and four weeks in Poland. It will be particularly interesting professional experience. Being able to compare how the hotels operate, how the staff work, how the hotels advertise their services and how they are equipped  will expand the professional, interpersonal, linguistic and adaptive skills, increase self-esteem because of additional qualifications. The project will give the students better chances of employment in their profession since it will raise their professional attraction for future employers. It will also encourage the students to become self-employed. Understanding the needs and difficult financial situation of the students the school is trying to enable them to have their professional training as part of the grant covering all costs of their participation.

We are situated in a small rural town in one of the seven poorest departments in France.  Professional openings are scarce and the economy is losing momentum.  It is therefore necessary to prepare and train the young people in the Agen area to become mobile.  Our pupils can be in tough situations, as a result of living in a difficult family context.  In response to these sociological difficulties, the Lyc\u00e9e opened the first Professional Micro Lyc\u00e9e in France in September 2013 to accommodate young people who have dropped out of the school system.\r\nOne of our main aims is to create an awareness of European opportunities through work placements in Europe. These ambitious projects increase our young peoples\u2019 self-esteem.  Although the approach is initially timid and incredulous, these projects are strongly supported by the students and their families.  The best proof of our success is during enrolment, when students tell us that a neighbour or a friend told them about their experience in a European country.  Whether it is through the Leonardo Da Vinci or Comenius programme, or through a school trip, these young people have been able to leave their region, generally for the first time, to go to Great Britain, Spain or Poland for work placements within companies or to almost any of the other European countries through the Comenius projects.\r\nOur Erasmus+ 2014 project concerns 25 Lyc\u00e9e students which corresponds to the average number of accepted applications which we are in a position to deal with each school year.\r\nOur European partners are constantly developing, according to the contacts and networks of the team in charge of the European activity.

The action begins with a review of the market, which is necessary during the current economic crisis: a lack of employment coexists with a lack of specific skills. Hence the need to train updated professionals with digital and language skills. Learners ask for synergies with the market, especially in Europe, and contacts with the outside world, along with forms of creative learning, informal, close to the world of young people suitable to awaken interest and creativity.\r\n\r\nGiven digital natives' skills, it is productive to exploit and hand over them to the vocational field in order  to create jobs.

So, the company training represents a valuable and effective instrument to make the most of the competences acquired at school, in an international dimension.

The Technical Institute of Technology \u201cBuonarroti\u201d has a strong tradition of experimenting in teaching methodologies. Indeed, a digital platform for supporting teaching (Eschooling) has been experimented for several years with the contribution of  ICT companies and universities. In addition, the four technical specializations offered by the school (computer science, mechanics, electronics and chemistry) are always looking for cutting-edge contents to improve the laboratory settings of the nearly 50 laboratories of the school. Moreover, internships in local and European companies are offered to the senior students of the last three years, and giving the high number of students interested in these work experiences the school has to face an increasing need to diversify the placement of students. Another strategic focus of the school are the students with special needs, which engage teachers in constant updating of their teaching methods.\r\n \r\nAll the above mentioned features have contributed to shape the project. This relies on the collaboration of schools and companies, both selected with the help of two private agencies, the Tellus Group Ltd of Plymouth (UK) and the Training Vision Ltd of Portsmouth (UK), which have been selected to meet the needs of the project. The chosen private companies excel in all the four areas of specialization of our Institute. The two colleges in Portsmouth have expertise in ICT and both offer to their students a variety of lab activities so great that either different learning styles or special needs of students are met.\r\n\r\n14 teachers of the Institute will take part in the programme. These will be selected from all the different disciplines or group of disciplines to ensure that the experience will be spread throughout the school. They will be engaged in activities of job shadowing at the schools and at the companies identified by the project, with the following objectives:\r\n1) To compare and contrast teaching methodologies which make use of Information Technologies and Communication;\r\n2) To learn technical contents straight from the leading companies with the aim replicate them at school;\r\n3) To diversify and strengthen student internships in companies;\r\n4) To improve English language competences in order to facilitate CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) at school;\r\n5) To compare, if possible, teaching methods for students with special needs.\r\n\r\nTo be recruited for the programme teachers must meet basic requirements, including an English language certification (at least level B1). In addition, candidates will have to take part in an internal selection. They will be selected by an evaluation committee on the basis of their personal educational project submitted. Finally, the teachers who win will have to sign their commitment regarding, among other things, the achievement of a higher-level language certification (e.g. at least a B2 level will be required to the ones who already had a B1 certification) and the production of CLIL modules that will become part of the CLIL modules archive of the school.\r\n\r\nTeachers taking part in the project will be divided into two blocks of seven teachers each, one for each group of departments. In this way, the absence of 7 teachers away will somehow be covered by the replacement of colleagues remained at home and belonging to the second block.\r\n \r\nThe teachers will be involved in activities of managing nature (such as organize and monitor the phases of the project), technical (for the teachers who will job shadow in companies) and methodological (guest teachers at the colleges will be involved in the implementation of CLIL modules in their guest school).\r\n \r\nThe project is also meant to keep track and constantly check the professional activity of the teachers during their stay in England.

The best way to transfer such skills is through the use of experiences that encourage the learning by doing approach. Among these, a crucial role is played by learning experiences based on the Project-based Learning (PBL)  methodology and by the participation in transnational traineeships. Through PBL, which is a teaching method that organizes learning around projects, students gain knowledge and skills by investigating complex and real issues, carrying out tasks and developing project products. The transnational experiences carried out outside the friendly environment encourage the development of transversal skills such as adaptability and flexibility that are part of the skills required to develop an entrepreneurial attitude. Since several years, the members of the national consortium (ENAC, SCF, ENGIM VENETO) are trying to apply PBL methodologies within their centers, and they have recently decided to promote a joint project, based on this methodology, aiming at creating a network among several IVET centers by establishing a buyer-supplier relationship.

The specific objective of the project EU gives you wings are: a) to strength the competences of VET staff engaged in planning and managing learning processes using the PBL approach and through the exchange of good practices with other VET providers; b) to strength technical/professional and linguistic skills of VET students, as well as  improve their transversal skills through transnational placements carried out in a different economic and social context. This will allow VET students to develop innovation, creativity and responsibility that in the short term will support them in the planning and implementation of projects using the PBL approach and in the long run will increase their employability. \r\nTo achieve these objectives, the project promotes three types of mobility activities: 1)traineeship for IVET students in a company abroad for a period of three / four weeks; 2) traineeship for IVET students in a VET center abroad - with learning periods in companies or other organisations - for a period of two weeks; 3) job shadowing activities for staff members in other VET centers throughout Europe. The first two types of mobility activities will involve 210 students (in IVET pathways, 2^-3^-4^ year or within one year of obtaining their graduation), the third is addressed to 35 VET staff members. The project provides a wide sectorial and geographical coverage and will involve students, providers and partners from different economic sectors. The students involved in the project have different professional background: catering (15%), food processing (14%), administrative (25%), graphic (17%), well-being (23%), fashion (6%). In addition, the partnership have a significant geographical dimension both at national level (13 Italian regions) and European level (24 partners from 13 countries). The large number of foreign partners and the criteria used to select these institutions will assure VET students that the mobility experience is suited to their professional profiles and will provide VET staff with an extensive knowledge of PBL methodologies developed in the EU. The project envisages the use of ECVET tools in order to allow the exploitation and recognition of the learning outcomes acquired during the transnational mobility. To this end, the consortium will take advante of the experience of SCF and will use the ECVET tools developed by SCF during GORES and LET's GO projects.\r\nThe main results of the project will be a) a manual with the PBL methodologies and best practices seen by the staff during the job shadowing experiences; b) the creation of video/ multimedia materials concerning students\u2019experiences. \r\nThe project will have an impact on the development of professional and transversal skills of VET students and staff involved, as well as on the improvement of VET  training provision which will be possible thanks to the improvement in the use of the PBL approach and by strengthening the mutual trust among project partners. This project will also lay the groundwork for the implementation of a network experience among Europen VET centers using PBL methodology.", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IT01-KA102-004352_15"], ["1PJ", "Work In Progress", "Training Vision Ltd", 342371.0, "Project WIP will involve 120 students attending the 4th and 5th (final) year of 4 vocational schools based in Sicily and 3 based in Veneto region. \r\nFields of study involved relate to the production of goods and services carried out primarily by micro-enterprises and private-social organizations.

During their time at ROC A12, students are offered the possibility to gain relevant international experience, by means of an internship abroad and/or an international study trip or exchange programme. ROC A12 has ample experience with international projects within various European programmes, BAND, Euregio, Comenius and Leonardo da Vinci. We work with a clear structure of a steering group of three coordinators. One coordinator for each location heads workgroups of teachers responsible for internationalisation in their courses of study. A sustainable and reliable network of some ten European partners has been set up to collaborate with us in our international projects. This network is annually evaluated by the steering group to anticipate and follow new international developments and innovations. If necessary, adjustments are made.\r\n\r\nWe have set ourselves a qualitative and a quantitative goal for this project.  \r\n\r\nWe aim at an increase in the quality of the Erasmus+ internships by integrating the quality cycle in the entire project. The basis for this is established in the preliminary phase: we draw up a Learning Agreement for each participant. Personal targets in the field of professional development, language skills and intercultural learning are laid down in this agreement. It is signed by the participant, the internship organisation and ROC A12. Evaluation and assessment of the goals set for the internship takes place immediately after the internship. Testing of language skills is done on the basis of the European Framework of Reference. Objective testing instruments are developed by ROC A12 for the other elements  of the Learning Agreement. All participants make use of the on-line linguistic preparation and assessment modules of the Erasmus+ programme.  Every participant receives a Europass after a successful completion.  A 10-step action plan determines the logical course of the internship, from providing information to giving feedback to the internship organisation and making follow-up appointments. \r\n\r\nROC A12 aims at an annual, quantitative growth of ten percent in our student mobility. This matches the tendency of a growing number of internship applications by students. We have analysed the need for teacher mobility before applying for this project. Teacher and staff mobility is therefore also a demand-driven activity.\r\n\r\nThis application is based on the participation of 100 students and 37 teachers/staff employees doing an internship abroad. We strive for an equal division of internships for both students and teachers across all training courses we offer. Students and teachers do their internships abroad at a company or organisation related to their line of business or professional field. They develop new professional competences, gain intercultural knowledge and improve their language skills. Students carry out tasks and activities matching their status as starting professional practitioners. Teachers acquire new competences and (innovative) knowledge and also improve their language skills. This helps in their professional and personal development and raises the quality of vocational education in our region. ROC A12 teachers attend lessons of their foreign colleagues, teach classes themselves, do presentations, take part in work meetings and team meetings and make arrangements for further cooperation.  \r\n\r\nThe impact aimed at in this international mobility project boils down to creating flexible, multi-skilled and interculturally competent employees who are able to comunicate in foreign languages; well equipped to operate successfully in a globalising labour market and society. ROC A12 intends to contribute to a quality foundation of skilful employees in the (Eu)region now and in the future.  We also aim at making internationalisation easily accessible to all students and teachers and we strive towards a high level of internationalisation at our school. \r\n\r\nDissemination of results takes place internally for all students and co-workers of ROC A12, externally for the international partners, by means of local and regional press and TV, for regional and national schools we work with, at national professional meetings and networking events.", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-NL01-KA102-008719_1"], ["1PJ", "Gradimo temelje prihodnosti", "Training Vision Ltd", 522982.0, "The consortium of schools of economics (Celje School of Economics, Grammar School Celje - Center, Murska Sobota School of Economics, Secondary School of Economics Maribor, Secondary School Slovenj Gradec and Muta, Secondary School of Economics Ljubljana, Grammar School of Economics and Secondary School Radovljica, Secondary School Jesenice, Secondary School of Business and Economics Koper, Novo mesto School of Economics) has formed partnership with partners in the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, Portugal and Malta for the purpose of collaborating in the mobility project for secondary school students from seven of our regions that is taking place from June 2015 until June 2016.

In this context, the local young population presents a number of pressing needs related to lack of experience and job opportunities that justify the existence of the \"ALCORC\u00d3N EN EUROPA II\" whose main objective is to promote the employability of young local people by improving their opportunities for personal development and employability levels.\r\n\r\n\"ALCORC\u00d3N EN EUROPA II\" is sponsored by a consortium coordinated by the Municipal Institute for Employment and Economic Development of Alcorc\u00f3n (IMEPE) and comprised of seven others active in the field of education institutions, training and employment, who together have extensive experience in mobility projects, providing continuity and strengthening the currently running project \"ALCORC\u00d3N IN EUROPE\".\r\n\r\n\"ALCORC\u00d3N EN EUROPA II\" is aimed at a group of 30 young people between the ages of 18 and 35 years old, in possession of a professional certificate through a VET course, obtained in any of the centers that make up the Consortium.\r\n\r\nThe professional sectors to which the project is concerned are specifically:\r\n\r\n- Physical and sports activities. \r\n- Administration and management. \r\n- Graphic arts. \r\n- Trade and marketing. \r\n- Electricity and electronics. \r\n- Energy and water. \r\n- Hospitality and tourism. \r\n- Sound and vision. \r\n- Information technology and communications. \r\n- Health. \r\n- Safety and environment. \r\n- Sociocultural and community services.\r\n\r\nThe Consortium has identified the specific needs of young graduates in these professions:\r\n\r\n- Poor knowledge of a second language, which prevents them from dealing with the demands of the labour market.\r\n- Lack of experience or training in their field, making it impossible for young people to be competitive when applying for a job. \r\n- Lack of expertise (due to the aforementioned lack of experience). \r\n- Requirement for continuous adapting to new technologies (ICT).\r\n\r\nBased on the socio-economic context, to identified needs, professional sectors and the overall project objective, we have established the following objectives for \"ALCORC\u00d3N EN EUROPA II\":\r\n\r\n- Encourage actions which look to acquire quality training and effective and specialized practice. \r\n- To combat the lack of connection between the worlds of business and education, and their respective needs, building bridges and synergies. \r\n- Provide participants with an opportunity to improve a second language with a stay abroad. \r\n- Ensure a better recognition of the competences acquired with a stay abroad.\r\n- To develop the participants' ability to entrepreneurship, to create more autonomous and sustainable societies. \r\n- Raise awareness among young people of the opportunities offered by new employment, which requires urgent demand for trained and skilled professionals. \r\n- Raising public awareness of the importance of international action to levels that contribute to local economic development and understanding of the new realities and cultures.\r\n- Contribute to the alignment of VET policies with strategies of development at local, regional, national or even European level.\r\n\r\n\"ALCORC\u00d3N EN EUROPA II\" plans stays for 30 young people, selected in accordance to a public and transparent process, to complete quality practical training in European companies for 3 months in Florence and Brescia (Italy), Lisbon (Portugal), and Portsmouth and Belfast (United Kingdom).

Key issues for the hotel industry students are connected with the methods of guest service at the hotel, e.g. by means of direct communication, getting knowledge about modern systems of reservation, check-in and check-out procedures, room service methods and fulfilment of duties on the different floors at the hotel. For the students of catering industry the main aim is to get special vocational competences concerning techniques of food preparation and serving, especially meals from other countries. Students want to know working methods and principles of special events preparation, master skills of cooperation in multicultural environment. Work expierience will enable them to know principles of hotels and restaurants working on European market. Work experience, new professional competences and language skills will prepare youth for getting a job in our country and abroad, improve their attractiveness on the job market. Hospitality and catering are prospective branches where students can find employment. One of the priorities of lodzkie region development is tourism expansion and building modern hotel chains. Hotel and catering workers should know Polish and foreign guests customs and be able to attend to different types of guests and customers. The main goal of the project is to improve the quality of the vocational training, broaden the knowledge, skills and professional competences, making easier to start professional career of future hotel and catering workers. The students will get Europass Mobility Certificate confirming skills and competences they acquired with exact description of educational path. Subsidiary goals are: putting knowledge into practice, to know modern standards and European traditions in the field of hotel and catering services, hotel and catering objects structures, regulations and work organisation, culture and traditions of another country, to adapt to life and work conditions in European countries, support of personal development, knowledge of food preparation techniques, hotel guest service and customer service and development of language skills and intercultural consciousness. Expected results are following: the students get work experience and know work prospects abroad, can use knowledge in practice and work in a team, skilfully use English, know and use professional terms, pass vocational exams well, are active on the job market, find job and work according to the highest standards, have knowledge that enable them to start their own business, they are independent, creative and tolerant, adapt to new conditions fast.

Previously, our participation has been through projects managed by the Education Ministry of the Balearic Government.\r\nTherefore, this project will involve our consolidation as an institution with European vision and offers students the opportunity to develop a training quality stay in another European country, while providing to the teachers of VET the opportunity, for the first time directly from our institution, to develop a training period.\r\n\r\nTo do this, our institution already has a systematic methodology that involves developing activities and necessary steps throughout the course as scheduled programming: briefing at the start of the course, onset of language and cultural preparation open to all stakeholders, a call publication, selection of interested students, organization of mobility, monitoring and evaluating them and finally certification and evaluation.\r\nAll these steps are possible thanks to the involvement of virtually all teachers of VET, foreign language department, management team and office staff.\r\n\r\nThe project addresses the increasing fact that students are able to develop their career and life anywhere, bear in mind that their future is not limited to the possibilities offered them their immediate environment. Living on an island as Menorca, this need even has greater importance.\r\nThe goal is that students come into contact with other ways of working in the professional areas they study, and very different from what can be found in Menorca work and industry fields. In addition, it is intended that students know and assume the reality of the European Working Market to which they belong, and are able to eliminate boundaries and open horizons for cultural, social and professional level. A difficult task, considering that our students have an additional limitation living on an island with few opportunities to travel to the rest of Europe due to the double insularity.\r\n\r\nThe training required for staff maintains this objective and it aims to improve the professional and linguistic skills of all students of Gardening and Floristry thanks to the training received by their teachers.\r\nIn this case, the project is aimed at students between 4 VET studies of our institution and a total of 12 mobility grants are requested for practical training for 4 weeks during 2015-16:\r\n    4 grants for VET students of Electrical and Automatic Installations (ELE-21)\r\n    3 grants for VET students of Gardening and Floristry (AGA-23)\r\n    One grant for a VET student of Mechanization (Mechanical manufacturing) (FME-21)\r\n    4 grants for VET students of Administrative Management (ADG-21)\r\n\r\nThese grants are distributed at various flows of students, their country of destination and the date of completion of the mobility. Thus, they will start with the 3 mobilities of Gardening & Floristry, which will take place in April 2016 in Finland, thanks to the collaboration of our partner OULU VOCATIONAL COLLEGE (OSAO).\r\nThe other mobilities are scheduled for the last week course, from late May to the third week of June 2016.

The project will also contribute to the development of the ability to \u201cadapt\u201d to the work context and to new realities and, therefore, will help improve the \u201cindividual\u2019s predisposition toward change\u201d which is essential, now more than ever, in any modern form of work organization.The achievement of the above-mentioned objectives will be ensured, in addition to the experience of local partners, also counting on the criteria by which the host foreign companies are selected; such a choice was made, in fact, taking into due consideration, on the one hand, the learning needs of the participants, on the other hand, the reliability of the partners and the quality of the training/work experience they are able to provide.In addition to the objectives that the project aims at, it is also very important the way the consortium intends to disseminate and exploit the results obtained. The project, therefore, will have a concrete impact on the territory under two different points of view: the one of the participants, who will increase their employability skills, and that of the local economy, which can make use of highly qualified human resources, able to bring in the host companies practices and processes for success (best practices) that trainees will have learned in the course of the internship abroad.", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-005109_6"], ["1PJ", "Social employability trought mobility experience", "Training Vision Ltd", 156077.0, "The SEME project is addressed to 60 students taking part in their initial vocational training in the social health care sector (vocational institutes for social services) in the region of Tuscany.The project is realized in a consortium composed Qualitas Forum (applicant) and following sending organisation: Institute of Secondary Education Elsa Morante of Florence (20 students), Institute of Secondary Education Signorelli di Cortona (20 students) and Institute of Secondary Education Santoni of Pisa (20 students) and is aimed at spreading student mobility in the social health care field in Europe.

Italian researches indicate that the problem is connected to the inadequacy of the educational system, not always able to provide the appropriate tools to support the employment of school leavers. As a matter of fact there is a significant mismatch between the professional requirements and the level of skills achieved by young people during their school education.\r\nIn the light of this a Consortium has been created, composed of six high schools, a group of local trade associations and municipalities of the Provinces of Treviso and Pordenone in the North-East of Italy. The Consortium has designed the project \u201cI MOVE\u201d with the main objective of matching the educational school syllabuses with the professional needs requested by the business world, as well as offering young students new tools and ways to increase their knowledge and professional skills.\r\nThese goals will be achieved through the development of on the spot training for 120 students (20 for each school) who will be placed in enterprises located in France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Malta, operating in the following sectors: economy, marketing, trading, mechanics, electronics, mechatronics, social services and tourism.\r\nDuring the four week training, the young participants will develop soft skills such as capacity of initiative, decision-making, adaptability, responsibility and autonomy that will support their personal and professional growth. Thus the participants will be qualified to deal with the labour market, experiencing new working environments and production methods, so as to match the professional expectations of the present business world.\r\nThe project will also enhance the cultural and linguistic background of the students, providing a multicultural and multi-linguistic working environment, and sharing values with people from different countries. This training path will allow the young participants to develop an open-minded and positive attitude towards the changes that occur in the international labour market.\r\nThrough the project \u201cI MOVE\u201d the schools of the Consortium will have a solid opportunity to build a European network between employees and enterprises, therefore establishing professional relationships. The schools and their staff will achieve an implementation of new educational paths for the professional and human growth of their students.\r\nFurthermore the project will have a positive impact on the local trade associations, allowing them to build a productive dialogue with schools in orienting educational careers towards the needs and expectations of the business companies, matching knowledge and skills required by the labour market. The local enterprises will be able to employ qualified and dynamic professional resources with an international profile.\r\nFinally the municipalities will strengthen relationships with local schools and companies, reaching the goal to promote and enhance the wellbeing and the quality of life in their community.

The expected results, in line with the needs and objectives identified, include:-The enhancement of technical and professional skills of the participants and the improvement of their professional curriculum through a certified, recognized and validated path;-The development of specific competences related to communicative and language aspects of project areas;-The implementation of high quality mobility experiences, that can be valuable in the social, cultural and professional context;-An increase in competitiveness for the participants, necessary to tackle the emerging fields of innovative jobs born to address social challenges.Finally, WELCOME promotes an innovative approach in the way we think, describe and certify work-based learning, through the creation of a stable network for the implementation of future successful projects, characterized by greater collaboration between schools, companies and social partners, using the ECVET tools. All these factors want to contribute positively to the development of a culture of quality, to the enhancement of mobility experiences and to the promotion of the knowledge of Europass and ECVET tools among potential employers, social partners and public bodies, as well as in building a solid baseline for a more cooperative, transparent and internationalized European education and production system.", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-005159_3"], ["1PJ", "Marketing 3.0 for Tourism", "Training Vision Ltd", 182059.0, "The project stems from researches and analysis of tourist sector, developed by the Consortium, and the comparison with national and European researches.The High Schools involved in the project come from the following Provinces: Lucca, Pisa , Massa-Carrara and La Spezia.Thanks to their important landscape setting, as well as, their cultural and artistic heritage, these areas are provided by a huge potential in the field of tourism.The modern tourist is not more satisfied to receive only information; new languages are required to tell about a territory: it is important to focus on a place and enhance its identity, in order to tell its story. At the same time a vineyard or a wine cellar could be a more visited site and a storytelling place. Some itineraries will  combine with others through a leitmotiv, realizing a thematic map of a country. Tourist wants to learn from the territory, becoming the protagonist and also the promoter, sharing and comparing its experience (posting photos, leaving feedback, making \"responsible\" travels).The development of our society and new communication systems shift the attention from information to the storytelling, a perfectly combination of experiences. Therefore, our wonderful natural, cultural and agri-food heritage becomes the narrative focus. In this regard, it is interesting to examine how some countries can have a relevant success in the tourism, despite their historical,  artistic, natural background and their low quality products.The abroad mobility experience is addressed to 90 young people attended the last year of High School or students that have ended it within one year, in tourism and business sector. The project aims to contribute to the professional growth of the future storyteller and the development of those sectors that can take advantage of 3.0 emotional marketing. Moreover, through the research of feelings aroused by a territory, the comparison with creative solutions and an active use of storytelling techniques, participants will be encouraged to take a new look at their country, increasing their sense of belonging and active involvement.  The participants will carry out a 3 weeks internship in the following countries: UK, Spain, Malta and Ireland. Candidates will be introduced in companies dealing with emotional marketing and storytelling; they will develop specific competences related to the process of territory storytelling, adopting the \u201cemotional\u201d strategy.Each High School will activate the recruitment of candidates through specific advertising measures. The selection process will identify candidates with the skills and competences required.The mobility preparation will last 51 hours divided into seminars (15 hours) and e-learning (36 hours).The workshops will take place at each High School with the topics listed below:1) Information about management of administrative documents and access mode to the self-learning courses and the FAD courses that will integrate experts' actions.2) Security field and emotional marketing.3) Connection between tourism and territory.4) Analysis of self-entrepreneurship and final project evaluations.It is also planned an additional FAD language course in English or Spanish.For each mobility it will be prepared an individual plan on the basis of participants' competences entry level and their personal characteristics, not forgetting, the defined learning outcomes:a) Design, definition and promotion of tourist development plans (Tuscany Region professional figures repertoire, activity area number 377).b) Adopt 3.0 marketing techniques to increase the territory value.The matching between participants and host company will be established in collaboration with our host organizations.The following project phase will concern the organization of the mobility and then the departure. Before these steps a meeting will take place to give participants the handbook and airline tickets.The monitoring will be provided by partner staff and all members of the Consortium  through skype contacts, e-mail and a blog.At the end of this experience the hosting organization will give participants the Europass mobility and the ECVET certificate of the skills and competences acquired. Serindform srl will issue a certificate of attendance and the certification of learning outcomes.The last project phase will concern the dissemination of the results achieved. These activities will directly involve the High Schools and all potentially interested subjects, who however operate in different area contexts.

There are just over 800 HVE learners at the school, 20 permanently employed staff and around 60 employees who are contracted to work with teaching.The aim of the project for staff is to gain more knowledge about EU tools and to obtain a greater insight into the overall objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy for Higher Vocational Education. More knowledge is needed regarding SeQF, EQF and how ECVET should be applied regarding the transfer of credits & qualifications, which is acquired when the staff gain insight into how work assignments are carried outdone in Europe concerning the professional roles that HVE learners at Frans Schartau are educated for. Additional aims of the project are to learn how the curriculum could better reflect the European dimension. The aim of the project for HVE learners is to acquire international work experience and to strengthen their language skills, since this is request made by the labour market. As a result of mobility, employability increases and at the same time HVE learner increase their opportunities to work in an international labour market. Mobility provides them with the opportunity to acquire key competences that include the ability to communicate in a foreign language, and to assimilate new technologies that lead to digital competence. Living in another country leads to the development of their social, personal and cultural skills. By participating in the exchange project, individual initiative is also stimulated.The project will be organised by three members of staff who have previous experience of international cooperation. Activities are well established and methods for running the project have been planned for some time. Once the project has started up and is implemented by staff and HVE learners, the work will progress according to the Activity Plan that includes, among other things, theme days, help with writing CVs and that every participant prepares themselves by investigating/examining specific areas in the destination country.Four different professional areas of work will be represented among the 16 members of staff participating in mobility, in order to achieve a comprehensive result. Staff should be in the position to apply their new knowledge immediately for the benefit of HVE learners and to support the school\u2019s own work with internationalisation. The 25 HVE learners participating each year will be selected to achieve a good spread across these four areas of work. Learners should have good interpersonal skills and a clearly stated goal for what they hope to achieve in their future careers with the help of this new experience. Participants must also have good communicative skills to be able to convey what they have learnt after their period of WPL. After selection, the goals for mobility should be agreed and anchored with the host company or organisation and the Learning Agreement written.The anticipated result is that Frans Schartau will be at the forefront when it comes to working with internationalisation. Within the organisation there will be a greater understanding of professional roles seen from a European perspective. The acquired knowledge will add an international dimension to the school\u2019s programmes and teaching, provide knowledge about SeQF, EQF and ECVET, and ensure that international Work Placements (WPL) maintain high quality.

During their time at ROC A12, students are offered the possibility to gain relevant international experience, by means of an internship abroad and/or an international study trip or exchange programme. ROC A12 has ample experience with international projects within various European programmes, Euregio, Comenius, Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus+. We work with a clear structure of a steering group of three coordinators. One coordinator for each location heads workgroups of teachers responsible for internationalisation in their courses of study. A sustainable and reliable network of some ten European partners has been set up to collaborate with us in our international projects. This network is annually evaluated by the steering group to anticipate and follow new international developments and innovations. If necessary, adjustments are made.We have set ourselves a qualitative and a quantitative goal for this project.  We aim at an increase in the quality of the Erasmus+ internships by integrating the quality cycle in the entire project. The basis for this is established in the preliminary phase: we draw up an ECVET Learning Agreement for each participant. Personal targets in the field of professional development (knowledge, skills and competences), language skills and intercultural learning are laid down in this agreement. It is signed by the participant, the internship organisation and ROC A12. Evaluation and assessment of the goals set for the internship takes place immediately after the internship. Testing of language skills is done on the basis of the European Framework of Reference. Objective testing instruments are developed by ROC A12 for the other elements  of the Learning Agreement. All participants make use of the on-line linguistic preparation and assessment modules of the Erasmus+ programme.  Every participant receives a Europass after a successful completion.  A 10-step action plan determines the logical course of the internship, from providing information to giving feedback to the internship organisation and making follow-up appointments. ROC A12 aims at an annual, quantitative growth of ten percent in our student mobility. This matches the tendency of a growing number of internship applications by students. This application is based on the participation of some 80 students doing an internship abroad. We strive for an equal division of internships for both students across all training courses we offer. Students do their internships abroad at a company or organisation related to their line of business or professional field. They develop new professional competences, gain intercultural knowledge and improve their language skills. Students carry out tasks and activities matching their status as starting professional practitioners.   The impact aimed at in this international mobility project boils down to creating flexible, multi-skilled and interculturally competent employees who are able to comunicate in foreign languages; well equipped to operate successfully in a globalising labour market and society. ROC A12 intends to contribute to a quality foundation of skilful employees in the (Eu)region now and in the future.  We also aim at making internationalisation easily accessible to all students and we strive towards a high level of internationalisation at our school. Dissemination of results takes place internally for all students and co-workers of ROC A12, externally for the international partners, by means of local and regional press and TV, for regional and national schools we work with, at national professional meetings and networking events.

It is a response to the need for continuous deepening of knowledge in the field of vocational education and the need to adapt to the growing demands of the European market.The main objective of the project is to improve the quality and attractiveness of vocational education through comprehensive preparation of teachers to undertake professional tasks realized by improving the skills and qualifications of teachers, emphasizing the European dimension of the institution (familiarizing teachers with specific objectives, values and tasks arising from European and global trends in education, acquiring partners for school mobility, co-creating international educational platforms, exchanging experiences with teachers and educational organizations in European countries) and learning new tools or methods of teaching (knowledge of European and world educational models, learning strategies and teaching methods, techniques and programs).The participants of the project will be 30 teachers (six groups of five) representing various sectors (mechanical, electric-electronic, catering, construction, information technology, hairdressing and cosmetic).In the project will be organized six mobilities of groups (of five teachers). There are planned three mobilities of education staff in the school year 2016/2017 and another three in the school year 2017/2018. Each mobility will last 12 days. There are planned two mobilities to England - for the electro-electronic industry and information technology, two mobilities to Italy - for mechanical engineering and construction and two mobilities to Spain - for foodservice and hairdressing and cosmetics. It is planned to serve an internship in the form of job shadowing in training institutions of learning profiles consistent with the professional profiles of the participants. Mobility also involves cultural knowledge of target countries - England, Spain and Italy. The internship program has been agreed with the host organizations. Recruitment of teachers will be based on defined criteria. All the project addressees will undergo language training before mobility.Partner institutions (Sistema Turismo Tribeka TRAINING LAB Training Vision) will be responsible for monitoring internships. Contact with PCKUiP will be maintained electronically and by telephone. The tutor appointed by the host organization will supervise the  current monitoring of the  participants'  practices. Within the internships will be organized the meeting participants, during which all problems and remarks will be reported and solved.In terms of evaluation, the project participants will complete prepared questionnaires and draw up individual reports on held practices. They will share their insights and observations on the created for this purpose online forum. They will prove the progress of their internships in the form of presentation. With the gained experience they will prepare lesson plans based on known methods of teaching and innovative curricula used in England, Spain and Italy.

Our position of double insularity along with the current economic crisis that is affecting Spain has lead to our people having to introduce this training and so increase their chance of employment. The project presented aims to give our students vocational training and the opportunity to undertake a stay outside of our country, which will enrich them, not just personally, but also on an academic level. Thus increasing their employment possibilities and the opportunity for them to forge a future career outside of our borders. Those students to whom this project is targeted are those of the health branch or more specifically the intermediate cycles of \u2018Auxiliary Nursing Care\u2019 and the  \u2018Emergency Health Technician\u2019 programmes. As health professionals they are subject to continuous training, avoiding their knowledge becoming stagnant and not progressing.Because of this we feel the need to opt for a project of this scale, which enriches the environment for our students with new technologies, techniques and innovations that are developed in other countries. The total number of students eligible for this offer is 16, split between both cycles. Amongst them we have 5 students from the Health Technician cycle and 8 students from the Auxiliary Nursing cycle who will develop part of their FCT during their stay. Along with 2 recent auxiliary nursing technician graduates and 1 health care technician graduate. The intended objectives are to strengthen the knowledge during the cycle, to learn about a new culture and language, to be more professionally competitive and finally acquire a job placement.Furthermore, the project aims to internationalise our faculty, offering 3 opportunities for teaching staff to \u2018job-shadow\u2019 in the health sector of foreign companies. We hope that this activity will increase the training of our staff since the objective is that the participating teachers learn and assimilate new professional techniques, and study how to apply them in our teaching. Taking into account our limited experience in such projects, the country chosen for the student to stay is Italy. For teaching staff we have chosen Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany. Our goal is to expand, in future announcements, our options to countries leading in the field of science such as those aforementioned. During the initial phase of the development of the stay, students and the recent graduates will have to also undertake the course provided on the OLS platform. a series of linguistic activities proposed by the Department of foreign languages of our Centre, with whom we will be co-ordinating for this purpose. On the other hand, we consider it necessary that prior to the completion of the foreign stay, students perform part of their FCT period in businesses on the island. With regards to monitoring the participants, we will establish an online exchange of information through email, Whatsapp and Skype between the tutors of the FTC at the receiving centre and those at the origin. As well as with the tutor responsible for monitoring the recent graduates and the co-ordination of European projects at our centre. It is expected that students complete their stay to the best of their ability and upon their return will fully share their experiences as well as those new techniques and new knowledge acquired during this period. In addition, the great autonomy that the student will acquire during their stay, being away from their family and being forced to communicate in a foreign language, is another value to take into account. With regards to staff training we hope to discover and understand new ways of working as well as new activities of teaching and learning which will be useful to apply to our centre. In terms of impact, we believe that this project will allow us to motivate all of those students on our island whom, for one reason or another, cannot picture their formal, higher level education completed, in such a way that they find our cycles to be motivating and rewarding with training that provides real working opportunities.

Moreover, they will bring to their friends the news from Europe, and, consequently, they will share their knowledge about creating the companies in European countries, consumer rights and safe use of computer. In the future, they will also help the local employers in the development of their companies as they will use gained knowledge as well as language and computer skills. The project \"Personal and professional development the key to participation in European societies\" will equip the students living in the area of high unemployment in knowledge and competences useful in active and satisfying functioning in the united Europe. It will enable them to gain practical work experience abroad. Moreover, the achieved skills will be clearly recognized due to the Europass-Mobility certificate as well as the recommendations from Polish and European employers. It will prepare the students for the deliberate planning of their future career and their further professional development. It will also prepare them for entering the European labor market and increase their chances of achieving the professional success. The project will shape pro-European attitudes, democratic behaviors and  social competences as well as it will enhance the sense of Polish and European identity of not only the participants, but also the whole local community. Thus, the durability and the effectiveness of its results will be increased.Finally, the implementation of the mobility will affect positively the image of  the school. It will be recognized as a modern institution, which prepares its students to living in the united Europe. It will also motivate both the teachers and the students to achieving better and better results. Moreover, it will strengthen the cooperation with partners, which will result in the development of our future actions connected with the vocational training.", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PL01-KA102-025737_2"], ["1PJ", "Czas zawodowc\u00f3w", "Training Vision Ltd", 167568.0, "The project regards three-week international internships for the students of Zespol Szkol Ponadgimnazjalnych No 3 named after Jan Sobieski III in Stalowa Wola. The hosting institution is situated in Rimini in Italy and Portsmouth in the United Kindom. The project will last from 01.11.2016 to 31.10.2018. The beneficiaries of this project are the 80 students of ZSP No 3 (second and third grade  of high school students) who have been educated in various areas such as economics, trade, hotel industry, tourism, gastronomy&catering&waiting staff members, photography and also basic vocational school students specializing in cooking (chef ) and trade (salesperson). The  internships include four  departures of twenty students each : from 17.09.2017 to 7.10.2017r and from  22.04.2018 to 12.05.2018r.Each group of students will be accompanied by two teachers from ZSP No 3 during internships.Each participant of the project will complete a language course in a foreign language and will take part in pedagogical and culural workshops. The students who will do an internship in the UK, will take part in a 40-hour training course in professional English, whereas the students who head for Italy, will participate in two courses: a 20-hour English language course and a 30-hour Italian language course.There are several reasons why ZSP No 3 decided to prepare that project.Stalowa Wola is located in the south-east  of Poland, the region with high unemployment rate which results in low standards of living of most of our students and their families. Therefore , rarely do our students have a chance to leave our region for recreational purposes and it seems it could be difficult for them to adjust to a new lifestyle. Students complete internships in workplaces where due to gradual process of impovershiment , there are few customers. Accordingly, our students have little contact with real working conditions. Lack of suitable vocational training, intercultural competence and worldwide experience as well as the language barrier very often generate social and occupational disqualification not only in our region but also in the country. Our school has been cooperating with numerous employers both in our region and larger Polish cities. Unfortunately, due to bad financial conditions only few students have an opportunity to complete the internships in reputable establishments out of their hometowns. Taking into consideration the needs and expectations of not only our students but also Polish and European job market we prepared the project, whose main aim is to support its participants in  improving their professional and linguistic competence, personal development and increasing chances for being employed. The main aim of the project is to improve practical skills as well as professional and linguistic competence of 80 students of ZSP No 3.Detailed targets :\u2022 the completion of a three-week international internship by 80 students\u2022 improving the professional English  language by 80 students\u2022 familiarising students with the culture and customs of the Italy and English society\u2022 learning about the European job market and its structure\u2022 promoting the mobility of workers on the European job market\u2022 gaining experience, professional competence and developing social competence by the beneficieries Thanks to the internships the students will highten their vocational skills, strenghten their language skills and they will be more motivated to master their vocational training. The internship will enable students to improve their self- assessment, gain valuable experience along with social competence. Taking part in that kind of internship is favourable for finding a job not only locally or in Poland but also in other European countries including Italy and the United Kindom. The completion of the project is significant due to the high unemployment rate in the area where the beneficieries live. The skills that students obtain during the education process, characteristic for different professions, are still very attractive and required on the European labour market.

Living on an island as Minorca, this need has even a greater importance.\r\n\r\nThe goal is that the students come into contact with other ways of working in the professional areas they study, and very different from what it can be found in the Minorcan work market and industry. \r\n\r\nIn addition, it is intended that students know and assume the reality of the European Working Market to which they belong, and are able to eliminate boundaries and open horizons for cultural, social and professional levels.

Thus, all mobilities will take place during the third trimester of the academic course 2016-2017.\r\n\r\nTo do this, our institution has already a systematic methodology that involves developing activities and necessary steps throughout the course as scheduled programming: briefing at the start of the course, the start of the linguistic and cultural preparation open to all the applicants, publication of the call, selection of interested students, organization of mobilities, monitoring and evaluating them and finally certification and evaluation.\r\n\r\nAll these steps are possible thanks to the involvement of all teachers of VET, foreign language department, management team and office staff, as well as thanks to the huge broadcasting done by the VET mobility coordination team along all the year. \r\n\r\nAs a result of this experience, these students should expand their technical and professional competence and their work beyond the area of the island where they live, or their country of residence. Therefore, the expected impact will range from improving the employability of the participants and developing their awareness as European citizens, to a greater prestige and attractiveness of our institution for its career in Europe.

It will assist learning in new contexts different from those of a school laboratory or local enterprise for the development of language skills and to experiment work environments that employ different technologies and job organizations and have different missions.  The experience will make it possible to develop both specific professional and transversal competences: the business environments will stimulate reflection, curiosity and a desire to learn; to promote and increase adaptability and flexibility, autonomy and the ability to work in a team.  Experience in an unknown international context will also be a wonderful opportunity to develop relationship skills, intercultural open-mindedness and personal responsibility, all characteristics necessary to work in the local economy.As at the end of the fourth form many participants are still minors, schools consider it necessary to have them accompanied by a teacher who will act as facilitator and take care of the participants and their safety.All institutes will take part in STAFF mobility.  The six participants involved will be five teachers of CLIL subjects in the English language (computer sciences, wine and food, maths and physics, etc.) and the administrative assistant of the Cerletti Institute dealing with the project.  Mobility will take place in the first two weeks of September, as per the plan and method indicated in the project (language training and job shadowing), only in the UK for this first year.The mobility come within the international development plan of the individual schools in the consortium which in school year 2016-17 will not only participate in staff mobility but will also extend their initiatives to promoting language certification for levels B1 to C1 in the different languages studied in the schools, increasing the number by at least 10%, and applying B1 certification to the third form so as to give participants in the future 2017 mobility an advantage.  All the schools also intend to take part in the FSE and PON regional competitions for language studies abroad for the purpose of achieving certification.The schools will extend their initiatives of hospitality, referral and exchange of both students and teachers (partnerships in Key Action 2 projects in progress, bilateral relationships with schools, invitations to visiting professors and intercultural activities).  In the framework of alternating school-work, the institutes wish to provide a broader horizon in terms of links to the world of work through category associations and internationalised businesses, with lectures in the original language by experts in subjects relating to internationalisation and pertinent to the different studies.  The school that have obtained financing from PON FESR \u201cLearning Environments\u201d will boost their digital abilities, which will assist contacts also in international relationships", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA116-005093_7"], ["1PJ", "Hvitfeldtska gymnasiet Erasmus+ Ackreditering 2016", "Training Vision Ltd", 79650.0, "The main purpose with the project is to give the students who study Economics, with focus on Business as well as Business and Administration the chance to do part of their International Work-Based Learning (IWBL). Besides our partners, we have close connections with two organizations within Service and Trade in Sweden, called Svensk Handel and K\u00f6pmannaf\u00f6rbundet. They support our project through offering networking, training, lectures, invitations to various events and venues.Thanks to very clear information about our programs to ninth graders on Open Houses, when they start school they already know the criteria for being eligible for IWBL. It is high presence, being responsible for yourself, your school work and your school. We believe these criteria help many students through school and will reduce the drop-out rate.  It is great to see the fantastic growth in the IWBL students. They do not only improve their language skills, their cultural understanding, but also develop and mature greatly as persons and become more and more independent. Many are ready for new challenges as they come back home. An important part is about enhanced self-confidence, another one is heightened tolerance and understanding of others. In the times we live in today, where many people are forced to leave their home countries and cultures are mixed, we believe these aspects are even more important than before. By participating in our project, the students are prepared for three major aspects in life. They are prepared for work life, by doing IWBL in businesses where they can find employment. They are prepared for further studies, either on an academic level or in vocational colleges. They will be prepared for adult life by being forced to take care of themselves.Both in the Board of Education, in the city of G\u00f6teborg and in the school itself, there is a strong focus on and will for increased internationalization. At Hvitfeldtska there is a long tradition of international focus. Both the principals and staff are very positive to our project and support us in all possible ways.The various tasks of the project are clearly defined. The coordinator runs the project, does all administrative work and has the major responsibility, but all the members in the team are involved. A total of eight teachers are so called destination teachers, responsible for a city each. They play a crucial role in the validation process. The coordinator works in close cooperation with the economists at the Board of Education. An important part in our development plan is to include more and more students from the Business and Administration Program and since December 2015, there is close cooperation between these two.There are many advantages in having two programs working closely in the project. Traditionally, the students from the Business and Administration come from weaker academic and socio-economic backgrounds and have fewer opportunities.  Both programs face the challenges of increased stress in our society. More and more students suffer from anxiety, stress-related symptoms, allergies, eating disorders and therefore need greater support from us than in the past.In order to meet these new demands, we need to support the students that we know will benefit from IWBL but need a bit of help on the way, by not only getting a visit after a month but also help getting to the destination and settling in.We believe that by sending accompanying staff, we can give students with fewer opportunities, from weaker socio-economic background and those with severe phobias or chronic diseases or diagnoses like for examples eating disorders the chance to go abroad for internships. Many students with backgrounds like these express the will to go abroad, but lack the courage. By accompanying these students their first week, we can strengthen the self-confidence, independence and maturity by helping them find their routines, either when it comes to eating or finding information and thereby opening up doors that otherwise would be closed for them.More and more students nowadays suffer from food, dust or mite allergies. By allowing for extra costs for gluten or lactose free diets or for purchasing specific bedding, we can meet these new needs and include even this group of students.Another important way to increase the quality of our project is to include staff training. Our plan is to, every year, send two-three teachers from each program for training abroad the first week of the fall semester so the new skills and experiences can be integrated in a natural way in the planning of the courses. By spending time at the companies, the teachers will clearer understand the situations the IWBL students face on a daily basis.A third area of improvement is getting more comfortable using ECVET. We already use CVs and Learning Agreements, but would like to expand to other tools in ECVET in order to increase the quality of our project.", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-SE01-KA116-021867_4"], ["1PJ", "Expanding the World \u2013  European Work Experience", "Training Vision Ltd", 92665.0, "Two of Aniara Upper Secondary School\u2019s overarching goals, which are described in the school\u2019s internationalisation plan, are to let internationalisation permeate the school\u2019s operations and to increase the mobility of the students. These goals are aimed at making the students \u201cjob-ready\u201d on an international labor market. This internationalisation is conducted through, i.a., specific projects such as \u201cErasmus+ mobility\u201d and strategic partnerships.The purpose of the school\u2019s mobility projects is to give the students an opportunity to pursue a six week work placement period in the UK, France or Spain, affording them language, cultural and occupational experience. The school strives for a flexible, qualitative and sustainable education, i.a. by abiding by the schools internationalisation strategy.During the next two school years the school intends to send in total 24 students from the Business and Administration programme and the Hotel and Tourism programme on an international work placement. The school has well established partners in the listed countries. The plan is to, during year 1, send eight students to the UK and three to Spain; during year 2, eight to the UK, three to Spain and two to France. The school is actively working on increasing its partnerships in France, which two teachers made a preparatory visit to during the autumn of 2015.The school\u2019s vision in its accreditation application was to send 16 students per year on work placement. Due to a decline in the number of enrolled students the school has decided to decrease the number of participants slightly. The school\u2019s ambition is to increase the number of participants when the number of enrolled students rises. The school\u2019s vocational teachers have defined the syllabus pertaining to the work placement periods for each grade and programme. The fulfilment of syllabus goals will be evaluated through visits by vocational teachers in the host country and upon the participant\u2019s return home. The project coordinator will also keep in continual contact with the participants and contact persons in the host countries in order to confirm that the syllabus goals are being met. The school\u2019s partners, who match the participants with the work placement sites, offer certain aid by following the students progress and assuring the quality of the placement sites. Upon coming home further evaluation of the acquired vocational knowledge is conducted and presented in reports, seminars and presentations. At this point a thorough evaluation is also made of how well the partners, work placement sites, work tasks and supervision have worked. Knowledge of the project will at first be spread to non-participating students at the school through blogs and vlogs created by the participating students. Later the participants will share their experiences of the project by holding oral presentations to other students at the school. The participants will also attend the Upper Secondary School Exhibition and contact local news media.The vocational programme students can choose their destination country freely based on interest. The mobility project\u2019s purpose and goals are presented to the school\u2019s students and the selected participants are prepared through regular meetings during the school year. All of the school\u2019s students follow the course English 5 and many of the students follow even higher levels of English courses. The school also offers modern language courses in Spanish and French.The school has a number of students with socio-economical difficulties. These students are encouraged to participate in the mobility project as they otherwise may not have the opportunity to experience international work placement.Courses within the Hotel and Tourism programme that are integrated with the work placement period are, i.a., activities and experiences, travel production and sales, accommodation, guide and travel guide, conference and events. Included courses for Business and Administration programme students are, e.g., practical marketing 1, purchasing 1, entrepreneurship and business and personal sales.The school is also continually taking actions to increase the compentece and knowledgeability of its staff. One of the goals of the internationalisation plan is to bolster the staff\u2019s knowledge regarding future requirements of the European labor market and to develop the international profile of the school. During the next two years the school is therefore planning to send the entire staff on job shadowing periods to Italy or Spain, where the school has well established contacts with other vocational schools. This will be done in two stages, with 10 teachers per year. The school\u2019s expectation is that the job shadowing project will inspire work placement planning and development of new course content.

Gianturco \" a 'European' Institute, with a high international standard, although it is located in a Region, Basilicata, disadvantaged economically and with significant delays due to the atavistic isolation. In order to achieve that, the school is going to start from the teaching and administrative staff training, because an exponential increase in student performance can be achieved only by improving the professional skills of school staff. On the other hand, the professional profile of teachers will be increased and aligned more closely to the challenges of tomorrow's school: this will lead to improve both motivation and satisfaction in their work. \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives that the high school \"E. Gianturco \" intends to get with this project are: \r\n\r\n- to strengthen linguistic skills of participants in mobility, with the result of a consolidation and/or development of their communication skills in a foreign language even profitably used in practical activities and a greater openness and willingness to the European mobility and lifelong learning. That will have an undeniable positive impact on teaching processes and, therefore, on learning by students; \r\n- to improve and update teaching methods to be able to design qualified learning paths, along with the use of advanced ICTs, according to the deep renovations introduced by the implementation of the Reform Law of Secondary School in 2010; \r\n- to boost soft skills such as leadership, capacity for teamwork, problem solving; \r\n- to promote more and more the awareness of European citizenship and identity, by offering participants the opportunity to create international networks; \r\n- to broaden the internationalization of the school, by offering students activities and programs that better match the needs of our modern society; \r\n- to foster the synergies and shift from formal to non-formal education; \r\n-to ensure a better recognition of the skills gained during the stay abroad. \r\n\r\nIn order to get these objectives, 25 school staff members (23 teachers, the headteacher and an administrative clerk) will attend for 20 days (excluding travel days) structured courses, guided visits and cultural activities, organized in cooperation with both our English partner Training Vision Ltd. and the Irish one ETN Training Vision Ireland Ltd. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo as to facilitate the achievement of our goals and the overall enhancement of the benefits and advantages of the initiative, school participants are expected to attend, before leaving, an orientation session, an intercultural training course and also some language classes (just for participants who don't have at least an A2 CEF English level). \r\n\r\nEffective communication and clear division of tasks between partners, sharing of tools and working methods, continuous and multidimensional monitoring and assessment, widespread dissemination strategy and exploitation of results are the elements that will distinguish the project implementation methodology. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the mobility experience participants will be able to:  \r\n                                                                    \r\n- improve their proficiency in English language, by using with relevance and appropriateness specific morphosyntactic structures and vocabulary, in order to plan Curricular tracks according to high quality standards;\r\n- choose the syllabus topics so that there is a consistent relationship between CLIL and native language teaching modules;\r\n- foster the updating of syllabuses; \r\n- acquire tools and teaching strategies that develop key competences of students, such as learning how to learn and sense of initiative;\r\n- enhance the ability to design learning environments, clearly aimed at carrying out dynamic learning paths in which aware students may be oriented, but not driven;\r\n- encourage the introduction of appropriate methodologies for new learning challenges, increasingly geared toward multimedia;\r\n- strengthen the support and promotion of international mobility initiatives and improve their management procedures.\r\n\r\nThe whole school will become an up-to-date educational environment, dynamic and professional, able to strategically plan the professional development of its staff according to the individual needs and the Institution goals.

For a few years many initiatives in our school have been addressed to such an aim: our school is the seat of the Delegation of \"Centrum Latinitatis Europae\" in the Eastern Sicily, every year we organise  a national Certamen of Scientific and Technical Literature and conferences /workshops about the Classic tradition considered as a unifying element of Scientific knowledge and Humanity knowledge in the European culture, and we  carry on school projects which follow the steps  in the history of Physics with a particular attention on its classic origin. The training of the teachers and, in general, of the school staff, is a central point for the achievement of this goal because, if the teachers are broad minded, they will be able to convey to their students , through the specificity of their subjects, the unity of Knowledges which is the core of the European culture and they will throw students into an intercultural dimension. So, with this project , not only are we aiming at the improvement of  competences and methodologies, but we are also creating a modern environment to make  the school look at an intercultural setting through a collation among teachers and students from different countries. There will be 17 teachers involved in the mobility, from different teaching areas, from Greek and Latin to Hystory and Philosophy, from Maths and Phisycs to English. In our school there are some students with special needs, so a project which considers students as the main target group of the teacher training, cannot but consider, among the participants, two teachers for inclusion from Humanities and Science.  The project activities will be concerned to three development areas: 1) the use of ICT in Classics teaching and the comparison between the Italian curricula and the European ones in the field of Classics; 2) The use of CLIL methodologies for the teaching of Maths, Phisycs, History and Philosophy; 3) The use of ICT and e-Learning and e-Twinning platforms in the teaching of English. During all phases of the project, which will last 13 months, we will choose methdologies in which the mental procedures typical of the Scientific thought are applied in interdisciplinary routes. After the first  step of mobility and an important work of dissemination of the materials and the methods among their collegues,  teachers of Latin and Greek will help the third and fourth  year students to search and analyse the ancient tests from Latin and Greek Literature. These tests will be later considered in their Historic/Philosophical context and  their scientific  content will be studied by Maths/Physics teachers by using a CLIL methodology which will use English as a vehicular language.

The deadlines of the events are supposed not to disturb the school work. The choice of the countries is obvious since their teachers have already had some experience in the field of migration and working with students of another nationality and culture.\r\nThe phenomenon of migration is getting more and more noticeable in Poland. For the system of education it is a challenge to organise the teaching process for students of various backgrounds and cultures. Schools play an important role in culture integration and supporting alien children. Through realising the project we would like to get the answer for the question what difficulties can appear at school attended by children with migration experience, and we hope to learn how to deal with this problem.\r\nThe detailed aims include familiarising with the culture adaptation process, creating an image of school as a place of a foreign student adaptation, shaping the teachers\u2019 attitude toward cultural variety, learning the legislations regulating migration issues and learning the rules and regulations being followed in European institutions related to working with students of a different nationality and culture. The aims refer to finding the ways how to cope with multiculturalism in Italian and English schools. We are willing to learn how to act with an alien child, how to prepare a class and take care of a foreign student so that he/she could adapt properly in a Polish school. The goal of the training course will be also to develop the competences enabling our employees to work effectively with the mentioned type of students, supporting the integration among school society and improving intergroup bonds. Observing such activities in Italian and English schools will help us to plant them in our place.

There are also language certificates as well as the certificates given by the foreign partners.

Thanks to new experiences and acquired knowledge, it would be easier to convince our students that it is worth travelling, learning foreign languages and becoming a citizen of Europe.\r\nIt should also be emphasized that international dimension of school and its European activity are absolutely essential for modern education. As a result of many-sided development of teachers and promoting European dimension of a vocational school, it raises its prestige and becomes more attractive for students.\r\nWe are convinced that one-week stay abroad among teachers from other European countries will end up in future collaboration, such as carrying out projects through e-twinning platform.\r\nUsing English language in different subjects will prepare our students to operate on European labour market and to become European citizens.

Only in a few European countries every child are entitled to attend ECEC and the demand and supply of the service is balanced. In Italy, not only there is no right to ECEC, but the demand is much greater than supply.

The sectors in which the students will have the chance to take their internship are the following:\r\n- Agribusiness (Backery and Pastry; Agriculture)\r\n- Arts and Crafts (Fashion, Wood)\r\n- Mechanic and Construction (Mechanics, Masonry, Electric, Electronic, Thermo-hydraulic)\r\n- Graphics\r\n- Administrative, Selling\r\n- Tourism and Catering\r\n- Personal Service (Beauty and Hairdressing)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the partnership will involve 16 partners from 6 different countries (ES, IE, UK, FR, DE, FI). Such a wide partnership will result in fruitful experience for the students, suitable to any professional path. \r\n\r\nThe DUAL MOB project promotes 2 different types of Transnational Mobility: 1) 3-4 weeks internships in a company abroad, carried out by students attending an Initial VET course; 2) 3-4 weeks in a VET centre abroad, with periods spent in company or other context, carried out by students attending an Initial VET course. \r\n\r\nThe Learning Outcomes will be valorized and recognized through the ECVET system. In fact, the Consortium Members will take advantage of the experience and the ECVET tools developed during the GORES project. \r\nThe project will have an impact on the development of professional and transversal skills of VET students and staff involved (accompanying persons), as well as on the offer of VET  training provision which will be possible thanks to the improvement in the use of the WBL approach and by strengthening the mutual trust among project partners.\r\n\r\nThis project will also lay the groundwork for enrichment in terms of organizational and teaching methods that the sending organisations may exploit during the pilot project related to the Dual System in Italy.", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005930_2"], ["2TR", "The Work Based Learning process in European Vocational / Educational Training, through Better Social and Economic Strategic Outcome for Youth Employability in the Tourism Sector", "Premier Inn", 438362.0, "The project raises in the CONTEXT of the \u201cStrategic framework \u2013 Education & Training 2020 (\u201cET 2020\u201d), in particular regarding the strategic objective 1,  \u201c.that the learning periods abroad should be the norm.\u201d\r\nIt promotes the guidelines of the conference \u201cWork-based Learning 2020\u201d of the NetWBL Network, which was held in Berlin (June 2016). \u201cCountries with a strong professional training system (VET Centre) and learning system, with strengthened apprenticeship systems, have a better performance in terms of youth employment\u201d.

During their time at ROC A12, students are offered the possibility to gain relevant international experience, by means of an internship abroad and/or an international study trip or exchange programme. ROC A12 has ample experience with international projects within various European programmes, BAND, Euregio, Comenius, Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus+. We work with a clear structure of a steering group of three coordinators. One coordinator for each location heads workgroups of teachers responsible for internationalisation in their courses of study. A sustainable and reliable network of some ten European partners has been set up to collaborate with us in our international projects. This network is annually evaluated by the steering group to anticipate and follow new international developments and innovations. If necessary, adjustments are made.\r\n\r\nWe have set ourselves a qualitative and a quantitative goal for this project.  \r\n\r\nWe aim at an increase in the quality of our international mobility, including the Erasmus+ internships, by integrating the quality cycle in the entire project. The basis for this is established in the preliminary phase by drawing up a Learning Agreement for each participant. Personal targets in the field of professional development, language skills and intercultural learning are laid down in this agreement. It is signed by the participant, the internship organisation and ROC A12. Evaluation and assessment of the goals set for the internship takes place immediately after the internship. Testing of language skills is done on the basis of the European Framework of Reference. Objective testing instruments are developed by ROC A12 for the other elements  of the Learning Agreement. All participants make use of the on-line linguistic preparation and assessment modules of the Erasmus+ programme.  Every participant receives a Europass after a successful completion.  A 10-step action plan determines the logical course of the internship, from providing information to giving feedback to the internship organisation and making follow-up appointments. \r\n\r\nROC A12 aims at an annual, quantitative growth of ten percent in our student mobility. This matches the tendency of a growing number of internship applications by students. We have analysed the need for teacher mobility before applying for this project. Teacher and staff mobility is therefore also a demand-driven activity.\r\n\r\nThis application is based on the participation of 80 students and 30 teachers/staff employees doing an internship abroad. We would like to stress that we offer this opportunity to all of our participants; students with learning, mental or physical difficulties, students from  disadvantaged backgrounds or descending from immigrant families, students with a low living standard and students belonging to an ethnic minority.  This matches with the ROC A12 Watermark: enabling all our students to develop themselves in the best possible way. We strive for an equal division of internships for both students and teachers across all training courses we offer. Students and teachers do their internships abroad at a company or organisation related to their line of business or professional field. They develop new professional competences, gain intercultural knowledge and improve their language skills. Students carry out tasks and activities matching their status as starting professional practitioners. Teachers acquire new competences and (innovative) knowledge and also improve their language skills. This helps in their professional and personal development and raises the quality of vocational education in our region. ROC A12 teachers attend lessons of their foreign colleagues, teach classes themselves, do presentations, take part in work meetings and team meetings and make arrangements for further cooperation.  \r\n\r\nThe impact aimed at in this international mobility project boils down to creating flexible, multi-skilled and interculturally competent employees who are able to comunicate in foreign languages; well equipped to operate successfully in a globalising labour market and society. ROC A12 intends to contribute to a quality foundation of skilful employees in the (Eu)region now and in the future.

Its  nature is closely linked to the fact that sport is a specific activity which regulates social relations and the reason for doing sport is the interests and the needs of every separate individual. The significance and the diversity in respect to sport were pointed out by the European Commission a long time ago. This is one of the main reasons to recognise in this connection the increasing importance of learning and the strive for better education and skills.\r\nYoung people cannot expect anymore to spend their whole life in one and the same sphere of activity or even in one and the same place. Their career path can change, so, they need a wider range of skills which could enable them to get adapted,  to be more flexible. The profession of the sports manager is attractive with excellent work and development prospects both in Bulgaria and abroad. The interrelation between sport and economy led over the last years to intensive development of the sports industry and has turned sport into an economic sphere. This, alongside with other prerequisites (economic, social, educational, cultural) has laid the foundations for the development of sports pedagogics, sports management and sports marketing.

Our project partners are educational organizations in the sphere of sports, with excellent sports specilaists and sports facilities. \u201cInter Sport Group\u201d as a sports organisation with international character works with students from different sports schools by assisting their professional realisation out of school, predominantly in the sphere of informal education. The objective of the project  is to encourage initiativeness, entrepreneurship and the future adaptability for employment. By providing additional opportunities for them, the project will enable the students to find realisation on the labour market after finishing their education and after finalising active sports career with most of them. During their training period, innovative methods will be applied of theoretically innovative practices and their application in a real environment. The project will provide equal chances to every beneficiary with no prejudice in respect to sex and ethnicity for mobility participation with the necessary motivation to further develop their knowledge or acquire new knowledge. Practice will help the further development of theoretical knowledge and the obtaining of practical experience. The mobililty practice will introduce beneficiaries to innovations in the marketing and management of sports, to  innovative sports activities programs, to the methodology and the systems for work with different ages and people with different interests. As a result of and due to the impact of the project, skills will be acquired for developing business plans for starting own business, training programs, marketing surveys for different sports activities, innovative European methods and practice for getting to know the relation between the production structures in sport, the company entities, functioning on the sports market and the consumers of sports production. Out of their project participation, students will gain extra linguistic and cultural competences.The relation sport-business makes us consider that for the application of management as a profession in sport, it is necessary to get to know the specifics and good practices. The long-term prospects for the practice beneficiaries will lead to efficient application of this interesting profession in a professional aspect and this will enhance the socio-economic significance of sport in society.

The project also refers to the European School Development Plan, which assumes, among other things, the creation of conditions for students to actively participate in the European labor market in an intercultural society and support for teachers in their professional development by introducing educational innovations and the enhancement of teaching quality.  There is also an identified, real need to strengthen the professional profile of students from the Complex of Schools of Economics to experience working abroad and its confirmation by a relevant certificate (Europass Mobility).\r\nThe project is aimed at 60 students of third classes, educating in the following professions: economic, IT , tourist service  and advertising technicians; as well as at 10 teachers who work in The Complex of Schools of Economics in Poznan.\r\nThe teachers will be provided with cultural and linguistic preparation before the trip. They will create and display after the return the presentations about innovative methods of teaching. The project participants will also hold demonstration classes addressed to all teachers interested in their vocational development. The school staff will also take part in chosen one- week eTwinning training.   The trained teachers, open to new methods and ways of working with students, will enhance their educational effectiveness and will create more modern, engaged and professional environment in the school.

They choose private education for their children even though it is expensive for them because they want the best.  Quite often, they cannot help their children with their homework and cannot afford to send them abroad.\r\nOur school is very dynamic and we organize many activities to motivate our students (trips to England, a one month work experience in England since 2002, a two weeks work experience in Spain, an exchange with some pupils in Norway, integration seminary, revision week-end, conferences, outings,\u2026).\r\nOur European section in English opened in 2004 for pupils in Secretarial and accounting vocational courses that has become Management Administration today.  That section glows on the whole school and is a key section for our school, completely part of our educational project.\r\nSince 2003, one year before getting the label European Section, a group of 8 to 12 students do a one month work experience in England, Felixstowe.  The last group to go to Felixstowe was in May-June 2014 to do a work experience in charity shops or restaurants.\r\nFrom 2015 our partnership with our English teacher personal contact stopped and we had to turn to an agency to help us find new partnerships and help us with the organization and the following up of our students.  We had to turn to an intermediary organization to help us  find the best placements and families for our students.  We have chosen Portsmouth for a fresh new start and for a change.\r\n11 year12 students did their work experience in november 2015 and 15 Year 11 students in January 2016.  All the organization is thought through and the students are prepared on a linguistic and cultural level.  In Year 1 of their vocational GNVQ, the students go on a linguistic stay for one week in Great Britain to discover an English country.  In year 2 they  do their 4 week work experience placement in Portsmouth and in year 3 they  use all their learning and practicing of the English language they have acquired along those experiences for their final exam to get the European distinction on their vocational Baccalaureat.\r\nThe project is lead by the two English teachers and the monitoring team, the students, the parents, the Headmistress and the deputy Head teacher in charge of the vocational school and the staff: contact with the different partners  to organize the work experiences, information for parents, collection of documents, survival kit booklet for the students, students preparation, , evaluation in the British companies, financial balance, events organizations and news of the European section broadcasted through the school, the RIDF (Ile de France Region Admin), the CRE (European Center for Resources), our sponsors and parents.\r\nThe excellent results our pupils have received every year for their European distinction (between 95 and 100%), TOEIC and TOEIC Bridge success, Europass cocktail, events in the European section are always communicated and put forward on our internet website, to high schools around us especially our partner Junior school Saint Augustin, the town, the local paper, parents and pupils.\r\nWork experiences abroad have a positive impact on our school because the pupils who have lived that experience are extremely proud to share it.  A European section created 12 years ago and so successful glows on the school so much that we offer now mobilities in Spain for Vocational Sales Students, on the same basis but in partnership with a school.  These projects are key projects in our school and we hope that it will last for a long time thanks to the grant we will get from our Erasmus+ programme an from other sponsors.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036683_3"], ["1PJ", "Europejski sta\u017c-pocz\u0105tek zawodowej kariery ucznia", "Training Vision Ltd", 130178.0, "The project \"European internship \u2013  the beginning of the future professional career\" is going to be implemented in TechniczneZak\u0142adyNaukowe in Cz\u0119stochowa, the biggest secondary technical school in the region.During the long process of the project preparation, all the needs of the institution have been thoroughly diagnosed and described in the European Development Plan.\r\nThe priority needs include :\r\n1.

Therefore , rarely do our students have a chance to leave our region for recreational purposes and it seems it could be difficult for them to adjust to a new lifestyle. Students complete internships in workplaces where due to gradual process of impovershiment , there are few customers. Accordingly, our students have little contact with real working conditions. Lack of suitable vocational training, intercultural competence and worldwide experience as well as the language barrier very often generate social and occupational disqualification not only in our region but also in the country. Our school has been cooperating with numerous employers both in our region and larger Polish cities. Unfortunately, due to bad financial conditions only few students have an opportunity to complete the internships in reputable establishments out of their hometowns.\r\n Taking into consideration the needs and expectations of not only our students but also Polish and European job market we prepared the project, whose main aim is to support its participants in  improving their professional and linguistic competence, personal development and increasing chances for being employed.\r\n The main aim of the project is to improve practical skills as well as professional and linguistic competence of 80 students \r\nof ZSP No 3.\r\nDetailed targets :\r\n\u2022 the completion of a three-week international internship by 80 students\r\n\u2022 improving the professional English  language by 80 students\r\n\u2022 familiarising students with the culture and customs of the Italy and English society\r\n\u2022 learning about the European job market and its structure\r\n\u2022 promoting the mobility of workers on the European job market\r\n\u2022 gaining experience, professional competence and developing social competence by the beneficieries\r\n\r\n Thanks to the internships the students will highten their vocational skills, strenghten their language skills and they will be more motivated to master their vocational training.

These learners will take part in mobility flows lasting 28 days and will be welcome by Training Vision (UK), Malta Vocational Centre (Malta) and AIP Languages (Spain), who will organise and manage their internships in companies of the tourist, hospitality and restauration sectors. They will attend online language preparation before departure.\r\nAs for the staff, EnAIP commitment is aimed at improving, at an internationalisation level, the skills of the human resources involved, at different levels, in the provision of effective training processes which need to reply to the needs of the companies, which are in return also implied in internationalisation processes (decentralisation, systemic or sectorial network, partnerships, merging, etc.). The internationalisation development thus means for EnAIP the achievement of a higher ability to prepare their operators to sustain the motivations, ambitions and personal and professional projects in a European dimension of youngsters and make them able to reply to the needs of the companies and of the labour market, so to improve their employability and to act as active citizens through labour inclusion. \r\nEnAIP staff will be involved in updating training sessions abroad on the following topics:\r\n- UK, cross cultural management \u2013 for trainers, front- and back-office operators\r\n- UK, didactic methodologies for foreign languages \u2013 for trainers\r\n- Malta, English language \u2013 for front- and back-office operators\r\n- France, Labour services offer \u2013 for case managers, guidance experts, project managers and designers\r\n- Spain, social and cultural integration of foreign citizens \u2013 for trainers, guidance experts, managers and designers of projects addressed to migrants\r\n- Denmark, Didactic 2.0 \u2013 for project designers and trainers", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005745_20"], ["1PJ", "PLUS - Mechatronics Ultimate Skills in Europe", "Training Vision Ltd", 240927.0, "The project proposal PLUS-MUSE (PLUS -Mechatronics Ultimate Skills in Europe) falls within the programming framework outlined in the Erasmus+ VET Mobility Charter obtained in 2016.

The mobility learning outcomes will be tailored to the single participant in order to give them the chance to obtain the final qualification of expert in MECHATRONICS AND AUTOMATION SYSTEMS. Along with the professional competencies, the mobilities will also be expected to improve participants\u2019 linguistic and social competencies.  \r\nParticipants will be divided into groups of about 6 learners each. Mobilities will take place in Germany, UK, Bulgaria and Spain and will have a duration of 12 weeks. Hosting Partners abroad have been selected in view of their connections with host-companies in the mechatronics and automation sector and their capacity to offer quality internships. The contents and the learning outcomes for the internships will be discussed with the companies and the participants. Participation to the project PLUS-MUSE will be based on an application by the participants on the basis of public open calls. Before the internship abroad, a preliminary linguistic, cultural and pedagogical preparation stage of 2 weeks will be carried out in Trento, to be financed with regional resources. The learners will also benefit from using the European OLS platform. The experience abroad will also include a 3-day initial induction and preparation to the workplacment. At the end of the experience abroad, 2 days of programme follow up will be organized in Trento. \r\nUpon return to Italy, a second internship experience of 8 weeks in Trentino in the mechatronics and automation sector will be available, this time aimed at work placement.

Those are:  high presence, being responsible for yourself, your school work and your school. Doing International Work-Based Learning (IWBL) is very popular among our students and by stressing the importance of these criteria, we believe we help many students through school and drop-out rates are reduced.  \r\nIt is great to see the fantastic growth in the students who go abroad, doing their IWBL. They do not only improve their language skills, their cultural understanding, their service and communication skills, but also develop and mature greatly as persons and become more and more independent. Many are ready for new challenges as they come back home and we have multiple stories of students who tell one or two years later that without those seven weeks abroad, they would not have dared to apply to schools abroad or dared to take on some other challenges. It definitely opens up new doors for the students. An important part is about enhanced self-confidence, another one is heightened tolerance and understanding of others. In the times we live in today, where many people are forced to leave their home countries and cultures are mixed, we believe these aspects are even more important than before. \r\nBy participating in our project, the students are prepared for three major aspects in life. They are prepared for work life, by doing IWBL in businesses where they can find employment. The result is increased employability both on the Swedish and the European market. They are prepared for further studies, either on an academic level or in vocational colleges. They will be prepared for adult life by being forced to take care of themselves.\r\nBoth at the Board of Education, in the city of G\u00f6teborg and in the school itself, there is a strong focus on and will for increased internationalization. At Hvitfeldtska there is a long tradition of international focus. Both the Head of School, the principals and staff  are very positive to our project and support us in all possible ways.\r\nWe have close connections with two organizations within Service and Trade in Sweden, called Svensk Handel and K\u00f6pmannaf\u00f6rbundet. They support our project by offering networking, training, lectures, invitations to various events and venues.\r\nThe various tasks of the project are clearly defined. The coordinators run the project, do all administrative work and have the major responsibility, but all the members in the team are involved. A total of ten teachers are so called destination teachers, responsible for one or two cities each. They work closely with the coordinators, they have the day-to-day contact with the students abroad, they visit the students after about half the time and therefore play a crucial role in the validation process. The coordinators work in close cooperation with the economists at the Board of Education, so all financial issues are well taken care of. The project has expanded since last year, thanks to more staff involved and a stronger, more solid student body. From about a year ago, there are now two coordinators instead of one. The work-load can greatly be shared which makes the project less vulnerable. Also, year by year, we receive more and more students who meet the criteria for IWBL. Since there are more staff involved in total, we can also meet the demands of students with weak backgrounds, fewer oppurtunities or special needs and give support on a more individual basis.\r\nAn important part in our development plan has been to include more and more students from the Business and Administration Program and since December 2015, there is close cooperation between these two programs, something the whole school benefits from.  \r\nAnother important way to increase the quality of our project is to include staff training. Since the well-coordinated staff training in September 2016 was a great success, our plan is to every year send two-three teachers from each of the two programs for training abroad the first week of the fall semester so the new skills and experiences can be integrated in a natural way in the planning of the courses. By spending time at the same companies in the same cities as the students, the teachers will know exactly which skills are needed and can adapt his/her teaching accordingly. \r\nA third area of improvement is getting more comfortable using ECVET.

The province is characterized by a longstanding industrial tradition, in which small and medium-sized businesses have flourished, and by a high migratory flow.\r\nKnowing that the globalization of the economy requires the school system to produce highly competent and flexible professionals, ITIS Castelli has always been committed to forming relationships of collaboration and synergy with the institutions and companies of the region, but now reread in a European light. In consistency with that which the School European Development Plan indicates, the school is aware of the need to develop didactic practices centered on Work Based Learning in order to bridge the school-work gap and to internationalize itself. \r\nThe main characteristics of the context in which the project has been designed are three:\r\n1)The institute is one of the most complex and multifaceted schools in the region of Lombardy with its 2151 students, of whom 20% are citizens of foreign countries. The average high school dropout rate in the region is equal to 29.8%, which is above the national average of 27.9%. IIS Castelli is not immune to this trend. It is, therefore, a priority for the school to improve the academic, training, and work-related success of all students, and in particular of those who are most deserving but most disadvantaged.\r\n2)The analysis of the occupational needs of our area has shown two important points: \r\nin 2017 the disparity between job demand and offer of technicians increased up to 40%: companies began requiring not only technical competences but also, and above all, additional soft-skills and e-skills.\r\nIIS Castelli has always been dedicated to the needs of the area, and therefore strives to bridge the school-work gap.\r\n3)Having consulted with the industrial and business industry of the region, the Institute encountered a very limited use of the European certifications such as Europass and ECVET. Instead, the school policy seeks to assert and promote recognition and validation of the competences of the students as this will foster mobility of citizens and workers with a positive impact both on our society and its economy.  \r\nThe main objectives of \u201cMo.VE\u201d are:\r\nOverall Objective: improve the training success of all students, and in particular of those who are most deserving but most disadvantaged.\r\nPurposes:\r\nImprove:\r\n1) technical/professional competences; \r\n2) linguistic competences;\r\n3) digital skills;\r\n4) relational skills.\r\nThe highly motivating experience described in the project, which provides for internships in EU member states (Germany, Ireland and the UK), will allow for the development of not only the necessary professional competences, but also of the key and citizenship competences that will enable students to learn and grow over the course of their career.\r\nThe two-year project concerns the mobility of 45 students, per year, of the fourth class in all of the institute\u2019s specializations for internships in the cities of Berlin, Cork and Portsmouth, for three weeks. The students will be accompanied by 2 teachers who will alternate every week, for a total of 18 teachers per year.\r\nThe main impact of the project will be on the reduction of school dropout: positive learning and relational experiences will increase the student\u2019s faith in his or her own abilities, which will increase the student\u2019s motivation and, hopefully, reduce school dropout rates.\r\nMo.VE will open new horizons to the students and will allow them to consider themselves confident and professionally competent European citizens, capable of continual personal growth. Moreover, they will possess the knowledge of foreign languages as real means of communication  in life and work.\r\nThe mobility experience will, hopefully, help to close the gap between school and work and demonstrate to local companies the importance of the use of the European instruments/certificates in order to facilitate the mobility of students and workers.\r\nThe most innovative aspect of Mo.VE is the large amount of data collected: this will help not only to systematically monitor the students\u2019 learning process and the impacts of the project, but also to compare the students\u2019 vocational training performances abroad- as well as locally- in order to support the recognition of the learning outcomes.\r\nAt the project\u2019s conclusion, ITIS Castelli will be equipped with new permanent competences capable of transforming the pilot project into a stable experience of the curriculum.\r\nIn the long run, the mobility project will produce new and flexible professional profiles that will be able to satisfy the needs of the global labor market.", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA102-006389_3"], ["2RG", "WBL+ECVET+EPRO=European Professional Skills for Employability", "Portsmouth English Language School", 605995.0, "The EuPROSkillS project raises in the context of the European Development Plan of the Vocational Educational Training Centers of the Umbria Region, and from the need to improve the quality of traineeships, in line with the Framework Agreement: \u201cImplementation of good practices regarding dual-training\u201d approved by the DGR n.377 11/04/2016, and to pursue the guidelines of the strategic framework \"Education and Training \u2013 ET 2020\", in particular Objective 1, \u201c..that abroad training periods are supposed to be usual..\u201d.\r\nIt promotes the directives of the conference \u201cWBL 2020\u201d of the NetWBL Network, which took place in Berlin on 28/06/2016\u2013 \u201cCountries with a strong professional and educational training system, with settled apprenticeship systems, are going to be stronger in terms of youth employment\u201d.

The school conducts Higher Vocational Education in Travel & Tourism and Hospitality, Accounting and Finance, Health and Welfare, Retail, and IT. The number of students at the school is just over 700, there are 22 permanently employed staff, and 60 to 80 contracted staff working with education. The project is linked to the EU\u2019s educational policy goals; at least 40% of all 30-34 year-olds should have completed tertiary education. The project is timely with regard to EU goals \u2013 Higher Vocational Education in Sweden has never before been allocated so many places. The political direction is clear \u2013 there is a strong commitment to HVE. \r\n \r\nThe aim of the project for staff is to obtain more knowledge about EU tools, and to gain better insight into the overall goals set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy for Higher Education. Knowledge is needed about SeQF, EQF and how ECVET can be implemented concerning credit transfer. Staff will gain knowledge by learning how tasks are performed, taught and assessed in Europe within the professional roles that students are educated for at Frans Schartau. Further aims of the project are to see how the European dimension can be reflected in the curriculum. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the project for students is to provide them with international professional experience, and increased language skills as requested by the labour market. One consequence of mobility is that employability increases while strengthening the student\u2019s ability to work in an international labour market. Through exchange, students get the opportunity to acquire key competencies such as communicating in another language, learning new technologies that increase digital skills. Living in another country leads to the development of social, personal and cultural skills, and by participating in exchange projects a person\u2019s capacity to take initiative is stimulated. \r\n \r\nThree members of staff with experience of international cooperation will organise the project. Well-established activities and methods have been planned for some time. After starting up the project and implementation with staff and students, work will progress according to the Activity Plan that also includes theme days, help with writing CVs, and that each participant prepares themself by examining specific areas in the recipient country. \r\n\r\nFive different professional areas of work at the school will be represented among the 14 employees participating in mobility to obtain a comprehensive result. Staff should be in the position to immediately apply their new skills to benefit students and promote work on internationalization at the school. The 25 students participating each year will be selected to achieve a good spread across the various areas of work. Students must have a good communicative ability to be able to pass on what they have learnt after their Work Placements. After selection, mobility goals will be anchored with the host organization or company and the Learning Agreement written.\r\n\r\nThe intended outcome is that the school should be at the forefront of internationalization work. There will be more knowledge within the organization about professional roles seen from a European perspective. The knowledge acquired will give courses and teaching at the school an international dimension, increase knowledge of SeQF, EQF and ECVET as well as ensuring that international Work Placements maintains high quality.\r\n\r\nThe school is part of the City of Stockholm, which organizes education at all levels so that circulation of results will be via the City's Intranet and in the newsletter. The companies (about 100) linked to the school\u2019s various steering groups as well as industry organizations within the various fields of education will be invited to participate in breakfast meetings and theme days in order to gain access to the school\u2019s internationalization work. All niche companies that the school works with will have access to a workforce that has international experience.\r\n\r\nOnce the entire project has been completed, Frans Schartau Business Institute will have strengthened international cooperation in Higher Vocational Education in Europe, which will facilitate future work on implementation of ECVET. If the project is carried out full-scale, in addition to the contacts made through staff skills development, it will also have included supervisors from 40 companies in Europe whereby knowledge and insights are spread further.

The goal of the Project is to promote and enhance the participants\u2019 education and training within a European Context. This Project is meant to include 34 participants, encompassing students, ex-students and staff members.\r\nEPFA wishes to ensure that the participants will take part in different learning experiences within the European job market. The vocational courses\u2019 curriculum in EPFA includes three different teaching areas: sociocultural, scientific and technical, as well as training periods (internships) in companies. The participants in the Project, which include Mobilities ErasmusPRO, will all be students and ex-students from EPFA, namely: Social and Psychological Care, Sports, Viticulture, Health Assistant, Sports Management and Audiovisual. We also included in the Project for the students of the Viticulture, Health Assistant, Sports Management and Audiovisual Vocational Courses who have successfully graduated from EPFA. Moreover we included Job Shadowing Days for the Staff members of our school.      \r\nThis Project will allow all the participants to take part in training periods (internships) in companies abroad, giving them the opportunity to learn new technical skills and improve their professional competences in a different working environment related to their vocational areas. These training periods within the companies will put the participants in touch with different cultural and social realities, which will allow them to develop their interpersonal abilities and also improve their foreign languages skills. Through the internships experience abroad, EPFA expects the participants to learn and master new professional tools and gather useful job connections, which will enhance their employability and give them the possibility to enter the European job market more easily, or even motivate them to create their own job/company.  \r\nWe will work hard with our partners and make a joint commitment to assure that the beneficiaries will find in the placements abroad the necessary conditions to make them develop and improve as many personal and professional skills and abilities as possible, namely: critical and creative thinking, decision-making skills, autonomy, self-confidence, team-work ability, problem-solving skills, self-esteem, responsibility and several vocational skills implied in the job/tasks performed. The internships will also help the participants to prioritize interests, establish goals and improve their time management capacity and their ability to adapt to different working contexts. A safe and intellectually stimulating working environment will be provided to all participants. With the help of our partners abroad we will try to find placements where the participants will feel welcome and free to express their opinions, ask questions and share ideas and experiences. \r\nBearing in mind that Alentejo is one of the most underprivileged regions in the country, taking part in a European Project means the world to most of our students who have low expectations towards their own future and lack opportunities to flee the lower conditions they live in and surpass the difficulties they face every day. This Project can be life changing for them and therefore we expect our participants to truly embrace this Project in order to develop their entrepreneurial skills, become more competitive professionally and widen their horizons. When they return from their working experience abroad they should be able to take advantage of what they have learned and be willing to use that advantage to take a chance, be positive, determined and confident, seize the opportunities ahead and trust their ability to find a suitable job and grab their place in the European job market with both hands.\r\nWe wish to provide the participants the possibility to take part in different experiences in a European context. Thus all the beneficiaries will have the opportunity to put the skills they have already learned at school and during the previous internships in local and national companies into practice abroad. The participants will take what they have learned in Portugal and share it with our partners abroad and at the same time learn new practices. The fact that they will be faced with different new ways of working in the companies abroad will be an advantage for them in the future.

It was found in 1982 to respond to the overcrowding of the schools of the Central urban center of Leiria and to correspond to the notorious demographic growth of the parish of Marrazes. This parish has been chosen as a place of fixation by (i) migrants, with diverse cultures and traditions, creating natural tensions arisen by the uprooting and adjustment to new customs.\r\n\r\nThus, ESALV assumes itself as an integrator hub of this multicultural community, not losing sight of its educational mission to promote scientific knowledge.\r\n\r\nWe believe that by increasing the level of education of our young people and the investment in their training, both academic and professional, we will contradict one of the main causes of unemployment and poverty in the younger age classes, which can be an important tool in Combating social exclusion.\r\n\r\nIt is in this context that our project is assumed to be fundamental for the promotion of education and training for young people, particularly those from disadvantaged sectors, encouraging creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship while promoting equality, social cohesion and active citizenship in our young people, contributing, consequently and simultaneously, to the appreciation of the image of our school.\r\n\r\nThe recognition and validation of learning done in a mobility context are also one of our goals, together with the improvement of communication skills in foreign languages and the chance to make them aware of other cultures.\r\nThese are, generally speaking, the goals we set for our European development plan. To achieve them we intend to give our third year students, as well as to students that have recently finished their courses, a set of 40 mobilities, over the next two years, to perform their internship in a working context in Spain, the UK, Bulgaria, Ireland and Italy.\r\n\r\nThrough the cooperation and the establishment of new partnerships with European organisations, we hope that these mobilities have a consistent outcome in the complete education (on the level of professional, social, linguistic and cultural skills) of our students and that their impact may be meaningful in their future career.\r\n\r\nOther impacts are also expected: in what concerns our school, we expect gains in terms of formative quality, and in what concerns the business community, it will most certainly benefit from better prepared and competent co-workers.\r\n\r\nThe dissemination, a core goal of our project, will contribute also to the wide spreading and growth of its impact. Making the results of these experiences known in the community will make them aware of the opportunities a programme like ERASMUS + can offer, thus encouraging and motivating them to future participation.\r\n\r\nSo, on the short and long term, with the concretization of this project, major gains will be achieved: an innovative education and more ambitious training to our students; the introduction of innovation in the learning process, namely on the technical-pedagogical level; a stronger relationship between local decision-makers, organizations, schools and citizens and fulfilment of a common goal on the level of active citizenship and entrepreneurship, having on its basis Europe 2020 Strategy.", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-PT01-KA102-046903_4"], ["1PJ", "Mais compet\u00eancias, melhores oportunidades!", "Training Vision Ltd", 177215.0, "The project \u201cMore Skills, Best Opportunities\u201d consists of a mobility project for learning purposes that the Agrupamento de Escolas Padre Benjamim Salgado (AEPBS) wishes to implement, so as to enhance the value professional education and, as a whole, the School.\r\nIt is important to increase the attractiveness of professional education, by promoting it as an alternative of quality learning and, simultaneously, fighting one of the biggest problems that AEPBS is facing presently: school absenteeism and dropout of professional education students. \r\nAnother challenge of AEPBS is to provide the students with a diversity of civic, intercultural, social and professional skills which will play as a differentiating factor in an increasingly competitive and changing labor market.\r\nStill, it should be noted that the AEPBS professional education students come from low financial resource families; therefore, it is the school\u2019s job to promote social equity, by creating the necessary conditions to attain equal opportunities for all of them. \r\nThus, the AEPBS needs to update and diversify its practices, in order to respond, properly, to its public and fulfill its mission: Educating for Success!

As for the learners, they are mainly weak individuals risking social marginalisation first, and then professional exclusion: in fact, they are primarily youngsters with few personal, cultural and economic resources - who often lack the tools to reply to the needs of a changing world, of a more and more multi and intercultural society, of an always more selective labour market with a scarce availability of posts \u2013 and thus need to be supported in the development of intercultural awareness, in the reinforcement of their language skills and, more in general of their social abilities which will be integrated to the technical competences. \r\nA first group of 58 learners, who attend initial vocational training courses carried out by EnAIP, in the tourist, leisure, hospitality and catering sector, will take part in mobility flows lasting 14 days in the following training agencies: Training Vision (UK), Malta Vocational Centre (Malta), European Career Evolution (Ireland), Cap Ulysse (France) and AIP Languages (Spain). Thanks to the collaboration that these institutions have with companies of the tourist, hospitality and restauration sectors, learners will be able to be directly in contact with the professional contexts. For this target group, we envisage the participation of a leader. This is required since some of the participants are under-18 youngsters, and this project represents the first significant experience abroad, away from their families, so the presence of an adult contributes to make it more sustainable and substantial for them.   \r\nThe second activity is addressed to a group of 30 learners, who have completed their qualification within 12 months or are attending a professional specialisation, for whom an experience in a European context helps reinforce the knowledge and skills acquired during the training course. These learners will take part in mobility flows lasting 28 days and will be welcome by Training Vision (UK), Malta Vocational Centre (Malta) and AIP Languages (Spain), who will organise and manage their internships in companies of the tourism, leisure, hospitality and catering sectors. They will attend online language preparation before departure.\r\nAs for the staff, EnAIP commitment is aimed at improving, at an internationalisation level, the skills of the human resources involved, at different levels, in the provision of effective training processes which need to reply to the needs of the companies, which are in return also implied in internationalisation processes (decentralisation, systemic or sectorial network, partnerships, merging, etc.). The internationalisation development thus means for EnAIP the achievement of a higher ability to prepare their operators to sustain the motivations, ambitions and personal and professional projects in a European dimension of youngsters and make them able to reply to the needs of the companies and of the labour market, so to improve their employability and to act as active citizens through labour inclusion. \r\n70 resources of EnAIP will be involved in updating training sessions abroad on the following topics:\r\n- UK: Cross cultural management \u2013 for trainers, guidance experts and VET designers \r\n- Malta: English language \u2013 for VET operators\r\n- Malta: Management of VET initiatives with companies - for tutors and career guidance experts \r\n- France: Labour services offer \u2013 for case managers, career guidance experts, project managers and VET designers\r\n- France: Cooperative learning - for trainers, guidance experts and VET designers \r\n- Spain: Diversity management \u2013 for trainers, career guidance experts, VET managers and VET designers.", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA116-006399_3"], ["1PJ", "FORINS 2018", "Training Vision Ltd", 235665.0, "The 95 scholarships for learners will take place in the summer 2019, as described in the project, confirming the same countries of destination as the years before: PL, CZ, EE, SE for technological and industrial  professional profiles; UK, DE, ES, and FR for those connected to services to businesses. \r\nThe learners will have finished their fourth year at high school; some accompanying persons will be required as many participants are under age or non-EU citizens.

Jana Zamoyskiego in Zwierzyniec. The technical school educates in the subjects of environmental protection, wood technology, land surveying and information technology. As for education in the Region of Lublin, there are  some weaknesses in the sphere, such as maladjustment of the offer and the process of education (in vocational sphere) to the challenges and needs of a modern society, low occupational mobility, little involvement of the population in the process of lifelong learning and renewing their qualifications, and finally outdated educational base in vocational education. Young students choosing education in technical schools are interested in undertaking work in modern workplaces in their region, throughout Poland and Europe as well as self-employment and discovering professional development prospects. Thus, the opportunity of gaining knowledge of the European job market is an essential factor to achieve these goals. ZSDiO\u015a in Zwierzyniec educates young students coming from rural areas and mostly poor families. Their background increases the danger of falling out of the education system and social exclusion. Thus, there is a need to strengthen the students\u2019 social and professional position. We also see the necessity to strengthen the position of vocational education teachers, so that their professional development meets the needs of modern school and is convergent with the requirements of the European education of the youth.\r\nThe strategic objectives of the project are the following:\r\n1. Intensification of international cooperation of the school.\r\n2. The school (meaning the staff and students) development in accordance with the objectives of the European education policy.\r\n3. Creation of the school image on both the regional education market and internationally.\r\n4. Drawing on experience from completed work placements and presenting employment prospects and opportunities in Europe.\r\nDue to the key objectives of the Internationalisation Strategy which should be realised, we have initiated some actions. To intensify our international cooperation and develop our participation in mobility programmes we have been extending cooperation with new foreign partners. It is consistent with the outlined goal of three \u2013 stage implementation of mobility. At the first stage our students take part in work placements in Germany, then they have an opportunity to participate in placements in Spain, and finally in England. Such a mobility pattern brings many advantages, e.g. wider knowledge of the European job market, the possibility of a diverse and more complete selection of workplaces for training at different stages, development of learnt at school foreign languages, and gaining the knowledge of cultural and historic diversity of the European countries. The multitude of foreign partners and cooperation with them will allow our students (and future graduates) to possess an objective outlook on the European education and job market. It will influence their future bold approach to mobility and willingness to seek employment anywhere in Europe.\r\nThe vocational training teachers who take part in job shadowing are also involved in the process of the mobility. The advantage for the staff is the necessary complement and development of their knowledge on issues related to organisation, technology and activity of European enterprises. This allows the school to adapt new curricula and modernise those used in our vocational training. The experience gained during the internships is shared by our teachers not only with the students, but also it is used in cooperation with partner companies, institutions and schools.\r\nDuring each mobility the students are accompanied by the school teachers. They provide the students with care and safety, give them support of knowledge and foreign language used during mobility. The teachers\u2019 presence influences also a quality of an implemented project due to its monitoring and assessment; the teachers also develop their professional and linguistic skills.\r\nTo sum up, implementation of mobility projects has helped to strengthen the position of our school on the local education market. Due to the location of our town, we are interested in cooperation with a partner from Ukraine. Our experience, social conditions and geographical location enable us to provide Ukrainian, Moldavian and Belarusian students with a full education offer.
