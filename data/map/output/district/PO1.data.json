Since then, it has been empirically proven that Humans share common cognitive attributes but also exhibit complex cognitive skills not demonstrated by other primates. A crucial question in comparative cognitive research is whether these species differences in cognitive abilities correlate with differences in ecological and social factors. The social intelligence hypothesis suggests that an increase in social complexity drove the evolution of cognitive flexibility in primates. Comparisons using established cognitive tests between species that live in social systems of differing social complexity offer the strongest test of the social intelligence hypothesis but these comparisons are lacking. To fill this gap, \u00b4Macacognitum\u00b4 will challenge the social intelligence hypothesis and will use a unique approach by comparing the cognitive skills of macaque species of different social tolerance grades using a large comprehensive test battery for comparative cognition. According to the theory, we should observe different set of cognitive abilities between the macaques. In particular, given their similar life history and diet, but different social styles, we expect macaques with a greater social tolerance to display greater skills in the social domain. Here, the integration of comparative psychology and evolutionary biology will: 1) help understand the evolutionary history of cognitive traits in a primate monophyletic group and 2) examine the differential influence of social style on cognition of closely related species.

Additional impetus for such research activities is provided by the potential of such carriers to improve the therapeutic profiles of many of the widely used hydrophobic chemotherapeutants. Nowday, carrier vehicles for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs are associated with several disadvantages: conventional emulsions, micelles and liposomes are thermodynamically unstable; lipophilic carriers cluster in blood flow and are rapidly opsonized and massively cleared by liver and spleen; loading capacity of hydrophobic drugs into hydrophilic carriers is limited. Rationalised in the terms of thermodynamic stability, capability to move through blood capillaries, imrpoved drug loading capacity, surface-charged hydrophilicity, and capacity to effect controlled drug release, one of the approaches towards addressing these issues involves the use of superabsorbent polyelectrolytes-based nanogels with affinity for both water and organic liquids.

We also include a comprehensive assessment of the economic ramifications of the proposed optimized rearing. These measures are all aimed at improving productivity of the turbot farms leading to more cost effective production and better use of the resources involved.

This project brings together a balanced and integrated consortium of fish farmers and scientists, with wide project experience, in a number of interrelated disciplines; growth physiology, immunology/health, welfare, slaughter methods, quality aspects and fish economics; all concentrating on improving the culture of turbot.

However, in order to further expand the production beyond this figure, new bio- and technological solutions are required.\n\nThe aim of the MAXIMUS (Innovative rearing and stunning of farmed turbot and sole to meet future challenges regarding quality of production and animal welfare) project was to optimise conditions for farmed turbot. The consortium worked closely with fish farmers to ensure that the entire value chain was improved, from the input resources required to the final product.\n\nResearchers investigated the best lighting and feeding conditions to enhance fish development, yield and shelf life. They also assessed current vaccination strategies and the effect of different diets on fish immune response.\n\nBetter slaughtering procedures such as live chilling or stunning with electricity were also studied. Researchers worked closely with small and medium-sized enterprises to develop an electrical stunner for turbot and sole, which is now commercially available.\n\nAn important aspect of the project was ensuring that the welfare of the fish was properly monitored and controlled during husbandry and slaughter. To this end, the internationally recognised Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points (HACCP) quality assurance system was adapted to control food safety at the industrial and retail levels for selected fish species.\n\nImplementation of the project's results will greatly contribute to the utilisation of turbot and other flatfish species in Europe. This will promote growth in the European aquaculture industry and its related production chain, thereby generating employment opportunities. It will also lead to a more diverse supply of high-quality aquaculture products throughout the year, encouraging more fish consumption among European customers and contributing to increased demand for fish products.\n\nWith such strong focus on fish welfare, reduced production time, and cost and resource efficiency, MAXIMUS will significantly improve the competitiveness of European turbot aquaculture.

A framework was also developed for filling gaps in the current information in order to achieve reliable long-term management requirements. \n\nA number of case studies were chosen to reflect the different types of deepwater fisheries found in the North-East Atlantic. Two additional case studies were also selected to give a wider view on the management and monitoring of deepwater fisheries in other parts of the globe. \n\nFor each case study, DEEPFISHMAN identified management and assessment problems, developed and tested new approaches, and made relevant recommendations. The project also studied the socioeconomic profile of and predicted impact of the different proposed management strategies over the short and long terms for each fishery.\n\nStakeholders' involvement was a key part of the project's success, as they offer a unique perspective and source of information. They were engaged through a series of workshops where they expressed their views on the present and possible future management regimes. \n\nThe website and a http://deepfishman.hafro.is/doku.php (WIKI) were also launched. The WIKI facilitated communication and collaboration, and was used to conduct a survey and questionnaire aimed at external partners.\n\nProject partners also developed a new fish stock assessment model for species that become confined in a smaller area following exploitation.

Dark energy was, therefore, postulated to be responsible for causing the expansion rate to increase during the second half of our Universe's history.\n\nMINE BOSS scientists also used the signature left in quasar spectra by neutral hydrogen to constrain properties of neutrinos. In particular, the analysis of Lyman-alpha lines in quasar spectra allowed them to measure the 1D flux power spectrum that is related to the 3D matter distribution.\n\nThe impact of neutrino masses on the flux power spectrum was computed with high precision by hydrodynamical simulations. A comparison of these numerical predictions with observational data led to several constraints on neutrino masses and other cosmological parameters.\n\nNeutrinos have offered a possible means to resolve discrepancies between the expansion rate of the Universe in the first and second half of its history. Dark energy is thought to be produced as neutrinos are pulled apart; yielding a tension like that fuels the expansion of the Universe.\n\nMINE BOSS project results have paved the way for new measurements of BAOs as part of the extended BOSS set to measure the expansion history of the Universe up to back when it was less than three billion years old.

An attractive antimicrobial approach is to inhibit functions that are essential for bacterial virulence. This disarms the bacteria rather than killing them, reducing the selective pressure that leads to antibiotic resistance in the first place. Four small regulatory RNAs, the quorum regulatory RNAs (Qrrs), lie at the heart of the virulence pathway in V. cholerae. At low bacterial cell density, in the initial phases of infection, the Qrrs are abundant which leads to the expression of virulence genes, infection of the host and cholera. Post infection, when the cells are at high densities, Qrrs are no longer produced, which turns off virulence-gene expression and induces the release of the bacteria back into the environment for reinfection. The Qrrs function by altering the translation and/or stability of specific mRNA targets through base-pairing, which ultimately regulates the expression of the virulence genes.

There are remaining issues in developing theoretical frameworks for probing gravitational physics on cosmological scales. We construct modified gravity theories as an alternative to dark energy and analyse \u201cscreening mechanisms\u201d to restore GR on scales where it is well tested. We then develop better theoretical frameworks to perform cosmological tests of gravity that include non-linear scales by exploiting our theoretical knowledge of the models and our state-of-the-art simulations.\n\nThis grant will exploit and develop the world-leading position of the group initiated by Kazuya Koyama at the University of Portsmouth funded by the ERC starting grant (2008-2013).", 1446539.0, 1446539.0, "CosTesGrav", null, null, null, null, "http://www.port.ac.uk", null, "h2020_194467_999847871"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1PJ", "Confidence through Competence", "Training Vision Ltd", 77061.0, "The project \"Confidence through Competence\", lasting 12 months, has the ambition to make the High School of Human Sciences \"E. Gianturco \" a 'European' Institute, with a high international standard, although it is located in a Region, Basilicata, disadvantaged economically and with significant delays due to the atavistic isolation. In order to achieve that, the school is going to start from the teaching and administrative staff training, because an exponential increase in student performance can be achieved only by improving the professional skills of school staff. On the other hand, the professional profile of teachers will be increased and aligned more closely to the challenges of tomorrow's school: this will lead to improve both motivation and satisfaction in their work. \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives that the high school \"E. Gianturco \" intends to get with this project are: \r\n\r\n- to strengthen linguistic skills of participants in mobility, with the result of a consolidation and/or development of their communication skills in a foreign language even profitably used in practical activities and a greater openness and willingness to the European mobility and lifelong learning. That will have an undeniable positive impact on teaching processes and, therefore, on learning by students; \r\n- to improve and update teaching methods to be able to design qualified learning paths, along with the use of advanced ICTs, according to the deep renovations introduced by the implementation of the Reform Law of Secondary School in 2010; \r\n- to boost soft skills such as leadership, capacity for teamwork, problem solving; \r\n- to promote more and more the awareness of European citizenship and identity, by offering participants the opportunity to create international networks; \r\n- to broaden the internationalization of the school, by offering students activities and programs that better match the needs of our modern society; \r\n- to foster the synergies and shift from formal to non-formal education; \r\n-to ensure a better recognition of the skills gained during the stay abroad. \r\n\r\nIn order to get these objectives, 25 school staff members (23 teachers, the headteacher and an administrative clerk) will attend for 20 days (excluding travel days) structured courses, guided visits and cultural activities, organized in cooperation with both our English partner Training Vision Ltd. and the Irish one ETN Training Vision Ireland Ltd. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo as to facilitate the achievement of our goals and the overall enhancement of the benefits and advantages of the initiative, school participants are expected to attend, before leaving, an orientation session, an intercultural training course and also some language classes (just for participants who don't have at least an A2 CEF English level). \r\n\r\nEffective communication and clear division of tasks between partners, sharing of tools and working methods, continuous and multidimensional monitoring and assessment, widespread dissemination strategy and exploitation of results are the elements that will distinguish the project implementation methodology. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the mobility experience participants will be able to:  \r\n                                                                    \r\n- improve their proficiency in English language, by using with relevance and appropriateness specific morphosyntactic structures and vocabulary, in order to plan Curricular tracks according to high quality standards;\r\n- choose the syllabus topics so that there is a consistent relationship between CLIL and native language teaching modules;\r\n- foster the updating of syllabuses; \r\n- acquire tools and teaching strategies that develop key competences of students, such as learning how to learn and sense of initiative;\r\n- enhance the ability to design learning environments, clearly aimed at carrying out dynamic learning paths in which aware students may be oriented, but not driven;\r\n- encourage the introduction of appropriate methodologies for new learning challenges, increasingly geared toward multimedia;\r\n- strengthen the support and promotion of international mobility initiatives and improve their management procedures.\r\n\r\nThe whole school will become an up-to-date educational environment, dynamic and professional, able to strategically plan the professional development of its staff according to the individual needs and the Institution goals.

For a few years many initiatives in our school have been addressed to such an aim: our school is the seat of the Delegation of \"Centrum Latinitatis Europae\" in the Eastern Sicily, every year we organise  a national Certamen of Scientific and Technical Literature and conferences /workshops about the Classic tradition considered as a unifying element of Scientific knowledge and Humanity knowledge in the European culture, and we  carry on school projects which follow the steps  in the history of Physics with a particular attention on its classic origin. The training of the teachers and, in general, of the school staff, is a central point for the achievement of this goal because, if the teachers are broad minded, they will be able to convey to their students , through the specificity of their subjects, the unity of Knowledges which is the core of the European culture and they will throw students into an intercultural dimension. So, with this project , not only are we aiming at the improvement of  competences and methodologies, but we are also creating a modern environment to make  the school look at an intercultural setting through a collation among teachers and students from different countries. There will be 17 teachers involved in the mobility, from different teaching areas, from Greek and Latin to Hystory and Philosophy, from Maths and Phisycs to English. In our school there are some students with special needs, so a project which considers students as the main target group of the teacher training, cannot but consider, among the participants, two teachers for inclusion from Humanities and Science.  The project activities will be concerned to three development areas: 1) the use of ICT in Classics teaching and the comparison between the Italian curricula and the European ones in the field of Classics; 2) The use of CLIL methodologies for the teaching of Maths, Phisycs, History and Philosophy; 3) The use of ICT and e-Learning and e-Twinning platforms in the teaching of English. During all phases of the project, which will last 13 months, we will choose methdologies in which the mental procedures typical of the Scientific thought are applied in interdisciplinary routes. After the first  step of mobility and an important work of dissemination of the materials and the methods among their collegues,  teachers of Latin and Greek will help the third and fourth  year students to search and analyse the ancient tests from Latin and Greek Literature. These tests will be later considered in their Historic/Philosophical context and  their scientific  content will be studied by Maths/Physics teachers by using a CLIL methodology which will use English as a vehicular language. Finally the English teachers, through e-Learning and e-Twinning platforms, will give an intercultural dimension to what the students have learnt, helping them to share their experiences and experiments with other European students who study Classics. l progetto sar\u00e0 monitorato e valutato fase per fase e alla sua conclusione attraverso questionari, sondaggi, diari di bordo, ricadute sulla didattica e risultati conseguiti dagli studenti nelle attivit\u00e0 proposte anche in termini di interesse, entusiasmo e partecipazione.  A multimedia product will be also made by the students with the help of their teachers, linked on our website and shared with other students and teachers from other Italian and European countries by e-twinning and e-learning platforms.

The deadlines of the events are supposed not to disturb the school work. The choice of the countries is obvious since their teachers have already had some experience in the field of migration and working with students of another nationality and culture.\r\nThe phenomenon of migration is getting more and more noticeable in Poland. For the system of education it is a challenge to organise the teaching process for students of various backgrounds and cultures. Schools play an important role in culture integration and supporting alien children. Through realising the project we would like to get the answer for the question what difficulties can appear at school attended by children with migration experience, and we hope to learn how to deal with this problem.\r\nThe detailed aims include familiarising with the culture adaptation process, creating an image of school as a place of a foreign student adaptation, shaping the teachers\u2019 attitude toward cultural variety, learning the legislations regulating migration issues and learning the rules and regulations being followed in European institutions related to working with students of a different nationality and culture. The aims refer to finding the ways how to cope with multiculturalism in Italian and English schools. We are willing to learn how to act with an alien child, how to prepare a class and take care of a foreign student so that he/she could adapt properly in a Polish school. The goal of the training course will be also to develop the competences enabling our employees to work effectively with the mentioned type of students, supporting the integration among school society and improving intergroup bonds. Observing such activities in Italian and English schools will help us to plant them in our place. Since working with the children\u2019s parents seems to be a vital factor, we would like to get to know the benefits which can be gained by the child through learning in a multicultural class, next we want to make Polish parents aware of these benefits\r\nSoft skills of the programme which we expect, are: rising knowledge and professional skills in the field of aspects discussed during the training course, widening the motivation to learn foreign languages, professional self development, improving professional and personal competences of the participants, forming such qualities like tolerance and acceptance for another habits, behavior and religions, learning history, culture and customs of the associate countries.\r\nHard results contain: language and culture preparations in a certain number of hours, receiving the document called Euro pass Mobility by the partakers of the programme. There are also language certificates as well as the certificates given by the foreign partners.

Six teachers of vocational studies or other subjects who are involved in implementing European Union projects, will take part in training on using CLIL methodology at lessons.

These institutes, in fact, have in common the intent to engage students in a transnational mobility project, also recognized for purposes of work-related learning which will help to acquire and consolidate specific skills in the field of educational childcare services and promote their employability by providing an effective response to the demand that, in recent years, has shown a trend of gradual growth and whose supply is inadequate throughout the Country.\r\nEurope, in fact, indicates to the member countries two significant goals to be pursued: the growth of our economic system through the enhancement of women workers and the services for early childhood, accessible to 33% of children from 0 to 3 years old.\r\nItaly is far away from reaching both these goals. In the EU as mentioned in Bulletin 2015 by Eurydice - \"Early Childhood Education and Care\", only 30% of children under 3 years old, is attending a ECEC structure (Early Childhood Education and Care). The demand is conditioned not only by the quality and cost of the service, but also by social and labor policies. Only in a few European countries every child are entitled to attend ECEC and the demand and supply of the service is balanced. In Italy, not only there is no right to ECEC, but the demand is much greater than supply. In recent years, however, policies to support the family have been implemented, firstly with the babysitter and kindergarten bonuses and lately with the kindergarten bonus in 2017, entered in the Budget Law as an economic contribution to families who enroll their children in kindergarten.\r\nIn this context was born this project that covers the territory of Puglia and Basilicata regions, as both have significant experience in services for young children and intend to continue in this direction, encouraging the exchange of experiences, good practices and raising the quality level of experience in mobility.\r\nPuglia Region in recent years stood out for its remarkable commitment to policies aimed at early childhood, setting a very ambitious goal, \"to increase the personal care services, easing the family responsibilities to raise the participation of women in the labor market\", with a systematic intervention aimed, on the one hand to strengthen the socio-educational infrastructure (80 kindergartens and 2,480 available jobs in 2005 - 497 structures and 11,586 existing jobs) and on the other to support the offer for families, through the issuance of a notice in order to benefit of Service vouchers for work-family conciliation, to be spent in childcare services, implemented with additional funds for 2016-2017.\r\nIn Basilicata, the percentage of municipalities that have activated services for children, stood at 32.1%, in line with the average of the South (32.8%), but significantly less than that of Italy (55, 1%). The region registered a strong growth of female unemployment rate, due also in part to the lack of educational services for early childhood. Therefore, it\u2019s important to invest in innovative and flexible services (eg. Tagesmutter), appropriate solutions for the small municipalities of the Region and an alternative for the bigger Puglia cities which often have unanswered demands. Last year, the Regional Council of Basilicata set up the \"Tagesmutter\" service and the Board approved the professional profile, inserting it in the regulated qualifications framework.\r\nThe project aims at the consolidation and the acquisition of skills related to the professional profile of Educators for early childhood, which carries out educational programs and care of children in the 0-3 years. Employment opportunities, which are enhanced by the implementation of this project, are represented by the inclusion in different types of public or private institutions aimed at early childhood.

We would like to stress that we offer this opportunity to all of our participants; students with learning, mental or physical difficulties, students from  disadvantaged backgrounds or descending from immigrant families, students with a low living standard and students belonging to an ethnic minority.  This matches with the ROC A12 Watermark: enabling all our students to develop themselves in the best possible way. We strive for an equal division of internships for both students and teachers across all training courses we offer. Students and teachers do their internships abroad at a company or organisation related to their line of business or professional field. They develop new professional competences, gain intercultural knowledge and improve their language skills. Students carry out tasks and activities matching their status as starting professional practitioners. Teachers acquire new competences and (innovative) knowledge and also improve their language skills. This helps in their professional and personal development and raises the quality of vocational education in our region. ROC A12 teachers attend lessons of their foreign colleagues, teach classes themselves, do presentations, take part in work meetings and team meetings and make arrangements for further cooperation.  \r\n\r\nThe impact aimed at in this international mobility project boils down to creating flexible, multi-skilled and interculturally competent employees who are able to comunicate in foreign languages; well equipped to operate successfully in a globalising labour market and society. ROC A12 intends to contribute to a quality foundation of skilful employees in the (Eu)region now and in the future.  We also aim at making internationalisation easily accessible to all of our students and teachers and we strive towards a high level of internationalisation at our school. \r\n\r\nDissemination of results takes place internally for all students and co-workers of ROC A12, externally for the international partners, by means of local and regional press and TV, for regional and national schools we work with, at national professional meetings and networking events.", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA102-035149_1"], ["1PJ", "O\u0161etrovate\u013esk\u00e1 starostlivos\u0165 v krajin\u00e1ch E\u00da", "Training Vision Ltd", 30298.0, "The main targets of the project are:\r\n1.

Its  nature is closely linked to the fact that sport is a specific activity which regulates social relations and the reason for doing sport is the interests and the needs of every separate individual. The significance and the diversity in respect to sport were pointed out by the European Commission a long time ago. This is one of the main reasons to recognise in this connection the increasing importance of learning and the strive for better education and skills.\r\nYoung people cannot expect anymore to spend their whole life in one and the same sphere of activity or even in one and the same place. Their career path can change, so, they need a wider range of skills which could enable them to get adapted,  to be more flexible. The profession of the sports manager is attractive with excellent work and development prospects both in Bulgaria and abroad. The interrelation between sport and economy led over the last years to intensive development of the sports industry and has turned sport into an economic sphere. This, alongside with other prerequisites (economic, social, educational, cultural) has laid the foundations for the development of sports pedagogics, sports management and sports marketing. With the project \u201cInnovations and Sports Management\u201d  initiated by  \u201dInter Sport Group\u201d - Haskovo and consortium, we will enable 36 students from 3 sports schools, students who are being trained in the profession \u201cCoach Asssistant in a sport type\u201d and 4 volunteers form ISG to acquire specialised sports management knowledge, practical skills for practising the profession of the sports manager, the necessary professional terminology, language and cultural preparation. The participants will be chosen subject to preliminary set selection criteria. They will have practice in three countries  \u2013 Italy and England. Our project partners are educational organizations in the sphere of sports, with excellent sports specilaists and sports facilities. \u201cInter Sport Group\u201d as a sports organisation with international character works with students from different sports schools by assisting their professional realisation out of school, predominantly in the sphere of informal education. The objective of the project  is to encourage initiativeness, entrepreneurship and the future adaptability for employment. By providing additional opportunities for them, the project will enable the students to find realisation on the labour market after finishing their education and after finalising active sports career with most of them. During their training period, innovative methods will be applied of theoretically innovative practices and their application in a real environment. The project will provide equal chances to every beneficiary with no prejudice in respect to sex and ethnicity for mobility participation with the necessary motivation to further develop their knowledge or acquire new knowledge. Practice will help the further development of theoretical knowledge and the obtaining of practical experience. The mobililty practice will introduce beneficiaries to innovations in the marketing and management of sports, to  innovative sports activities programs, to the methodology and the systems for work with different ages and people with different interests. As a result of and due to the impact of the project, skills will be acquired for developing business plans for starting own business, training programs, marketing surveys for different sports activities, innovative European methods and practice for getting to know the relation between the production structures in sport, the company entities, functioning on the sports market and the consumers of sports production. Out of their project participation, students will gain extra linguistic and cultural competences.The relation sport-business makes us consider that for the application of management as a profession in sport, it is necessary to get to know the specifics and good practices. The long-term prospects for the practice beneficiaries will lead to efficient application of this interesting profession in a professional aspect and this will enhance the socio-economic significance of sport in society. For all project partners, benefits will be future-oriented and for that purpose, a common international platform will be designed for exchange of good practices, new European sports initiatives and projects.

The project participants will also hold demonstration classes addressed to all teachers interested in their vocational development. The school staff will also take part in chosen one- week eTwinning training.   The trained teachers, open to new methods and ways of working with students, will enhance their educational effectiveness and will create more modern, engaged and professional environment in the school. They will also get certificates Europass Mobility.\r\nStudents will leave for a three-week training period to the UK and Italy.\r\nAmong the current second grade students learning to become advertisement organization technicians and tourist service technicians 20 students will be selected who will participate in a training in Italy. Among the current second grade students learning to become information technology technicians and economic technicians 40 students will be selected who will participate in a the UK.\r\nThe applicant, through proposed linguistic, cultural and educational support before the trip, will provide comprehensive preparation of the participants before international internships. Trainees will also take part in on-line language course.\r\nDuring internships, the students will keep on co-creating a blog and post pictures on Instagram. The photos will present not only the participants but also the mascots which have been created during the previous editions \u2013 Stashek, Azzura and Charlie. Thanks to these modern and youth-familiar mass media, the idea of European internships within the Erasmus+ program will reach a large number of young people.\r\nThe methodology used for the implementation of the project is a combination of theory, practical exercises and tasks previously prepared to be performed. These activities will be supported by a mentor acting on behalf of receiving and sending organization, and include: discussions, games, consultations, creative tasks, tests, teamwork, role play and video projections. Independent work on own portfolio and individual presentation will improve self-esteem of the participants.  In the project gamification will be applied in which motivation plays crucial role. Coordinators supported by Partners in Italy and the UK are supposed to motivate students to work through adequately prepared educational tasks that could be performed both individually and in groups and will present a challenge and include elements of competition.\r\nThe elements of gamification incorporated in the project will include quizzes, games and interactive exercises prepared by the students.\r\nExperience gained in Italy and the UK will make the participants aware of the fact that mobility, initiative, entrepreneurship and innovation is the key to professional success. Creativity understood in this way will give the students better chances to successfully enter the European labor market, as well as meet the requirements of a Polish employer expecting a young employee to have experience in the intercultural work environment abroad. Due to the increasing globalization and the situation in the world not only good command of English language is important but also familiarity with other, not just European, cultures.

The final group consisting of 20 students (10 electricians, 10 electronic engineers) will go to Portsmouth, the UK, and receive their vocational training 15th\u00f730th May 2018 at Oden Services Ltd and Elmdene International Ltd. Working 8 hours a day students will broaden their vocational knowledge, gain practical vocational experience while performing real work tasks. Students will learn how to install and maintain electronics devices of the access control and security systems, diagnose and troubleshoot electrical wiring in buildings under construction, assemble and check electric shock protection measures, use electrical installation meters, diagnose a computer and its operating system,  secure the user\u2019s stored data and recover data if necessary, repair peripherals, decide how much to charge for computer repair, operate numerical control machines, write programmes for the CNC machine tool and CNC milling machine, create objects according to the programmes. Students\u2019 work and progress will be monitored constantly and graded to give them feedback what they do well and where they need to improve.  Moreover, the mentors and supervisors from the host companies will test students\u2019 skills and  fill in a trainee\u2019s mid-point and end-point evaluation form.  In this way students, their mentors and the representatives of the partner institutions will learn if work placement has been an effective work experience for students. Back at school students will be obliged to demonstrate their skills. Speaking English or German they will perform certain work tasks step by step to present newly acquired skills which are defined in the Internship Programme. These presentations will verify the benefits of international internships and allow to prepare Europass Certificates for every student. To promote project results students will prepare video guides, brochures, English and German dictionaries for specific uses in different fields, which will be posted on online learning platforms, in online social media and official school website to reach a wide audience.\r\nThe project is expected to have an enormous and long-term influence on every student,  the sending organization as well as all partner institutions. Students will learn new things, especially how to perform certain vocational tasks and work effectively within the workplace, they will broaden their occupational knowledge,  discover new opportunities. They will improve their language skills, learn how to be independent, resourceful, increase multicultural awareness. Due to the knowledge and acquired vocational skills, students will get better results during vocational qualifying exams and in the whole process of learning in general. Their job mobility will increase and they\u2019ll become very attractive, skilled workers for potential employees. The sending organization\u2019s prestige will be raised by giving its students an opportunity to do a work placement abroad. The project team\u2019s professional qualifications will be raised, they\u2019ll enrich their experience and extend their horizons which by all means will help them write even better projects.

The hosting institution is situated in Rimini in Italy and Portsmouth in the United Kindom. The project will last from 02.11.2017 to 01.10.2019. The beneficiaries of this project are the 80 students of ZSP No 3 ( third grade  of high school students) who have been educated in various areas such as economics, trade, hotel industry, tourism, gastronomy&catering&waiting staff members, photography and architecture of ladscape.\r\n The  internships include four  departures of twenty students each : from 10.09.2018 to 28.09.2018r and from  6.05.2019 to 24.05.2019r.\r\nEach group of students will be accompanied by two teachers from ZSP No 3 during internships.\r\nEach participant of the project will complete a language course in a foreign language and will take part in pedagogical and culural workshops. The students who will do an internship in the UK, will take part in a 40-hour training course in professional English, whereas the students who head for Italy, will participate in two courses: a 20-hour English language course and a 30-hour Italian language course.\r\nThere are several reasons why ZSP No 3 decided to prepare that project.\r\nStalowa Wola is located in the south-east  of Poland, the region with high unemployment rate which results in low standards of living of most of our students and their families. Therefore , rarely do our students have a chance to leave our region for recreational purposes and it seems it could be difficult for them to adjust to a new lifestyle. Students complete internships in workplaces where due to gradual process of impovershiment , there are few customers. Accordingly, our students have little contact with real working conditions. Lack of suitable vocational training, intercultural competence and worldwide experience as well as the language barrier very often generate social and occupational disqualification not only in our region but also in the country. Our school has been cooperating with numerous employers both in our region and larger Polish cities. Unfortunately, due to bad financial conditions only few students have an opportunity to complete the internships in reputable establishments out of their hometowns.\r\n Taking into consideration the needs and expectations of not only our students but also Polish and European job market we prepared the project, whose main aim is to support its participants in  improving their professional and linguistic competence, personal development and increasing chances for being employed.\r\n The main aim of the project is to improve practical skills as well as professional and linguistic competence of 80 students \r\nof ZSP No 3.\r\nDetailed targets :\r\n\u2022 the completion of a three-week international internship by 80 students\r\n\u2022 improving the professional English  language by 80 students\r\n\u2022 familiarising students with the culture and customs of the Italy and English society\r\n\u2022 learning about the European job market and its structure\r\n\u2022 promoting the mobility of workers on the European job market\r\n\u2022 gaining experience, professional competence and developing social competence by the beneficieries\r\n\r\n Thanks to the internships the students will highten their vocational skills, strenghten their language skills and they will be more motivated to master their vocational training. The internship will enable students to improve their self- assessment, gain valuable experience along with social competence.\r\n Taking part in that kind of internship is favourable for finding a job not only locally or in Poland but also in other European countries including Italy and the United Kindom. The completion of the project is significant due to the high unemployment rate in the area where the beneficieries live. The skills that students obtain during the education process, characteristic for different professions, are still very attractive and required on the European labour market.\r\n The fulfillment of the internships will furnish ZSP No3 with information whether students have been educated not only in a modern way but also in accordance with the requirements of contemporary European job market.", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PL01-KA102-038015_2"], ["1PJ", "\u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c1\u03c6\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b5\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd  \u03b5\u03bd\u03b7\u03bb\u03af\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd \u03c3\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1: \u03a4\u03bf \u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u0394\u03b5\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u03c5\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u039c\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2.", "Training Vision Ltd", 16570.0, "The School of Second Chance of Mitilini has decided to form this proposal to reform and upgrade  the kind of studies it offers to its adult students, especially the immigrants and refugees who have gradually started to enroll in it.

As for the learners, they are mainly weak individuals risking social marginalisation first, and then professional exclusion: in fact, they are primarily youngsters with few personal, cultural and economic resources - who often lack the tools to reply to the needs of a changing world, of a more and more multi and intercultural society, of an always more selective labour market with a scarce availability of posts \u2013 and thus need to be supported in the development of intercultural awareness, in the reinforcement of their language skills and, more in general of their social abilities which will be integrated to the technical competences. \r\nA first group of 70 under-18 learners, who attend initial vocational training courses carried out by EnAIP, in the tourist, hospitality and restauration sector will take part in mobility flows lasting 14 days in the following training agencies: Training Vision (UK), Malta Vocational Centre (Malta), European Career Evolution (Ireland), Cap Ulysse (France) and AIP Languages (Spain). Thanks to the collaboration that these institutions have with companies of the tourist, hospitality and restauration sectors, learners will be able to be directly in contact with the professional contexts. For this target group, we envisage the participation of a leader. This is required as for under-18 youngsters, this project often represents the first significant experience abroad, away from their families, so the presence of an adult contributes to make it more sustainable and substantial for participants.   \r\nThe second activity is addressed to a group of 30 learners, who have completed their qualification or professional specialisation within 12 months, for whom an intervention in a European dimension to reinforce the knowledge and skills acquired during the training course becomes very important. These learners will take part in mobility flows lasting 28 days and will be welcome by Training Vision (UK), Malta Vocational Centre (Malta) and AIP Languages (Spain), who will organise and manage their internships in companies of the tourist, hospitality and restauration sectors. They will attend online language preparation before departure.\r\nAs for the staff, EnAIP commitment is aimed at improving, at an internationalisation level, the skills of the human resources involved, at different levels, in the provision of effective training processes which need to reply to the needs of the companies, which are in return also implied in internationalisation processes (decentralisation, systemic or sectorial network, partnerships, merging, etc.). The internationalisation development thus means for EnAIP the achievement of a higher ability to prepare their operators to sustain the motivations, ambitions and personal and professional projects in a European dimension of youngsters and make them able to reply to the needs of the companies and of the labour market, so to improve their employability and to act as active citizens through labour inclusion. \r\nEnAIP staff will be involved in updating training sessions abroad on the following topics:\r\n- UK, cross cultural management \u2013 for trainers, front- and back-office operators\r\n- UK, didactic methodologies for foreign languages \u2013 for trainers\r\n- Malta, English language \u2013 for front- and back-office operators\r\n- France, Labour services offer \u2013 for case managers, guidance experts, project managers and designers\r\n- Spain, social and cultural integration of foreign citizens \u2013 for trainers, guidance experts, managers and designers of projects addressed to migrants\r\n- Denmark, Didactic 2.0 \u2013 for project designers and trainers", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005745_20"], ["1PJ", "PLUS - Mechatronics Ultimate Skills in Europe", "Training Vision Ltd", 240927.0, "The project proposal PLUS-MUSE (PLUS -Mechatronics Ultimate Skills in Europe) falls within the programming framework outlined in the Erasmus+ VET Mobility Charter obtained in 2016.

The programme will be aimed at improving the competencies of the staff in managing and coordinating VET mobilities, and in enhancing the value of transnational mobility as a training tool.  \r\nThe whole PLUS-MUSE project will be accompanied by promotion, monitoring, evaluation and dissemination actions, to take place at the start, during and at the end of the project.", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005770_7"], ["1PJ", "THREE 2017", "Training Vision Ltd", 222499.0, "The consortium will carry out 100 learner mobilities during the summer 2018, as the project 2016-1-IT01-KA102-005228 is being done.\r\nThey will be students who completed the fourth year of the Technical and \u201cLiceo\u201d High school according to the foreseen courses of studies for 5 weeks\u2019 mobility as stated on the original project. \r\nAs part of the participants will still be under age, the presence of tutors is foreseen. \r\nThe Staff mobility (4 teachers) will be already carried out in September 2017, to meet the interest of the consortium in participating in this experience. There will be teachers of languages and professional subjects who will follow a program of professional and linguistic formation and job shadowing in the UK to enhance their competences in the CLIL teaching. The beginning of the VET mobility for CLIL teachers represents a real opening towards the internationalization in the field of the professional formation of the teachers.\r\nTherefore, following this experience, it is foreseen that the participants will start up a network working CLIL group that will be increased with future mobilities to capitalize the results of the project.\r\nThe countries of destination for the students are Germany, France, Spain, United kingdom and Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe receiving partners confirm the network built in the past and which is operating in the on-going project. They are formative institutions with whom good practices have been carried out, ECVET procedures have been experimented, and recent projects have been completed successfully.\r\nTwo of the English partners are able to offer a developmental program for the Staff which is respondent to what was outlined in the project.\r\nSome other forms of mobility, which are part of the international opening strategy of the consortium, are the work experiences in companies abroad with the aim of acquiring professional competences that can be valid for Alternating training and bilateral exchanges.\r\n To increase the vocational mobility, in addition to Erasmus+ VET, the IIS Kennedy Institute will participate in a network to the regional call MOVE for Alternance School-work abroad  \u201cDGR 1914 del 29/11/16\u201d for 12 students, and to Padova Chamber of Commerce Call that is going to co-finance 10 mobilities of high school graduates, moreover the Institute is going to carry out self-funded staying with internship in companies in France and Austria or Germany, for 20 students. These mobilities will be achieved in the 2017 summer; Europass mobility will be issued for these activities as well as for the  Erasmus+ ones.\r\nOne week reciprocal exchanges between schools will be kept on with France and Germany.\r\nA new partnership with Hungary will start next year, and it will move 30 students of Ferrari partner Institute. Exchanges and individual longer mobilities will be improved (22 students for a bilateral stay of one month at the Ferrari Institute, some units inbound and outbound from 6 months to one year with Intercultura at Kennedy and Alberti.\r\nI IS Ferrari will host a teacher of a French Lyc\u00e9e with ESABAC high school diploma as invited teacher for a set of lectures in French.\r\nIIs Kennedy, taking advantage of its 8 partners of the project K2 I.M.A.G.I.N.E-2014-1-FR1-KA201\u2013002327, will go on with the inbound and outbound students and teachers exchange, with the possibility of job shadowing as well as tutoring for the teachers. \r\nIn the international development plan of the institutes, the strengthening of foreign languages competencies is expected. The schools intend to enhance the certification examinations B1 and B2 levels for the different languages.\r\nIn 2017 the self-funded certifications will be a hundred (+10% comparing to the previous year). The schools are participating to the Regional Call Move for the future 4.0 (POR-FSE) for linguistic stays followed by certification.

All these actions are based on the awareness of the importance of pursuing the value of multiculturalism, of belonging to Europe, of responsible participation. The five-week 95 mobility projects for learners will take place in summer 2018, as scheduled in the project,  Poland, the Check Republic, Estonia will be confirmed as destination countries as the job internships offered have a great high- tech value. The UK, Germany, Spain and France will also be confirmed, as they offer  some excellent job internships in companies providing  indirect services to businesses. \r\nAlthough the students who study French are not so many, France will be confirmed as a destination  country in order to cherish the interest in the country shown by the students in  the last two years. \r\nSome of  the 6 two-week scholarships for the staff will be done in 2017, to continue the positive experience of  the first year. Thanks to the experience done by the staff in September 2016, an interschool  CLIL Team has been created at ITCG Pasini. \r\nThe leading school, Pasini, has created a CLIL project that includes the other schools of the consortium and a local Liceo Scientifico (a High School for Science and Maths). The project was one of the two winners (D.D. Miur 1433-22/12/16-Azione A2) in a competition promoted by the Italian Ministry for Education and Research (MIUR d.m.663/2016-art.29). It aims at creating innovative E-CLIL learning laboratories with the use of ICT. \r\nThis very important result has a great impact on the whole mobility project and it encourages the schools to promote the mobility of the staff and to foster the activities of language training for teachers (with an increase of + 20% of language certifications next year). \r\nThe language certifications (B1-B2-C1) of the students will increase too (+ 13%), this result will be reached thanks to promotion inside the schools, an increase of the number of language courses, school grants  for the certification exams (whose total amount has been so far  paid for by the students\u2019 families), the participation to the call of the Regione Veneto MOVE 4.0 POR-FSE for language studies abroad which  aims at making the students get the language certification. \r\nIn order to reinforce and improve language skills, the schools will promote activities with mother tongue teachers (115 hours), one language assistant of the project EduChange will be involved, language study holidays during the summer and school trips abroad will be organized, the project Smarter English will be implemented (a week of full immersion in the English language with activities held by mother tongue teachers for about 150 students). \r\nThe internationalization strategy  will be pursued with activities organized with local and foreign partners, through actions taken by each school:  Exchange Program with two German VET Schools (Marzotto e De Pretto with about 25 incoming students and 25 outcoming students); short training periods for 10 Polish students (at Marzotto and Chilesotti)  Erasmus+ VET coming from the foreign partner who is a host partner in this project too; in case the projects, submitted in the different countries, will be approved some mechatronics students coming from (BG and CZ ) will do a short period of training at De Pretto, and others  of  a textile course from Brno-CZ will do the same at Marzotto. The activities to promote Intercultura will continue; three students have already left for the USA where they will be staying for a year, however no prevision of this type of mobility is possible. The schools in Schio will continue to take part in the activities for the Exchange Program promoted by the Municipality of Schio with Landshut, German partner of the consortium. Other activities in English will be organized with local partners: conferences on international topics (\u201cIndustry 4.0\u201d and \u201cSharing Economy\u201d) held in English by Federmanager,   addressed to students of the fourth and fifth year, a whole day to promote work-training during the school period (ASL)  will be addressed to students of the third year, during this day all the activities will be in English. The event to promote European projects and let people know about them and the results  achieved, is being organized on the Europe Day 2018.

Those are:  high presence, being responsible for yourself, your school work and your school. Doing International Work-Based Learning (IWBL) is very popular among our students and by stressing the importance of these criteria, we believe we help many students through school and drop-out rates are reduced.  \r\nIt is great to see the fantastic growth in the students who go abroad, doing their IWBL. They do not only improve their language skills, their cultural understanding, their service and communication skills, but also develop and mature greatly as persons and become more and more independent. Many are ready for new challenges as they come back home and we have multiple stories of students who tell one or two years later that without those seven weeks abroad, they would not have dared to apply to schools abroad or dared to take on some other challenges. It definitely opens up new doors for the students. An important part is about enhanced self-confidence, another one is heightened tolerance and understanding of others. In the times we live in today, where many people are forced to leave their home countries and cultures are mixed, we believe these aspects are even more important than before. \r\nBy participating in our project, the students are prepared for three major aspects in life. They are prepared for work life, by doing IWBL in businesses where they can find employment. The result is increased employability both on the Swedish and the European market. They are prepared for further studies, either on an academic level or in vocational colleges. They will be prepared for adult life by being forced to take care of themselves.\r\nBoth at the Board of Education, in the city of G\u00f6teborg and in the school itself, there is a strong focus on and will for increased internationalization. At Hvitfeldtska there is a long tradition of international focus. Both the Head of School, the principals and staff  are very positive to our project and support us in all possible ways.\r\nWe have close connections with two organizations within Service and Trade in Sweden, called Svensk Handel and K\u00f6pmannaf\u00f6rbundet. They support our project by offering networking, training, lectures, invitations to various events and venues.\r\nThe various tasks of the project are clearly defined. The coordinators run the project, do all administrative work and have the major responsibility, but all the members in the team are involved. A total of ten teachers are so called destination teachers, responsible for one or two cities each. They work closely with the coordinators, they have the day-to-day contact with the students abroad, they visit the students after about half the time and therefore play a crucial role in the validation process. The coordinators work in close cooperation with the economists at the Board of Education, so all financial issues are well taken care of. The project has expanded since last year, thanks to more staff involved and a stronger, more solid student body. From about a year ago, there are now two coordinators instead of one. The work-load can greatly be shared which makes the project less vulnerable. Also, year by year, we receive more and more students who meet the criteria for IWBL. Since there are more staff involved in total, we can also meet the demands of students with weak backgrounds, fewer oppurtunities or special needs and give support on a more individual basis.\r\nAn important part in our development plan has been to include more and more students from the Business and Administration Program and since December 2015, there is close cooperation between these two programs, something the whole school benefits from.  \r\nAnother important way to increase the quality of our project is to include staff training. Since the well-coordinated staff training in September 2016 was a great success, our plan is to every year send two-three teachers from each of the two programs for training abroad the first week of the fall semester so the new skills and experiences can be integrated in a natural way in the planning of the courses. By spending time at the same companies in the same cities as the students, the teachers will know exactly which skills are needed and can adapt his/her teaching accordingly. \r\nA third area of improvement is getting more comfortable using ECVET. We have reinforced our knowledge when it comes to the use of Europass CVs,  Cover Letters and Learning Agreements, but would like to integrate Memorandum of Understanding more in order to reach higher quality in our project.", "http://www.trainingvision.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA116-034265_5"], ["1PJ", "TSJOCH!

The objective is to create more awareness of the growing globalisation and the  impact it has on our lifestyle and the economic development in Europe and beyond. We want to make them realize that a united Europe and a good cooperation between the member states are crucial for a stable economic Europe.  Especially in view of countries leaving the European union and the rise of the populist parties.\r\nWe aim at offering challenging education in general, not only by creating an international programme of Excellence for our VET+ students of level 4EQF but also for developing the talents of our students of level 2 EQF, with a socially challenged background by offering them a placement abroad. \r\n\r\nOur continuous goal is to maintain the high standard of QUALITY OF PLACEMENTS abroad by using solid and renomated training companies,  by consulting the Dutch recognition organisation SBB, the intermediate organisations in the host country and by using the network of our educational partners abroad .
