Get high take-up by early adopters (e.g., in manufacturing). Augment training in situ with live expert guidance, a tacit learning experience and a re-enactment of the expert, in knowledge-intensive environments where effective decision making, often in new situations, has high impact on effectiveness in production. Bring learning content and technical documentation to life via task-sensitive Augmented Reality (AR). Make final products flexible for workplace integration via industry-standard repositories and toolkits. \nHOW: Wearable TEL platform enhances human abilities to acquire procedural knowledge by providing a smart system that directs attention to where it is most needed. An extensive audit of industry procedures, policies and participatory design methods will define the main facets of the platform. User test cycles will refine prototypes and deliverables. Existing wearable smart devices and sensors will be tailored to provide an innovative solution for content delivery and measurement of user performance. Comparative tests, stakeholders\u2019 review and leading the IEEE AR group will secure high-standard academic and industrial outputs. \nRELEVANCE to work programme: WEKIT is strongly aligned with EU job/training policies (e.g., Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs). It enhances the industrial value chain, reduces fragmentation/cost and improves efficiencies with impact regarding speed and scale in production. Looking ahead: roadmap shows safe skill pathways for use of TEL in changing industrial landscapes (e.g. smart machine-to-machine (M2M) knowledge-sharing).

Entrepreneurship meant as a basic skill is the leit motif of our strategic plan and it will be the goal of the whole plan of activities and mobilities. Other objectives are:\r\n- offering quality and variety to our teaching offer; offering job opportunities; orienteering to carreer; improving a sense of European and global identity; promoting innovation at school; improving linguistic competences to overcome linguistic and cultural borders; promoting mobility in Europe and in the world and allow success into the more and more fast-moving and demanding job market   \r\n- creating an updated learning environment to enable self-discovery and fullfillment, to create interest and awareness implementing CLIL methodologies; implementing a EU dimension in the school curricola and of the credit transfer system like  ECVET e EUROPASS\r\n- developping competences and skills in using new media in students and staff to fill in the gap between the teachers' and the digital natives' worlds, by creating a common language; facilitating learning with diversified paths, overcoming borders and obstacles.\r\nAccording to the VET Mobility Chart, the number of  beneficiaries will be 60 students attending the 4-5 class (catering, tourism, administration and marketing) and recent graduates of our school. The group includes disables, disadvantaged students and with learning difficulties. First learners will improve their competences in foreign language used abroad and will attend a pedagogic/professional training; after they will do a 4-week work placement to develop their field competences with a focus on fusion food and catering/tourism trends and social marketing. Given the large number of mobilities, they will be nomore restricted to excellence but offered in a systematic way to all students with good behaviour, widening, differentiating the school training offer, increasing motivation and promoting school success as planned in our school mission. Our school will gain an international dimension and will convey mobility and good practises in the area. \r\nStudents will be accompanied by 1teacher given the large number of minors and disadvantaged students+ 1 extra for fluxes with  students with special needs.  \r\nThe staff mobilities will be 25 (teachers, management and ATA employees) to offer wider opportunites abroad to develop competences, overcome disaffection and spread passion for teaching. The mobilities lasting about  8 days will be concentrated on jobshadowing, workshops, courses about foreign languages,  social inclusion, new teaching tecniques, CLIL and exchange of good practises.\r\nOn the return, the students will take part to a final contest: in teams they will prepare a fusion dish/cocktail expoiting the experience they got and the new skills gained. The reception group will prepare a suitable menu and presentation while the marketing group will plan a marketing campaign to launch on the social media. The jury will be composed by chefs/maitre of famous local restaurants while the audience will be formed by representatives of local boards, associations in order to give visibility to the project and offer job opportunities. The staff  will spread the new methodologies learnt in their department and will put into practice their new skills in their classes. Everybody will  update learning paths and will spread an international dimension at school, a dynamic, positive, motivating climate to get success and personal fullfillment. \r\nAccording to the internationalisation process, the network has been reinforced: we have chosen to keep the partners we trust and that are located in strategic markets  as well as to keep te prestigious cooperations we have with oversesas partners, especially due to the project topic. Indeed we believe that training should be opened to an international market to mirror the multicultural, multiehnic, global composition of our society. These partners give added value to our project and will let learners widen opportunities and perspectives, competence and will offer unique trainings in destinations that are among the top-world and in luxury accommodation like the 5-star holiday resort in Turks and Caicos.
