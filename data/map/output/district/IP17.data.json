Coupled with increased flue gas temperatures from high efficient solid fuel stoves, flue liners are failing to reduce serious chimney fires. The Intelli-Flue solution will address the issue of highly corrosive flue gases and elevated flue gas temperatures by developing a flexible ceramic liner and an energy recovery system. The combination will enable homeowners to continue to use solid safely without risking the building and its occupants. Intelli-Flue promotes solid fuels as alternatives to oil and gas domestic heating. With concerns over energy supply set to continue Intelli-Flue will help Europe to better utilise solid fuel resources and diversify our energy mix to meet EU energy targets.", 105356.0, 1260358.0, "INTELLI-FLUE", "Keeping flames where they belong", "The majority of Europeans enjoy the warmth of a fireplace or solid fuel-burning stove during the cold winter months.

Flue liners require an important update to resist the elevated temperatures of solid fuel stoves and highly corrosive flue gases produced by the combustion of solid fuels.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'Intelligent combustion management of flue gases for solid fuel domestic heating systems' (http://www.intelli-flue.eu (INTELLI-FLUE)) set out to solve the safety problem. Scientists developed a protective ceramic liner with a novel energy recovery system to meet home heating needs.\n\nCeramics are widely used in applications requiring resistance to wear, impact, corrosion and high temperatures. The INTELLI-FLUE liner demonstrated enhanced durability. The heat-exchanger harnesses waste heat for domestic heating and limits flue gas temperatures.\n\nGiven that the majority of European homeowners live in a dwelling with an operational chimney, the market is large and the danger real. The technology improves safety, efficiency and reliability. It has the potential to decrease heating, maintenance and insurance costs while protecting homes and their occupants.", null, "http://www.chimney-problems.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/148684.jpg", "fp7_97891_984624303"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1SP", "ULYSSES", "SNAPE MALTINGS", 1736142.0, "The Ulysses project was originally inspired by an illustrious generation of 18th Century artists who wandered all across Europe, visiting at each \u201cstop\u201d along the way the greatest masters\u2019 workshops in order to improve and to complete their skills. Following the steps of the Homeric hero, their odyssey was an initiatory journey paving the way for future generations of young European artists. Today Europe\u2019s singularity is characterized by the rich diversity of artistic situations and sociological contexts. The Ulysses \u201cjourneys\u201d aim to exploit this singularity to the fullest. It is a conviction of the Ulysses project that this is the only really modern approach to education. Ulysses aims also to give the \u201cjourney\u201d a more metaphorical meaning as well.Firstly, the metaphor applies to the \u201cprofessional journey\u201d young talent must undertake in order to become mature artists. Ulysses aims to propose \u201cpaths\u201d that will enable young artists to find their way from the academies, through the journeys that ultimately will put them in a position to be offered commissions for creating new works to be premiered in world-class venues, thus serving as a \u201claunching pad\u201d for their careers. Secondly, the metaphor applies to potential young artists where the goal is to propose a \u201cjourney\u201d that will take them from the discovery of new art forms to a stage where they can become creative themselves in a variety of projects fitted to their needs thereby revealing their talent.Thirdly, the metaphor applies to audience building. Audiences today are confronted with a bewildering variety of musical aesthetics and practices. Therefore, audiences of all ages will be offered activities that will take them from a first encounter with an artist (or a work) to a deeper understanding of the work.Lastly, the metaphor will be deployed in the virtual world of the online Ulysses Platform by enabling music professionals and amateurs to follow the evolution and accomplishments of our young artists.", "http://www.snapemaltings.co.uk", null, "creative_570769-CREA-1-2016-1-FR-CULT-COOP2_11"], ["1SP", "YOUNG OPERA MAKERS Programme by enoa", "SNAPE MALTINGS", 1733496.0, "YOUNG OPERA MAKERS PROGRAMME by enoaThe role of creation, development of new forms, exploration of innovative creative processes and audience renewal are all major challenges facing today\u2019s European opera world. Young artists must be the drivers of this change: their training and employability are crucial issues. In a globalized and competitive sector young artists should be fundamentally mobile and innovative. As existing training structures do not prepare for current challenges, the enoa network institutions have developed the YOUNG OPERA MAKERS Programme.This programme will give young creators (such as composers, writers and directors among others) and performers (singers, conductors, pianists and vocal coaches) the keys to develop their employability and international career in a constantly evolving field. It will offer them excellent training, with an interdisciplinary and contemporary approach to opera, enable them to perform and experience creative processes, and increase their visibility and access to international recruitment circuits.The programme therefore offers tailored training consisting of a wide variety of activities hosted by members of enoa throughout Europe along with a digital platform dedicated to the young artist community. Activities include: practical and theoretical workshops focused on technical development and the issues around creating opera, residences immerging young artists in the creative environment of cultural institutions, labs devoted to experimentation of innovative artistic projects, and new productions that will each lead to international tours.", "http://www.snapemaltings.co.uk", null, "creative_570767-CREA-1-2016-1-FR-CULT-COOP2_12"]]}}, "outwardCode": "IP17"}
