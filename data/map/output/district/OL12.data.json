This is an area of north west of England.  The school serves the immediate community and is over subscribed each year.  The children of St. James' are almost entirely from a White-British background. (98%).\r\n\r\nCurrently the school does not offer the children the teaching of a foreign language.  This stems from a lack of staff confidence and competence in this area of the curriculum, coupled with staff unskilled at leading curriculum developments.  As the teaching of a foreign language is a statutory requirement of England's National Curriculum, this situation is a concern to the school's leadership team, governing body and parents.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, it is of concern to the school that our children do not have an understanding and appreciation for cultural diversity.  Attending a school where 98% of the children are from a White-British background does not prepare them adequately for life in the wider community, country and indeed the world. Rochdale has experienced significant racial tension in recent times due to a number of high profile criminal cases.  Through pupil interviews, we have found that this has tainted the children's viewpoint on cultural diversity and the benefits and opportunities it brings.  For this reason, we believe the Erasmus+ project will help develop the children's appreciation of being a European and global citizen and gain an understanding of the potential benefits to their life as they move into adulthood.\r\n\r\nWe plan to use  Erasmus+  to access high quality training as part of this project via the training provider PQ  France.  8 participants will take part in training over a period of two years in France.  The first round of participants will include a new language co-ordinator, recruited with the specific intention of implementing our new language and cultural project.  Three further groups of 2 participants will attend, each developing their own skill-set through an individualised learning plan and providing incremental developments for the school's long term aims.  It is our intention that each round of training will target the individuals needs alongside the school's developmental needs.  The training provided will not be a repeat schedule.\r\n\r\nDuring this training week, the participants will further their own language skills, whilst developing a greater understanding of effective pedagogy in language acquisition.  This will give them the confidence and competence to teach well in school, improving the outcomes for the pupils of St.James'.  \r\n\r\nA secondary benefit from the project will be the enhanced leadership capacity of my staff.  A newly appointed language coordinator will be supported through this project by the school, PQ-France staff and wider colleagues in order to become a highly effective leader in school.  This will provide improved opportunity for career progression that might otherwise not be available.\r\n\r\nWe aim to introduce an educational visit to France.   Through this the children will gain first hand cultural experiences that will develop and challenge their understanding of European culture and its wonderful diversity.  This will give the children a real life context in which to apply their new language skills.  The Erasmus+ project will allow us to create appropriate partnerships and develop learning networks that will help us deliver our aspirational intentions.  \r\n\r\nIn order to monitor the impact of this project, both participants and pupils will be assessed throughout the two years.  participants will complete a baseline assessment using a Language Passport before the project begins and will update it each term.  This will formally be reviewed throughout the school's appraisal cycle.  This will allow for clear accountability to ensure the project is successful and its outcomes are achieved.  These assessments will help contribute to a personalised learning plan for each teacher that will be used within school and during the proposed training week.\r\n\r\nThe children will also be assessed in a similar way, using Language Ladders.  This will allow us to track the progress of children's language development.  We will also conduct pupil interviews against  scoring criteria to quantify the development in cultural appreciation and individual confidence.\r\n\r\nIIn summary, we hope that after two years, the children's cultural appreciation and understanding will have been broadened and they will have acquired new language skills that they are legally entitled to.  The most notable outcome will be for our children to confidently partake in a residential visit to France, engage in local culture and converse in another language.  It is hoped that they will be able to articulate the benefits of being a 'European minded' and appreciate the opportunities this can bring them as they grow up and enter adulthood.", "http://www.st-james.rochdale.sch.uk", "St. James' CofE Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035889_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["9QB", "RM3", "BIRCH HILL HOSPITAL"], ["9QB", "RT2", "BIRCH HILL HOSPITAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES"], ["9QB", "RT2", "CHILD & ADOLESCENT UNIT - BIRCHILL HOSPITAL"], ["9QB", "RT2", "PENNINE 3 - BIRCH HILL HOSPITAL"], ["9QB", "RT2", "WATERGROVE DAY HOSPITAL"], ["9QB", "RW6", "BIRCH HILL HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "OL12"}
