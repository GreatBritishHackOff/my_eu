Around 40% of the world\u2019s energy consumption is dedicated to the production of materials and chemicals. Thus, there is a need to develop high-performance materials based on renewable resources, simpler to synthesise and cost effective. Carbon materials derived from renewable resources (e.g., biomass) are ideal candidates to meet these needs. The main objective of our proposed Innovative Training Network is to develop new scientific knowledge, capability, technology, and commercial products for biomass-derived carbons (BCs); thus impacting the way that Europe uses and innovates with sustainable carbon materials. This will be accomplished through outstanding research and training programmes for fourteen early-stage researchers (ESRs). Our proposed research programme is feasible given the varied expertise and knowledge of the academic and industrial participants. We expect that GreenCarbon will improve our ability to rationally design a range of functionalised BC-derived materials using different individual and synergistically coupled processes and expand their practical applications. Our research programme comprehensively covers all aspects from precursors (the nature of biomass) to processing (thermochemical conversion, porosity development, chemical functionalisation) and application (e.g., CO2 capture, heterogeneous catalysis and chemicals from biomass) enabling a unique design of engineered sustainable BC materials. At the same time, our training programme is designed with the aim to empower the ESRs through the provision of a comprehensive and coherent training package, which includes complementary competencies and knowledge in all the science, engineering and business skills so as to be capable of deploying new technologies within different environments both inside and outside of academia.", null, 3160339.0, "GreenCarbon", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_205578_922670791"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2JF", "BUILDING BRIDGES FORGING WELLFARE", "Muslim Association of Britain", 14997.0, "\"Building bridges, forging welfare\" seeks to promote peace, multiculturalism and tolerance through the joint effort of young muslims and the neighborhood  in many European cities to improve social projects to improve their environment (neighborhood, district or city) through social projects and cultural mediators.Due the  rise of Islamophobia and xenophobic behaviors, the project will meet many young muslims associations of Europe, local organizations and the neighbors to share experiences and good practices and to create social projects that will make better their neighborhoods. Also the participants will develop their skills to become cultural mediators and to implement these projects for the integration of young migrants and refugees.That is the reason why six entities such as the Association of Muslim Youth in Valencia (Spain), Norges Unge Muslime (Norway), Giovani Musulmani d'Italia (Italy) and musilm Association of Ireland (Ireland), Muslim Association of Britain (UK) and Organization of Muslim in Hungary (Hungary) have designed a youth exchange, consistent with the priorities of the Erasmus + program for 2016:-reaching out to young people with fewer opportunities including refugees, asylum seekers and migrants;-promoting diversity, intercultural and inter-religious dialogue, common values of freedom, tolerance and respect of human rights as well as on projects enhancing media literacy, critical thinking and sense of initiative of young people;In this youth exchange will participate 60 young people and 6 young leaders from six organizations of young Muslims of Europe with local associations and neighbour representatives  of Orriols and collaborative entities, for 10 days in the city of Valencia in order to carry out:- A exchange of good practices  where Muslim youths will acquire skills as intercultural and social mediators.- Projects to improve marginal neighborhoods and to integrate refugees and segregated groups  through joint efforts.- Campaigns, measures and actions to combat xenophobia, racism, to promote the  multiculturalism and to achieve a full integration of young migrants and refugees.All of this through formal and informal methodologies consisting of working groups, participatory development, street activities... everything with the help of prestigeous experts, expert institutions on the cultural mediation (University of Valencia, City Hall Valencia Orriols Convive, Movement against Intolerance, SOS Racisme, CeiMigra ...) and the neighbors of Orriols (who will help to generate proposals for social projects for this area particularly affected by the crisis).In these meeting, we will develop the skills and competences  that will help us to build those bridges and generate social projects, to achieve the objectives set and  get a great impact in youth and in our communities. A project sustainable in time, that it becomes larger, stronger and more able to build a multicultural society without hatred.We want to build bridges between cultures but also contribute to the social  improvement for all residents in Europe, no matter our religion, our origin or ethnicity or religion.
