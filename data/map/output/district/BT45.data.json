TEAM\u2019s will build a network of expertise and train a new generation of researchers to deliver more effective, affordable and feasible mental health services for young people. Our interdisciplinary, international, intersectoral network, balanced in skills, experience and perspectives, will train the next generation of researchers to lead Youth Mental Health (YMH) services into the future. Research objectives focus on key challenges in YMH: delivering new technologies to support rapid, large-scale, and early assessment, prevention and treatment.TEAM will also deliver policy directions and guidelines for technology-enabled YMH. 2 themes are covered: how can technology a) increase access, and b) help people to engage more successfully? TEAM will deliver new technology-enabled services that are both accessible and engaging for young people. Our ambitious objectives require individuals with a unique combination of interdisciplinary and intersectoral skills. TEAM ESRs will receive integrated training across three key areas necessary to fully realise the potential of technology-enabled mental health: Mental Healthcare Delivery - the theories and practice of YMH; Computer science - core principles in software engineering and technology infrastructures; Interaction Design - theories and methods including co-designing with young people and active engagement with clinicians, social workers, caregivers (e.g. parents) and teachers.

The ethos of the school aims to develop European citizens of the 21st Century.  \r\n\r\nIn line with the school development plan, it is intended that staff professional development through European training courses will help raise the standard of teaching and learning in the school to outstanding and that the international dimension of this project will broaden cultural awareness of the diversity in education and allow for sharing of ideas and methodologies .  \r\n\r\nThe projects focus, specifically on the idea of an outdoor classroom for teaching environmental issues in Geography should improve the experience and engagement of our learners. A Geography teacher has been identified with a desire to develop their ability to  inspire environmental awareness amongst students. At present the school has gained funding from the Northern Ireland Environment Agency to develop the biodiversity of the school grounds creating a sustainable ecosystem to be used as an outdoor teaching resource. The training of a member of staff would equip the geography department with a wider understanding of how to best make use of this resource to benefit students. The project would ensure that dissemination of this practice would encourage other departments including biology to make a greater use of this resource in their teaching. \r\n\r\nPotentially, the participant will take part in an Outdoor Learning Training Course which aims to give teachers ideas and ways of harvesting \u201cthe touch of nature\u201d, the inspiration and stimulation, exploring ways to connect the person and the surroundings via learning, activities and tasks, building capacity to care for environment. Through this, links will be established with a partner school with which to communicate, collaborate and share ideas on their local environment using the E-twinning website. The participant will then develop teaching approaches and methods that connect individual learners to their surrounding environment, sharing this good practice with the Geography department, learning area and five local geography departments in the Magherafelt Learning Partnership. A key aspect of this project will be evaluation by staff and students throughout the year and at the conclusion of the in-service training by the participant.\r\n \r\nAs a result of the training the participant will have gained professional development amongst European colleagues to develop their teaching methods and approaches in relation to environmental education in the outdoors. These teaching strategies will be shared with colleagues in the Rainey and disseminated to other local geography departments, marketing the value added by staff development through Erasmus+. Through the project Geography students will have a greater knowledge of their local environment and will be empowered to participate actively in society and engage with the international dimension through their established partnerships with a European institution further sharing culture and ideas.\r\n\r\nAs the first application made by Rainey Endowed School for the mobility of school staff, it is intended that this may be rolled out to a great number of staff in the coming years both enhancing the international dimension of professional development and encouraging greater interaction with other institutions throughout Europe.", "http://www.raineyendowed.com", "Rainey Endowed School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002142_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["5AJ", "Community Family Support Programme (CFSP)", "NETWORK PERSONNEL (NP)", null, "ESF", 2998933.0, 4613745.0, "esf_ni_3"], ["5AJ", "Up for Work (UfW)", "NETWORK PERSONNEL", null, "ESF", 705304.0, 1085083.0, "esf_ni_37"], ["5AJ", "Jobmatch", "NETWORK PERSONNEL LTD.", null, "ESF", 2067884.0, 3181360.0, "esf_ni_57"], ["5AJ", "Up for Work- Supporting Young People", "NETWORK PERSONNEL", null, "ESF", 252096.7, 630241.74, "esf_ni_101"], ["5AJ", "Community Family Support Programme", "NETWORK PERSONNEL", null, "ESF", 1197776.0, 2994440.0, "esf_ni_102"], ["5AJ", "Jobmatch", "NETWORK PERSONNEL LTD", null, "ESF", 735002.0, 1837504.0, "esf_ni_103"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT45"}
