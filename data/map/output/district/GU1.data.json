In order to fulfil these increased expectations, the trainees are given the chance to participate in an internship at companies in the south of England for several weeks. Thus, the students will be able to broaden their professional, social, language and intercultural skills. In return, the local companies in and around Friesoythe will benefit from the additional knowledge and experience their trainees gain in England.\r\nMoreover, it is an important aim of the BBS Friesoythe to give the students the opportunity to really experience and live the European idea with all its diversity and advantages.
