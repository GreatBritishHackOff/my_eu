The Internet architecture designed in the 1960's has been supporting a variety of applications and offering a number of services till now but emerging applications demand better quality, programmability, resilience and protection. Any alterations to the Internet architecture have become restricted to simple incremental updates and plug-ins instead of radical changes by introducing new solutions. RINA is an emerging clean-slate programmable networking approach, centring on Inter-Process Communication (IPC) paradigm, which will support high scalability, multi-homing, built-in security, seamless access to real-time information and operation in dynamic environments. The heart of this networking structure is naturally formed and organised by blocks of containers called 'Distributed Information Facilities - DIFs' where each block has programmable functions to be attributed to as they required. A DIF is seen as an organizing structure, grouping together application processes that provide IPC services and are configured under the same policies. Virtualization is a fundamental attribute of the architecture itself. Based on the above fundamental aspect, PRISTINE intends to:\u0095 Design and implement the innovative internals of this clean-slate architecture that include the programmable functions for: security of content and application processes, supporting QoS and congestion control in aggregated levels, providing protection and resilience, facilitating more efficient topological routing, and multi-layer management for handling configuration, performance and security.\u0095 Demonstrate the applicability and benefits of this approach and its built-in functions in three use-cases driven by the service providers and vendors in the consortium. This will ensure that the applications and tools we develop will be deployable by providers.", 58705.0, 3842755.0, "PRISTINE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_189055_927577827"], ["9NT", "Development of an automatic process of in-house collection, storage and application of adaptive bacteria culture for fish farms", "Aquarius Marine Group Ltd", "Evidence from recirculation systems shows that new starters experience 30-80% loss in sales almost unavoidably in the first year during the adaption period of a biofilter, accompanied by the failure losses from fish medication and seasonal depressions counting summingly for more than \u20ac70-90M annually in Europe. Low reliability of biofilter systems are considered the main reason why people avoid entering fish farming business. Our idea is to reduce the bio-filter recovery time after failure by developing an Intelligent Biofilter Control (IBC) system. Real-time monitoring system will detect the viability and metabolic activity of the bacteria culture. At healthy period excess bacteria are extracted, prepared for storage and stored by automatic collection system. In case of biofilter failure, the stored culture will be cultivated for rapid recovery of the biofilter thereby providing increased productivity of the farm. The major barriers to overcome are: (a) Biofilter start-up and recovery processes in fish farm are slow, taking 3-6 weeks. (b) Methods of bacteria extraction and storage are designed for usage in laboratory and not providing the efficiency required for industrial applications; (c) Limited knowledge about how is the recovery performance of recultivated bacteria related to the health before collection; (d) Existing methods to assess the viability and metabolic activity of bacteria are complicated and time consuming. We intend to overcome these barriers by speeding up the recovery of a bio-filter by recultivating the stored adapted bacteria. Farm productivity will increase up to 15%; Farm supply security will improve, increasing the sales price about 5%, there is less environmental risks, and less hazard to fish health.

European research has optimised an automatic biofilter for recirculation systems in fish farms.", "Toxic build-up of ammonia and nitrite from the breakdown of faeces and excess food in fish farms can be hazardous to fish. The biological way to remedy nitrogen-based toxic build-up is to use nitrifying bacteria that ultimately convert the ammonia into harmless by-products such as nitrogen gas. The bacteria are housed in biofilters composed of material such as plastic sheets or sand grains. \n\nUnfavourable growth periods for the bacteria result in a decrease in population and inability to purify the water. As it may take weeks or months to recolonise a biofilter, the EU-funded ADAPOND project has developed an Intelligent Biofilter Control (IBC) system. System reliability was enhanced with reduction in the biofilter recovery time after failure.\n\nThe IBC has three critical components. There is a real-time monitoring system to detect the viability and metabolic activity of the bacteria in the culture. An automatic collection system extracts excess bacteria during their optimal growth period. These are then cultivated to be ready for use in the event of a biofilter failure. \n\nThe ADAPOND system has many advantages over currently used systems. Most available commercial enrichment cultures are in liquid, dried or freeze dried form and therefore easily washed out from the system. ADAPOND nitrifying bacteria are attached to the biofilter carrier material and are therefore ready for immediate action. \n\nAnother feature is that the bacteria are cultured and stored in the actual farm and are therefore adapted to thrive in that specific environment. Research has shown that the reaction rate in a biofilter is influenced by the history of the inhabitants \u2013 locals are adapted to the conditions!  \n\nNew biofilter starters can cause a 30\u201380 % loss in sales during the adaptation period of the biofilter. Altogether, filter changes accompanied by failure losses from fish medication and seasonal depressions cost the industry more than EUR 70\u201390 million annually in Europe. An added advantage of not transferring bacteria from another site is that there is no risk of importing diseases from other farms.", "http://adapond.eii.ee/", null, "/docs/results/images/2014/146151.jpg", "fp7_93707_999454536"], ["8BQ", "A Process to Engineer and Manufacture Medium to High Value 3D Products Using Mixed Polymer Recyclate", "Acorn Project Management Ltd", "Polymer products have transformed society. Some of their many uses include construction, food preservation, healthcare, water distribution and sanitation. They are crucial in saving energy through their light weight and insulating properties. As a result the European polymer processing industry is of strategic importance to Europe. However, increasing feedstock prices seriously affect the competitiveness of EU plastic converters. Rising costs can no longer be effectively mitigated by increased productivity and cost cutting. Instead we MUST focus on higher value added products and increase our use of recycled plastics. Although 50% of Europe\u2019s plastics waste is recovered, only 7% is converted into usable products. This is because it is often technically difficult and uneconomic to separate mixed waste streams, secondly mixed plastics cannot be processed by conventional technology and thirdly, phase separation often results in poor mechanical properties. If it were possible to increase the utility of mixed waste plastics this would significantly benefit European polymer converters, recyclers and minimise material going to landfill. The EuPR and EuPC represent over 50,000 of Europe\u2019s polymer converters and recyclers and propose to develop a process that will enable the production of medium-to-high value products containing up to 98% mixed waste plastic. The project will focus on advancements in moulding and material technology, application of reinforcements and development of a design tool that will enable the European industry to engineer pioneering products using mixed plastic waste streams. The production process will reduce our member\u2019s material costs by up to 50% and contribute to enabling EU industries to comply with the WEEE, WFD and EC Packing Waste Legislation.
