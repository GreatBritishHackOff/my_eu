Mar-ginalised teenagers from three European countries (Wales, Czech Republic and Germany) get the chance to enhance their personality in a cultural and individual way through art workshops. Behind this project lies the desire for strengthening the already intensive team-work between the partner organisations and for advocating a feeling of a common European identity.\r\n\r\nOne of the project\u2019s most important goals besides fostering the youth\u2019s mobility, creativity and intercultural exchange is to enable the further development of their social skills and per-sonality. The achievement of an improved language ability as well as a better ability to com-municate is pursued. The youths get to learn about their fellow European citizens and their differing cultures. By the end of the project they would have acquired the skill to understand and value each other\u2019s perception.\r\n\r\nAfter the first matchings by telephone, a preparatory meeting will take place in May 2017 where one representative and one teenager per country will participate. Final details and questions will be clarified then.\r\n\r\n36 youths aged between 13 and 15 years will participate. One person with special needs is estimated per country. Each organization (Caerphilly, Nov\u00fd Ji\u010d\u00edn and Ludwigsburg) will mo-bilise 12 teenagers. Among the German participants are mainly teenagers with migration background and refugees. The participants from Wales and Czech Republic are from geo-graphically dispersed areas and socially and financially disadvantaged.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the three workshops that are engaged in traditional art, new media and sculp-turing a diverse framework programme will take place, including an opening and closing event. During the closing event, the youths\u2019 dedication will be awarded with the Youthpass. The Youthpass will increase the participant\u2019s career opportunities.\r\n\r\nFurther results are a strengthened cooperation between the partner organisations, tolerance and a common European identity. The project\u2019s position as a role model will encourage other European twin towns to follow the lead.", "http://www.caerphilly.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE04-KA105-014933_2"], ["7XR", "International Work Experience for Staff and Students", "Coleg y Cymoedd", 130193.0, "The overall objective for the colleges in our consortium is through this project to strenghten the international perspective in our educations in order to appear as attractive educational centres to students and staff  and as competent collaborators for international cooperation within the  scope of the colleges. This project encompasses 92 social and health care students and child care students plus 14 teachers. This is a minor reduction in the number of students probably due to the three-party agreement which meant a reduction in the number of Pedagogical Assistant students. The main objectives of the project with regard to the students are to provide a basis for the students to obtain knowledge about international relations especially within the social and health care area and the child care area. Furthermore to strengthen the students' intercultural competences through practice placements abroad by strengthing their skills in foreign languages and their personal and professional competences hereby  improving their employablity at both the Danish and the European labour market. With regard to the staff the main objectives are to strengthen the development of quality and innovation mainly in teaching at our colleges and to enhance internationalisation sending out members of our staff for supplementary education abroad.  in February SOSU-Fyn, SOSU-Esbjerg and da Vinci College in Dordrecht will meet to discuss the possiblities of exchanging teachers on a more structural basis with focus on pedagogics in relation to rehabilitation and psychiatry. \r\nFor students the stays last 1 month,  for teachers typically 1 week. The stays will be arranged in cooperation with our partners abroad, mostly vocational colleges that offer similar educations. These partners many of which we have cooperated fruitfully with for several years have committed themselves by Memorandum of Understanding / Letter of Intent to fulfil the demands of the project. \r\nThe fields of responsiblity are laid down in MoU / LoI and are briefly mentioned as follows: Sending college undertakes the responsiblity to prepare the participants, draw up the necessary documents according to  the Erasmus+ Programme, make sure the participants have the insurrances and health care insurrance required by the Erasmus+ Programme, transfer the grant from the Erasmus+ programme and inform the participants about  possible means of transport to the destination. The receiving organisation undertakes to find a suitable practice placement, make sure that there is a mantor at the practice placement, provide a suitable accommodation, be avaliable for the participants to contact in case they need support that cannot be carried out by the practice placement, and make sure that an evaluation takes place at the end of the stay.\r\nIn the comments to the Charter for our Consortium it was stated that some points are missing: 1) more definite plans for our activities in the international strategies of our colleges 2) the frame and intentions for our work with receiving students and teachers from abroad for practice placements and staff traning  3) considerations about future demands for adding new partneres to our project. With regard to item 1 it is a topic that we have planned to address on our meetings in the consortium where we would discuss how we in cooperation with our managers and principals will develop our international strategies in line with the European and Danish political objectives. However this has not been possible due to the need for our managers to reorganise our colleges as a result of the reduction of students at our colleges decided by the Danish Government, the Region and the municipalities in the three-party agreement . With regard to item 2 we  typically receive students and staff from colleges that have proven their ability to organize stays that contribute to fulfil the objectives of the project in question and with a high degree of quality  for our students and members of staff  and we want to repay this in the same way. The intention is also to give our students and members of staff a possiblity to exchange experiences about relevant topics an hereby enhance  the interest for and understanding of international activities in VET. Concerning item 3 it is a topic that we currently discuss. At our last meeting  in December 2016 we decided to try to esatblish new partnerships with  two colleges, one in Sweden and one in the Netherlands. At a contact seminar arranged by Arbeit und Leben in Hamburg in December 2016 we met representatives from what seems to be reliable colleges, that showed  interest in working together with us and that will be able to live up to our requirements for exchange of students and staff. We always visit new partners before we proceed toformal agreements in MoU /LoI.", "http://www.cymoedd.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DK01-KA116-034081_3"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["7PG", "The Lawns", "Caerphilly County Borough Council", "The establishment of two new buildings on the Lawns Industrial Estate in Rhymney. 10 new units will be built on the site where there is already 21 fully occupied industrial units", "ERDF", 1291667.0, 2030811.0, "erdf_wales_81378"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CF82"}
