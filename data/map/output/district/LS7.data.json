The SciCafe proposes an innovative approach that crosscuts the boundaries between the already existing initiatives, focusing both on the improvement of organisers\u2019 knowledge on how to develop and maintain a SC and on increasing the participants intrinsic motivation to learn and understand about scientific issues, which could potentially change their attitude towards science and encourage them to follow scientific careers in the years to come. It offers tools and activities combining physical presence of its members in the existing SC, and virtual presence of members from across Europe and beyond, ensuring everyone\u2019s active participation, irrespectively of their physical location and possible disadvantage (rural areas\u2019 citizens). In this hybrid world of SC, the network will consist of actors from the cities who are involved in science/culture/entertainment/education/local development/citizens' participation/media, such as local authorities, universities/research centres, science communication structures, schools, libraries, local civil society organisations, enterprises based on science and technology. Today\u2019s participant to a SC has to find it more and more attractive and not static to what it was when these initiatives were begun so such places should follow the new trends and the new technological achievements. The project will focus on: (i) To create a network of SC that will guide the next generation of SCs, (ii) To implement a series of state of the art technologies (virtual presence, social tagging) through a series of innovative scenarios.", 65241.0, 787240.0, "SCICAFE", "Science cafes online", "Science cafes (SCs) provide an online forum for discussing science. An EU programme was set up to look after them.", "The EU-funded project 'The science cafes network' (SCICAFE) created a network of online SCs in various cities across Europe and abroad. These took the form of sophisticated chat rooms for the discussion of science.\n\nInvolving a consortium of 12 diverse partners from 8 EU states, the project ran from 2009 to 2012. It coordinated networking among the various SCs and individual science communication practitioners. This was intended to support the evolution of SCs by fostering cooperation and information exchange about experiences and best practices.\n\nSCICAFE listed 12 results against its 7 objectives. It developed an understanding of SC operations across Europe, establishing a set of best practices and forming a How-To guide for establishing new SCs. The project also developed innovative scenarios on organising different types of SCs.\n\nProject partners conducted 40 validation workshops in 9 countries. They also organised 23 training workshops in six European and two African countries, which exceeded the project's initial target of four such workshops.\n\nAs part of this action, SCICAFE familiarised SC organisers with information and communication technologies (ICT) tools that facilitate the operation of SCs. These included the portal release of 3-D tools simulating a real cafe environment, employing cross-media tools that bridge the 'second life' online environment and reality. Other tools allowed for improvements such as larger video uploads plus email and SMS tools.\n\nSCICAFE expanded its list of cafes in Africa, eastern Europe and the United States. The project, overall, included 93 junior cafes, intended for young people, listed as an important and difficult achievement given initial resistance to the concept from schools.\n\nThe project's dissemination achievements include the development of relevant materials, including 70 posters, 1 000 leaflets, 2 newsletters and 50 copies of the guidelines for creating new SCs. These activities also resulted in 6 conferences/workshops and 10 publications, the most important of which was the e-book 'Sipping Science with a Science Cafe'. This contains the project's legacy, including culturally relevant information, and will be critical to those wishing to start new SCs in the future.", null, "http://www.cafescientifique.org", "/docs/results/images/2013-12/57860.jpg", "fp7_92321_997364671"], ["4HZ", "Promoting Technology Transfer of Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and new Production Technologies", "GLE Growth Capital Limited", "ProNano aims at validating new practices to remove the major barriers that prevent results out of scientific research projects on nanotechnology field from reaching market applications: market barriers, technology barriers, financial barriers, managerial barriers. Managed by experienced innovation consultant firms and venture capitalist from several European countries, and involving European and national nanotechnology networks and platforms, ProNano promotes existing results of scientific research projects available in EU research centres that have not yet been exploited, through assistance to the entrepreneurial teams connected to such research work. First, existing research results are identified and screened for evaluation of their commercial potential. The technical information is completed by a business-relevant analysis of technological competitive markets, road maps to financing, and management issues leading to draft business plans. Then, potential entrepreneurs and investors are associated to this process and coached by technology transfer and innovation professionals including specialists in venture capital/ private equity financing and banking instruments. The promising nanotechnologies are made ready to be licensed for sale to industry or developed into business proposals for start-up companies.

But it is not just about frontier research \u2013 there is the socioeconomic aspect, too. Nanotechnologies promise to revolutionise existing industries, create new ones, and address many of the social and economic challenges facing society. However, this requires transforming science into concrete applications.\n\nAlthough Europe is a global powerhouse in creating knowledge in the various nano fields, it tends to stumble when translating science into useful and marketable products. Funded by the EU, PRONANO provides a wide range of support services, free of charge, to research bodies or individuals interested in commercially exploiting their nano-related scientific results. Project practices help them to overcome the market, technological, managerial and financial barriers standing in the way of commercialisation.\n\nRun by innovation consultancy firms and venture capitalists from several European countries, PRONANO also brings together national and European nanotechnology platforms.\n\nOut of 50 promising research projects, PRONANO managed to steer 10 towards final decisions on commercialisation. Effectively this means the project approach raised 17 times the EU investment in the successful technology opportunities. Another five other projects were still under consideration when the initiative came to an end.\n\nThe project's approach proves that, managed correctly, Europe's cutting-edge nanotechnology sector can deliver profitability to the EU and enhance its competitiveness.

FI-STAR will create a robust framework based of the 'software to data' paradigm. A sustainable value chain following the life cycle of the Generic Enablers (GEs) will enable FI-STAR to grow beyond the lifetime of the project.

Through the trials FI-STAR will validate the FI-PPP core platform concept by using GEs to build its framework and will introduce ultra-light interactive applications for user functionality. It will pro-actively engage with the FI-PPP to propose specifications and standards.FI-STAR will use the latest digital media technology for community building and will proactively prepare for Phase 3 through targeted elicitation of new partners using open calls. Finally, FI-STAR will collaborate with other FI-PPP projects, through the mechanisms in place, by actively interacting with all necessary bodies.
