Has Europe the technical and human capability to lead future underground science by hosting the next generation underground neutrino and rare event observatory? We aim to answer this question.  Certainly construction will exceed the capacity of any single European nation - to compete with the US and Asia unification of our scattered efforts is essential. Failure to plan now risks not only that our picture of Nature's laws remain fundamentally incomplete but also that leadership in the field enjoyed by Europe for 20 years falls away.

They travel with the speed of light and pass through Earth with almost no interaction. Because they are not stopped easily, they carry unique information about the processes that have occurred in the far reaches of the Universe and in the core of stars. This means that what is inaccessible to telescopes 'only' able to look at the surface of celestial bodies becomes accessible to neutrino detectors.  \n\nTo open a new window to probe the Universe with neutrinos, physicists initiated the EU-funded http://laguna.ethz.ch/laguna-eu/ (LAGUNA) project. So that neutrinos are not confused with cosmic rays (sub-atomic particles that do not penetrate the Earth), a detector much larger and more sensitive than those presently used will be installed underground.  \n\nThe first phase of the project involved studying seven pre-selected potential locations in Spain, France, Poland, Romania, Finland and the United Kingdom. For each site, a detailed geological assessment of underground caverns was carried out to identify the most appropriate to host instruments with a total mass around 100 000 to 500 000 tonnes.   \n\nThree different types of neutrino detectors were considered: Memphys, Glacier and Low energy neutrino astronomy (LENA). At their core is a huge tank filled with tonnes of liquid observed by light sensors that are arranged on the inner surface. The liquid, either water or liquid argon, acts as the detecting medium.   \n\nAccording to their findings, the extraordinarily ambitious experiment will be composed of a liquid argon chamber with a mass of about 20 000 tonnes, complemented by a magnetised iron detector. The ideal location would be at a depth of 1 400 m within the Pyh\u00e4salmi mine in Finland.  \n\nTo also assess scientific opportunities offered, the LAGUNA project brought together industrial partners and the scientific community. Physicists pointed to the need to couple the new neutrino observatory with neutrino beams from the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and study matter\u2013antimatter asymmetry in neutrino oscillations.  \n\nThe next phase of the project, called LAGUNA-LBNO, has already started. This will address one additional challenge to making the final detector and site choice: to determine the full cost of underground construction, commissioning and long-term operation of the observatory.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813111836.jpg", "fp7_89640_999735351"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7PA", "Rozv\u00edjen\u00ed dialogu lok\u00e1ln\u00edch a evropsk\u00fdch p\u0159\u00edstup\u016f v oborech zam\u011b\u0159en\u00fdch na restaurov\u00e1n\u00ed a design od\u011bvu pro zkvalitn\u011bn\u00ed vzd\u011bl\u00e1v\u00e1n\u00ed", "Ian George Wall", 51949.0, "The project of the Secondary School of Art and Design and Higher Professional School Brno (HPS) supports professional foreign internships for:\r\na) students/graduates of conservation and restoration departments of HPS (Furniture, Painting, Ceramics; 8 persons) \r\nb) students/graduates of the Department of Fashion and Textile Design (7 persons)\r\nc) HPS staff members (professional instructors, school management; 6 persons)\r\n\r\nThe mobility program plans for internships of one month (students, graduates) or three weeks (staff, management) in four runs over the period from Sept. 2017 to Dec. 2018 in major European urban centres: Vienna, Berlin, Potsdam, Munich, London, Bologna and Houten.\r\nThe host organizations have been chosen with respect to their anticipated benefit for the project participants (e.g. focus on a specific field or technique, modern technologies and materials, professionally suitable destination, topicality \u2013 current trends in the field) while maintaining the aim that the placement corresponds with the abilities/knowledge of each supported person, so that the professional relationships thus established are mutually beneficial. The project complies with HPS\u2018s long-term policy regarding foreign internships (strengthening extant collaborations and further broadening of the host organization network) and with the ideas HPS holds concerning high quality professional internships. \r\nThe project follows previous successful projects, but it also responds to the current needs of the students/instructors at HPS. The feedback is performed through internal questionnaires, multi-level discussion (student/graduate-instructor-school management), in regular instruction, staff meetings and student assemblies. The school uses the EURES platform and organizes special seminars focused on foreign internships and/or employment opportunities on foreign labour markets. The school thus maintains its competitiveness with universities and thereby its attractiveness for future applicants. Another expected effect is broadening of the graduates\u2019 career opportunities, which is expedited by their acquisition of comprehensible European documents (Europass-Mobility, Europass-Diploma Supplement, Europass-CV) and the adoption of ECVET, which is a guarantee of quality for the potential employers. Simultaneously, general awareness about the school is spread through successful graduates, which helps its search for new professional partners. A secondary effect of the steady offer of foreign internships is high motivation for current students.\r\nSelected participants represent all departments at the HPS, i.e. Conservation and Restoration of Furniture and Non-polychromed Woodcarving, C&R of Painting and Decorative Techniques, C&R of Ceramics and Fashion and Textile Design. This concerns the second/third year students (6), graduates (14), teaching staff (6) and school management (1). Graduates are unfortunately rarely the target group of grant programmes, although it is them who attest to the qualities of their school the most. The education, however, would lose its purpose should the graduates fail to find work in their field. The support should thus be readily available in the most vulnerable stage of their career development, which is why their number is relatively high compared to the day students. \r\n\r\nThe content of the professional internships for C&R students/graduates corresponds with clearly defined units of learning outcomes for each separate department; i.e. the participant will examine, document, propose a restoration treatment and restore the assigned object. The student/graduate of the Department of Fashion and Textile Design will design an article of clothing based on the assigned criteria, justifying his/her choices, and realize it. Staff and management members will fulfil the obligatory Work Programme (job shadowing, exchange of expertise, practical work internship). All participants will also improve their language skills (some of them in two languages \u2013 in case they reach the B2 level in the main communication language, c.f. OLS) and appropriate soft skills.\r\n\r\nProject implementation consists mainly in the following steps:\r\n- selection of key activities based on the school\u2019s needs (open discussion, internal survey \u2013 appended to the application, staff meetings, student assemblies, special seminars).
