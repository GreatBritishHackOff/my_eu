The MATRHYCE project aims to develop and provide an easy to implement vessel design and service life assessment methodology based on lab-scale tests under hydrogen gas.

At least three types of lab-scale tests will be carried out and carefully analysed to address the fatigue of pressure vessel steels without and under hydrogen pressure. The proposed rationale will be finally validated by means of fatigue tests under hydrogen pressure on full scale components. The obtained results and conclusions will allow prioritized recommendations to support ongoing or new RCS initiatives at the international level.

Because hydrogen used in fuel cells produces only water, electricity and heat, there are no polluting emissions and power can be efficiently produced to sustain everyday vehicles for kilometres. The challenge that hydrogen fuel cell technology faces today is infrastructure.\n\nThe first hydrogen refuelling stations have been built all over the world. But international standards to evaluate the fitness for service of high-pressure hydrogen vessels do not properly addressed hydrogen enhanced fatigue. The EU-funded project 'Material testing and recommendations for hydrogen components under fatigue' http://www.mathryce.eu/ (MATHRYCE) was initiated to fill this gap.\n\nThe project brings together world leaders in standards development and hydrogen production and storage. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission is also participating together with government organisations from three European countries. Project partners' efforts are aimed at the assessment of pressure vessels for high pressure hydrogen storage based on laboratory experiments.\n\nMATHRYCE partners have so far reviewed existing codes and standards in order to identify their limits. They found that only recently, the high-pressure vessel codes of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the High Pressure Gas Safety Institute of Japan (KHK) addressed the effects of hydrogen on metal properties under cycling loading. In Europe, there are local codes developed and used in different countries, but not always considering fatigue loading under hydrogen pressure. However, several components of the hydrogen supply chain, such as high-pressure compressors and pressure buffers in hydrogen refuelling stations experience cyclic loading.\n\nA combined numerical and experimental approach has been followed to contribute in filling this gap. Numerical simulations have been carried out to quantify stresses and hydrogen concentrations inside pressure vessels. The results will provide the most representative conditions for laboratory tests. At the same time a testing campaign has been set up including lab scale and full scale tests aimed at assessing the effect of Hydrogen on fatigue life.\n\nThe lab-scale specimen as well as the full scale pressure vessels have been manufactured from aCrMosteel with a tempered martensite and bainite microstructure. Although classically used to manufacture pressure vessels for hydrogen transport and storage, this steel is sensitive to hydrogen embrittlement. Under high hydrogen pressure cycling, cracks can initiate and grow within the lifetime of the tank. Thus, the MATHRYCE partners have developed test instrumentation to both detect fatigue crack initiation and measure its growth under cyclic loading.\n\nResults of the tests under high hydrogen pressure will lay the groundwork for development of an easy-to-implement methodology to assess real-scale high-pressure vessels. The assessment will be based on solid knowledge of the influence of parameters, such as pressure and loading frequency, on hydrogen enhanced fatigue. At the end of the project, a methodology for component design will be proposed based on fatigue life obtained from lab-scale test results combined with data obtained by testing full-scale cylinders under cycling pressure.", null, "http://www.ccsglobalgroup.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/156388.jpg", "fp7_104387_990709889"], ["3PB", "Pre-normative research on safe indoor use of fuel cells and hydrogen systems", "The Ccs Global Group Limited", "This project addresses the issue of safe indoor use of hydrogen and fuel cells systems (priority 4.6 of the call FCH-JU-2010-1) for early markets (forklift refuelling and operation, back-up power supply, portable power generation, etc.): It aims to provide scientific and engineering knowledge for the specification of cost-effective means to control hazards specific to the use of hydrogen indoors or in confined space and developing state-of-the-art guidelines for European stakeholders.\nSpecific knowledge gaps need to be closed in the areas of indoor hydrogen accumulations, vented deflagrations, and under-ventilated jet fires.

Integration of transport volumes and modes, better use of capacity, flexibility, resource efficiency and cooperation between all actors along the logistic chain are required.\n\nAligned with the European policies and the ALICE roadmap, LOGISTAR objective is to allow effective planning and optimizing of transport operations in the supply chain by taking advantage of horizontal collaboration, relying on the increasingly real-time data gathered from the interconnected environment. For this, a real-time decision making tool and a real-time visualization tool of freight transport will be developed, with the purpose of delivering information and services to the various agents involved in the logistic supply chain, i.e. freight transport operators, their clients, industries and other stakeholders such as warehouse or infrastructure managers.\n\nLOGISTAR will address several advances beyond the State of the Art in the interdisciplinary field of the smart algorithms for data processing: Artificial Intelligence focussed onr prediction, parallel hybrid metaheuristics for optimization, automated negotiation techniques, and constraint satisfaction problem solving techniques. The resulting platform will outperform other market products and services such as Freight Exchange Systems, Collaborative Platforms, Transport Control Towers or Routing Systems.\n\nLOGISTARS involves RTD organisations (DEUSTO, UCC, CSIC), technology developers (DNET, SWC), consultancy firms (MDST, PRESTON), ICT services developers (SAG, DBH, GENEGIS) and stakeholders from different stages of the supply chain (AHLERS, ZAILOG, NESTL\u00c9, PLADIS, CODOGNOTTO).\n\nThe duration of the project is estimated to be 36 months and has an approximate budget of 5 million euros.", 274329.0, 4352290.0, "LOGISTAR", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_216006_947686218"], ["3PB", "DEVELOPMENT OF A COST EFFECTIVE AND RELIABLE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLE REFUELLING SYSTEM", "The Ccs Global Group Limited", "H2Ref addresses the compression and buffering function for the refuelling of 70 MPa passenger vehicles and encompasses all the necessary activities for advancing a novel hydraulics-based compression and buffering system that is very cost effective and reliable from TRL 3 (experimentally proven concept) to TRL 6 (technology demonstrated in relevant environment), thereby proving highly improved performance and reliability in accordance with the following targets that have been defined considering the intrinsic characteristics of this new solution:\n- Throughput: 70 MPa dispensing capacity of 6 to 15 vehicles per hour (i.e. 30 to 75 kg/hr) - depending on the inventory level in source storage of the compressed hydrogen - with a 75 kW power supply;\n- Robustness and Reliability: 10 years of operation without significant preventive maintenance requirement, demonstrated through intensive lab test simulating 20 refuellings per day during 10 years, i.e. 72,000 refuellings;\n- CAPEX:  Manufacturing cost of 300 k\u20ac for the compression and buffering module (CBM) assuming serial production (50 systems/yr). This level of cost for the CBM allows to target a cost of 450 k\u20ac for the complete HRS (including pre-cooling and dispensing), assuming application of the optimized approaches for pre-cooling and dispensing control being developed in the HyTransfer project, far below the current HRS cost of approximately 900 k\u20ac;\n- Energy efficiency: average consumption for compression below 1.5 kWh/kg of dispensed hydrogen, i.e. 50% below the energy consumption of current systems, in fuelling stations supplied by trailers, which is and will likely remain the most common form of supply.\nThe knowledge gained will allow subsequent development to focus on optimization of components, of design for manufacturing and maintenance, further demonstration, and the development of a product range for different refuelling station sizes, thus taking this innovation to the market.", 131187.0, 6013445.0, "H2REF", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ccsglobalgroup.com", null, "h2020_198235_990709889"]]}}, "outwardCode": "KT23"}
