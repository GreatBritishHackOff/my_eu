The contacts gained and experiences made within this project shall be the foundation for other projects within the department of catering and tourism but above that also for other departments and types of educational qualifications which are offered at our school. This project is based on experiences that have already been gained in previous European activities but is also supposed to be a pilot project for the delegation of students doing an apprenticeship to foreign countries. What must be organized beforehand? How are the students to be prepared? Which partners and what kind of support is required? How are mobilities organized and executed? How are students taken care of and coached? How can the experiences made be included into the daily life at school and at work? How are the mobilities going to be evaluated and deliberated? How can consequences be drawn and how can processes be optimized for following projects?

There is very strong potential for increasing the number of young people, from all backgrounds that have the opportunity to benefit from this unique experience.We are also convinced that the Erasmus + framework and the structure of these projects brings great benefits to Sail Training and increases the impact that our programmes have on the personal and group development of our young participants.We have successfully run 10 Youth in Action / Erasmus + projects since 2012.    Sail Training is a fun and exciting adventure, which has a profound impact on the lives of participants. \u201cTrainees\u201d take part in voyages at sea on tall ships and large yachts during which they become part of the working crew.
