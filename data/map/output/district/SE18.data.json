By combining both, guidance of (groups of) such vehicles can considerably improve especially in urban areas. For management of automated vehicles at signalized intersection and corridors, the MAVEN (Managing Automated Vehicles Enhances Network) project will develop infrastructure-assisted platoon organization and negotiation algorithms. These extend and connect vehicle systems for trajectory and maneuver planning and infrastructure systems for adaptive traffic light optimization. Traffic lights adapting their signal timing to facilitate the movement of organized platoons and reversely will yield substantial better utilization of infrastructure capacity, reduction of vehicle delay and reduction of emission. The MAVEN project will build a system prototype for both field tests and extensive modeling for impact assessment, contribute to the development of enabling technologies such as communication standards and high-precision maps, and develop ADAS techniques for inclusion of vulnerable road users. Additionally, MAVEN will include a user assessment and the development of a roadmap for the introduction of vehicle-road automation to support road authorities in understanding changes in their role and the tasks of traffic management systems. Finally, MAVEN will white paper on \u2018management of automated vehicles in a smart city environment\u2019 will be written to position the MAVEN results in the broader perspective of passenger transport in smart / future cities and to embed them with smart city principles and technologies as well as service delivery.", 122187.0, 2747677.0, "MAVEN", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_204151_939160500"], ["6HQ", "Sharing Cities", "Royal Borough of Greenwich", "Sharing Cities has four key objectives.  \n1) To achieve scale in the European smart cities market by proving that properly designed smart city solutions, based around common needs, can be integrated in complex urban environments.  This will be done in a way that exhibits their true potential and allows for the significant scale-up and consequent increase in social, economic and environmental value. \n2) Adopt a digital first approach which proves the extent to which ICT integration can improve and connect up existing infrastructure, as well as the design and running of new city infrastructure.  This will also allow for the creation of a new set of next stage digital services which will help citizens make better and beneficial choices around energy efficiency and mobility, which when scaled up will enhance the city\u2019s ability to hit key targets for mobility, housing, energy efficiency and resilience, and economic development. \n3) Accelerate the market to understand, develop and trial business, investment and governance models, essential for the true aggregation and replication (through collaboration) of smart city solutions in cities of different sizes and maturities. In doing this, we intend to accelerate the pace by which we make transformative improvements, and enhance sustainability in communities. \n4) Share and collaborate for society: to respond to increasing demand for participation; to enhance mechanisms for citizens\u2019 engagement; to improve local governments capacity for policy making and service delivery through collaboration and co-design; resulting in outcomes that are better for citizens, businesses and visitors.
