This analysis will also be used to update the literature of green technology based on updating previous papers.\nThe technology being developed is divided into three work packages based on chemical catalysis and synthetic methods, biocatalysis and synthetic biology. The first effort will investigate the use of a range of catalysts with a main focus on replacing and applying catalysts based on common metals rather than the precious metal based catalysts that have limitations of sustainable supply. Use of continuous reactors and process intensification will also be addressed as well as fluorination chemistry. In biocatalysis a range of projects based on the needs identified by the chemical round table have been chosen including amide synthesis, stereo- and regio-specific hydroxylation of complex molecules as well as other redox reactions.

The European Union is the largest market player, contributing about 20 percent to the total fresh fruit and vegetable trade. Despite extensive production, pest infestation (i.e. all forms of insects) is a major problem in post-harvest processing, including in storage, packing and transportation of agricultural commodities. The quality of stored produce decreases rapidly due to pest infestation with cost implications for producers and dealers who cannot increase the time-to-market of their products. Pesticides in the form of fumigants are widely used during post-harvesting and are particularly suitable for killing pests, as on-field fumigation usually cannot guarantee absolute disinfestation. Pests can develop resistance to pesticides and often survive in the form of eggs or larvae. Furthermore, rain can easily attenuate the effects of fumigants. Despite the fact that fumigants help to control infestations, maintain the appealing appearance of produce longer and maximize storage time, increasing regulations on pesticide use and consumer selectivity of the foods they eat are creating a competitive threat to SME profit margins.
