Obesity is largely determined by modifiable lifestyle dependent risk factors such as reduced physical activity, sedentary behaviour and an unhealthy diet. There is growing evidence that influences on individuals and their lifestyle should not only be addressed in single-level interventions that focus on a distinct individual, social or environmental aspect, but rather in community based multi-level intervention approaches (MIAs) that integrate individual, community, organisational, and societal systems.\nOBJECTIVES\nSPOTLIGHT aims to increase and combine knowledge on the wide range of determinants of obesity in a systematic way, and to identify MIAs that are strong in terms of Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM). A further aim is to identify factors for successful implementation of MIAs into health promotion practice.\nAPPROACH\nBy combining published research and collected cross-European data with expert and target-group perspectives, effective, sustainable and implementable MIAs that counteract obesogenic behaviours in adults will be defined.\nACHIEVEMENTS\nWe will provide an evidence-based model for effective MIAs in health promotion practice applicable across Europe, and disseminate our findings by policy makers and the scientific community.

One important target group for obesity prevention is school-aged children.\u00a0As such, the school environment is a good setting for health promotion interventions.

A review of the relevant literature revealed a number of pertinent points. In particular, parents' physical activities, doing physical activities with parents and parental logistic support are the most important predictors of physical activity in children.\n\nA cross-European large-scale survey was carried out among more than 1\u00a0000 children aged 10\u201312 in seven European countries \u2014 Belgium, Greece, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia and Spain. The surveys included the measurement of children's height and weight, and questions about a range of energy balance-related behaviours, including key dietary behaviours, physical activity and sedentary lifestyle.\n\nResults showed high levels of obesity and overweight among Europe's children, with nearly 1 in 20 children obese and a further four in 20 overweight (averaged across all seven countries surveyed). Lowest levels were found in Norway where only 1 child in 70 is obese, and highest levels where 1 child in 10 is obese were found in Greece, where children have the lowest levels of sports activities.\n\nSocial differences were also found to play an important role. Generally, children of more highly educated parents tend to engage in more favourable energy balance-related behaviours, and also tend to be slimmer, except in Greece and Spain.\n\nFurther data analysis revealed that obesogenic behaviours are associated with a range of important potential determinants, at the individual, home and school environment levels. In particular, the impact of parents, as role models, facilitators, by setting rules and boundaries, and specific parenting behaviours are of crucial importance. Interventions to effect changes in behaviour need to be sensitive to these differences.
