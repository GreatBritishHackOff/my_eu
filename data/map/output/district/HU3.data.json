As an alternative to chemoterapy, target therapy with gefitinib (epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) has been used in clinical practice in patients with tumours harbouring mutations in EGFR gene, improving their treatment effectiveness. For that reason EGFR mutations analysis should be perform to support the treatment decision for a patient with NSCLC. Despite all the foreseen benefits of EGFR genotyping, the current PCR-based methods used have been shown some associated bottlenecks: i) use of complex samples (tumour biopsy embedded in Formalin Fixed Paraffin, FFPE), ii) require a better understanding from the clinical geneticist to accurately interpret the information provided and to setup the best line of therapy and treatment and iii) the assays are quite expensive and time-consuming. New age diagnostic tools, such as microfluidic platforms and nanodiagnostics are emerging technologies for DNA analysis requiring lower sample volumes and providing comparable sensitivity and specificity at lower costs. Nonetheless, sample preparation and detection of the result of a chemical analysis on-chip are still weak points in many lab-on-a-chip devices. The current proposal, aiming the integration of \u201call laboratory-based process steps\u201d in one single step, is both challenging and feasible: development of a microfluidic chip that combines blood sample processing (DNA extraction/purification, multiplex amplification) and detection of EGFR mutations in tumour DNA by means of gold and silver-nanoparticles (Ag and Au-nanoprobes). Furthermore a microfluidic chip analyser with an integrated user-friendly software to report genotyping results will be developed.", 7968.0, 1221845.0, "LungCARD", "A novel genotyping test for non-small cell lung carcinoma", "New-generation diagnostic tools utilise microfluidic chips and nanotechnology to analyse DNA from blood samples. An innovative blood assay harnessing these technologies is being developed for genotyping lung cancer patients.", "Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in Europe, with an incidence of nearly 18\u00a0% among new cancer cases. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. Standard therapy entails administration of chemotherapeutic agents, but not all NSCLC cases respond.\n\nAs an alternative to chemotherapy, targeted inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is used in patients with mutations in the EGFR gene. These mutations cause a constant activation of the receptor, thereby leading to uncontrolled downstream signalling and cell division. For this purpose, prompt analysis of EGFR mutations in exons 18\u201321 in the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor is a prerequisite for initiating therapy in NSCLC patients.\n\nCurrent polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods necessitate biopsy samples and are sometimes inconclusive due to the poor quality of the isolated DNA. As an alternative to tumour-based assays, scientists on the EU-funded http://www.lungcard.eu/ (LUNGCARD) project propose a blood-based test for genotyping the EGFR gene. The test will be performed as an automated process that contains a microfluidic chip and a bio-analyser.\n\nThe system is designed to process blood and perform EGFR genotyping in one single step. Circulating tumour cells are captured from blood, DNA is extracted and amplified. Subsequently hybridised with gold nanoprobes for mutations encountered in exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene. The light emitted from the probe hybridising to the DNA is detected by an optical reader.\n\nDuring the first period of the project, partners have finalised the design, technical requirements and materials that will be used to generate the LUNGCARD device. In the next phase, they will optimise the tumour cells captured and PCR amplification part to attain maximum sensitivity and speed.\n\nThe minimally invasive nature of the LUNGCARD assay, alongside its low cost, makes it ideal for diagnostic purposes. In the long run, the same device could be used to detect other mutations implicated in various diseases.", "http://www.lungcard.eu/", "http://www.hey.nhs.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/149886.jpg", "fp7_106884_956024241"], ["2BN", "Smart wearable and autonomous negative pressure device for wound monitoring and therapy", "Smith & Nephew Medical Limited", "SWAN-iCARE is an ambitious project aiming at developing an integrated autonomous device for the monitoring and the personalized management of chronic wounds, mainly diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers.

This has been ongoing over the past 10-15 years, at a time of major European innovations in player development and coaching delivery. This ignorance of advanced European methodology has hindered skills acquisition among our young apprentice players, relative to European player development on an age-matched basis.\r\n\r\nThis project will allow a group of 36 Hull Tigers apprentices (aged from 16 to19 years of age) to gain experience of the training methods at an acknowledged (UEFA) Centre of Excellence in Austria. The Austrian host partner is a regional training and coaching complex used by Austrian and European professional teams which are applauded as having world class records in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.  Innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and player development. Improved success rates for apprentices in being admitted to the professional ranks of UK clubs are anticipated, while improved academic attainment and European exposure will improve employability in secondary careers. \r\n\r\nConsequently this project will prioritise the following specific objectives :\r\n1. Improved physiological development of participants via the implementation of innovative training regimes as a direct result of structured Erasmus+ mobility programme.\r\n2. Skills and technology transfer between the Academy mobility apprentices and players in Europe.\r\n3. Improved employment rates for mobility participants in professional football careers.\r\n4. Improved linguistic skills for participants and an awareness of the cultural diversity within another European country.\r\n5. Increased maturity and sense of initiative.\r\n6. Increased self-empowerment and self-esteem.\r\n7. Enhanced intercultural awareness.\r\n8. More active participation in work and social environments.\r\n9. Enhancement of soft skills.\r\n10. Increased motivation both on and off the field.\r\n\r\nOur host partner, Obertraun, was chosen on the basis of them being an acknowledged European Centres of Excellence and can demonstrate clear evidence of a mobility support structure for prospective participants.
