As an alternative to chemoterapy, target therapy with gefitinib (epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) has been used in clinical practice in patients with tumours harbouring mutations in EGFR gene, improving their treatment effectiveness. For that reason EGFR mutations analysis should be perform to support the treatment decision for a patient with NSCLC. Despite all the foreseen benefits of EGFR genotyping, the current PCR-based methods used have been shown some associated bottlenecks: i) use of complex samples (tumour biopsy embedded in Formalin Fixed Paraffin, FFPE), ii) require a better understanding from the clinical geneticist to accurately interpret the information provided and to setup the best line of therapy and treatment and iii) the assays are quite expensive and time-consuming. New age diagnostic tools, such as microfluidic platforms and nanodiagnostics are emerging technologies for DNA analysis requiring lower sample volumes and providing comparable sensitivity and specificity at lower costs. Nonetheless, sample preparation and detection of the result of a chemical analysis on-chip are still weak points in many lab-on-a-chip devices. The current proposal, aiming the integration of \u201call laboratory-based process steps\u201d in one single step, is both challenging and feasible: development of a microfluidic chip that combines blood sample processing (DNA extraction/purification, multiplex amplification) and detection of EGFR mutations in tumour DNA by means of gold and silver-nanoparticles (Ag and Au-nanoprobes). Furthermore a microfluidic chip analyser with an integrated user-friendly software to report genotyping results will be developed.", 7968.0, 1221845.0, "LungCARD", "A novel genotyping test for non-small cell lung carcinoma", "New-generation diagnostic tools utilise microfluidic chips and nanotechnology to analyse DNA from blood samples. An innovative blood assay harnessing these technologies is being developed for genotyping lung cancer patients.", "Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in Europe, with an incidence of nearly 18\u00a0% among new cancer cases. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. Standard therapy entails administration of chemotherapeutic agents, but not all NSCLC cases respond.\n\nAs an alternative to chemotherapy, targeted inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is used in patients with mutations in the EGFR gene. These mutations cause a constant activation of the receptor, thereby leading to uncontrolled downstream signalling and cell division. For this purpose, prompt analysis of EGFR mutations in exons 18\u201321 in the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor is a prerequisite for initiating therapy in NSCLC patients.\n\nCurrent polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods necessitate biopsy samples and are sometimes inconclusive due to the poor quality of the isolated DNA. As an alternative to tumour-based assays, scientists on the EU-funded http://www.lungcard.eu/ (LUNGCARD) project propose a blood-based test for genotyping the EGFR gene. The test will be performed as an automated process that contains a microfluidic chip and a bio-analyser.\n\nThe system is designed to process blood and perform EGFR genotyping in one single step. Circulating tumour cells are captured from blood, DNA is extracted and amplified. Subsequently hybridised with gold nanoprobes for mutations encountered in exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene. The light emitted from the probe hybridising to the DNA is detected by an optical reader.\n\nDuring the first period of the project, partners have finalised the design, technical requirements and materials that will be used to generate the LUNGCARD device. In the next phase, they will optimise the tumour cells captured and PCR amplification part to attain maximum sensitivity and speed.\n\nThe minimally invasive nature of the LUNGCARD assay, alongside its low cost, makes it ideal for diagnostic purposes. In the long run, the same device could be used to detect other mutations implicated in various diseases.", "http://www.lungcard.eu/", "http://www.hey.nhs.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/149886.jpg", "fp7_106884_956024241"], ["2BN", "Smart wearable and autonomous negative pressure device for wound monitoring and therapy", "Smith & Nephew Medical Limited", "SWAN-iCARE is an ambitious project aiming at developing an integrated autonomous device for the monitoring and the personalized management of chronic wounds, mainly diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers.
