As a result, a specialist French tutor was appointed from September 2014 to develop and deliver the French curriculum to Key Stage 2. Years 3 to 6 have been learning French since 2014 for half an hour sessions per week. It is our aim to further expand the French curriculum to Years 1 to 6 from September 2018.\r\n  Currently, these lessons are supported by non-language specialist Teaching Assistants with limited knowledge of the both the language and current language-learning methodology. They are not able to confidently consolidate and extend pupils learning with any follow-up activities. With the time constraints of only one French specialist teacher, French is also limited to Key Stage 2. As the school continues to expand to a 3 form entry school over the next 4 years, this limitation will become even more apparent and there will be a deficit in staff capacity to teach French.\r\n  Our objective is to upskill tour eachers and teaching assistants to support the delivery of the French curriculum across the school. From September 2017, we will extend the curriculum to cover KS1 classes and our 2 year project is focused on  staff undertaking training  in France to support this. We have identified 5 staff members to participate in this project based on factors including individual  linguistic skills, motivation to develop their skills, their role within the school and in the expansion of the languages provision to meet increased pupil numbers. The MFL coordinator had a crucial role in this selection process with the oversight of  senior leaders.\r\n  The participating teachers will carry out 2 mobilities--one each year. The mobilities will be a one week long French language immersion course, incorporating pure language and language methodology. The chosen language school is a certified centre in Antibes, France known to our borough Language Adviser for its excellent reputation.   \r\n   Daily lessons in French targeted to learners\u2019 ability levels will also offer the opportunity to develop knowledge of the region and local customs. Participating staff will attend preparatory twilight French lessons, delivered by the French specialist/borough Advisory Teacher in advance of the course.\r\n   Each participant will be responsible for ensuring that follow-up activities are timetabled to allow pupils to consolidate their learning.  TAs will be expected to take responsibility for managing resources and familiarizing themselves with the key resource (song, game, interactive task) so that all staff are equipped to follow up during the week. \r\n  The school MFL coordinator will attend a training course in October 2017 to enable her to set up an etwinning profile, find a partner school in France  with whom to work on a project beginning January 2018.\r\n  We expect the impact of the project to  be evident through the changes to our  French curriculum and improved pupil outcomes. For the annual governor's review, the MFL coordinator will be required to demonstrate how effective the project has been in achieving its objectives and we expect our school to be much better at delivering French as a result and to have developed a more international dimension across the school.", "http://www.olga.towerhamlets.sch.uk/", "Olga Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036325_coordinator"], ["4HL", "Community Sports Coaching Mobility Project 2017", "Community Sports Coaching and Development", 161264.0, "CONTEXT\r\nThe primary rationale for the Community Sports Coaching Mobility (CSCM) Project is to support VET learners who are undertaking sports coaching qualifications within a community context by providing access to work experience \u2018mobilities\u2019 based in Spain. The project is based around the partnerships between Community Sports Coaching and Development and two community sports organisations based in Spain - Squared Circle S.L. (C\u00edrculo al Cuadrado) based in the \u00celes Bal\u00e9ares region and World Player Internacional in Andalucia.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nThe key objectives of the CSCM 2017 Project are to provide vocational and career development benefits for the participants, including:\r\n \u2022 Enhanced awareness and understanding of the role of sports coaches in youth and community settings\r\n \u2022 Development of specialist knowledge and practical skills\r\n \u2022 Improved employability and workplace skills\r\n \u2022 Development of vocational, personal, intercultural and linguistic skills\r\n \u2022 Progression into employment and/or further study within the sports and leisure sector\r\n\r\nThe project will provide options of either 2-week or 8-week mobilities to Spain incorporating different types of work experience for learners according to their individual learning needs and professional development aspirations. We will provide a total of 60 x 4-week mobilities and 12 x 8 week mobilities, which will all incorporate work placements for participants who are making progress towards a good level of knowledge and understanding of their vocational area but who either lack practical experience or are looking to develop the breadth and depth of their technical expertise.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\nParticipants will be VET learners working towards the working towards the City & Guilds Award in Sports Coaching at either Level 2 or Level 3.  They will also have demonstrated a long-term commitment to participating in sports activities and the majority will have experience of volunteering at sports clubs and/or as sports coaches in the UK.  They will be typically young people aged 19-23 who have gained some volunteering or work experience within their local communities and wish to undertake a qualification to further develop and formally recognise their skills.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\nProject methodologies focus on supporting learners to develop experience-acquired skills for their vocational area and learn by working alongside established professionals in their chosen field.  The main activities undertaken by participants during their mobilities will be their work experience programme of sports coaching and related activities, such as help to organise and deliver community sports events, that will form the basis of their mobility placements.  This will be complemented by a programme of preparation, orientation and induction activities, ongoing language support and social and cultural activities.  \r\n\r\nECVET\r\nThe CSCM 2017 project will also incorporate ECVET elements, with participants being able to undertake assessment for their Award in Sports Coaching course via practical observations of coaching sessions organised and delivered during their mobility work experience placements.  Areas where participants will be required to demonstrate their skills and knowledge will include: Safe and Equitable Coaching Practice; Fundamentals of Coaching Programmes; and Supporting Athlete Lifestyles through Coaching Programmes.\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\nThe project will provide significant beneficial impacts for the participants in terms of labour market integration and career development. For participants undertaking 8-week mobilities, we expect at least 67% of participants (8 out of 12) to move into sustainable employment in their chosen field after completing their Mobility Placement, with a further 17% (2 out of 12) progressing onto further learning. Participants undertaking 2-week mobilities will be from a younger target group with higher level needs and thus their primary target outcome will be progression to further learning and we expect at least 60% (36 out of 60) to achieve this outcome after completing their Mobility Placement, with a further 20% (12 out of 60) progressing into employment.\r\n\r\nThe project will also help to build the capacity of partners to participate in transnational activities and European projects in general and the Erasmus Plus programme in particular.  \r\n\r\nOver the medium to long term, evaluation and dissemination activities offer potential to engage with VET providers and enterprises within sports and leisure sector more widely across the EU and thus inform developments in VET provision at local, national and European levels.", "http://www.communitysports.org.uk", "Community Sports Coaching and Development", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-035849_coordinator"], ["5QS", "Work based learning in Europe for more and better jobs and a fair and open society", "IT System Design Limited", 149071.0, "Considering the labour market\u2019s functional changes and its modernization, as well as the very high youth unemployment rate (more tan 50%) and the dropout rate among VET students without any professional qualification, educational systems are clearly facing the challenge of improving student\u2019s professional improvement, incrementing their participation as active citizens in the society, and their employability inside and outside the European labour market.\r\nThe project aims at providing VET students with the chance to deepen and improve the quality of their training, by carrying out internships in European companies, and getting in contact with European labour market. \r\nThe close cooperation among the VET Schools that are members of the consortium, set the basis for the development of this project.\r\nThe consortium is composed by 9 VET schools of the Valencian Region, coordinated by the IES Ram\u00f3n Esteve.\r\nThe consortium VET schools need to establish European quality networks with companies and other educational centres throughout Europe, in order to stay update on innovations, to share good practices and to get informed on European policies, improving the quality of the provided teaching and trainings, thus fighting youth unemployment. \r\nThe project is addressed to former students and students who are attending the 2nd course of school-based intermediate VET programme in Computer Science and Communication, and Administration, or to former students just graduated, i.e. technicians in the above mentioned professional sectors. \r\nThe project foresees the participation of 72 VET students, distributed in 8 flow: 4 to Italy, 1 to Portugal, 1 to Latvia and 2 to United Kingdom. Each centre will select 2 former students (technicians) and 6 students.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that relations with the European partners fostered reciprocity, as all the participating transnational centres has also submitted a mobility project in which Spanish consortium will receive their students. The reciprocity will enhance the promotion of the European active citizenship.\r\nThe 1 year project will last from the 1st of July 2017 to the 30th of June 2018. The internship will be carried out from the 15th of March to the  30th of May 2018.  \r\nThe following activities will be structured in 5 phases:\r\nE1- Activities for communicating and spreading information to promote the students\u2019 participation, planning tasks (including participants\u2019 selection), establishing Learning Agreements, reviewing of ECVET documents, logistics and organization (insurance, lights and accommodation), determining contract-related issues, selecting hosting companies, tutors and accompanying teachers, setting up a common dissemination plan.\r\nE2-Preparation of the mobilities. Information Meeting, signing contracts, linguistic, cultural and professional preparation, OLS registration for students.\r\nE3- Implementation of mobilities. Follow-up, evaluation and certification of participants. Competences will be determined in the Learning Agreement and will be evaluated, using the ECVET instruments and will be certifies by Europass. \r\nE4- Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the overall project\u2019s results.\r\nE5- Dissemination. The dissemination activities will be carried out throughout the project\u2019s duration. An extraordinary staff meeting will be held in all the consortium centres. A Final Conference will be also organized.\r\nIn addition to the impact on the participants, the project will also benefit all the partners, by fostering  European cooperation and the relationships between companies and educational centres. \r\nBoth dissemination activities and the mobility experience itself will produce an impact at local, regional and national level. \r\nOther local, regional and national entities will be able to to benefit from the project\u2019s results (even though they are not partners of the project):\r\n- Creation of a quality network that include educational centres and companies\r\n- Decrease in youth unemployment rate\r\n- Improvement of youth qualifications\r\n- Increase in VET enrolment \r\n- Creation of new collaborative networks at regional level\r\n- Widening the possibility of internationalization for other centres, and their chance to be part to other European projects\r\n- Better knowledge of the Erasmus+ programme and EU values (tolerance, equity, equality and inclusion).\r\n- Fostering the sense of European active citizenship and respect of other cultures\r\n- Possibility to create new companies and new business models \r\n- Promotion of social inclusion\r\nThe project is in accordance with the Strategy 2020, the New Skills Agenda for Europe 2016 and the Erasmus+ objectives, improving the professional development of the students, their participation as active citizens in society and and their employability inside and outside the European Labour market", "http://www.itsdes.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037021_15"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2DA", "THE LANGUAGES COMPANY LIMITED", 56721.0, "Erasmus+ \u2014 Contribution from the development cooperation instrument (DCI) (21.02.20)", "fts_2017_26653", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "E3"}
