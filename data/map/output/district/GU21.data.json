In addition tools will need to be developed to inform decision makers about the economic and environmental consequences of different intervention options being considered.\nMAINLINE proposes to address all these issues through a series of linked work packages that will target at least \u20ac300m per year savings across Europe with a reduced environmental footprint in terms of embodied carbon and other environmental benefits. It will:\n- Apply new technologies to extend the life of elderly infrastructure\n- Improve degradation and structural models to develop more realistic life cycle cost and safety models\n- Investigate new construction methods for the replacement of obsolete infrastructure\n- Investigate monitoring techniques to complement or replace existing examination techniques\n- Develop management tools to assess whole life environmental and economic impact.\nThe consortium includes leading railways, contractors, consultants and researchers from across Europe, including from both Eastern Europe and the emerging economies.

At the same time, it is the young generation who will have to address and adapt to the unfolding consequences in the future. To empower these youngsters and facilitate a mental shift in their lives we count on a tool that has always been there for us, though in recent times we have relied less and less on it: we are talking about nature. Our connection with nature plays a major role in the quest of getting closer to our inner being, to our core. In order to create a positive change in our lifestyle without losing quality of life, we intend to bring participants back to their essence of who they really are, diving into their personal and inner life;  nature will be a part of this journey.\r\n\r\nThe target group of this training course are 24 youth workers, project leaders or educators, including anyone who is actively involved in youth work. With this training course we create a space for personal development in connection with nature through reflection on our concerns and passions as well as becoming more conscious of our personal learning process. We believe that gaining a deeper understanding of who we are and what we can do for others is an empowering process which can lead to positive changes for the future of society. Moreover it is necessary that youth workers know how they can support young people in facing their own challenges and thereby continue to grow as a person. After the training, participants are expected to adopt a multiplier role: they will lead young people in their home organisations and communities through a personal learning journey to craft and find powerful and meaningful responses to the challenges of the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThe objectives are:\r\n- To raise awareness of our identity through reflecting on our challenges, concerns, talents and passions.\r\n- To stimulate the creativity, vulnerability, confidence and resilience of the participants.\r\n- To explore alternative ways of living, in particular the exchange with nature, which gives us a new quality of life.\r\n- To develop a different Mindset, based on the values: mind, heart, body and environment, which serves us in our future.\r\n- To encourage and serve the participants in planning their learning process also after the training course and also implement with their own target groups: young persons in their organization and community.\r\n- To learn more about the Erasmus+ program and its actions, and Youth Pass as a tool of recognition of the key competences.\r\n\r\nThis training course will be based on non-formal and informal education with a self-directed learning approach. That means that the participants are responsible for their own learning and the facilitators provide activities and guide the participants through their own learning process. The training course will be characterised by highly participatory, interactive and experiential methods. The activities will include case studies, working in pairs and small groups, meditations, contemplations, team building activities, role plays (Theatre of Oppressed), outdoor education, discussions, and self-assessment. Some sessions will be completed by theoretical inputs and all of them will be followed by group reflection or self-reflection.\r\n\r\nThe main direct dissemination will be a good action from every participants after he/she returned back home and put the things he/she learned in practise. The participant can enrich their environment, in particular their organisation, because these \u2018good actions\u2019 will be inspired by the needs which were mentioned by the partners before the application of the project. The good actions are one of the evaluation tools and will be a part of the final report. \r\n\r\nAlready during the project the evaluation process will play an essential role in the learning process. Participants will meet everyday to discuss the progress of learning as well as group integration and group dynamics. There will also be a final evaluation of the project during the last day of training: besides a visible evaluation the participants will be asked to fill the questionnaire and evaluate the project, content, methods and trainers. The project will also be spread by publications, Facebook and other European networks.", "http://www.wpifoundation.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DK01-KA105-033978_4"], ["2AZ", "Bring Heroes to Life", "World Peace Initiative Ltd", 13659.0, "Based on the EU Youth Report (2015) the current generation of youth is the best educated ever as one third of Europeans has a tertiary education degree and 82% of them completed upper secondary school. There are promising numbers as well showing that youth has been engaged in social and civic life too, 1 in 4 youth has been a volunteer and 50% of youth are active in organization, club or association.\r\nDespite of all these numbers showing the POTENTIAL that youth has yet REALITY shows that 13,7 millions of youth (under 30 years) remain out of employment, education or training. This shows a significant contradiction between the POTENTIAL what youth has and the REALITY as there is block, obstacles between realizing the potential and put into practice. \r\n\r\nYouth work put lot of focus on developing the competences and the capacities of young people (POTENTIAL). European Commission invests in youth\u2019 education (formal, non-formal and informal learning), offering dozens of programs to increase their mobility and support their employment. Above all, the new need arises that all these potential must be put into REALITY. Why? As the POTENTIAL is still yet to arise, still yet to be brought to LIFE. There are competent youth (=HERO) and we need to start implementing the potential into life, to put competences into practice. It is time to support youth in order to \u201cBRING HEROES TO LIFE\u201d.\r\n\r\nIn order to support youth to become the heroes of their lives, youth worker's\u2019 role is unquestionable. As described by the EC \u201cYouth work develops the life management and social skills of young people which assists their transition to the labour market\u201d.  We know that youth work does not only support young people in entering labour market, but also in achieving personal development and social change! In an attempt to move from the place of competences/potential to the place of practice,2 steps need to be done:\r\n\r\n1. To support youth to find and bring the hero realizes the competences they have and find ways to put them into practice (bring to life), to apply them in real life for their personal and professional development.\r\n2. Provide a direction for youth to find a purpose in life that will lead them and through which they can apply the competences to have a meaning and significance. Embracing a purpose in life is a very important element, since without that the competences cannot be truly applied.  Youth need to dare to dream, to envision themselves and the society in the future and strive to achieve it by practicing their competences.\r\n\r\nIn this context, the project \u201cBRING HEROES TO LIFE\u201d has been developed. The aims of the project is to enhance the competences of the youth workers to support better youth people to cultivate their competences purposefully for personal, professional and social growth.\r\n\r\nThere will be 25 youth workers coming from 12 European countries.\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n*1. To increase the knowledge of 25 youth workers related to the\r\ntransferability of non-formal and informal learning acquisitions into\r\ncompetences;*\r\n*2. To increase the understanding level of 25 youth workers of why a\r\npurpose in life is significant for young people;*\r\n*3. To develop the skills of 25 youth workers in supporting the young\r\npeople applying their competences in a purposeful way; *\r\n*4. To increase the motivation of 25 youth workers in conducting young\r\npeople to use their competences (professionally and personally);*\r\n*5. To create a professional follow-up plan in order for the 25 youth\r\nworkers to use it with the young people they work with\r\n\r\nThe venue of the training course is Hajdunanas, Hungary. The 25 youth workers will come from 12 countries (Hungary, Italy, Romania, Slovakia, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Austria, Denmark, Turkey, Greece, UK). It will take place between 8th - 14th of May 2018. \r\nThe training will be based on the elements of experiential learning, self-directed learning and non-formal education (NFE). \r\n\r\nThe project will include these results: \r\n- increased competences of the youth workers directly involved in the project;\r\n- articles outlining the importance of transferring the competences into practice and the purpose in life. \r\n- video with information and key elements of the project; \r\n\r\nPartners will conduct a workshop in their local community focusing on youth with fewer opportunities and partners will organize knowledge transfer meetings in order to share all gained knowledge in their local reality. The dissemination activities will create a great impact by enhancing their capacities on European level. \r\nThe biggest beneficiaries of the project will be  youth from the local communities of all partners who will be able to realize the hero within themselves, develop their competences and put them in practice for achieving a personal, professional and social development.", "http://www.wpifoundation.org", null, "erasmus_2017-3-HU01-KA105-046895_2"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["7SA", "EPIBIOSAFE LTD", 48415.0, "Strengthening European research infrastructures, including e-infrastructures (08.02.01.03)", "fts_2017_2152", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "GU21"}
