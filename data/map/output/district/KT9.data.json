This surface is envisaged to be capable of redistributing the pressure, strain and shear applied on the skin. A controller and an algorithm optimizes the load-time curve as pre-specified by the pressure-duration threshold curve, thus protecting the tissues against prolonged and excessive epidermal pressure-shear. This will in turn prevent the onset or deterioration of pressure ulcers. Diagnosis and prevention will rely on intelligent optical fiber sensing devices that can identify the values and coordinates of excessive epidermal loadings and will provide feedback information to an adaptable mattress or seat mechanism. This adaptable mechanism comprises of self-shaping elements and is responsible for relieving pressure and strain in a timely manner according to the information received by the sensing modules. To this end, IASiS intends to develop optical fiber-based two-dimensional pressure/strain/shear sensing elements and demonstrate their performance for the first on rehabilitation applications. It will also integrate the intelligent fiber-based sensing surface with the adaptable surface mechanism, and finally IASiS will evaluate the performance of the developed Intelligent Adaptable Surface through extensive Laboratory as well as Clinical Trials.", 8677.0, 1297184.0, "IASIS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.fujikura.co.uk", null, "fp7_107646_997666244"], ["2NY", "Novel nanotechnology-enabled system for endovascular in vivo near-infrared fluorescence molecular imaging and endovascular near-infrared targeted photodynamic therapy of atherosclerotic heart disease", "Fujikura Europe Ltd", "CosmoPHOS-nano is a multidisciplinary, translational and business-oriented project, aiming to accomplish the following objectives:\n1) develop the CosmoPHOS system, which is a novel theranostic (diagnostic & therapeutic) nanotechnology-enabled portable combination system enabling endovascular in vivo near-infrared fluorescence molecular imaging, endovascular near-infrared targeted photodynamic therapy, real-time & follow-up therapy monitoring of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD),\n2) nonclinically evaluate this system,\n3) clinically validate the system after regulatory approval, &\n4) reduce in the long-term CAD deaths and morbidity by up to 40%, resulting in a significant decrease of the European and global healthcare costs for CAD, increasing the income of the European healthcare industry from CAD market which is the global largest. The CosmoPHOS-nano consortium has a five year history of successful collaboration between the industrial and academic partners, and its funding would underpin a team devoted to delivering a novel powerful & affordable healthcare solution against the leading cause of death, without the need for heavy and expensive medical equipment.\nThe CosmoPHOS system consists of two interacting components:\na) targeted theranostic near-infrared photoactivatable biocompatible nanomedicines, and\nb) medical devices.\nAfter systemic administration, the nanomedicines targeted accumulate in coronary atherosclerotic plaques, followed by endocoronary photoactivation and detection by the medical devices, enabling molecular imaging, targeted therapy, real-time & follow-up therapy monitoring of CAD. Preliminary in vitro & in vivo successful experimental results, as well as parts of the CosmoPHOS system are already available from the prior five year collaboration.\nThe project plan includes: A) nonclinical R&D (30 months); B) nonclinical validation & regulatory approval (18 months); C) first-in-man phase-I clinical trial in 20 CAD patients (12 months).", 61165.0, 10511666.0, "COSMOPHOS-NANO", null, null, null, "http://www.cosmophos-nano.eu/", "http://www.fujikura.co.uk", null, "fp7_106917_997666244"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2NY", "LONDON WALL INSTALLATIONS LIMITED*", 329.0, "Buildings and related expenditure \u2014 Commission Representations (16.01.03.03)", "fts_2016_72812", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "KT9"}
