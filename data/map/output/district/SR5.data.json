Dried food offers many advantages for the mass production of commercially prepared goods, not least cheaper transportation costs, longer storage life and ease of use. However modern drying methods, such as Accelerated Freeze-Drying, prove costly, time consuming, labour and energy intensive, limitations which can prove more crippling for SMEs. There is a need to provide EU dried food SMEs with a technology which will help to remain competitive in the EU and global dried food sectors. Preliminary research conducted to date suggests that the application of high power ultrasound (HPU) for the dehydration of porous materials may be very effective in processes in which heat-sensitive materials such as foodstuff have to be treated. HPU is a powerful technology that is safe and environmentally friendly, efficient and economical. High-intensity ultrasonic vibrations are capable of affecting mass transfer processes with the result of increasing the drying rate of materials, thereby permitting the use of lower temperatures or shorter treatment times.  This process thus shows promise for assisting the dehydration of fruits, vegetables and other foods, preserving the quality attributes of the food products and during this project a HPU based pre-treatment method will be developed. A prototype will be built and tested prior to conventional drying processes to improve the added value of the dried product and enable faster, more cost effective and energy efficient drying of food, which will empower and equip SMEs from the European dried food industry to compete against the growing threat of global competition and large multinationals. It will also result in increased sales of high powered ultrasound components and equipment.

Products such as garlic, ginger, spring onions and shrimps are cellular tissues containing gas-filled pores that tend to collapse when subjected to dehydration. This collapse is more noticeable with prolonged exposure to elevated drying temperatures, such as those used in convective drying. For this reason, hot air drying results in substantial degradation in quality attributes such as colour, nutrients and flavour, sever shrinkage also reduces bulk density and dehydration capacity. Also, chemical changes causing loss of flavour and nutrients occur during convective drying so the properties of dehydrated products are poor. A number of drying techniques have been developed over the years, among them atmospheric forced-air dehydration, a very common method. The major disadvantage of the hot air convective drying of food is the low energy efficiency and lengthy drying time during the falling rate period.\n\nMILD-DRY will build on the positive results of laboratory trails using microwave-assisted vacuum drying (MAVD) for the successful dehydration of selected foods, whereby the drying time for carrots for example was reduced to 2 h compared with 4.5-8.5 h in convectional hot air drying. Moreover, dried carrots showed higher rehydration potential, higher beta-carotene and vitamin C contents, lower density, and softer texture than those prepared by air drying.

In recent years, research on cumulative risks, exposure, and long-term effects has raised awareness for the control of such health risks.
