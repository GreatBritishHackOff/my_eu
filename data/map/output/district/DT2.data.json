The students will typically be aged between 18-20 years old and are keen to pursue a career in animal management or tourism. They critically need experience to deepen their academic learning for several reasons: to give value and meaning to their academic work; strengthen their CVs; improve employability skills; help them network with potential employers and help them decide on optimal career paths.\r\n\r\nThe students come from 4 partner colleges with which the AWDF enjoys a long standing relationship. The project builds strongly on the shared experience with these colleges over time and incorporates several innovative elements to improve the student experience: evolved preparation especially language preparation; enhanced and innovative selection processes; longitudinal integration with academic curriculum to embed the experience within the academic career of the students and provide for continued experience in Tenerife and elsewhere.  The latter achieved through development of international collaborations particularly in the tourism sector which bring together both college partners and critically their students and organisations in Tenerife in long term promotional activities.\r\n\r\n The work placements provide opportunities for complementary sector-specific training unavailable to students in the UK but readily accessible in Tenerife.  The roles include working as research guides on whale watching boats, giving talks to tourists on nature and cultural activities in Tenerife, working at the Visitor Centre in Puerto Colon, with animal rescue centres and shelters, liaising with tour operators and hotel groups, developing contacts with specialist culture, nature and activity tourism providers on a local level and supporting them in accessing the global tourist market, both in Tenerife and through the internet.\r\n\r\nStudents receive comprehensive pre-departure training in the UK and in-country orientation on arrival in Tenerife and receive pastoral support throughout the mobility to ensure success. \r\n\r\nSignificantly, the students will gain relevant subject-specific knowledge and practical experience that is directly relevant to their formal programmes of study and have exposure to alternative work environments and processes that are unavailable to them in the UK.  \r\n\r\nMany of the students come from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds and generally opportunities for them to gain work experience that provides a broader perspective of the wider world and employment possibilities beyond their immediate region are limited.  The project will add value to their college programmes and aims to support students to broaden their horizons: personally and professionally. \r\n\r\nScholarship funds, set aside by the AWDF to provide ongoing support to students showing particular ability and or enthusiasm, will be deployed to facilitate continued participation where it is perceived to be of value.\r\n\r\nLonger term benefits of participating in this mobility are that, in addition to obtaining work-based skills and knowledge, students will also benefit from an intercultural experience and personal development that strengthens their position in the labour market and their workplace readiness.    \r\n\r\nParticipants will develop personal and professional confidence, an understanding of the labour market in another European country, a set of transferable skills and an international outlook that better prepares them for employment, giving them a competitive edge when seeking employment.   \r\n\r\nThey will also be able to self-accredit on a special qualification for the European labour market, \u2018TransCSR\u2019, which recognises corporate social responsibility within the tourism industry. Additionally, participation will provide two UCAS point for university applicants.\r\n\r\nThrough participation in the mobility project, colleges will have the opportunity to develop longterm relationships with host organisations in Spain, with whom they can work to develop closer ties and possibly expand the fields in which mobility opportunities are offered. From a college perspective also, the programme will enhance their course offerings making them more marketable to potential students.\r\n\r\nAt a local and regional level, this provides young people with an enhanced training programme, providing them with experience they could never gain in local work placements, and thereby a better chance of attaining employment in the sector.  It supports drives to reduce youth unemployment and build the confidence and capacity of young people.\r\n\r\nThe anticipated impact for participating host partners is their European networks and international outlook will be developed and strengthened, so they are able to offer similar opportunities to future students and are more engaged and connected to the European labour market.", "http://www.kmc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036106_8"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DT2"}
