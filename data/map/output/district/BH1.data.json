It provides a way to optimise the effectiveness of mental healthcare provision to offenders through a model that fosters innovation and collaborative processes.

These management courses are full-time schooling. Sometimes also graduates of dual system qualifications who don\u2019t find any employment after their graduation take part in this project. For example social insurance clerks, IT clerks, office clerks, bank clerks, retail clerks, notary clerks and clerks in public administration. Besides the students and graduates of the mentioned professions the target group also consists of the teaching staff of Friedrich-List-Schule. The different skill enhancements should be realized in this project.\r\nA central target of our project is the better employability on the labour market. This employability however is not given with the majority of the participants before this project. Especially the graduates of full-time schooling courses i.e. graduates of the commercial assistance qualifications have great difficulties in finding a job because they lack work experience, important linguistic and social competences.\r\nThe planned project is suited for the further education demands of the participants and thus enables them to find a job.\r\nOur main target, the good employability of participants on the first labour market is achieved by the acquisition of international competences, foreign language experiences, intercultural knowledge and experiences in the international world of work. Therefore the participants in general do a 26- week internship related with their job in a European destination country.\r\nThey acquire linguistic, intercultural, personal and social skills as well as competences referring to their job without those they would hardly find an adequate job. The requirement of our target group is the further education concerning languages, personality and job specific to increase the employability on the local, national and international labour market. By means of this project the participants achieve a considerable additional value related to their job and personality and after their return it\u2019s a lot easier for them to get a job on the first labour market. \r\nThe Hessian Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs officially authorized the sending organization to make it possible that also graduates from other Hessian vocational colleges which are not in a position to carry out such projects to take part in those projects. To promote the demand for further education above all the mobility of young graduates coming from the structure weak regions in East-North and Mid-Hesse is another vital target of the project since in these regions there are only few jobs available catering for the individual commercial qualifications the students have. \r\nThe students will do a 6-week commercial work placement at the end of their first year of studies in a European target country. The participants will increase their motivation and will start their second year of studies highly enthusiastically.

This guarantees a high comparability and growth of knowledge for the trainees. An existing cooperation with the \u201cNorderpoort-College\u201d facilitates a remarkable success of the project. \r\n\r\nA three-week project with our partnership-connecting vocational college in Kepno (Poland) is suited especially for minor students. The missing maturity of the trainees caused by difficult social life circumstances, leads to the fact that a close and personal support is highly recommended. If young trainees got no chance to acquire in development possibilities like these, the chance of quitting the apprenticeship would provable increase. \r\n\r\nAfter having acquired a previous language course, 20 trainees of the sales-sector will have the opportunity to start a job training within the additional \u201csalesmen for international business activity\u201d qualification.

From the set of data it is evident that the issue of women in the Italian labor market has essentially a territorial connotation.

The trends of which Cooperative Eudaemony gave account add up to a \"structural\" conditions particularly alarming for the South: the size succeed returns the comparison of employment rates of women, before and after the crisis, with the European average.

Unfortunately, only two students grabbed this chance. This project now aims at increasing the number of participants. After intense evaluation of the first project, another project in the form of an internship could be developed, which is more suited to the students of our school. Consequently, there are now 32 participants. In order to reach this goal, the following activities have been conducted:\r\n\r\n\u2022 interviews with students in order to evaluate the previous project\r\n\u2022 development of an internship appropriate for the students \r\n\u2022 intensive information of the students as well as the parents \r\n\u2022 integration of the project into the course design of the school in order to increase its significance\r\n\r\nThe acceptance and extensive integration of the internship abroad is especially important since the requirements for students of the business college Lustenau have changed radically due to changes in the working world, especially in Vorarlberg. While until a few years ago, it was small to medium-sized enterprises that were active mainly at regional level, it is now high-tech companies that act on a global basis. This increased internationality is also illustrated by Vorarlberg\u2019s export quotas and can be seen in the job descriptions and vacancies: Working in international teams, multilingualism and international work experience are increasingly sought-after and ever more important job qualifications.

Other objectives are: getting to know other cultures, getting references for the future and cultivating the relationship between the partner institutions. Work experiences abroad are huge motivating factors for students.\r\nThe partner of the school in the project is English 2000 School of English in Bournemouth. The partner has organised several successful projects in the field of hotel and catering for students of tourism within the framework of Leonardo and Erasmus projects.

The partner hotels are chosen by English 2000 on the basis of pre-agreed principles. Monitoring and mentoring are also provided by our partner institution. Keeping contact with English 2000, as well as with the appointed hotels and the students during the whole work placement period is crucial.\r\n The main phases of the realization of the project: 1. Announcing and presenting the professional practice abroad to the students. 2. Recruiting the students. 3. Preparing the recruited students, providing additional training and help. The students attend language, professional and cultural courses at the school. 4. Organising the placement at different hotels with the help of the partner institution (appointing the hotels where the professional practice will take place, making all the travel and accommodation arrangements, taking out insurance, assigning the accompanying teacher). 5. A one-week language and work preparation course in England at English 2000. 6. A 12-week work experience in hotels mentored and tutored by English 2000. 7. Keeping contact with the partner, the appointed hotels and the students during the whole work placement period. 8.Continuous assessment and disseminating the results of the project. 9. Closing the project, writing the financial and the final report.\r\nBesides the development of professional skills and knowledge, by the end of the project the students will be able to work in a team, their work morale will improve, and an aspiration for accurate work will be formed. Not only will they be more fluent in English, but they will also learn to respect the culture of other nations getting an insight into European culture.

The South Devon College is interested and well-prepared to carry out our international business simulation games with cross-national teams. As we wish to enhance CLIL in lessons a British partner is particularly welcome.\r\nAnother new partner is a Norwegian school in Gjovik \u2013 the Gjovik videregaende skole. Our objective is to run a student project which is supported by the federal state Schleswig-Holstein and the Norwegian region Oppland. Besides this project, we pursue the idea to train our staff  in areas this awarded Norwegian school can assist us with.\r\nThe work placement in business and administration that regularly takes place in Brest/France is a vital issue of the school partnership between the RBZ Wirtschaft Kiel and the IFAC \u2013 Campus des M\u00e9tiers in Brest. Our French partner looks for the work placements required in Brest. All participants benefit from this school partnership as a perfect procedure is guaranteed by this longterm cooperation based on trust.\r\nIn order to realise our internationalisation strategy we also set up teacher trainings with our partners in France, Great Britain, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and Spain. The courses provided in Spain, France and Bournemouth/GB as well as Cheltenham/GB focus on enhancing competences in teaching a foreign language. In the long run we wish to guarantee teacher trainings on a regular basis, so that as many colleagues as possible can take part. This year some of our English teachers are sent abroad for courses via Kulturlife. Coming year we will apply, ensuring that more colleagues teaching English participate in teacher trainings abroad, thus improving both their competences in the English language and methodology or other educational fields being important in the 21st century.\r\nOur teacher trainings are varied and match the requirements of our modern school. Apart from developing competences among teachers, we also look after the modernization of our school library and work on setting up a new concept.

A completely new section will be six months\u2019 work placements for 7 students in full-time vocational training (commercial assistants).  During these work placements the students will experience (i.) general differences in the vocational training compared to Germany and (ii.) differences in business culture and organization. Furthermore, the trainees will improve their personal skills concerning their intercultural competence and the command of foreign languages.\r\nLast but not least, the trainees will enlarge their flexibilty concerning the challenges connected with a workplacement abroad. This will have a positive effect on the trainees' self-confidence.On some work placements , during the first days of their stay, the trainees are accompanied by a German teacher who will assist in coping with potential initial problems, especially when underage students are involved. The work placements and the further tutorial will be organized by the European project partners.\r\nWe are planning for [a] 12 mobilities in the dual system and [b]  20 mobilities for students in full-time vocational training.

[d] Concerning the  staff mobilities a total of 7 is planned. [e] Furthermore, we plan to have one teacher accompanying the students in two cases  during the first five days of their stay (commercial assistants (England/ Totnes], nursing assistants [Austria]). We arranged this for the last work placements of these students and it worked out alright. Especially for the nursing assistants it is very likely to be the first time apart from their family and friends. Sometimes lacking eloquence leads to misunderstandings that might grow into problems which in the end are very hard to solve. An accompanying teacher can prevent this easily.\r\nA similar effect we noticed for the commercial assistants who serve their internship in England. Here misunderstandings might arise due to their not perfect command of the foreign language. An accompanying teacher gives the necessary back-up and reassurance so that it is easier for them to cope with minor problems during their five-weeks\u2019 stay.\r\nat a.)6 three-week mobilities in England (Bournemouth) (4 of these mobilities are reserved for industrial clerks and wholesalers/export merchants as one component of their additional qualification \u201cEuropean Merchant\u201d;2 are planned for the same kind of apprentices not taking part in the additional qualification. Furthermore we plan for 2 two-week mobilities in Belgium (St. Vith) for retailers, office clerks, warehouse workers.

The participation of 2 teachers  in the EcoMedia Congess in Glasgow (2017) serves two aspects: On the one hand it will enhance the teachers\u2019 knowledge concerning the effective appliance of new media  for teaching purposes and on the other hand it will offer the chance to get into contact with representatives of vocational schools that might be interested in a partnership for students of technical professions.

As a result since the existence of the Vocational Training Centre of B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba Zwack J\u00f3zsef Vocational Grammar and Vocational Secondary School for Trade and Catering it actively participates in international cooperation, international internship opportunities within which it provides students the opportunity to participate in vocational training abroad with the help of grants.\r\nIn the constant and accelerated pace world the acquired knowledge given by the school with the graduation becomes obsolete quickly, so our school constantly rethinks and develops further the knowledge, learning and teaching system in accordance with the above-mentioned ECVET principles of trade, hospitality and tourism, for lifelong learning. The Vocational Training Centre of B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba Zwack J\u00f3zsef Vocational Grammar and Vocational Secondary School for Trade and Catering offers practical, marketable courses, to which it adapts general, international \"best practices\" and always implements the latest technical content in them. Thanks to our regular international cooperation the international and domestic practices have become comparable which helps to develop our practical methods.\r\n\r\nAs part of the application our institution also supports its staff to take part in foreign professional training courses and study tours with the help of tender funds.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned improvements and changes within mobility:\r\n\r\nIn case of students (57 persons):\r\nFor a long time our school has to serve the increasingly diverse and differentiated society of students who have different backgrounds and family preparedness, motivation, and different learning needs when they come to school. Accordingly, the school is widely tries to satisfy the increasingly differentiated needs of society and to help disadvantaged students, which exists in most cases in social aspects. With the help of the project we also help disadvantaged students to get to foreign countries. This is particularly important in our region in B\u00e9k\u00e9s county, which is a highly underdeveloped area concerning the social situation.\r\nAbilities of the candidates for the mobility program are different in the professional, linguistic and social context. The fundamental motivation of the candidates of the program only lies in the fact to gain foreign work experience and they do not take into consideration that they should have a number of input competency to spend a month abroad which we make them aware of during the preparatory classes (language, professional, cultural, and psychological ).\r\nDespite our efforts it was found that the participants' awareness of the benefits and drawbacks of self-sufficiency has become clear for them only during the mobility. Therefore, more emphasis is put on the education of independent living. during the preparing sessions mentioned above and the in the framework of classes with class teacher \r\n\r\nIn the case of teachers (17 persons):\r\nIt can be observed that those teachers who participated in previous programs for teachers and study trips abroad have developed their practical skills, renewed methodically and thus increased the quality of their work, efficiency and motivation. The school wants to expand the competence development, methodological renewal ever drawing wider numbers of its teachers in the program.\r\n\r\nThe foreign language competence of the pupils and staff involved in the project does not always reach the expected level, so we want to increase this with the help of foreign language preparation and the mobility.\r\n\r\nThe need of escorts:\r\nAmong the students participating in mobility almost every group has at least one underage or underprivileged student who need the accompanying presence in foreign travels. In addition, the presence of this person is needed on-site to do the administrative tasks in the host country\u2019s partner institution.\r\n\r\nNew partner institutions:\r\nIn order to improve our standard of training besides the already existing and well-functioning international relations abroad we need to maintain further addition \u2013 in similar education profile \u2013 and new educational institutions should be explored, thereby expanding our potential for learning for teachers and students alike. Therefore besides the existing partner institutions we have involved new partner institutions, such as Lobog\u00f3 Panzi\u00f3, Homor\u00f3df\u00fcrd\u0151 in Romania; Mobilityfriends, Barcelos in Portugal; English 2000 School of English, Bournemouth, in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nOverall, we strive to provide the widest possible field of vision for students and teachers by the Erasmus + mobility in the trained professions.", "http://www.english2000.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-HU01-KA116-035734_2"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["4JQ", "RDY", "BOSCOMBE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"], ["4JQ", "RDZ", "BOSCOMBE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"], ["1RW", "RHM", "BOURNEMOUTH NUFFIELD HOSPITAL"], ["1RW", "RNZ", "BOURNEMOUTH NUFFIELD HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BH1"}
