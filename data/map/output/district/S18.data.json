(Initiative St\u00e4dtepartnerschaften Sindelfingen e.V.)  invites to its intercultural youth exchange \u201cZur\u00fcck in die Zukunft \u2013 Back to the Future? What will your country look like in 20 years? What do you hope for? What are you afraid of?\u201d 42 young people aged 15-18 years from seven EU-countries to Sindelfingen. The young people come from Croatia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom. They are mostly from rural, structurally weak areas or from volatile schools located at the outskirts of their cities. The German group consists of youths whose families have taken asylum in Germany. In this intercultural youth exchange, the young people create a joint performance which they will perform twice publicly in a youth centre (\u201cJugendhaus. Treffpunkt f\u00fcr Jugendkultur\u201d) in Sindelfingen. \r\n\r\nContent of the young people`s joint action is to confront their own living conditions to the ones of youths of other European countries to create future prospects for a coexistence in solidarity within the European Community. For this, the young people will take the actual crisis within the European Community as a starting point. At the moment, national egoisms, supposed domestic needs and fears of financial losses gain influence all over the European communities. At the same time, common European aims and values are challenged. Our youth exchange wants to oppose this development. The aim is to strengthen the social cohesion and the European citizenship of the youth. Furthermore, we want to improve mutual understanding, solidarity and tolerance between them.\r\n\r\nFor this artistic interpretation, we choose a creative approach with elements of performing arts, metaphorical presentation and music. Thus, the young people get to know each other on a level of non-formal education: They perceive themselves sensitively, overcome their prejudices and learn to respect each other and to interact in a mutually respectful manner - regardless of race, nation, language, culture and social class.\r\nBy our creative approach we avoid discussions which often only reinforce existing prejudices and widen the social and cultural divisions. On the contrary, it allows young people to deal with the different lifestyles of all participants. Their social competence will increase as well as the ability to communicate with other people in an appropriate manner, especially with persons of different backgrounds. Furthermore the youths will build up knowledge on how to solve conflicts constructively.\r\n\r\nFor the preparation of our project we ask all participants to create a drawing, painting or collage about the topic \u201cZur\u00fcck in die Zukunft \u2013 Back to the Future? What will your country look like in 20 years? What do you hope for? What are you afraid of?\u201d and send them to the drama teachers. We will provide those creative works to all young people in our intercultural exchange in November. On this basis, we will create improvisations and stories which will lead into a final joint performance.\r\nBased on this holistic creative process, young people will strengthen their cultural expression. They will become adept in showing each other the national, cultural, social and creative characteristics of their country\u2019s people and therefore strengthen the awareness of the European citizenship. As a result we expect that for the solution of the European crisis they will overcome national egoisms and be able to seriously develop creative future scenarios for a solidary European Community and to spread it into their home countries.\r\n\r\nAs we know from experience, during the constant feedback process within the exchange, the youths recognize that these shared learning processes are possible only within a Europe of Solidarity. Especially in times of a growing number of Eurosceptics, we believe that it is important especially for young people, to let them experience that a model of a united Europe is possible and to reassure this believe to the general public.", "http://www.dronfield.derbyshire.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-DE04-KA105-015369_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "S18"}
