The joint work shall aim at a better understanding between and knowledge of the youths and their respective culture, to set reflection process in motion and to offer the young people new options.\r\n\r\nPreparation of the project: All young people who take part in this project write some kind of diary at the weekend of 26th and 27th April (short texts: at the morning, noon, evening and night) and make a comic, foto-story or collage. The texts should be sent in one of the following languages: German, English or French.\r\n\r\nCarrying out of the project: We will send the documents of the youths to the responsible persons in the different twin cities until 15th May - as basis for the performance that will be worked out by the youths together with two professional theatre pedagogues in July. At the last day of the action this performance will be presented to the public.\r\n\r\nThe main effects we hope to achieve with our international EU project \"An einem Samstag im April: Jugendkulturen in Europa\" are understanding, respect and friendship of the young people of six nations of which more than the half come from sections of society with low levels of academic achievement and often socially disadvantaged backgrounds. We want to show that differences in language and culture don't mean differentiation but an incentive to talk to each other, get to know the different cultures and ways of life and to compare them in the different forms and contents of the youth cultures in Europe. It will be an extraordinary experience for the youths to understand each other without interpreters and to create a performance together. We are convinced that this project will improve their self-esteem and make them curious to encounters with youths from other countries.", "http://www.dronfield.derbyshire.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE04-KA105-000375_4"], ["2FZ", "Der gro\u00dfe BLACKOUT: Was ist, wenn alles anders wird?

The citizens suffered heavily from the devastating consequences of the terrible years of war. In many parts of Europe, civilization and society were collapsed. Nothing was the way it was before and because of the great numbers of refugees, many communities hat to change or the groups of refugees had to settle down in new areas. \r\n\r\nNevertheless \u2013 or perhaps even because of this situation \u2013 the idea of a joint and peacful Europe rose again. This time, the pioneers of the European idea had the hope that international cooperation could reduce or even prevent wars and the escalation of violence in future.\r\n\r\nThe project \u201cThe big BLACKOUT. What, if everything changes? Social blueprints of our living together within the European community from the perspective of young people\u201d wants to take up this thought. The participating youth - all in all 36 persons from Germany, Great Britain, France, Latvia, Poland and Hungary - get the exercise to imagine a situation where their social fabric changes, a situation where neither social networks as Facebook, nor television or telephones work any more. The young people should imagine to live in a completely changed situation.\r\n\r\nIn working on a joint performance, the participants will get to know the dependences of civilization and become aware of the fact that their possessions and circumstances of life can not be taken for granted. They will deal with the different moral concepts of their countries and with the difficulty of social processes. They will experience the core values of the European society and become aware of the privileges of the European Union and the great value of long-lasting peace. \r\n\r\nThe German group consits of young refugees \u2013 inter alia from Syria or Kosovo \u2013, some of them had to experience the consequences of war and destruction by themselves. The other participants, who know war just from their history lessons or from the media, will get a very intensive insight into the suffering of people of their same age. At the same time, the young refugees will be integrated into a social network of European youth and get the chance to increase their self-confidence by working together on the performance. Hopefully they will also get new perspectives for their future. This shall be achieved both by the joint working on the performance and by so called \"Eat-culture-evenings\".\r\n\r\nThis project within the ERASMUS+ programme \u201cYouth mobility\u201d aims to show the youth the intrinsic values of their European citizenry so that they both develop an understanding for their own role in history and become active European Union\u2019s citizens.\r\nIt contributes to the development of solidarity and in promoting tolerance of young people and therefore strengthens the social cohesion between people of different cultures within the European Union. With its topic and methodology the project promotes the European core values of freedom, democracy, human rights and peace.\r\nThrough our holistic methodology the youth will develop and present to one another different social models within the creative process of working ton the performance. Within the joint work for the performance to the topic \u201cThe big BLACKOUT\u201d, there will happen a very concrete and intensive experience regarding the above-mentioned priorities.", "http://www.dronfield.derbyshire.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-2-DE04-KA105-012695_3"], ["2FZ", "GRENZERFAHRUNGEN - BORDERLINE EXPERIENCES.

Die Grenzen Europas\" we invite 42 young people aged 15-18 years from Croatia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom to Sindelfingen. In this intercultural youth exchange, the young people create a joint performance which they will perform publicly in a youth center and a theater in Sindelfingen. The German group consists of youths of a preparatory class whose families have taken refuge in Germany.Content of the joint actions of the young people is to confront their own living conditions to the ones of the people who had to flee from their home countries and who hope to find asylum in Europe.For this artistic interpretation, we choose a creative approach with elements of performing arts, metaphorical presentation and music. Thus, the young people get to know each other on a level that usually has no space in their school and everyday life: They perceive themselves sensitively, overcome their prejudices, learn to respect each other and to interact in a mutually respectful manner - regardless of race, nation, language, culture and social class.By our creative approach we avoid discussions which often only reinforce existing prejudices and widen the social and cultural divisions. On the contrary, the creative approach allows young people to deal with the different lifestyles of all participants and to develop empathy for the emergency of refugees.For the preparation of the project we ask all participants to photograph three things that they would take with them if they had to flee their homes . At the preparatory meeting in October, we will select some of the photos under thematic aspects .After that we will provide these photos to all young people in our intercultural exchange in November. On this basis, we will create improvisations and stories which will lead into a final joint performance .Based on this holistic creative process, young people will be able to seriously develop creative future scenarios for a solidary European Community. They set themselves the goal to overcome national egoisms in solving the refugee crisis.The participants will discover  and will become aware of national, cultural, social and creative special qualities of each of them - even the people who had to flee from their home country.As we know from experience, during the constant feedback process the youths recognize that this shared learning processes are possible only within a Europe of Solidarity.

The young people come from Croatia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom. They are mostly from rural, structurally weak areas or from volatile schools located at the outskirts of their cities. The German group consists of youths whose families have taken asylum in Germany. In this intercultural youth exchange, the young people create a joint performance which they will perform twice publicly in a youth centre (\u201cJugendhaus. Treffpunkt f\u00fcr Jugendkultur\u201d) in Sindelfingen. \r\n\r\nContent of the young people`s joint action is to confront their own living conditions to the ones of youths of other European countries to create future prospects for a coexistence in solidarity within the European Community. For this, the young people will take the actual crisis within the European Community as a starting point. At the moment, national egoisms, supposed domestic needs and fears of financial losses gain influence all over the European communities. At the same time, common European aims and values are challenged. Our youth exchange wants to oppose this development. The aim is to strengthen the social cohesion and the European citizenship of the youth. Furthermore, we want to improve mutual understanding, solidarity and tolerance between them.\r\n\r\nFor this artistic interpretation, we choose a creative approach with elements of performing arts, metaphorical presentation and music.

They will become adept in showing each other the national, cultural, social and creative characteristics of their country\u2019s people and therefore strengthen the awareness of the European citizenship. As a result we expect that for the solution of the European crisis they will overcome national egoisms and be able to seriously develop creative future scenarios for a solidary European Community and to spread it into their home countries.\r\n\r\nAs we know from experience, during the constant feedback process within the exchange, the youths recognize that these shared learning processes are possible only within a Europe of Solidarity.
