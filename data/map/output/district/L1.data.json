In that way artworks become active artefacts that react on users' attention and emotions and provide more information about them! This leads to the new generation of mobile museum guides based on the novel concept we call Adaptive Augmented Reality (A2R).The realization of such an ambitious result will be based on the prior work of partners in the domain of Augmented Reality for Cultural Heritage, Affective Computing and Complex Event Processing, which ensures the quality and reliability of generated outcomes and it will be driven by the three complementary use cases from Cultural Heritage domain, which ensures the usefulness and reusability of results.Very rigorous and comprehensive evaluation and exploitation plans ensures that this work will produce exploitable research results and influence the selected research areas, as well as the usage of advance ICT in the CH domain in general.", 124709.0, 3619501.0, "ARtSENSE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_97475_974134432"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0AH", "Virtual Sets: Creating and promoting virtual sets for the performing arts", "PACIFICSTREAM ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONSCOMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", 153403.0, "ViSet will promote cutting-edge digital technologies for the arts, in order to demonstrate the many social, economic, commercial and cultural advantages of these technologies for the arts.

It explores the storytelling potential created by the exponential growth and availability of data when internet-linked connectivity is extended to everyday objects. The narrative: A Moeda (The Coin) is a digital artefact that wants to travel around the world. A semi-autonomous object passed between human hosts, its \u2018journey\u2019 \u2013 defined by a desire to eventually to return home \u2013 is also influenced by a combination of individual biophysical, social and geophysical forces. Hosts are left to wonder how much of its movement is defined by their behaviour or the coin\u2019s \u2018free will\u2019. Putting aside utilitarian use, A Moeda investigates human relations to the IoT by shifting the perspective from the human to that of the object. It is our belief that the IoT cultural\u2019s potential is underexplored; that the imagination of creative agents is needed to construct multiple, and even contradictory IoT scenarios \u2013 models of the world diverse enough to ensure the IoT returns some value to the social life of individuals and cultures.

How would IoT objects tell stories? How would they \u2018see\u2019 humans? What language would they \u2018speak\u2019? The value of the A Moeda system is that it provides a storytelling mechanism that is open enough to support different ways of recounting a coin\u2019s journey.
