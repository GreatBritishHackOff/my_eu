In that way artworks become active artefacts that react on users' attention and emotions and provide more information about them! This leads to the new generation of mobile museum guides based on the novel concept we call Adaptive Augmented Reality (A2R).The realization of such an ambitious result will be based on the prior work of partners in the domain of Augmented Reality for Cultural Heritage, Affective Computing and Complex Event Processing, which ensures the quality and reliability of generated outcomes and it will be driven by the three complementary use cases from Cultural Heritage domain, which ensures the usefulness and reusability of results.Very rigorous and comprehensive evaluation and exploitation plans ensures that this work will produce exploitable research results and influence the selected research areas, as well as the usage of advance ICT in the CH domain in general.", 124709.0, 3619501.0, "ARtSENSE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_97475_974134432"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0AH", "Virtual Sets: Creating and promoting virtual sets for the performing arts", "PACIFICSTREAM ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONSCOMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", 153403.0, "ViSet will promote cutting-edge digital technologies for the arts, in order to demonstrate the many social, economic, commercial and cultural advantages of these technologies for the arts.

This will clearly improve their chances of finding work abroad in the future. Since many companies in this branch operate throughout Europe, or indeed internationally, work can be found in many countries.

As this library aims to extend an attractive selection to international guests, this will also contribute to intercultural competence. The third participant of this course is currently in her first year of study and will be going to the Austrian National Library. On the one hand, this project will focus on intercultural differences between two German-speaking countries and, on the other hand, concentrate on work in a national library, which cultivates international contacts due to its assignments.\r\nThe necessity for Specialists in Media and Information Services to have a command of specialist vocabulary is ever increasing due to the expansion of the use of electronic sources of information. Specifically in scientific and technical fields, these are often, and sometimes exclusively, in English.\r\n\r\nThe bookseller will spend her internship in a bookshop in Liverpool.

This will take place in a youth hostel in the vicinity and will include an overnight stay. The seminar will focus on intercultural and linguistic preparation and will clarify technical formalities.
