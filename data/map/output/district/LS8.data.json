Once that connection is established, we are able to help the youth prepare for a sea of confronting situations and challenges they will encounter during their lives.\r\nYouth workers use a variety of different techniques in order to form connections with youth. Through games, youth workers are able to lay strong foundations of trust and openness with the youth with whom they work. We believe games not only provide a safe social environment for personal development, but also improve competencies  and fundamentals youth need to establish themselves well within a community. We believe that certain types of physical games have an educational value that is yet to be fully explored in our education systems. When it comes to the personal development of youth, games are more than a way of having fun, they are important to our organisations and are an extremely powerful learning tool especially when used in a social context.\r\n\r\nThe games exchange will provide a sharing platform for physical games and how they are used in youth work amongst circus schools and other organisations who promote non-formal learning and art education. \r\nIt will take place from 03/05/2015 - 07/05/2015 and will be hosted by Cirkus In Beweging in Leuven, Belgium.\r\nOriginally stemming from a spontaneous games exchange workshop during the NICE (Network for International Circus Exchange) meeting in Denmark in 2013, the International Circus Games Exchange had instant partners and support through youth circus schools and other organisations across Europe.\r\nIn this project we will bring together a strong knowledge base from different countries, cultures and organisations.\r\nThe project will be focussed on the exchange of this knowledge between partner organisations and the individuals representing them. \r\nWe will investigate the different kinds of games used by our organisations and for what purposes.  Time will be spent on different categories of games such as Ice-Breakers, physical warm-up games, group connection games, energising and de-energising games, team building games, cooperation games, character based games, building games, creative thinking games, social inclusion games, improvisation games and others.\r\nThere will be a specific focus on learning new games from other organisations and cultures as well as offering variations on games that are already known. With the expertise of the partners and the participants representing them, time will also be spent on improving and customising games to cater for specific purposes.\r\nCirkus In Beweging will be partnered by Youth Circus Schools and other organisations throughout Europe who promote non-formal learning. Each organisation will send two or three \"Games Experts\" who have a strong knowledge of games used in their organisations. This expertise will be shared with and transferred to the other participants through explanation and physical demonstration in an open sharing space setting, this means that everyone will be free to give feedback, to propose variations and also have the opportunity to help customise the games to suit other purposes.\r\n\r\nEach participant will return to their organisation with a larger and stronger knowledge and database of games. They will have a greater knowledge and awareness of different types of games and also variations on games they already know.  Participants will have been exposed to the purposes for which other organisations and participants use games. The individuals will have had the experience of being a key role in developing and customising games to suit a specific purpose/need and will now be more adept in doing so in the future. The participants will return with a better awareness of games played in other countries and in other cultures.\r\n\r\nThe desired impact of the project is to share knowledge on a European, international and intercultural level. \r\nThe project will help strengthen bonds between partnering organisations and countries and help to form long lasting partnerships between partner organisations. The project will create a better awareness of the philosophies of the different partner organisations and countries. This project will also serve as a basis for this type of exchange and hopefully promote further Games Exchange possibilities and partnerships in the future.", "http://www.leedschildrenscircus.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-3-BE05-KA105-000755_11"], ["5LN", "YE - Free to be me", "GETAWAY GIRLS", 20629.0, "Free to be me, focuses on Being a young woman in 2018 and explores the issues of  identity, equality, strength, diversity and boundaries, The exchange project has been developed by young women from Oslo and Leeds who have been involved in planning workshops and Skype calls to get to know each other and share ideas for the project.Within the project Young women from Oslo and Leeds will build confidence , learn new skills,  increase awareness of their own potential and create a strong bond between young women from different cultures.

Daily reflection and small groups to receive feedback and adapt the programme flow to needs and interests of the participants.\r\nf During the discussion we've found out that we share a common background - the experience of migration in different countries and we are aware the difficulties that migrants face. Thus, we thought that going through this experience ourselves by organising this YE we can help other youngsters to overcome the barriers they face by sharing their individual stories and getting heard, raising self-esteem and acquiring a number of transferable skills they can apply in their everyday life and on labor market increasing the level of their employability and inclusion to the new societies they are settling in. \r\nBy sharing and publishing the stories of young migrants in a brochure, spreading them in different media channels (TV, Radio, Newspapers, Newsletters, Social media) within and outside the partner organisations and participants' social networks we will gain a high level of publicity and promote cultural diversity, equity tolerance and acceptance. \r\nWe're also aiming to promote E+ possibilities among disadvantaged groups that face high risk of marginalisation and raise their level of inclusion into the European educational programme and their local communities promoting European values, principles of democracy, solidarity, equity and acceptance; to create an inter-cultural dialogue and opportunities for cooperation for young people, youth workers and partners by engaging people with different backgrounds. \r\nThis project will help partners to:\r\nstrengthen cooperation and gain more experience of carrying out educational projects on international level.\r\nenlarge grant winning and project realisation history that will have positive impact on image of the orgs and increase the chance of getting funding, resources and partnerships in the future. \r\nMore experienced staff in the face of volunteers and youth workers in the field of journalism (+project management, planning and in carrying out YEs - leaders, coordinators and staff), who know how to make their projects visible and through that engage youth in social activities. \r\nParticipants of the YE are 1st or 2nd generation of migrants  also refeguees facing high risk of marginalisation, who would share their stories and experience of migration and views on problems that they face, which will help them to realise that they are not alone in their struggle.\r\nThe main activities: \r\nice breakers and trust building activities + open space\r\nintroduction to the topic and experience sharing\r\nstudy visits on the local radio, tv\r\napplication of the knowledge gained through practical activities \r\ninter-cultural activities\r\ndevelopment of the ideas and brochure\r\ncreating professional cooperation\r\nregular reflection to foster the learning process\r\nevaluation of the experience and closing activities\r\nParticipants are expected to acquire knowledge and skills they will be able to apply and share within their social networks + in the local communities (by conducting a workshop).
