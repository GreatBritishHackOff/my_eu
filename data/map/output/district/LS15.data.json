This collective effort and learnings will also be shared with other EU actors through an electronic platform where key analysis, PCP templates and webinars will be stored for future use.<br/>The Lead Partners behind the INSPIRE initiative represent some of the most experienced PCP experts and PCP/PPI practitioners currently operating in the Health space in Europe.<br/>INSPIRE will create:<br/>- a sector-specific network of Contracting Authorities to foster demand for innovation. Focus will be on sharing and disseminating evidence on innovation procurement practices from EU- projects, and in particular promotion of the risk/benefit sharing aspects of these. We need to take into use new technologies and new ICT-based services, which should lead us towards better quality services and patient satisfaction as well as lower total system level costs. INSPIRE consortium will deliver evidence on how this can be done in practice.<br/>INSPIRE project will also focus on remodeling the public healthcare service procurement and innovation strategies and on the importance of fostering user involvement in the R&D&I processes and the use of real life testing environments.<br/>- a link between PCP / PPI and venture capital activities. R&D&I activities and in particular the prototype, testing and commercialization phases often phase difficulties in attracting sufficient external finance in an adequate timeframe. Linking PCP with Venture Capital can provide the missing boost to complete the Innovation chain in a manner which secures also the Business case.
