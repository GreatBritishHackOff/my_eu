On the whole, performances on secondary lower level are much better which is proved in the test results of national standards E8 from 2014. Unfortunately only a small number of schools received raters to find out about pupils' oral communications skills. Speaking in a language class does still not have the importance it should have. In inclusive settings every child  can contribute to language learning providing knowledge and skills in their mother tongue.\r\nCLIL is an option to introduce more English in schools without rising the number of English lessons per week. Only teachers with a high language competence can run CLIL-lessons, only teachers with high language competence can set up a learning environment that challenges the pupils to use English as a medium of instruction and communication. Therefore we need to qualify our teachers in terms of language competence as well as in methodology and didactics. Teachers also have to prepare pupils to make use of digital ways to learn and improve a language. As a consequence e-education must be part of teacher training as well.\r\nOur project goals:\r\nFostering the knowledge of modern languages and intercultural communication\r\nTeaching staff that keeps improving their own competence in modern languages to act as role models for students\r\nIncrease of ICT in language classes\r\nIncrease of CLIL in primary and lower secondary schools\r\nIncreased use of the potential of collaboration within Europe\r\nFurther development of ICT competences as a basic prerequisite for innovation and collaboration in the field of education\r\nReinforcement of motivation and contentment of teaching staff\r\nIncreasing the number of joint projects in the province of Styria (School to school partnerships, eTwinning, A-Twinning)\r\nInitiatives to set up regional and European networks of teachers\r\nSetting up an online communication helpdesk for pupils operated by native speakers \r\nRaising awareness for the importance of language learning on all levels (teachers, inspectors, school authorities)\r\nExpanding of invitations to informal \"tea time chats\" for all teachers run by native speakers \r\nThe participants in job shadowing are headteachers and teachers who have been using innovative ways of teaching already and who are willing to share their experience with other colleagues within Europe. In addition school inspectors who have to guide schools with their school development as well as education psychologists who contribute their knowledge of learning styles to the implementation of successful inclusive learning environements take part in job shadowing and exchange meetings.\r\nAs far as job shadowing is concerned teachers usually have only limited knowledge of how other teachers of English act in their classes. Observing classes has become more frequent on secondary level, but is still the exception in primary schools for reasons as tight timetabling and English considered a low priority subject. Teachers need time to watch the students' learning process with both struggling and success. Teachers will volunteer to job shadowing and will indicate their interest to the Landesschulrat via their headteachers.\r\nTeachers who want to do intensive training in a course in Ireland or Scotland will come up with a selected course from the Erasmus+ SEG course catalogue. Teachers who choose courses that are in line with the school profile will get priority. Only schools with a school development plan that contains \"Improvement of language competence\" will be nominated. All participants must be willing to share their experience with other colleagues not taking part in the programme. They are to act as disseminators.\r\nThe strong impact of the consortium will help the region and the province to make faster progress aiming at the targets of Europe 2020. \r\nAbove all the project will serve the pupils: better learning performances achieved with the help of innovative and motivated teachers will improve the students career opportunities and will in the end strengthen the economy and as a consequence the province of Styria. Strong regions form the backbone of Europe.\r\nThe consortium consists of 1.300 compulsory school teachers plus  members of the school authority , teaching or being responsible for 7447 students. Out of this 1300 educational professionals 179 will do an European job-shadowing, 76 are intending to do a teacher training course, this means that around 19% of the staff members of the consortium will go for a mobility.  By this our project will have benefit for one-tenth of the compulsory students of our region.  The 51 participating schools consist of 38 primary schools and 13 NMS lower secondary schools.", "http://www.mount.dudley.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA101-034957_1"], ["4LA", "Fomentando el Cuerpo de Solidaridad Europeo.", "High Oak Youth and Community Centre", 15857.0, "The working seminar \"Fostering the European Solidarity Corps\" is an activity in which 24 youth workers representing 12 countries (Poland, Romania, France, Estonia, Portugal, Croatia, Turkey, Italy, UK, Lithuania, Spain and Hungary) will meet in the north of Spain (Cantabria). During 4 days (June 19-22, 2018) we will meet to know each other and exchange our volunteering knowledge, paying special attention to the creation of partnerships to promote the new programme of the solidarity corps.\r\n\r\nThe European Solidarity Corps (ESC) is a new European Union initiative which creates opportunities for young people to volunteer or work in projects in their own country or abroad that benefit communities and people around Europe.\r\n\r\nIt builds upon, and is currently piloted in, the European Voluntary Service (EVS) element of Erasmus+ as well as other EU funding programmes. The plan proposes that Erasmus+ National Agencies will manage the ESC in each country.\r\n\r\nIn addition to offering opportunities, internships and job placements, our project will help to consolidate the initiative and create more opportunities for young people.\r\n\r\nParticipants will be youth workers (two from each entity), and along with two support experts, we will explore the main lines of projects framed within the Solidarity Corps. We will work together to create partnerships in the following projects types:\r\n\r\n- Solidarity Placements: It will support young people to carry out voluntary activities and jobs according to the national legislation for 2-12 months.\r\n\r\n- Voluntary teams: It will allow groups of 10-40 young volunteers from different countries to have a joint impact, from 2 weeks to 2 months.\r\n\r\n- Solidarity projects: It will allow small groups of at least 5 participants, on their own initiative, to prepare and implement solidarity projects in a local level, from 2 weeks to 2 months.\r\n\r\n- Networking activities: It will serve to attract beginners to the European Solidarity Corps. It will allow the exchange of good practices, provide support after their practices and establish alumni networks.\r\n\r\nIn addition to working together in these four areas, we will hold sessions to meet each of the entities, plan projects jointly and have two special training sessions provided by experts from the European Solidarity Corps.\r\n\r\nBy carrying out this project we will:\r\n\r\n- Know in depth the new initiative of the Solidarity Corps and its connection to EVS.\r\n- Get familiar with the four axes of the Solidarity Corps\r\n- Increase the motivation to promote activities in our entities involving young people.\r\n- Extend the solidarity perspective and its importance in youth activities at European level.\r\n- Improve language and communication skills.\r\n- Enhance work in multicultural teams.\r\n- Plan projects within the framework of the Solidarity Corps between the participating entities.", "http://www.highoak-youth.com", null, "erasmus_2017-3-ES02-KA105-010357_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DY5"}
