Recent crises such as BSE, swine fever, foot and mouth disease and avian influenza, and the activities of consumer and animal welfare organisations have raised public awareness that animal production is more than just an industry and that many other issues have to be considered. In this project, we focus on the fact that farm animal welfare has become an issue of increasing public significance and concern. Recent surveys indicated that European citizens show a strong commitment to animal welfare and many consumers express a willingness to pay a premium price for a product emanating from a welfare-friendly production system (Eurobarometer, 2007). But their expressed willingness often fails to result in purchase. Consumers\u2019 apparent reluctance to actually buy these products in the shop may at least partly reflect a lack of transparency in the market for animal products, (consumers are unable to recognise animal friendly products), as well as the limited assortment of such products. Clearly, it is extremely important for the industry, both from a corporate social responsibility and a market point of view, to re-build and maintain consumer trust related to how food-producing animals are housed and handled across Europe. This requirement demands the development of credible, reliable and transparent welfare assessment systems as well as product information and certification schemes to support communication to the consumer about the ways in which the animal food products are produced. The present project addresses the above needs by developing a Stakeholder Platform (European Animal Welfare Platform; EAWP) that will facilitate the exchange of knowledge, experience and expertise in order to effectively support the implementation of scientifically based welfare assessment and information systems, improvement strategies, market initiatives, research and development and policy formulation in the area of farm animal welfare.

The project brought together many different stakeholders in the supply chain, namely producers, processors, retailers, animal welfare organisations and academic experts.\n\nBuilding on previous EU initiatives in the field, the team supported welfare assessment and improvement strategies, in line with research and development (R&D) priorities in the field. It identified key welfare issues in beef and dairy cattle, pigs, poultry and fish. The partners then produced a total of 58 strategic approach documents (SADs). Each SAD focuses on a specific welfare problem and documents the likely causes and consequences, the relevant legislation, and existing best practices. It also sets short and long-term goals for welfare and economic improvement as well as prioritising future R&D. Thus, many important recommendations emerged from the project and these were prioritised for each product group.\n\nThe overall results were communicated via the project's website, as well as through press releases, newsletters and conference presentations.\n\nIn effect, the project built a powerful platform to facilitate the exchange of resources and expertise on the topic.

Another target is to provide for the young participants the context for intercultural expression, creativity and innovation. \r\nPromote and develop non formal education as a method for active citizenship and civic involvement of youngsters.\r\nOffering culture related activities to let participants actively learn to set their own culture backgrounds and experiences in relation to other participants of the programme.\r\n\r\nAnother aim of this project is to build a long lasting partnership and cooperation between the partners, we hope that this will lead to life long learning that can be filtered down through the young people we work with and then into the comunities that we work in. \r\n\r\nWe think that the Erasmus + programme aims to provide young people with an intercultural learning experience and the opportunity to acquire many skills and competances which will be useful for their social and professional integration.\r\nSutton Coldfield YMCA offers a variety of cultural and leisure-time activities, advice, support and help.

The analysis realized starting from these activities of discussion and sensitization highlighted the need of implementing transnational mobility activities for the strengthening and updating of professional competences, both of recent graduates and staff, in the sectors identified in the project. In fact, they are sectors extremely relevant for the national economy (tourism, fashion, commerce), constantly increasing (ICT, electronics/electrotechnics, mechanical engineering/mechatronics, marketing), and in which the request of specific competences has grown (social field, mechanical engineering/mechatronics,  environment and territory). \r\nBesides the technical-professional competences related to the identified sectors, the project contributes to enhance the European identity and to improve intercultural, linguistic and digital skills, allowing the development of a set of personal and transversal abilities, essential in the current occupational scenario. \r\nThe realization of the project \"E.A.S.Y. VET - Experiences Abroad for Staff and Young graduates in VET\"  is part of the internationalization strategy of Essenia UETP, that foresees the implementation and the development of activities aimed at improving the quality and increasing the quantity of transnational mobility projects. \r\nBesides the transversal phases of management, monitoring and dissemination, the project foresees the implementation of the following activities, carried out according to procedures and methodologies already experimented over the years, and that guarantee high quality standards:\r\n-Information and sensitization\r\n-Selection of participants\r\n-Linguistic and pedagogical preparation\r\n-Logistic organization of mobilities\r\n-Evaluation of the project\r\n-Dissemination of project results\r\n-Follow-up\r\nThe quality procedures adopted are constantly improved and updated, also thanks to the use of new technologies and to the professional retraining of Essenia UETP\u2019s human resources, that occurs through training activities realized in the framework of Erasmus+ KA2 projects.

Hordaland is a region in growth, having reached half a million inhabitants it is now one of the fastest growing counties in Norway. \r\n\r\nRelevant skills and competences are becoming increasingly important, and the labour market and businesses call for more well-performing educational and training systems. In order to meet these needs, and ensure the competitiveness of the region, Hordaland will continually have to acquire new knowledge and methods. Hordaland should contribute in making its inhabitants become global citizens, with awareness and knowledge of Europe and the world. Global competences and intercultural understanding can contribute to further development of civil society.\r\n\r\nInternational cooperation is an integral part of HCC\u2019s strategy for regional development (International Strategy 2013-2016). As the challenges the region is faced with are not only valid for Hordaland, HCC sees international cooperation as a tool in finding possible solutions to challenges that are either common for many, or that are transregional/ transnational.\r\n\r\nHCC aims at using Erasmus+ VET Mobility 2017-19 as a strategic tool in developing the region. The programme will be an important contribution in meeting both the challenge of restructuring, as well as creating closer cooperation between education and training and the labour market. Further, the programme will be important in improving language and intercultural competences.\r\n\r\nHCC continuously aims at increasing participation among our partners. In this application, we have maintained approximately the same number of VET pupils as previous years, but have had an increase in participation among our Apprenticeship Training Offices/Establishments.  \r\n\r\nBy including participation in the Erasmus+ programme as a tool in the Competence Development Plan 2016-20 (CDP), we aim to strengthen professional skills and intercultural competences among VET teachers. Including job shadowing abroad into the CDP, contributes to the quality of the projects as well as long-term competence development. We also make an effort to include staff mobility to the mobilities for apprentices. Allowing mentors to take part in work placements together with their apprentice will not only improve the quality of training, but also increase the impact of the mobility. \r\n\r\nThis project emphasise developing cross-sectoral group mobilities. Sustainable development demands international cooperation across different sectors, governmental levels, and disciplines. Close links between businesses and education is of great importance in developing competences and networks, promoting innovation, adapting to the green shift, and securing that education reflects the needs in the market. Mobilising the inter-municipality councils of Hordaland has been a priority in this application, as they are central players when it comes to facilitating cooperation between municipalities, commerce and education. One example of a project involving these councils is the project exchanging best practice with the wool industry in Shetlands, coordinated by Region Nordhordland. The project involves several key local stakeholders within the wool industry, VET, and municipalities of the region.\r\n\r\nThe mobility projects in this application involve systematic work to ensure the quality of preparation and implementation. Quality management and preparation are important for the desired effects and impact of the projects, such as attitudes, shared responsibility, reflection, enhanced cultural awareness as well as more active and positive participation in a multicultural Norwegian and international society and work force. \r\n\r\nHCC is applying for 64 mobility projects, which count 192 pupils and 24 apprentices from 15 different upper secondary schools and 7 training offices, and 58 accompanying persons. HCC is also applying for 28 mobility projects, which count 201 staff from various businesses, municipalities, VET schools and other regional developers. The disciplines represented in this application includes health care/social work, restaurant/hotel, industrial technology, design/crafts, electricity/electronics, and Ict. In addition, the mobility projects will cover themes such as textile industry, welfare technology, innovation, renewable energy, adaptation of curricula/teaching methods and development of new workshops, and cooperation between VET and businesses.\r\n\r\nAs a school owner, HCC is responsible for the safety and wellbeing of the pupils participating in the mobility projects.
