Recent crises such as BSE, swine fever, foot and mouth disease and avian influenza, and the activities of consumer and animal welfare organisations have raised public awareness that animal production is more than just an industry and that many other issues have to be considered. In this project, we focus on the fact that farm animal welfare has become an issue of increasing public significance and concern. Recent surveys indicated that European citizens show a strong commitment to animal welfare and many consumers express a willingness to pay a premium price for a product emanating from a welfare-friendly production system (Eurobarometer, 2007). But their expressed willingness often fails to result in purchase. Consumers\u2019 apparent reluctance to actually buy these products in the shop may at least partly reflect a lack of transparency in the market for animal products, (consumers are unable to recognise animal friendly products), as well as the limited assortment of such products. Clearly, it is extremely important for the industry, both from a corporate social responsibility and a market point of view, to re-build and maintain consumer trust related to how food-producing animals are housed and handled across Europe. This requirement demands the development of credible, reliable and transparent welfare assessment systems as well as product information and certification schemes to support communication to the consumer about the ways in which the animal food products are produced. The present project addresses the above needs by developing a Stakeholder Platform (European Animal Welfare Platform; EAWP) that will facilitate the exchange of knowledge, experience and expertise in order to effectively support the implementation of scientifically based welfare assessment and information systems, improvement strategies, market initiatives, research and development and policy formulation in the area of farm animal welfare.

The project brought together many different stakeholders in the supply chain, namely producers, processors, retailers, animal welfare organisations and academic experts.\n\nBuilding on previous EU initiatives in the field, the team supported welfare assessment and improvement strategies, in line with research and development (R&D) priorities in the field. It identified key welfare issues in beef and dairy cattle, pigs, poultry and fish. The partners then produced a total of 58 strategic approach documents (SADs). Each SAD focuses on a specific welfare problem and documents the likely causes and consequences, the relevant legislation, and existing best practices. It also sets short and long-term goals for welfare and economic improvement as well as prioritising future R&D. Thus, many important recommendations emerged from the project and these were prioritised for each product group.\n\nThe overall results were communicated via the project's website, as well as through press releases, newsletters and conference presentations.\n\nIn effect, the project built a powerful platform to facilitate the exchange of resources and expertise on the topic.

Attention will be paid to recyclability and environmental impact of the materials and the OLED lighting systems. Flexolighting project will also ensure European industrial leadership in lighting.\n\nThe introduction of OLED Lighting technology is held back by the current cost of the systems, life-time and poor uniformity of luminance on large area panels. The programme aims to combine existing state of the art OLED materials technology (Thermally activated fluorescent materials (TADF) and phosphorescent emitters and world class transport materials) with new developments in processing technologies (Organic Vapour Phase Deposition (OVPD) and  printing technologies) to develop new next of generation low cost OLED lighting systems to move forward to scale up and full scale production on novel planarized flexible steel substrates with cost effective conformal encapsulation method. The transparent top contacts made of thin metallic films, conducting polymers or graphene monolayer with metal tracks to reduce the series resistance will be employed in inverted top emitting OLED structures to deliver 100 lumens per Euro.", 61937.0, 3529196.0, "FLEXOLIGHTING", null, null, null, null, "http://www.marks-and-spencer.com", null, "h2020_194181_997799522"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2LH", "Film Sales Support 2017", "TRUFFLE PICTURES LIMITED", 176501.0, "Film Sales Support (FSS) reimburses  a proportion of promotion and marketing campaigns undertaken by European sales companies associated to EFP for European films at a selection of renowned international film festivals and markets.
