It is now recognized that research results are within a factor of 2 of fundamental capacity limits, bounded by fibre nonlinearity and the Shannon Limit and radical approaches now need to be investigated if we are to avert grid-lock on the internet. Mode-Gap will develop multi-mode photonic band gap long haul transmission fibres, and associated enabling technologies. These fibres offer the potential of order of magnitude capacity increases through the use of multiple-input-multiple-output operation of the multi-mode fibre capacity and further order of magnitude capacity increases through the ultra low loss and ultra-low nonlinearity offered by multi-mode photonic bandgap fibre.<br/>Specifically MODE-GAP will:\u0095\\tDevelop ultra-low loss (\u00ab0.1 dB/km) multi-mode (&gt;10 modes) photonic band gap transmission fibre (MM-PBGF).\u0095\\tDevelop novel rare earth doped optical amplifiers for the new transmission windows necessary for the achievement of ultra-long links.\u0095\\tDevelop sources and detector arrays operating within the 1.8 to 2.1 um region\u0095\\tDevelop MIMO arrangements for coupling source arrays to multi-mode fibre and multi-mode fibre to detector arrays\u0095\\tDevelop MIMO and dispersion compensation signal processing algorithms applicable to both conventional solid core (glass and POF) fibres and MM-PBGF.<br/>MODE-GAP is therefore fully aligned with the objectives of ICT-2009.3.7 and directly addresses several of its target outcomes by developing 'photonics technologies, components and (sub) systems driven by key applications/social needs' and using them to fulfil the EU vision of 'future-proof networks and systems enabling unlimited bandwidth' enabling'more optical processing and very high spectral-density transmission and the reductionof power consumption at the system and component level' with the ultimate goal ofenabling 'increasing information throughput'. If successful, the MODE-GAP technologywill have a significant impact in enabling 'future proof networks and systems' of'increasing information throughput'. Without such a breakthrough the internet of thefuture will be severely compromised.

Sensing systems based on these new fibres and space division multiplexing (SDM) systems, for enhancing future network capacity, are being developed, but the problem is that there are no commercially available component products to build these systems.\n\nThe project objective is to develop a range of optical fibre component, module and sub-system products for FMF and MCF solutions in network and sensing applications. Basic building block components and fully integrated multiplexers and amplifiers for high channel count systems will be developed.\n\nDemand for components utilising these new fibres is continuing to increase and technical specifications are developing. Within this project Phoenix will have the resource to work with the customer, to develop a required specification of product and supply to the customers\u2019 needs.\n\nThe feasibility assessment will enable a full commercial assessment to be made. Current technology status, competitive landscape, operator forecast and customer requirements will be assessed. Potential partners and sub-contractors to develop the suite of products will be identified and a roadmap with route to market will be defined. \n\nThe market is global and this project will provide the opportunity for a European SME to be at the forefront of this key future technology.", 36217.0, 51738.0, "ModeCore", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_196238_985720306"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CT7"}
