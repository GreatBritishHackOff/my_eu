It is now recognized that research results are within a factor of 2 of fundamental capacity limits, bounded by fibre nonlinearity and the Shannon Limit and radical approaches now need to be investigated if we are to avert grid-lock on the internet. Mode-Gap will develop multi-mode photonic band gap long haul transmission fibres, and associated enabling technologies. These fibres offer the potential of order of magnitude capacity increases through the use of multiple-input-multiple-output operation of the multi-mode fibre capacity and further order of magnitude capacity increases through the ultra low loss and ultra-low nonlinearity offered by multi-mode photonic bandgap fibre.<br/>Specifically MODE-GAP will:\u0095\\tDevelop ultra-low loss (\u00ab0.1 dB/km) multi-mode (&gt;10 modes) photonic band gap transmission fibre (MM-PBGF).\u0095\\tDevelop novel rare earth doped optical amplifiers for the new transmission windows necessary for the achievement of ultra-long links.\u0095\\tDevelop sources and detector arrays operating within the 1.8 to 2.1 um region\u0095\\tDevelop MIMO arrangements for coupling source arrays to multi-mode fibre and multi-mode fibre to detector arrays\u0095\\tDevelop MIMO and dispersion compensation signal processing algorithms applicable to both conventional solid core (glass and POF) fibres and MM-PBGF.<br/>MODE-GAP is therefore fully aligned with the objectives of ICT-2009.3.7 and directly addresses several of its target outcomes by developing 'photonics technologies, components and (sub) systems driven by key applications/social needs' and using them to fulfil the EU vision of 'future-proof networks and systems enabling unlimited bandwidth' enabling'more optical processing and very high spectral-density transmission and the reductionof power consumption at the system and component level' with the ultimate goal ofenabling 'increasing information throughput'.

Reciprocal projects and knowledge exchange especially concerned:\r\n- Improvement of the quality of preparation and tutoring of international work placements by both Aventus and the foreign training companies.\r\n- Building up (formal) European networks of partners designing policies as to contents and validation of international work placements\r\n- The structure and curricula of the courses and innovative projects/routes resulting in European Job Profiles with units of learning outcomes, such as: European Management Assistant, European Import and Export Assistant, European Transport & Logistics Assistant, European Green Automotive Energy Mechanic, European Fashion Designer, European Fashion Production Coordinator, European IT System Administrator, European Application Developer, European Marketing Assistant, European Private Security Assistant.\r\n- Monitoring of the trainee\u2019s learning process during the international work placements while accomplishing growth with linguistic and intercultural competences\r\n- Connecting assessments of growth of intercultural competences (within the  international work placements) with career guidance of participating students \r\n- Introduction of ECVET proof \u201cEuropean Job Profiles\u201d for Welfare and Health care courses\r\n-DUAL learners\r\nThe last 4 years ECVET instruments were implemented, such as the Memorandum of Understanding, Learning Agreements and Units of Learning Outcomes. The translation from work processes into \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d was completed within the first 10 European Job Profiles. The outcomes of international work placements have become more transparent and valid. \r\nAventus has become a member of the following \u201cEuropean Job Profile\u201d networks: NETINVET (International Trade and Transport & Logistics), EUrFASHION (Fashion), EURO-AST (Management Assistant), EEE (green car technology), Shaping IT (IT System administrator, Application Developer and Media shaping), AEHT (Hotel and Tourism) M&C (European Marketing Assistant) and NOKAS (European Private Security Assistant). Aventus believes that for the next few years it is of great importance to cooperate with European partners by using ECVET instruments to create more clarity about the learning outcomes of international work placements and to get to a fitting assessment system for them. In order to do this Aventus is an active member of both formal and informal networks that are based on  \u201cEuropean Job Profiles\u201d. Aventus aims at exchanging expertise, experiences and best practices as to assessment and validation of professional tasks during international work placements of students, innovations and tested recipes to complicated educational issues together with its partners within these networks.  All project partners within this project offer many ideas for realising  learning goals for the individual students derived from the European Job profile concerned. As a learning organization Aventus will submit this application both from the perspective of the individual student and the qualifications they aim at with a new focus at level 1 and 2 with the \u201cProfessional Orientation\u201d and at level 3 and 4 with assessments of professional units of learning outcomes and last but not least validation of these meaningful learning experiences for the participants at all 4 levels. The effect for the students will be that the professional as well as the personal learning goals like \u201cself reliance\u201d and the status as a Europan Citizen, in which cultural differences are recognized and accepted. The effect for the entire partnership is that in determining a fitting international work placement the current curriculum, the job profiles and the connection to the European labour market will be reviewed. Both Aventus and the participating students will be stimulated to invest into flexibility of the work force, so that European citizenship also gets a wider European labour perspective. In designing the \u201cProfessional Orientation\u201d international work placements the main focus will be on determining how the connection between current curriculum and foreign language learning can be made. The effect for the corporate world lies in extending their own European network by participating in the EUROCON project and reciprocal projects of Aventus\u2019 European partners and getting to know new, sometimes innovative approaches. The ECVET-instruments that will be used in this project are \u201cMemorandum of Understading\u201d, \u201cUnits of learning outcomes\u201d and the \u201clearning agreements\u201d.

In the course of our activities popularizing history and tradition, we learnt  how important is the selection of appropriate methods of communication with the target groups.\r\nHistory is inspiring and interesting, but the methods of popularization are not always able to draw attention of a potential recipient.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the main objective of the project is the exchange of tools and methods for active and creative way of showing the history trough showing old crafts and creating the historical costume as a tool for non-formal education.\r\n\r\nOther objectives are:\r\n\r\n- Meeting other enthusiasts of medieval history\r\n- Exchanging experience what historical re-enactment movement and promotion of the history of their country look like\r\n- Learning what crafts are presented at their festivals and what their costumes look like\r\n- Learning how showing what medieval costumes look like medieval can teach about the history and mentality of the people of a particular historical period\r\n- Exchange of experiences on effective methods of organization and co-creation of the historical festival for the local community here in Poland.\r\nFour partner countries are going to take part in the exchange: Poland, Italy, Great Britain and Lithuania, 20 people in total. These are people who share our passion for reenactment and promoting the country\u2019s legacy in their local communities through festivals or meetings on history and traditions in their towns.\r\n\r\nThe place we chose for  the exchange(Kwiatk\u00f3wek) is a place with a long history, an open-air museum and a medieval settlement. For lovers of history it is a perfect location to meet and implement activities in a joined effort.\r\n\r\nThe methods we have chosen refer to the historical subject of exchange. As a person involved in the historical reenactment, we try to recreate the ways of life at that period and present them to the people. These methods include joint discussions - task groups will be patterned on \"guilds\" with the leader of each group as \"a master\"; the use of the period equipment replicas and historical costumes (role play);  joint effort in creating of historical  camp.\r\n\r\nDuring the exchange we will share not only the knowledge about how our groups work, but we\u2019ll learn different ancient  crafts and how to use them to promote history. Together, we will develop a concept by which we will organize an event for the local community \"IzSzyci with History\". The acquired knowledge will be  shared with the local community by presenting medieval costumes from different parts of Europe during the event we will create together. We will learn about other countries and cultures during historical and cultural evenings held by each country.\r\n\r\n The aim of the exchange is also to create a network to maintain contact so that we could continue international cooperation. Already at the preparation stage of the exchange we came up with ideas for further action in other countries to spread historical knowledge through the methods of non-formal education. The outcome of the exchange will also be a brochure presenting outfits of women and men from each country, along with a description of historical and cultural context such as who, and on what occasion\r\nwore it, which afterwards will be put on the website so that other people, who did not participate in the exchange, could learn and perhaps use our knowledge to prepare their own historical costumes. We will also present the Erasmus + as a tool for integrating young people at the international level and to support non-formal education.\r\n\r\nImpact on participants: \r\n\r\nWithin the European Union we notice a growing interest in history and curiosity about how people lived in earlier times. More and more groups of historical re-enactment are created , reconstruction of important historical events are getting popular. Such activities attract young people due to its interactive form that allows them to \"touch history.\" Such events are very valuable and stay for a long time in the memory of the participants.", "https://regia.org/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PL01-KA105-038077_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CT7"}
