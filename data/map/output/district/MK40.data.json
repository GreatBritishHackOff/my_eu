This will be done by a number of state of the art studies. These studies will be carried out through desk research and interviews, on country, regional and European scale. The dialogue process will consist of a set of facilitated workshops. The results of these workshops will be synthesised in a shared vision of how to harness Research & Development for Sustainable Development.\n\nThe final step of the project will disseminate the results to a broader target group in science policy as well as science communities working in support of Sustainable Development.", 46468.0, 1071275.0, "VISION RD4SD", "New ideas for sustainability research", "Research into sustainable development (SD) may need different administration compared to other sciences. An EU team developed a framework to help researchers achieve better outcomes, including new tools and policy suggestions based on best practice.", "Europe has been funding research into SD for more than 20 years. Such efforts have administered SD research like any other branch of science, though some researchers feel the topic warrants a new and more effective approach.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Producing a shared vision on how to harness research & development for sustainable development' (http://visionrd4sd.eu (VISION RD4SD)) project aimed for a suitable framework. Over 3 years, the 26-member consortium planned to provide Europe with tools fostering SD research. The approach involved formulating policies based on best current knowledge, and developing through dialogue a shared vision among relevant funding and administration bodies. The project tools and conclusions were intended for Horizon\u00a02020 and for the 2020 Vision for the ERA (European Research Area). The undertaking concluded in November 2013.\n\nTeam members established a platform for dialogue and exchange of experiences among interested parties. The platform had a similar structure and process to technology projects, in terms of information collection followed by implementation. The dialogue allowed development of a new interface for exchange of SD-related research. Hence, the project also created an overview of current European practices in terms of funding and administration. Consequently, SD was discussed for the first time in a complex ERA context, beyond national boundaries, and seeking a holistic policy approach.\n\nThe group's major work consisted of hosting and documenting a series of workshops, each attended by approximately 40 people. The consortium finalised a further nine case studies on the state of the SD art. The team publicised on its website several examples of good SD funding.\n\nProject work led to three main outcomes. It produced statements relating to the vision and principles of supporting SD, and an interactive web resource about conducting and funding SD research. Additionally, the team created a platform for action, designed to support communications about SD research after the project's completion.\n\nThe VISION RD4SD project yielded a new common vision about harnessing research for SD, including practical principles. As a result, European researchers were better able to formulate objectives that meaningfully contribute to the topic.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2015-06/149349.jpg", "fp7_97101_986600775"], ["3JY", "Interdisciplinary training network on the purinergic P2X7 receptor to control neuroinflammation and hyperexcitability in brain diseases.", "Sarissa Biomedical Limited", "Brain disorders affect ~179 million people and their families in Europe alone, with an annual cost to the taxpayer estimated at \u20ac800 billion- a greater economic burden than cardiovascular disease and cancer combined. Despite diverse etiology, overlap in clinical symptoms and comorbidities between brain disorders suggests shared patho-mechanisms. In particular, hyperexcitible states driven by glial activation and neuroinflammation appear near ubiquitous. Targeting these mechanisms offers the potential to ameliorate symptoms and reverse disease progression across a broad span of brain disorders. Functioning as a gatekeeper to neuroinflammation and mechanistic link between neuronal hyperexcitability and glial activation, the ATP-gated, ionotropic purinergic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) offers the most promising target for pharmacological intervention in the neuroinflammation-hyperexcitability pathway, to date. With breakthroughs in understanding P2X7R function, highly promising effects demonstrated for antagonists in models of brain disease and vast investment in P2X7R-related drug development programmes, now is the perfect time to pool resources. PurinesDX brings together global leaders in translational research in purinergic signalling, Europe\u2019s leading clinical specialists in a broad range of brain diseases, and industrial partners specializing in drug and biomarker development. Sharing unique genetic tools, newly developed diagnostic devices and novel, selective and brain-stable P2X7R antagonists, the synergism facilitated within PurinesDX will extend to the training of an urgently needed new generation of highly skilled, innovative, creative and entrepreneurial scientists.
