The number of turbulence accidents has been growing by a factor of 5 since 1980. A whole class of turbulence (Clear Air Turbulence), representing 40% of turbulence accidents, cannot be detected by any existing equipment including state-of-the-art weather radar. Operational concepts for the protection against turbulence hazard, based on a UV LIDAR, are: - Short-range measurement of air speed ahead of the aircraft and action on the flight controls, - Medium-range detection of turbulence, and securing of passengers by seat belts fasten. The short-range concept has been validated in the frame of the FP5 AWIATOR project. The objective of DELICAT is to validate the medium range turbulence detection (based on backscattered energy fluctuations). In development phase, both short and medium range will be integrated in single equipment. The validation of medium range turbulence detection is based on the comparison of LIDAR data and aircraft sensors data. - A UV LIDAR mock up is designed, manufactured and flight-tested, - The LIDAR data and the aircraft sensors data are compared off line for the same atmosphere area. The consortium assembled for the DELICAT project includes all the expertise necessary to reach the objective, and will take advantage of previous projects such as FP5 AWIATOR and FP6 FLYSAFE. The project resources are globally adapted to the project ambitious objectives and innovation content. DELICAT takes advantage of existing hardware (laser sub assemblies, test aircraft fairing) to achieve the goal at lower possible cost. The DELICAT project will directly contribute to the objectives of the AAT.2008.3.3.2. topic by increasing customer safety; the objective is to reduce the number of turbulence accidents by 40%. Dissemination of DELICAT will be ensured by setting up a Web Site, and by gathering an External Experts Advisory Group.", 372268.0, 4778846.0, "DELICAT", "Towards better detection of turbulence", "A recent EU project has built and tested a device that can detect turbulence up to 30\u00a0km away from the aeroplane.", "Turbulence is responsible for a large number of injuries to passengers on commercial aeroplanes. A remote sensing technology known as LIDAR (light detection and ranging) can identify turbulence at short (<\u00a0300\u00a0m) and medium (<\u00a030\u00a0km) distances.\n\nA short-range detection method in this line has already been validated through EU-funded research, and the 'Demonstration of LIDAR based clear air turbulence detection' (http://www.delicat-fp7.org (DELICAT)) project carried this research forward.\n\nSpecifically, the DELICAT team aimed to produce and validate a short- and medium-distance turbulence detection device. As noted, the device is based on LIDAR \u2014 a technology that uses light reflection on particles to calculate distance.\n\nResearchers designed the LIDAR device and built a pilot-scale unit. DELICAT designed and tested components such as the transmitter, beam steering system and receiver modules to prepare the device for in-flight testing.\n\nFor this to take place, researchers developed a test strategy, prepared the aeroplane for integration of the device, and installed the prototype.\n\nThe device was tested in flight and detected some light turbulence in specific conditions. No heavy turbulence was encountered during testing, so the DELICAT device has yet to be tested in those conditions.\n\nIf future tests prove successful, the DELICAT device could become a key component of all commercial aircraft in the future. Its incorporation into aircraft is expected to contribute to a reduction in passenger injuries by avoiding or countering Clear Air Turbulences in time.", null, "http://www.hovemere.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/153152.jpg", "fp7_92589_997539465"], ["1RF", "Demonstration of LIDAR Based Wake Vortex Detection System Incorporating an Atmospheric Hazard Map", "Hovemere Ltd", "Wake vortex and wind shear are major causes of accidents and injury to passenger and crew of all aircraft types.

The SMARTFISH systems will:\n- assist fishermen in making informed decisions during pre-catch, catching, and post-catch phases of the extraction process. This improves catch efficiencies and compositions in fisheries across the EU, leading to improved economic efficiency while reducing unintended fish mortality, unnecessary fishing pressure and ecosystem damage.\n- provide new data for stock assessment from commercial fishing and improve the quality and quantity of data that comes from traditional assessment surveys. This provides more accurate assessment of currently assessed stocks and allow the assessment of data-poor stocks.\n- permit the automatic collection of catch data to ensure compliance with fisheries management regulations. \nThe SMARTFISH systems are tested and demonstrated in several EU fisheries.

We will evaluate these impacts before, during and after the implementation of the landing obligation, allowing comparison between intentions and outcomes. Eliminating discards is as much a societal challenge as a fishery management one, so we will also evaluate stakeholders\u2019 perception of discards. DiscardLess will describe the changes in management and the associated governance structures needed to cement the process. We will propose approaches to managing discards in a range of case study fisheries across Europe, encompassing differences in specific discarding issues. All these innovations will be combined in integrated Internet based interactive programs (DMS toolbox) that will help fishers to evaluate the present and future situation and to take a more qualified decision of how to adjust to the new regime.
