This group of children are exposed to triple jeopardy through break-up of the family, financial hardship, and extremes of stigma and secrecy, leading to adverse social and educational repercussions. None of the four countries so far recognises the extreme disadvantage experienced by these young people. Support available, for example, in accessing prisons and participating in prison visits is extremely variable and mainly provided through non-governmental organisations. Support for imprisoned parents, whose moral authority is diminished through their incarceration, is equally inconsistent. The COPING research strategy places the clearest emphasis on knowledge obtained directly from children and young people. The project will commission surveys of 200 children in each country aged 11-16 with an imprisoned parent, using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, to ascertain coping strategies and mental health problems for these young people, which will be compared with normative population samples. Smaller groups of children and parents will be involved in in-depth qualitative interviews to explore the impact of parental imprisonment and support services available in greater detail. Interventions to support these families will be comprehensively mapped. Children will play a prominent role in disseminating research results to policy makers and professional bodies Impacts of the COPING research will include improvements in information about this group of children; step changes in Government and public awareness about their plight; potential new legislation; and improvements in prison regimes to enable effective contact and visits for children to imprisoned", 122965.0, 3169483.0, "COPING", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_100488_994830061"], ["8GQ", "a universal thin film transistor platform for flexible and curved displays", "Smartkem Limited", "SKEM proposes a project which will accelerate the uptake of their flexible transistor platform technology (incorporating their proprietary organic semiconductor, truFLEX), into backplane drivers for the manufacture of flexible and curved electronic displays. SKEM\u2019s technology enables the low temperature processing of high performance transistors onto plastic for the first time. This allows mechanical flexibility to be combined with electronic performance previously only demonstrated by rigid inorganics, along with significant reductions to processing costs.\nThis will enable SKEM\u2019s customers to produce entirely new form factors for display-based consumer electronics: flexible, body conforming, lightweight, unbreakable devices with high resolution and low power consumption (longer battery lifetimes). This can be achieved with low risk to adoption, using refitted standard production lines. As a universal transistor platform, SKEM will supply the existing market for liquid crystal displays (LCDs), while also facilitating the new market for organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays.\nThe project will involve customer engagement (customers are already engaged in joint development work, showing commitment with signed Letters of Intent) and commercial planning (WP2), development of the technology platform to meet customer requirements (WP3), demonstration of the technology in full display devices (WP4) and preparation for commercial roll out, involving technology transfer to industrial process lines, and scale-up of truFLEX production (WP5). A strong regime of project management (WP1) dissemination and communication (WP6) will support the aims of the project. These developments will elevate the technology from initial demonstration in the relevant industrial application (TRL6 - first LCD demonstrator completed prior to project), to full commercial readiness after the project (TRL9).
