To achieve this, EPAD will also provide the analytical infrastructure to make correct observations regarding an intervention\u2019s value as an agent for secondary prevention. All this must exist in the right ethical, legal and social context. It must also be sustainable by being of value to numerous partners and stakeholders in the long term. The EPAD Consortium has been carefully designed to achieve the aim of secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nCurrent and recent drug development programmes in AD have been limited through the collection of heterogeneous samples of patients with advanced brain disease and an inability to measure effectively an index of disease course modification.\nRecruiting participants from clinics and the community for AD prevention trials with limited clinical background is both a risky and cost-inefficient strategy. Creating a disease register of people consented to enter secondary prevention trials delivers a degree of readiness that ensures better knowledge of a participants suitability and a more rapid throughput of screening for the trials. The EPAD Consortium has the necessary reach and influence from its partners to develop such a \u2018readiness\u2019 cohort.\nBy delivering an earlier, risk stratified population with run-in data in the EPAD Cohort across both clinical and biological domains; we can ensure a more homogenous population for study. We can also track changes in disease status as the basis for deciding on an intervention or combination of interventions likelihood of success in larger Phase 3 confirmatory trials.\nMost of the scientific community still consider A\uf062 dysregulation as central to AD so targeting this pathological process is a rational first step in what will be a standing trial. Other disease processes can be targeted when candidate interventions and intermediate phenotypes to reflect success are available.\nEPAD High Level Structure:\nThe IMI-EPAD Consortium will form the third part to a proposed IMI\u2013AD Platform (with IMI-EMIF-AD and IMI-Aetionomy) to produce a globally important superstructure for the secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nIMI-EPAD brings together all the major cohorts in Europe purposed for the exploration of disease processes and risks for dementia. In drawing from over 40 cohorts with almost 250,000 participants in 11 countries we have the basis for the EPAD Register from which we can draw the EPAD Cohort. Expertise in basic neurodegenerative sciences, epidemiology, statistics and trial design ensures that the standing proof of concept adaptive trial will have the optimal chance of delivering meaningful and definitive answers on an interventions likely success in confirmatory trials.\nIn establishing the International Scientific Synergy Group (ISSG) we have ensured that our work is visible to similar international initiatives and vice versa hence, through pooling know how and sharing data we can collectively overcome this devastating global disease.\nEPAD Work Packages and National Leadership:\nWe have created 8 work packages with 4 of these bound together in the EPAD Delivery Cluster which includes the scientific bedrock (WP1), the statistical engine room (WP2), the aggregation of suitable subjects (WP3) and trial delivery (WP4). These trial delivery activities are supported by project management (WP5), dissemination (WP6), business model and sustainability (WP7) and ethics, legal and social implications (WP8).

My program of work seeks to identify genes underlying both pathological and non-pathological traits that: (i) represent the extreme of a particular neurocognitive domain, and (ii) onset very early in childhood before any known environmental contributors would be expected to have much impact. The underlying hypothesis is that in some cases these traits are caused by a single genetic variant that can be identified by comparing the genomic sequence of the affected and unaffected family members.

At the cross sectional level, more leveraged banks are more likely to default, larger banks (by asset size) are more leveraged, have lower equity as a share of deposits and rely more heavily on the federal funds market to finance new loans. At the time series (aggregate) level, problem loans rise in a recession and are negatively correlated with new loan growth, the aggregate default rate is strongly countercyclical, while banks face substantial idiosyncratic (background) risk in the form of liquidity shocks through deposit changes and problem loans. We propose to build different quantitative models to understand these facts. The bank faces realistic aggregate and idiosyncratic risks in the form of problem loan processes and deposit growth. At the same time the bank faces realistic regulatory constraints like a leverage constraint. The bank chooses whether to default or not. If the bank does not default, then the bank chooses the amount of new loans to make, the amount of liquid securities to hold and the amount of borrowing on the interbank market.

In fact, if intelligently designed, these coatings can even enhance the light in- or out-coupling for existing and next-generation electronic devices, further improving device performance. In this project, new solution-processable near-IR and IR reflective coatings and mirrors (e.g. SPIRCAM) will be developed. These coatings and mirrors, which consist of novel organic-inorganic hybrid materials, will provide improved heat and light management due to their excellent near-IR (NIR)/IR reflectivity, high transparency in the UV-Visible regime, and their tunable index of refraction (n).

This system is a specialised transmembrane complex which secretes toxins and other effectors into eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. The H1-T6SS of P. aeruginosa is one of the best characterised systems and has been shown to target non-immune prokaryotic cells.

The generalisability of our results will be reinforced by a contemporaneous registry level data collection in 15-25,000 patients. Our conceptual approach is to exploit the heterogeneity in biology, care, and outcome of TBI, to discover novel pathophysiology, refine disease characterization, and identify effective clinical interventions. Key elements are the use of emerging technologies (biomarkers, genomics and advanced MR imaging) in large numbers of patients, across the entire course of TBI (from injury to late outcome) and across all severities of injury (mild to severe). Improved characterization with these tools will aid Precision Medicine, a concept recently advocated by the US National Academy of Science, facilitating targeted management for individual patients.  Our consortium includes leading experts and will bring outstanding biostatistical and neuroinformatics expertise to the project.  Collaborations with external partners, other FP7 consortia, and international links within InTBIR, will greatly augment scientific resources and broaden the global scope of our research. We anticipate that the project could revolutionize our view of TBI, leading to more effective and efficient therapy, thus improving outcome and reducing costs.

Activities spanned six research fields aimed at identifying innovative museum practices that can respond to the challenges posed by an age of intensive migration flows, fluid circulation of information, cultures and ideas, and the political, economic and cultural process of creation and consolidation of the EU. Bibliographical surveys, on-site analyses and fieldwork were carried out, including visits to case study museums, interviews with directors and curators, and in-depth visitor studies.\n\nThe project promoted a series of events designed to foster cross-disciplinary and inter-sectorial cooperation. The events included brainstorming sessions with museum practitioners, scholars, artists, policymakers and others, international conferences and a related call for papers, and public seminars at selected European museums.\n\nParticular attention was given to the implementation of various experimental actions and innovative practice-based research methods. The aim was to contribute to the development of new research tools for humanities and social sciences. Examples include research exhibitions, curatorial and artistic experimentations, applying new technologies to improve visitor interactions, innovative techniques for visitor studies, and design-based investigations.\n\nProject newsletters, the website and the blog provided constant and updated information. MELA produced project brochures illustrating key observations and recommendations in a policy-oriented form, several publications and a MeLa book series.\n\nOverall, MELA has advanced knowledge that will benefit the wider museum communities as well as policymakers and museum visitors for extended impact on cultural diversity and social cohesion.", "http://www.mela-project.eu/", "http://www.rca.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-10/163726.jpg", "fp7_99606_986206373"], ["2AZ", "Design of an Interoperable European federated Simulation network for critical InfraStructures", "Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine", "DIESIS proposes to establish the basis for a European modelling and simulation e-Infrastructure based upon open standards to foster and support research on all aspects of critical infrastructures with a specific focus on their protection.

Further, it has been demonstrated that adverse or extreme loading has a detrimental effect on implant performance. Thus, device failure still occurs too frequently leading to the conclusion that their longevity and reliability must be improved. The premise of this proposal is to realise that wear and corrosion are an inevitable consequence of all implant interfaces within contemporary total joint replacements.

I will use automorphic induction to transfer the problem to U(4) over the rational numbers, where I will use automorphy lifting theorems and results on the weight part of Serre's conjecture that I established in my earlier work to reduce the problem to proving results in small weight and level.

This will transform the subject by building the first connections between the p-adic Langlands program and the geometric Langlands program, providing an entirely new world of techniques for number theorists.

The pathogenesis of HSE remained unknown until the recent discoveries of Mendelian single-gene mutations specifically impairing immunity to HSV-1 at least in a subset of children suffering from HSE. We have identified mutations in TLR3, UNC93B, TRIF and TRAF3 in patients with isolated HSE, suggesting that impaired type I interferon (IFN) production upon stimulation of TLR3 by dsRNA viral intermediates in the CNS underlies the pathogenesis of HSE in these patients. Despite the identification of these genes, only a minority of the patients tested carried these genetic defects. Hence we hypothesize that childhood HSE is a genetically heterogeneous disease and that other single gene inborn errors of immunity may explain HSE in other patients. As a first objective, we hope to identify novel HSE-causing genes following a candidate gene approach in patients with a cellular phenotype. The TLR3-IFN pathway will be tested and the known genes sequenced.

These have been expressed in the bacteria Escherichia coli and, after thorough biophysical characterisation, they have been used to immunise rabbits. Among 17 candidates, the most promising immunogen has been selected and developed further for clinical use. The ultimate goal is to test this vaccine in phase I clinical trials using mucosal and parenteral routes of immunisation.\n\nThe vaccine generated by Euroneut-41 constitutes a novel effort to prevent HIV infection by blocking viral cell entry. Application of the vaccine could be a preventive measure against HIV infection or it could complement other approaches that aim to reduce viral load by eliciting T cell-mediated immune responses. Overall, vaccination constitutes the most effective strategy for HIV management as it can reduce the number of new infections and alter the course of the AIDS pandemic.", null, "http://www.imperial.ac.uk/", "/docs/results/images/2011-12/47617.jpg", "fp7_87833_999993468"], ["2AZ", "SMOOTH MUSCLE CELL TRANSCRIPTOMICS AND INFECTIOUS AGENTS", "Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine", "A critical event in the formation of mature atherosclerotic plaque is migration of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from the media to the intima, where they produce extra-cellular matrix (ECM) proteins, forming a fibrous cap above the pro-inflammatory and lipid core.

Typical examples are medical (i.e. implantable cardiac pacemakers) or automotive systems (i.e. vehicle stability control), in which the shortest stop in operation will cause dramatic damages. Therefore, such applications require a fault-tolerant system, which guarantees correct and reliable functioning at any time.However, as semiconductor technology scales, chips are becoming ever less reliable; prominent reasons for this phenomenon are the sheer number of transistors on a given silicon area and their shrinking device features. As a consequence, fault tolerance, e.g. provided through various redundancy schemes, has an enormously increasing power and performance cost. To make matters worse, power-density is becoming a significant limiting factor for performance and SoC design in general. In the face of such changes in the technological landscape, current solutions for fault-tolerance are expected to introduce an excessive overhead in future SoCs.

SKINSPECTION scientists set out to address these limitations through a multimodal imaging approach combining multiphoton tomography, fluorescence lifetime imaging, optoacoustic imaging (OA) and high resolution ultrasound. This offers a non-invasive method of viewing dermatological lesions with molecular analysis, subcellular resolution of the upper skin layers and temporal resolution.\n\nOA generates broadband ultrasound signals by absorption of short laser pulses allowing the capture of images down to 3 mm in depth and sub-100\u00b5m resolution. Following extensive development and certification for clinical testing, the evaluation of the platform was performed in a clinical study.\n\nOver 700 lesions were imaged and a statistical analysis of the data indicated a correlation among defined cell features and disease. Apart from excellent sensitive differentiation between lesion types, the system proved highly suitable for high resolution non-invasive imaging of subcutaneous vasculature.\n\nTaken together, the SKINSPECTION imaging platform comprises a unique tool for the detection and diagnosis of skin cancer.

C. difficile is an anaerobic Gram-positive, spore-forming enteric pathogen. After disruption of the intestinal barrier by antibiotics, spores of C. difficile germinate and bacteria multiply in the intestine. Toxins are released and cause symptoms of disease which include diarrhea, or in the worst case, pseudomembranous colitis.The crucial early step of C. difficile infection is colonization of the intestine. C. difficile, like most bacterial pathogens, displays proteins on its surface that may act as adhesins and facilitate interaction with the host in order to allow colonization.\n\nGram-positive bacteria predominantly use their thick cell wall as a platform for display of surface proteins. Cell wall surface proteins can be covalently linked to the peptidoglycan by a sortase enzyme, a membrane-associated transpeptidase. Sortase enzymes and their substrates are promising therapeutic targets for the development of novel antibiotics. To date no sortase enzyme or substrates have been described in C. difficile, although we have identified several sortase and sortase substrate genes within the genome.\n\nThe project described here will investigate the role of the C. difficile sortase enzyme and sortase substrates.

Through a bioinformatics analysis they identified a gene encoding a putative sortase enzyme and putative substrates in the genome of C.\u00a0difficile.\n\nTo delineate its role, they generated a transgenic bacterial line where sortase was conditionally expressed and unveiled its membrane localisation. A number of sortase substrates were identified, which were either secreted or required modification to be correctly translocated to the bacterial surface.

The main idea behind Implicit Human-Centred Tagging (IHCT), which is the main topic of this proposal, is automatic extraction of tags based on user's behaviour or response while watching multimedia content. The underlying assumption of IHCT is that observable nonverbal behaviour while interacting with multimedia content (e.g. affective facial expressions, head nods and shakes, laughter, pupil dilation, etc.) provide information useful for improving the tags associated with the data. As such responses are generated naturally and spontaneously, no specific effort is required from the users, and this is why the resulting tagging is said to be \u201cimplicit\u201d (rather than explicit). The main aim of the EmoTag project is to develop and evaluate an affect-sensitive implicit tagging system based on continuous assessment of affective responses of users. Specifically, the project aims to answer whether users' behaviour can be used to inform the system about the possible tags that could be used to describe the multimedia content and  how automatic tools for multimedia content tagging could be redesigned to benefit from the implicit tags.

Unfortunately, these two properties tend to be mutually exclusive in synthetic structures. Nature, however, is very effective in designing strong and tough materials through the creation of hierarchical architectures which span multiple length-scales from atomic to macroscopic dimensions. The notion of replicating natural designs (biomimetics) has generated enormous interest but has yielded few technological advances, primarily because of the lack of processing techniques able to achieve, in practical dimensions, such complex structural hierarchy. Recent results have shown how the freezing of ceramic suspensions can be used to replicate Nature\u2019s concept of hierarchical design and create strong ceramic-polymer materials with exceptional toughness, up to 300 times higher (in energy terms) than their constituents. The objective of the present grant is to follow this approach and create a new family of bio-inspired structural materials that will exhibit unprecedented combinations of strength and toughness. This will be achieved by combining new processing techniques based on the concept of ice templating with microstructural with mechanical characterization and modeling at multiple length scales, from the atomic to the macro levels.

These porous scaffolds were then filled with a metal or polymer to create composites similar to nacre. Nacre is a natural composite that exhibits fracture toughness several orders of magnitude greater than its constituent parts.\n\nResearchers also used the freeze casting process to fabricate highly porous graphene-based cellular networks. This process allowed scientists to manipulate the density, cell size and shape of the structure, thereby influencing its surface area, elasticity, specific strength, energy loss coefficient and conductivity. New applications for the process were explored, such as energy damping, compression-tolerant supercapacitors or catalysers, and any application where separation, absorption or filtration is required.\n\nThe template approach was extended to \u2018soft templates\u2019, particularly emulsions, to create complex structures. The result was responsive ceramic particles capable of assembling or disassembling in an emulsion in response to an external stimulus. This technique can be used to build ceramic scaffolds that are extremely strong and rigid, yet highly porous, which can be manipulated to control pore size.\n\nProject results have paved the way for large-scale fabrication of complex and lightweight porous structures and composites.

Asymptomatic infections likely play a crucial role in the initial invasion process and DENV transmission and, although hitherto ignored, must be addressed.\nUsing retrospective and prospective data from Asia, the main objectives of the program are (1) to identify key factors determining dengue transmission, outcome of infection and epidemics; (2) the development of novel diagnostic tools to detect asymptomatic infections. We will estimate the risk of DENV spreading to uninfected areas, especially in Southern Europe where susceptible vector exists.

There is, though, an apparent lack of solution-processable systems of  \u03ba close to 0 (i.e. are transparent) whilst n can be manipulated over a broad window \u2013 a bottleneck that has rendered fabrication of a range of optical structures impracticable, if not impossible. Here we address this issue and advance versatile, solution-processable polymer/inorganic hybrids whose refractive index n can be tuned over a wide range without compromising their transparency nor processability.\n\nThe programme will develop in three directions: i) the design of novel, solution-processable molecular hybrids; ii) the development of (nano-)fabrication technologies for the deposition and/or patterning of such hybrids; and iii) extension of the range of currently explored photonic crystals to entirely new optical devices.\n\nHence, we have identified a clear need for new materials with increased optical functionalities, and novel concepts and approaches that will allow simple fabrication of structures to light.

Recent data suggest that the incidence of NENs has increased over the last three decades. Furthermore, symptoms are frequently overlooked and subsequently, 60-80% of these tumors present with metastases at initial diagnosis. The common denominator of these tumors is their neuroendocrine origin; however, they demonstrate remarkable diversity, unique properties and different survival rates. We have little knowledge regarding the fundamental regulators of proliferation of these tumors and, hence, we have a narrow range of treatment options. We need additional biological and molecular data to enhance our knowledge on NENs, optimize patient stratification according to prognosis and to develop a more successful treatment strategy.

It represents a promising tool for better understanding of genetic data, for establishing a \u201cmetabolic signature\u201d and for interpreting epidemiology in the cell level by metabolic screening.\nAim: The aim of this study is to develop a metabolic signature of NENs that would allow stratification according to the primary tumor site and the malignant potential.

Seeking to address this need, scientists on the EU-funded METABONOMICS IN NETS project performed metabonomic analyses on samples from patients with different types of NETs. The idea was to evaluate how cancer is associated with perturbed metabolic responses and obtain data on a series of interacting metabolic networks.\n\nScientists applied a metabolic phenotyping approach to the analysis of NETs to evaluate its clinical utility for improved diagnosis and as a response to treatment.

Theoretical  understanding of  gauge theory dynamics at large values of coupling  when one cannot use the Feynman diagram perturbation theory is a major problem of physics of strong interactions. Goals include analytic computation of   mass spectrum of  hadrons, etc. The general aim of this proposal is to develop  new theoretical tools to describe strongly coupled  gauge theories. Research in the last decade brought strong evidence that connection of gauge theories  to string theory should be a key to solution of this  problem. Gauge-string duality and,  in particular,  Anti deSitter / conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence is  one of the most active directions  of current work in theory of fundamental interactions. A remarkable progress  was achieved towards quantitative   understanding of this relation  in the most  symmetric case of   maximally  supersymmetric gauge theory in flat 4 dimensions  dual to  superstring theory in curved 10-dimensional AdS5 x S5 space. We propose a detailed study of this duality from the string theory side using world-sheet methods and hidden integrability of the maximally symmetric theory. The goal is to provide  a first-principles  proof of the duality for the spectrum of states and  also to establish its validity at the level of correlation functions of conformal operators. We also plan to extend  string-theoretic approach to gauge-string duality to less symmetric cases, corresponding, in particular, to certain non-supersymmetric conformal and n=1 supersymmetric non-conformal planar gauge theories.", 1360241.0, 1360241.0, "GAUGE-STRING", null, null, null, null, "http://www.imperial.ac.uk/", null, "fp7_101677_999993468"], ["2AZ", "Cell cycle regulation of ES cell identity and reprogramming potential", "Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine", "Pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) and germ (EG) cells differ from other stem cells in several respects.

This unusual cell cycle signature is important for maintaining their identity since cell cycle arrest, or lengthening, results in irreversible differentiation, and somatic cells assume this unusual signature when successfully reprogrammed.\n\nWe have shown that ES and EG cells rapidly convert somatic cells towards pluripotency in transient heterokaryons, and this can be enhanced by genetic modification or using ES cells enriched at G2-phase. On the other hand, mouse epiblast stem (EpiS) and ES cells that lack specific repressor activities (such as Polycomb) although pluripotent, do notdominantly convert somatic cells and show increased doubling times. To determine the importance of cell cycle control for pluripotent self-renewal, we have optimised elutriation to allow the isolation of ES, EG and EpiS cells at progressive stages of the cell cycle. Pilot studies show changes in the levels of modified histones as ES cells transit the cell cycle, and increased levels of specific reprogramming factors during G2-phase. We will extend these analyses genome wide (using ChIP and RNA Seq, and high throughput proteomics) and use fluorescent microscopy to document changes in chromatin dynamics during ES cell cycle, and during somatic cell reprogramming. This will be achieved using novel micro-fluidic approaches to generate heterokaryons between ES, EG, EpiS and lymphocytes.

This impairment could be secondary, such as in the case of metabolic disorders or chronic heart failure, or could be the direct cause of physical inactivity.

The consortium partners are particularly interested in inducing cross-protective immunity and improving the immunogenicity of shigella glycoconjugates by using synthetic oligosaccharides.\n\nTo this end, scientists aim to use colonic infection animal models to test combinations of cross-protective protein antigens and the most prevalent synthetic oligosaccharides. A number of parameters that includes route of immunisation and the associated adjuvant will be optimised to elicit strong T cell responses and B/T cell memory. An important line of work entails the identification of novel correlates of protection and markers for immunomonitoring infected patients and volunteers enrolled in clinical trials.\n\nAdditionally, the consortium partners are exploring shigella and shigella-derived outer membrane proteins (GMMA) as sources for the discovery and evaluation of novel cross-protective antigens. Synthetic oligosaccharides mimic the serotype-specific determinants carried by the shigella 'O-Antigen'-one of the most prevalent shigella serotypes. When combined to form shigella semi-synthetic glycoconjugates for use in protein vaccines, immunogenicity could be improved.\n\nWith respect to ETEC antigens, the consortium has discovered a great heterogeneity among the genomes of various E. coli isolates. Bioinformatics analysis is currently being performed to identify a common set of ETEC-specific genes, preferentially encoding putative surface-exposed proteins.\n\nCandidate antigens are being produced, purified and evaluated for their capacity to confer protection in pre-clinical models.

Surgical procedures remain the options that offer the foremost success rate against such pathologies. Regretfully, surgery is not so frequent due to several limitations. Indeed, eligibility for liver surgery is based on the minimum safety liver volume remaining after resection (standardized FLR), but this minimum value varies over time and from one patient to another according to biological and mechanical properties of the liver. Since 1996, a large set of preoperative planning softwares has been developed, but all of them provide only the volume of the liver before and after resection.

The relevance of water scarcity as a stressor is more important in semi-arid regions, such as the Mediterranean basin, which are characterized by highly variable river flows and the occurrence of low flows. This has resulted in increases in frequency and magnitude of extreme flow events. Furthermore, in other European regions such as eastern Germany, western Poland and England, water demand exceeds water availability and water scarcity has become an important management issue.

The main energy demand for this method results from the O2 generation, which is usually done by air liquefaction. This energy demand can substantially be lowered using thermally integrated separation modules based on ceramic oxygen transport membranes (OTM). It is least if the OTM is integrated in a 4-end mode, which entails that the permeating oxygen is swept and directly diluted using recirculated flue gas.

Nevertheless, this seems impractical as more power would be needed to run the thermal sources. This would also make electronic devices heavy, bulky and complex.\n\nWithin the EU-funded 'Cryogenic electronics for space applications and research' (http://www.cesar-space.eu/ (CESAR)) project, researchers pioneered a technology called cryoelectronics.

Specifically, transistors based on Si germanium proved to outperform conventional Si-based transistors operating at a temperature higher than 100\u00a0Kelvins.\n\nThe next step was to determine how to create complex circuit designs using current complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology that works at temperatures as low as 4\u00a0Kelvins. The cryoelectronic circuits improved the performance of the detectors because they control amplification and filtering of signals recorded as well as the conversion of digital signals into analogue, and vice\u00a0versa.\n\nFurther developments include miniaturisation, packaging possibilities and extended functionalities for cryoelectronics.

In the present study, the hull of the wind turbine consists of a floating steel cylinder attached to the seabed through moorings, while the turbine is modelled as an actuator disc. Numerical tools capable of calculating the complete response of a floating wind turbine with fully coupled hull, moorings and wind turbine are currently at an early stage of development. An efficient strategy to minimise the computational cost is also lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, cutting-edge ocean/fluids and solids computational methods will be employed. Key components are: (a) a numerical wave deep basin that uses unstructured meshing, coupled to (b) a discrete element method for the dynamics of solids with (c) finite element modelling of stresses and (d) mesh adaptivity.\n\nThe overall deliverable is an open-source code to model the two-way coupling between fluids and floating solids.

ENTRACTE provides a deep understanding of how climate policy instruments interact with each other and with related policy instruments. It takes the \u201creal-world\u201d and its imperfections comprehensively into account and considers practical barriers in the implementation (like information asymmetry, uncertainty, political and legal constraints, behavioural aspects). ENTRACTE integrates empirical findings from ex-post assessments using broad sets of empirical data as well as ex-ante analyses with simulation models and experimental approaches with theoretical findings in order to optimize the policy mix. By adopting a project-wide harmonization of assumptions and scenarios about the current and future policy environment, ENTRACTE allows to pursue an integrated approach and and to arrive at a synthesis of research results which identifies strengths and weaknesses of different instrument mixes. Based on these findings, ENTRACTE makes a major step in providing practically applicable recommendations for policy makers on how to design the environmentally effective, economically efficient and politically and legally feasible climate policy mix needed to achieve medium-term and long-term GHG reduction targets in Europe.", 65916.0, 2998352.0, "ENTRACTE", "Comparing climate policy options", "An EU project is studying the interaction of climate policy options.

However, about 78\u00a0% of patients sought help too late due to gradual onset of RA symptoms, believing that their symptoms would resolve spontaneously. To ensure early intervention in RA, 'early arthritis recognition clinics' were opened in Europe. These clinics provided insight into onset of RA symptoms through donated blood serum samples.\n\nResearch into biological mechanisms demonstrated an auto-antibody response increasing in magnitude and complexity shortly before the onset of arthritis. Such an abnormality might serve as an early indicator of risk for RA-development, providing a window of opportunity to initiate early treatment and prevent disease onset. Numerous novel immune cells and related mechanisms were identified as potential targets for new drug therapies and treatments.\n\nMASTERSWITCH has already begun implementing findings through its early recognition clinics.

Due to their physiological constitution and stability in biological liquids these carriers hold great promise in fundamentally improving efficient drug delivery. The goal of this project is to assess the potential of shedding microvesicles as drug delivery vehicles by means of an innovative and broadly applicable assay for the detection of enzymes in living cells. Measurement of intracellular enzyme activity is crucial for the elucidation of molecular disease mechanisms and the development of efficient treatment strategies. The versatile enzyme assay is based on a novel nanoneedle system which allows parallel detection of intracellular enzyme activity. Nanoneedles are functionalized with different enzyme-specific, short fluorophore-labelled peptides. Once introduced into living cells, peptides will be cleaved intracellular releasing the fluorophore leading to a specific emission pattern depending on which intracellular enzymes are active. The assay constitutes a simple but broadly applicable technique for the measurement of any intracellular enzyme activity and can be adapted to monitor other cellular processes.

When the frontal lobes are damaged, the consequence is can be a debilitating impairment referred to as \u2018dysexecutive syndrome\u2019. Dysexecutive syndrome is one of the most commonly documented cognitive impairments across psychiatric and neurological populations. Whilst in many ways, dysexecutive patients may be unimpaired, with normal speech, perception and motor control, they are often unable to lead normal lives, because their behaviour becomes disorganised, disinhibited, maladaptive, and socially inappropriate. The long-term outlook for such patients can be particularly poor as they cannot adapt to their environments or maintain normal relationships. Despite this clinical importance, even the most rudimentary questions regarding how the frontal lobes support executive cognition remain controversial. For example, it is unknown how many specialised circuits exist within the frontal lobes or relatedly what the different forms of executive process are that those circuits support. Consequently, the questions of how dysexecutive patients should most appropriately be categorised and how they may most effectively be treated remain altogether unclear.

The area is vitally important for the reduction of GHG emissions and the resulting climate change impact of transportation.\nGENFUEL is an intersectoral collaboration that tackles fundamental challenges in understanding combustion mechanisms under highly boosted conditions that will be key to unlocking improvements in the design of a new generation of fuels. The project adopts a holistic approach with project components which study fuel engine behaviour along with safe handling technologies and life cycle analysis accounting for water use in fuel pathways.\nLong-term collaborative relationships will be established between Shell, the coordinator, and six partner universities.

Initial work in this EU-funded project has focused on identifying the 200 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that will be put on the Illumina iSelect chip, to be generated by one of the consortium partners. SNPs, the most common type of genetic variation found in the same biological species, offer information on how genetic make-up is linked to disease development and therapeutic responses.\n\nDatasets have been made up from existing genetic association studies (GWASs) in breast, prostate and ovarian cancer.

Actual genotyping has been scheduled to begin when the chip is delivered.\n\nNegotiations have been conducted for the purchase of an iCOGS chip for SNP selection and genotyping. The first cancer chip of its kind, this achievement allows for genotyping across all consortia and provides a means of eliminating candidate SNPs at each locus.\n\nThanks to advances in methods of data generation, 55 loci (18 loci for breast cancer, 27 for prostate, 6 for ovarian, 4 implicated in various other cancers) have already been examined. Data mining of data released by the 1000 Genomes Project and the Hapmap project have made it possible to compare numbers of the common variants identified.\n\nIn work investigating gene-environment interactions placing individuals at risk for cancer, study questionnaires have been uploaded onto the websites of project partners.

Immediately after differentiation, SC-CM have the characteristics of immature foetal or neonatal cells in terms of contraction, growth and intracellular signalling. To realize their full potential, they need to grow towards the adult cardiomyocyte in these respects. We have evidence that this occurs in culture, over time-frames of 3-6 months, and that reproducing the stimuli for maturation can produce or accelerate these changes.  One key maturational stimulus is thyroid hormone, and the first part of the project will apply this to SC-CM. However, the foetus has evolved sophisticated mechanisms to protect itself from maternal thyroid hormone, to prevent premature development.  Intrinsic enzyme systems and receptor expression levels carefully control the intracellular environment with respect to levels of T3, the active agent, to preserve the natural staged differentiation and maturation programme.  Particularly, an enzyme called D3 keeps levels of T3 tonically low.

Their human origin, ease of isolation and prolonged survival in culture make them ideal candidates for use in regenerative medicine. \n\nWork so far indicates that in vitro cardiac differentiation of hESCs and iPS cells produces immature cardiomyocytes similar to neonatal cells in phenotype. Accumulating evidence suggests that cardiomyocyte maturation is associated with thyroid hormones. Early in development, cardiomyocyte precursors resist the premature effect of maternal thyroid hormones through mechanisms that resemble the in vitro cardiac differentiation of stem cells. \n\nSeeking to address this issue, scientists on the EU-funded T3D3 STEM CELLS project decided to modulate the thyroid hormone pathway to obtain more mature cardiomyocytes. To this end, they evaluated the maturation impact of T3 hormone cardiomyocytes derived from either hESCs or iPS cells.\n\nThey measured a number of markers associated with cardiac differentiation to find that T3 did not affect cell size nor organisation in these cells. However, T3-treated cells exhibited an increase in spontaneous beating with altered dynamics of the intracellular calcium ion levels \u2013 key factors for  regulating heartbeat. Taken together, these findings suggested a more mature phenotype of the cardiomyocytes following treatment with T3.\n\nInterestingly, researchers found that the presence of the thyroid hormone modifying enzyme Deiodinase 3 (D3) in hESC-derived cardiomyocytes was associated with the immature phenotype. During development, D3 breaks down maternal T3 to prevent early growth and maturation of the heart. When they used an inhibitor against the D3 enzyme in combination with T3 hormone, an even greater maturation effect was seen. \n\nOverall, the findings of the T3D3 STEM CELLS study underscored the importance of the thyroid hormone pathway in cardiomyocyte differentiation.

Epigenetic reprogramming in germ line is characterized by the concomitant loss of histone variant H2A.Z and H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 histone modification marks. During the reprogramming in zygote, histone variant H2A.Z also disappears and there is a selective early incorporation of H3.3 histone variant into paternal chromatin. Histone chaperones are responsible for the incorporation and removal of histones, and Nap1l1 and Hira have been found enriched during epigenetic reprogramming in vivo. In the proposed project, we will generate Nap1l1 and Hira conditional knockout mouse models to investigate the exact role of these factors in epigenetic reprogramming in the developing germ line and in zygotes, respectively. Furthermore, using our genetic models, we will address the involvement of these chaperones in the development of early germ cells as well as in oocyte maturation and during early mouse pre-implantation development.

High-throughput techniques have implicated hundreds of genes. There are also considerable individual variations. A clinical implication of this may be inadequate treatment response, which is increasingly recognized as a cause of increased suffering and costs. Ideally, physicians should be able to routinely personalize medication based on a few diagnostic markers. Finding such markers is a formidable challenge. We hypothesize that translational clinical studies based on high-throughput genomics, advanced computing and systems biology may help to identify markers for personalized medication in complex diseases.  We organize disease-associated genes in networks that are analyzed in a top-down manner. First, modules of interacting genes with distinct biological functions are identified. Then the modules are dissected to find pathways and finally upstream genes with key regulatory functions. We use bioinformatic methods that were recently described by us in Nature Genetics and Nature Biotechnology. An important focus of this project is to develop these methods to form multi-layer modules that integrate information about disease-associated changes on the DNA, RNA and protein levels. Since these levels interact, studies of the different levels can be interactively used to cross-validate the modules. This involves both genetic and experimental studies, but the ultimate test of the modules will be if they can be used for clinical predictions. For example, changes in RNA expression may be caused by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a regulatory region. If so, the corresponding protein is tried as a marker to personalize medication. We have chosen hay fever as a model of complex disease because it is common, well-defined and readily examined in clinical and experimental studies.

Environmental, genetic and epigenetic determinants influence disease development, progression and patients\u2019 response to a particular therapy.\n\nTo prevent unnecessary cost and suffering, it would be desirable to tailor medication based on an individual patient\u2019s profile. To this end, diagnostic markers are required that can be routinely measured in the clinic.\n\nBased on this, the EU-funded 'Multi-layer network modules to identify markers for personalized medication in complex diseases' (MULTIMOD) project employed a systems medical strategy to identify markers for personalised medication. Researchers used seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) as a model disease because it represents a common, well defined disease. The external cause (pollen) is known and can be analysed at both the experimental and clinical levels.\n\nResearchers performed high-throughput microarray analyses (mRNA, exon, methylation and microRNA) of allergen-challenged T lymphocytes from SAR patients or healthy controls to identify disease-associated genes. Mapping of these genes on a network of human protein interactions revealed that they were highly interconnected and functionally related. This was based on the principle that genes whose protein products interact tend to be co-expressed and will therefore co-localise in the protein\u2013protein interaction network.\n\nThese gene clusters were termed susceptibility modules (SuM), and were subsequently analysed by bioinformatics to identify the implicated pathways. Gene expression and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from almost 5\u00a0000 subjects were combined to validate the method.\n\nResearchers found that genetic polymorphisms were more frequent in the SuM genes, including the gene FGF2, which has not been previously implicated in allergies. Analyses of other genomic layers (microRNAs, transcription factors and methylation) highlighted the importance of genome-wide epigenetics in the stratification of immune diseases. Combined, these tools facilitated the identification of prognostic protein markers for predicting patient response to medications such as glucocorticoids.\n\nFor the functional annotation and interpretation of the modules, the consortium invented new tools and databases. These linked modules and genes with biological information, genetic and phenotypic variations, as well as tissue specificity. The MULTIMOD tool for the identification of modules is available on the http://www.multimod-project.eu/\u00a0(project) website.

Their phylogenetic position has long been controversial. However, recent placement within Cnidaria makes it clear that myxozoans have undergone astonishing morphological simplification associated with the evolution of parasitism. Such simplification is characteristic of many parasites but the genetic and developmental bases are poorly understood. Myxozoa demonstrate perhaps the most extreme example of simplification known to date, lacking a nervous system, gonads, cilia and centrioles. Differing degrees of simplification within the group provide an ideal opportunity to investigate the genetic and developmental bases of morphological simplification in a comparative approach. The myxozoan Buddenbrockia plumatellae forms muscular worms with a polarised body plan while the very closely related Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae occurs as simple, unpolarised sacs. This fellowship proposes to generate transcriptomes of developmental stages from these two species by next-generation sequencing. Resulting data will be used to (i) compare developmental gene repertoires and expression levels of the two species and (ii) identify how myxozoans are related to other cnidarians. In a second step, expression patterns of developmental genes will be analysed by in situ hybridization. A third step will characterise the morphology and ultrastructure in regions of gene expression. Collectively, these investigations will provide a comprehensive picture of myxozoan development that can be compared to patterns in other myxozoans and free-living cnidarians.

The project 'Evolution and development in Myxozoa: body-plan simplification associated with endoparasitism' (MYXOZOA EVO DEVO) is the first detailed analysis of developmental processes in Myxozoa.\n\nIt compared two closely related myxozoan species on the evolutionary branch represented by the Malacosporea. One has extremely simplified morphology evident as a large immotile sac lined with a single epithelial tissue layer. The other is worm-like with longitudinal muscle between two epithelial layers imparting the capacity for locomotion.\n\nScientists carried out extensive field work to collect and culture infected host organisms. This allowed them to obtain the required tissue material containing RNA for generating transcriptomes (libraries of nearly all the genes expressed in an organism). Researchers exploited next-generation sequencing, an advanced method producing a greatly expanded range of sequences to study these non-model organisms.\n\nThe organisms produced transcripts related to neurotransmission suggesting that, despite the lack of obvious nervous system structures, some form of neurotransmission likely occurs. The neurons, like the organisms as a whole, appear to have simplified structures compared to those of higher organisms. Most genes used by higher organisms for patterning of body-plan elements or body structures exist and are expressed, although at very low levels. Continued research should elucidate how they are used.\n\nGiven recent evidence that myxozoans evolved from free-living cnidarians, it was also of interest to compare subcellular organelles in these two organisms. Scientists found highly significant similarities in proteins associated with myxozoan and cnidarian organelles thought to be homologous, supporting that hypothesis.\n\nThe database will be made publicly available, serving as an invaluable resource for researchers in the field.

Background (Why?) The Department of Health (DH) is currently introducing a new cost accounting method in NHS trusts: PLICS. This new method has the objective not only improve the quality of cost data, but to improve significantly the quality of health care. Shifting the question from where costs are produced to wherefore they are produced, the focus is on the efficiency and quality of actual health care processes rather than on units or departments. However first experiences show that some trusts failed to complete the implementation process and others having implemented PLICS struggle to transform it in an effective management tool. If individual behaviors may be at the origin of some of these failures, other failures may be linked to system-wide factors: The traditional vertical management structure of the NHS may be resistant to attempts to introduce elements allowing a horizontal perspective. The NHS would benefit from conceptual guidance on and access to critical variables of the initial PLICS implementation, subsequent PLICS-use and their link with wider systemic factors. But currently there is little conceptual guidance systematizing these critical aspects. Methods (How?)

Plant growth is regulated by developmental programmes that can be modified by environmental cues acting through endogenous signalling molecules such as plant hormones.

BRs are implicated in multiple developmental processes and as such they determine important agronomic traits including biomass, crop yield, and stress and pathogen adaptation.

FRDA is a severely debilitating disease that leads to loss of the ability to walk and dependency for all activities. Some patients have cardiomyopathy that can cause premature death, visual and auditory loss, kyphoscoliosis, pes cavus, diabetes. Onset is usually in childhood, but it may vary from infancy to adulthood. FRDA involves child health and ageing aspects. FRDA affected individuals and clinical specialists are dispersed. This is a hindrance for patients to receive the care they need, and for clinicians and researchers to make progress. EFACTS has been created to move past this limitation. EFACTS strongly believes that, 12 years after European researchers discovered the FRDA gene, frataxin, when new treatments for FRDA are being developed, the time is ripe to invest in FRDA research in a concerted Europe-wide fashion. EFACTS gathers the critical mass of researchers and clinicians to exploit the patient base, research reagents and knowledge for progress. This comes when IT can act as a crucial support for collaborative work in collecting patient data and material, making it available to leading researchers for advanced analysis, research and drug development. This project proposal has the following scientific and technological objectives: 1. Comprehensively populate a European FRDA database, linked to a bio bank; 2.

Failure to activate this process leads to multiple enzyme deficiencies, dysfunction of the respiratory chain with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and altered iron metabolism with mitochondrial iron accumulation.\n\nSince the frataxin gene fails to express in FRDA patients, restoring frataxin levels has been identified as major therapeutic target. Seminal work by an EFACTS partner using a cardiac conditional KO mouse model has provided proof-of-principle that gene replacement therapy with an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-derived vector can restore frataxin expression in the heart and prevent or reverse the progression of cardiomyopathy.\n\nWork to unravel the mechanism of frataxin gene silencing in FRDA has shown epigenetic modifications based on GAA nucleotide repeats, which could however be reversed to turn on gene expression. This observation has been recapitulated in two clinical studies, using either nicotinamide (known as vitamin B3), a class 3 HDAC inhibitor, or RG2833, a class 1 HDAC inhibitor, which were both able to restore frataxin levels in blood cells.

The Coordinating activities within SLHC-PP play a central role for the organisation of the new accelerator- and detector-upgrade collaborations, putting in place project structures and collaboration management tools, ultimately aiming for agreements on work-sharing and funding for the implementation phase. Support activities address upfront priority safety issues in the radiation protection domain. The Technical developments address the construction of prototypes of Nb-Ti high-field magnets with large aperture, the study of a new H- ion source, field stabilization in superconducting accelerating structures, and novel tracking detector power distribution.  The SLHC-PP project runs in parallel with an extensive SLHC-oriented R&D program, funded by CERN together with important contributions from many CERN member and non-member states. In order to prepare for the SLHC project implementation as a whole, the coordination tasks within SLHC-PP include the coordination of these developments carried out outside SLHC-PP.   The main aim of SLHC-PP is to prepare the SLHC project for a decision on the approval of its implementation by 2011. Beside the justification of SLHC by the physics results and operational experience from the first years of LHC running, the necessary ingredients for the approval will include: the maturity of new technologies required for SLHC, solutions for critical safety issues, and the formation of collaborations for the implementation, including the definition of work sharing and financial commitments.

These breaks increase the efficiency of homologous recombination so that, by providing an exogenous repair sequence, it is possible to repair or mutate endogenous genes. Although zinc finger engineering has reached a state of maturity, there are very few groups in the world who have the technical know-how to adopt this technology, and this has delayed general uptake.

However, to exploit this potential, a method for direct conversion of spin information into an electric signal is indispensable. Spin-charge conversion in inorganic semiconductors and metals has mainly relied on the spin-orbit interaction, a fundamental relativistic effect which couples the motion of electrons to their spins. The spin-orbit interaction causes a flow of spins, a spin current, to induce an electric field perpendicular to both the spin polarization and the flow direction of the spin current. This is called the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). We have very recently been able to observe for the first time the inverse spin-Hall effect in an organic conductor. This breakthrough raises important questions for our understanding of spin-charge conversion in materials with intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling. It also expands dramatically the range of materials and structures available to address some currently not well understood scientific questions in spintronics and opens opportunities for realising novel spintronic devices for spin-based information processing and spin caloritronic energy harvesting that make use of unique properties of hybrid, organic-inorganic structures.

Its virulence mechanisms are pleiotropic, but secretion systems have a key role in transporting effectors, toxins and other virulence factors from the bacteria into the environment or target host cells. In recent years, a novel secretion system, the Type VI secretion system (T6SS), was shown to be important for P. aeruginosa virulence. Of three T6SSs encoded on the P. aeruginosa genome, the H1-T6SS is important for P. aeruginosa to compete with other bacteria and to establish chronic infections. H1-T6SS is involved in the secretion of at least three bacteriolytic effectors, Tse1-3, whereas no effectors have been identified for H2- and H3-T6SS. We hypothesise that proteins secreted by these two systems mediate other important aspects of P. aeruginosa virulence and their identification and characterisation are crucial to further understanding the H2- and H3-T6SS function and P. aeruginosa pathogenesis. This project will identify these effectors, using three approaches: 1) identification of regulatory elements controlling H2- and H3-T6SS gene expression in order to up-regulate expression of the H2- or H3-T6SS clusters and other co-regulated genes; 2) analysis of H1-, H2- and H3-T6SS gene expression in biofilm conditions using flowcells; 3) identification of H2- and H3-T6SS secreted effector proteins via secretome analysis of strains that have up-regulated expression of H2 and H3-T6SS clusters.

One hypothesis proposes that the presence of stem cell properties in breast carcinomas hardens resistance to chemotherapy and promotes tumour recurrence. Research must discover if this tumour type originates from malignant stem cells as basal tumours show poor prognosis.\n\nTo this end, the Basal Breast Cancer project had two main objectives: to determine whether basal cell lines (normal and tumourigenic) show stem cell features; and to assess the extent to which basal cells can differentiate to myoepithelial cells. If basal carcinoma cells could be differentiated into myoepithelial cells, it would open up possibilities for novel new therapies of these aggressive cancers. The differentiation process involves isolation of cell sub-populations and testing of their ability to conduct complete myoepithelial differentiation.\n\nThe study followed up on this with gene expression profiling. Once complete, project results will give the opportunity to study human breast cancer in two ways: in silico analysis of gene expression data from basal-like tumours; and immunohistochemical studies in normal and tumour breast samples.\n\nTo date, results being reported reveal that basal cell lines show intrinsic phenotypic heterogeneity and contain sub-populations with undifferentiated stem cell-like features. This explains the mixed expression of luminal and myoepithelial markers seen in basal tumours. Also, data suggest that basal cancer cells with stem cell features may not be able to fully differentiate into myoepithelial cells, generating instead fibroblastic cells. Other progress reports offer evidence that a host of specific factors (Slug, Twist, and Zeb1) control the maintenance of a stem cell-like phenotype in normal and cancer basal cells.", null, "http://www.icr.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2011-02/45676.jpg", "fp7_88702_999460841"], ["2AZ", "Nano Optics for Molecules on Chips", "Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine", "This project aims at the demonstration of detailed control of molecules realized by means of<br/>integrated electric, magnetic, radio frequency, micro wave and optical fields.

The effect of these changes is crucial in the behavior of ultra-thin fluidfilms and fluid motion in microchannels of micro-electromechanical systems, but is essential as well in macroscopic phenomena involving interfacial singularities, such as thin-film rupture and motion of three-phase contact lines associated e.g. with droplet spreading. Interface boundaries are mesoscopic structures. While material properties vary smoothly at macroscopic distances from an interface, gradients in the normal direction of conserved parameters, such as density, are steep with strong variations as the molecular scale in the neighborhood of the interface is approached. This brings about a contradiction between the need in macroscopic description and a necessity to take into consideration microscopic factors that come to influence the fluid motion and transport on incommensurately larger scales. The aim of the proposed research is to develop a class of novel continuous models bridging the gap between molecular dynamics and conventional hydrodynamics and applicable at mesoscopic distances from gas-liquid and fluid-solid interfaces. A combination of analytical techniques, numerical modeling and computer-aided multiscale analysis will be employed.

This finding paves the way towards the design of integrated therapies for both HIV and malaria infections.\n\nThe epidemiological work of TRANSMALARIABLOC discovered that certain antibiotics posed children at risk of disease transmission.

The aim of the proposed research is to develop and test two competing models for the sympatric speciation of sister palm tree species endemic to Lord Howe Island.

The allochronic model will be based on previous work by the applicant (Devaux &amp; Lande 2008).

They sought to exploit nano-scale structure using a bottom-up approach.\n\nThe catalytically active metal complexes were linked with nanoparticles (NPs) such as polymeric gels or a class of silicone resin (silsesquioxanes). The NPs then linked to one another to produce innovative membranes of varying porosities.\n\nNovel catalyst systems using silsesquioxane-modified metal catalysts were used for continuous reactor operation with high turnover number. Several simple and economical synthesis routes were developed and patented. Scientists also demonstrated for the first time proof-of-principle for a novel class of polymer (microgel)-supported metal catalysts. These were used in two reactions and relevant patents will be filed shortly.\n\nThe consortium developed important technology for hierarchical formation of layers of NPs of homogeneous NP size and different functionalities. Data support the excellent potential of microgel NPs to yield separation membranes with tailor-made properties. Finally, commercial applications often require spiral-wound membranes, flat-sheet membranes rolled into tubular form. HICAT demonstrated fabrication of suitable membranes into spiral-wound modules, further increasing commercial applicability and readiness.\n\nPowerful novel catalysts incorporated into porous membranes of tailor-made functionality and commercially relevant shapes open up new opportunities for integrated catalysis and separation.

This technology would dramatically increase assay throughput while reducing cost.\n\nMicroarray assays are currently processed manually and require equipment not suitable for the clinical laboratory. FLUARRAY converted the sophisticated microarray technology into a simple and robust diagnostic system. This system can simultaneously process hundreds of assays on a surface area the size of a fingernail. It will be used to distinguish between haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) variants from major human and animal viruses in biological specimens.\n\nThe system essentially comprises a miniature immunoassay utilising a microarray of capture antibodies directed against the two influenza virus proteins, HA and NA. The array captures recombinant tracer proteins which are then sandwiched by a secondary fluorescently-labelled antibody. In the presence of influenza virus in the specimen, the tracer proteins are displaced by the viral antigens, causing a reduction in the recorded fluorescence signal.\n\nThe consortium has produced all the molecular components of the assay including the monoclonal antibodies and assessed its detection sensitivity. Scientists have validated the performance of the system but the desired sensitivity is yet to be achieved.\n\nConsiderable efforts were dedicated towards the production of a prototype automated microarray reading instrument that can add samples and reagents to the assay device. The instrument contains an optical module to read microarray immunoassays with a sensitivity and dynamic range similar to that of the most sophisticated microarray scanners.\n\nFLUARRAYs portable point-of-care diagnostic system will perform hundreds of distinct parallel immunoassays offering high discriminatory capacity in the diagnosis of influenza.

For many respiratory pathogens no vaccine is available, for others classical immunisations remain insufficiently effective. This project concerns the development of novel, nasal vaccines against two major respiratory pathogens, B. pertussis and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). No vaccine is yet available against RSV, and, although efficacious vaccines against pertussis are widely used, roughly 40 million cases and 200,000-400,000 pertussis-linked deaths are recorded annually, mostly in infants (<6 months) not yet sufficiently protected by the current vaccines. This proposal will yield proof of principle and provide prototypes of multivalent nasal vaccines based on attenuated B. pertussis. The concept is based on the fact that early in life, infants can mount strong anti-B. pertussis T cell responses upon natural infection in contrast to vaccination. Live attenuated B. pertussis BPZE1 has already been constructed and shown to be much more protective in infant mice after a single nasal dose than two doses of current pertussis vaccines. Immunity induced by BPZE1 will be studied in detail, and its genetic and biological stability and safety in various mouse models will be characterised. GMP lots of BPZE1 will be produced and tested for safety in a phase 1 trial in adults as a prerequisite to future trials in the target population. In parallel, human immune responses, in particular memory responses to infection and vaccination will be analysed, which will serve as a basis for immunogenic evaluations of BPZE1. Finally, we will develop BPZE1 as a vector for the presentation of heterologous RSV antigens to the respiratory mucosa. This will be tested in mouse models.

Current vaccination strategies require at least three doses to be given one or two months apart to confer protection. However, vaccination usually starts two months after birth rendering infants below the age of six months highly susceptible to infection.\n\nDespite the immaturity of the immune system at birth, previous studies showed that early vaccination with the whooping cough agent Bordetella pertussis generates a strong immune response. The EU-funded CHILD-INNOVAC project developed an attenuated B. pertussis strain called BPZE1 to be delivered as a nasal live vaccine. This would mimic the natural infection without causing disease.\n\nPre-clinical testing in various animal models ensured the safety and stability of this vaccine, making it viable for clinical development. Among the most exciting results of the project was the protective effect of BPZE1 in mice against non-related respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This intriguing protection was found to correlate with an increase in regulatory T cells, and also with IL-10 and IL-17 production.\n\nFollowing harmonisation of the study protocols for immunological evaluation, 400 children were enrolled in three countries. In order to evaluate the duration, strength and diversity of the elicited immune responses following vaccination or infection, partners developed assays for the detection of B. pertussis-specific memory T cells and antibody-secreting B cells.\n\nMethods for manufacturing a nasal vaccine for human use were developed and the vaccine was administered to healthy adult male volunteers. Trial objectives included the assessment of safety, tolerability and immune responses of the vaccine as well as the colonisation properties of the modified B. pertussis strain.\n\nBy demonstrating the safety of the BPZE1 vaccine, the CHILD-INNOVAC consortium facilitated its good manufacturing practice (GMP) production, toxicology studies and the first-in-man phase I clinical safety trial.

Both the direct applicability of dynamical systems in numerous situations of the real life and the creation of the chaos theory in the 1960s have provided a great impetus to the theory of dynamical systems in the last decades and were a main reason for its success and popularity.

Nonautonomous situations arise quite frequently in the applied sciences, for instance, in studies of pollution spreading processes in coastal environments and climate modeling.  In general, dynamical systems depend on parameters which reflect conditions influencing the system. In the dynamical bifurcation theory, the qualitative behaviour of the system under variation of these parameters is discussed.

One solution that organisms have come up with is the evolution of systems that allow them to sense and respond to their surroundings. Despite being usually complex and costly to maintain, sensing devices are widespread throughout the Tree of Life, which has puzzled researchers for years. Theory has identified a number of scenarios that promote the emergence of environmental sensing systems. Yet, most aspects of their origin and evolution remain obscure; largely due to the practical difficulties of observing these processes in real time. Here I propose to fill this gap by combining experimental evolution with the Host Group's expertise on the molecular regulation of bacterial behaviour. Methodology: The plan is to couple sudden changes in growth conditions with arbitrary environmental cues (e.g.,  toxic metals) to select for bacteria capable of reading these cues and altering their behaviour accordingly. I will target a well-studied behaviour: motility, which plays a key role in nature allowing bacteria to find good conditions and move away from threats. Using this setting, I will test decades-long hypotheses about the genetic and ecological factors that shape the emergence of novel sensing systems. Later, I will exploit the power of new DNA sequencing techniques to work out how genetic changes drive the new behaviours. Impact: This research will shed light on how readily novel sensing systems can evolve, thus contributing to efforts to understand pressing issues such as the emergence of multi-drug resistance pathogens or the response of natural populations to the current global change.

RESCEU\u2019s aim is to develop robust evidence on RSV disease burden and economic impact; create a sustainable Europe-wide multidisciplinary, multi-stakeholder community from academia, public health, scientific societies, patient organisations, regulatory agencies and industry; and provide infrastructure to perform future pivotal trials for RSV vaccines and therapeutics. RESCEU aims to provide sustainable longer term impact on RSV disease burden and thus make a significant contribution to improved health and wellbeing in Europe. \nThe project will comprise 6 work packages. WP 1-3 will identify and marshal data from large-scale systematic reviews of epidemiological and cost studies, disease registries, linked routine (national) healthcare and claims datasets and will establish a framework for and assemble data from RSV surveillance in Europe to estimate RSV disease burden on health services and inform economic models. WP4 will design and conduct prospective studies across Europe to tackle existing data gaps data gaps that cannot be addressed by WP1-3; and develop a well-annotated biobank (RESCEU biobank) of clinical samples for analysis during and beyond this project period. WP5 will analyse samples from RESCEU and other existing biobanks to identify candidate biomarkers for (severe) RSV disease using a systems approach, adopting state of the art technologies. WPs 1-5 will develop high-quality, sustainable, robust data collection systems that link closely with public health/regulatory bodies/health care providers for informing policy and regulatory processes. WP6 is devoted to project management, dissemination and outreach. At the start of the project, RESCEU will develop a governance model by which industry, public health agencies, healthcare workers, academia, patients and policy makers can collaborate effectively for global health benefit. RESCEU will combine strong leadership and highly experienced project management, including experienced and innovative partners who have already championed RSV research and led successful IMI projects.\nA key unifying mission of RESCEU will be to achieve engagement of relevant stakeholders to share resources and develop a shared understanding of RSV epidemiology and increased awareness of its impact on healthcare systems to improve strategic planning and decision making on RSV prevention and treatment. In an effort to set up a broad-based consortium, RESCEU has expanded the constituency beyond the core consortium partners by including all other relevant and interested stakeholders within and outwith EU as Associate Partners. This allows RESCEU to leverage third parties\u2019 expertise, knowledge and connections with other relevant worldwide initiatives for the benefit of the project.

We propose a highly interdisciplinary joint doctorate program realized by bringing together world-leading experts in applied mathematics, high performance computing technologies, particle and nuclear physics, fluid dynamics and life sciences to appropriately train researchers in Europe to exploit high performance computing, advance science and promote innovation. Students will be trained in mathematical and computational concepts underpinning current and future numerical simulations in turbulent flows, computational biology and lattice quantum chromodynamics. The research projects are designed to enhance collaborations and interactions across these disciplines, integrating non-academic partners, and to develop methodologies that efficiently use large-scale numerical simulations on future high performance computer systems.

Tobacco, and recently, exposure to air pollution, are considered the main causes for LC, thus specific carcinogens have been only partially identified. The complex composition of tobacco smoke and air pollution makes it difficult to identify the specific compounds responsible for the carcinogenesis process. To understand the mechanisms of LC onset, methods are needed to characterize specific toxicants that people are exposed to. We propose to develop a new method to identify exposure-specific (tobacco or air pollution) markers of LC. This new method is based on the measure of the ensemble of electrophile-carcinogens and human serum albumin adducts in human serum:  the Adductome. Electrophiles present in blood are highly reactive species that have been long suspected of causing cancer because of their ability to bind DNA and proteins. Protein adducts provide more suitable markers of exposure as they have a longer life span in the blood and are present in much higher concentrations, but have been poorly investigated. In EXACT we hypothesise that protein-carcinogen electrophiles adducts can be used as markers of LC carcinogenesis and that different markers can be identified for tobacco-induced or air pollution-induced disease. Our objective is to improve the current analytical methodology for adductomics analysis and develop a new methodology for adducts structural identification in order to characterize adduct profiles in 400 samples of human serum from the EPIC cohort.

We will accomplish this through an integrated training programme that will produce a cohort of young researchers who are able to fluidly translate between the fundamental neuro-cognitive mechanisms of object and material perception and diverse applications in virtual reality.  The training environment will provide 11 ESRs with cutting-edge, multidisciplinary projects, under the supervision of experts in visual and haptic perception, neuroimaging, modelling, material rendering and lighting design. This will provide perceptually-driven advances in graphical rendering and lighting technology for dynamic interaction with complex materials (WP1-3).

The interaction between Salmonella and host macrophages has proven to be a powerful and relevant model to study persister biology since the bacteria specifically respond to engulfment by the host defence cells by forming high proportions of persisters.

Specifically, this research will determine, for the first time, the ability of the dielectric nanoantenna to selectively enhance a molecule\u2019s electric and magnetic dipole emmisions, without perturbing the sample by undesired heating. Furthermore, this project will investigate the coupling of dielectric resonators to suitable nanomaterials for high-efficiency infrared-to-visible light conversion, and will design hybrid arrangements of dielectric and metallic nanostructures to combine the best of both worlds. Finally, dielectric metamaterials will be studied for both enhanced spectroscopies and nonlinear photonics to further improve these characteristics. The results of this work will have significant impact in a number of fields and will represent, for the case of silicon, the perfect scenario for the integration of optical nanoantennas and metamaterials with the extensively used silicon-based optoelectronics technology.", 160678.0, 160678.0, "NANO-DIELECTRICS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.imperial.ac.uk/", null, "h2020_208606_999993468"], ["2AZ", "Decoding neural circuits controlling sleep drive and sedation", "Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine", "Sleep and anaesthesia are both commonplace states that involve reversible loss of consciousness.

Chaos and chaotic systems are by their very nature unpredictable. Paradoxically, the manner in which systems transition into chaotic regimes is highly structured and rigid. This contradiction can be explained mathematically through an elegant process called renormalization. Renormalization is like a microscope which can be used to observe the shape of fractals that appear on the boundary of chaos. One aspect of the structure of chaos is that such fractals on a large scale may look nothing like each other, but as the magnification factor on the microscope is increased they look more and more alike. This is expressed by saying that renormalization converges. Convergence of renormalization has been a consistent theme since the very inception of chaos theory, thus it was believed that the structure of chaos was thoroughly understood. In an unexpected twist, the applicant recently made the groundbreaking discovery that there are natural systems for which the renormalization sometimes is convergent and at other times degenerate.

In nature, animals are continuously exposed to a diverse variety of stimuli, and interactions with con-specifics represent a particularly relevant set of them. For Drosophila males, interaction with females is key to ensure reproduction, while interaction with other males can create antagonistic fights to compete for sexual partners, food or shelter. \nThrough this project, I propose to investigate if and how social interactions affect sleep need and sleep quality. Employing fruit flies it has been previously shown that male-male interaction during the night builds up sleep pressure, observable in the next day as marked increase in sleep.

The longer an animal stay awake, the higher the sleep pressure and following rebound. Also, it has been described that previous sleep experience modulates antagonistic behaviours between males. Thus, bidirectional interplay between social interaction and sleep appears as a promising framework to address a main goal of modern neuroscience, understand how sleep is regulated and which sleep functions are.\nI intend to use new developed behavioural paradigms and software that improve sleep analysis in combination with refined genetic tools available in Drosophila to extend our knowledge on the interaction between phylogenetically conserved behaviours, social interactions and sleep, which have a high impact on reproductive fitness.", 160530.0, 160530.0, "SEX_FIGHT_SLEEP", null, null, null, null, "http://www.imperial.ac.uk/", null, "h2020_207818_999993468"], ["2AZ", "Tracking Of Plastic In Our Seas", "Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine", "The amount of plastic in our ocean is exponentially growing, with recent estimates of more than 5 million metric tonnes of plastic reaching the ocean each year.

To accomplish this we first select naturally protected individuals from high endemic regions and identify all neutralizing epitopes from the major outer membrane antigen (MOMP) of Chlamydia trachomatis through the unique combination of the B cell cloning and high density array technology. The epitopes will be produced as vaccines through the use of the immuno-repeat technology that is known to increase the quality and quantity of the vaccine promoted response. The second main objective is to develop an immunization protocol for optimal ocular mucosal immunity. To do this we will establish an ocular non-human primate (NHP) challenge model and use this to test different prime boost vaccination strategies for ocular responses and protection against challenge. We will subsequently test the best strategy in a clinical phase I evaluation of a trachoma vaccine based on a immuno-repeat construct targeting serovar B. This will provide early human proof of concept both for the immuno-repeat technology and the prime boost strategy for ocular IgA. In summary, TRACVAC will deliver a final vaccine candidate targeting the main ocular serovars and a vaccine protocol ready to enter a clinical phase I trial.\n\nTRACVAC is highly relevant for the topic (Vaccine development for malaria and/or neglected infectious diseases), as the aim is to accelerate vaccine development against the neglected infectious disease Trachoma.", 1411974.0, 5827414.0, "TracVac", null, null, null, null, "http://www.imperial.ac.uk/", null, "h2020_208491_999993468"], ["2AZ", "KIOS Research and Innovation Centre of Excellence", "Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine", "The proposed Teaming project aims to develop the KIOS Research and Innovation Centre of Excellence (KIOS CoE), for conducting multidisciplinary basic and applied research and innovation in the area of intelligent systems and networks with emphasis on monitoring, control, management and security of critical infrastructures.

In this manner, ECCL benefits from the intrinsically high reactivity of the lignin oligomers, leading to further depolymerisation (via hydrogenolysis of ether linkages) and, most importantly, to the passivation of the intermediates (via hydrodeoxygenation of aldehyde and ketone groups), thus protecting the lignin fragments from recondensation. In short, this novel approach renders a high yield of mono-aromatic products (>60%) and highly delignified pulps, allowing for the full utilisation of lignocellulose.

Currently available T2D therapies are not disease modifying: they treat hyperglycaemia without addressing its underlying cause, i.e. beta cell failure. In this proposal we seek to identify pathogenic molecular events that operate in the diseased tissue, i.e. the failing human beta cell, at their true level of complexity. T2DSystems will accomplish this ambitious goal by integrating human islet genetic and epigenetic data with disease-relevant environmental perturbations, metabolomics and functional studies, and use this knowledge to identify distinct human islet phenotypes in subgroups of patients. In closely interacting work packages, we will achieve the following goals:\n\u2022\tCompile and expand existing European bio-banks and datasets to create the Translational human pancreatic Islet Genotype tissue-Expression Resource (TIGER), a T2D systems biomedicine resource of unprecedented scale;\n\u2022\tDevelop large-scale data analysis tools and both data driven and mechanistic probabilistic modelling frameworks to exploit TIGER towards system level biological insight;\n\u2022\tTranslate these findings to identify stratified beta cell phenotypes in human cohorts. This will provide understanding of beta cell pathophysiology in vivo and enable stratified prevention and therapeutics.\nT2DSystems will enable the development of personalized diagnostic tests, taking into account individual environmental and genetic risk factors.

Furthermore, many solid tumours show a significantly increased interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) which prevents the efficient uptake of therapeutic agents. As a result, a reduction in IFP is recognized as a hallmark of therapeutic efficacy.

The aim of restoring the motor functions has moved much of the attention of clinicians and researcher towards the use of the combination of brain stimulation techniques for the assessment of cortical excitability and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) for the control of rehabilitation devices. This intervention induces cortical plasticity and reactivates the closed-loop pathway between the impaired cortical tract and the limb by using the cortical command to drive the device for the generation of the afferent volley.

However, some pathogens evade antibody responses by rapidly changing their composition. Designing vaccines that elicit antibody responses against invariant parts of the pathogen is a rational strategy to combat existing and emerging pathogens. Production of antibodies is initiated by binding of B cell receptors (BCRs) to foreign antigens presented on the surfaces of antigen presenting cells. This binding induces B cell signalling and internalisation of the antigens for presentation to helper T cells. Although it is known that T cell help controls B cell expansion and differentiation into antibody-secreting and memory B cells, how the strength of antigen binding to the BCR regulates antigen internalisation remains poorly understood. As a result, the response and the affinity maturation of individual B cell clones are difficult to predict, posing a problem for the design of next-generation vaccines. My aim is to develop an understanding of the cellular mechanisms that underlie critical B cell activation steps. My laboratory has recently described that B cells use mechanical forces to extract antigens from antigen presenting cells. We hypothesise that application of mechanical forces tests BCR binding strength and thereby regulates B cell clonal selection during antibody affinity maturation and responses to pathogen evasion. We propose to test this hypothesis by (1) determining the magnitude and timing of the forces generated by B cells, and (2) determining the role of the mechanical properties of BCR-antigen bonds in affinity maturation and (3) in the development of broadly neutralising antibodies.

Metal-free H2 activation has recently been demonstrated using the concept of \u2018frustrated Lewis pairs\u2019 (FLPs) based on main group elements such as phosphorous and boron rather than transition metals. FLPs are somewhat limited in scope due to the highly reactive Lewis acids (LAs) and bases (LBs) required for H2 activation which can lead to side reactions with substrates and solvents. The use of less reactive FLPs is restricted by the H2 activation step. This project addresses this problem by using the unique solvating ability of ionic liquids (ILs) to control the reactivity of FLPs for H2 activation. Many FLPs form ions when they react with H2. To promote H2 activation, it is essential that the reverse reaction (ion recombination to form H2) is prevented. The high ion dissociation power of ILs should prevent the recombination of these ions, leading to more efficient H2 activation. The impact of ILs on H2 activation by FLPs will be investigated in the context of synthesis and fuel cell applications. Successful use of ILs for this purpose would substantially increase the scope of FLP catalysts, reducing the reliance on transition metals thereby decreasing the potential cost and environmental impact of H2 activation processes.

As a result, the host mounts an immune reaction to combat the fungal infection. The fungus, in turn, has evolved ways to circumvent the immune reaction. This \u201carms race\u201d between fungus and host has given rise to a plethora of secreted proteins that the fungus uses to suppress the host immune responses and circumvent host defence reactions.

The modular CRL architecture is centred upon one of seven different cullin scaffold proteins which associate on one side with a RING protein that acts as receptor for an E2 ligase and, on the opposite side, with a substrate receptor (SR) that confers specificity to the complex. The multiplicity of SRs allows the recognition of many different substrates by the same CRL catalytic core. CRL-mediated ubiquitination modulates the substrate\u00b4s biological activity and in many cases targets them for proteasomal degradation. The COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex plays a fundamental role in CRL regulation both by forming stable inhibitory complexes with the CRLs where the E2 ligase and substrate binding sites are occluded, and by enzymatically removing Nedd8 (a homologue of ubiquitin) from the cullin scaffold subunit, in a process termed deneddylation, that leads to inactivation of CRLs.

The project complies with HPS\u2018s long-term policy regarding foreign internships (strengthening extant collaborations and further broadening of the host organization network) and with the ideas HPS holds concerning high quality professional internships. \r\nThe project follows previous successful projects, but it also responds to the current needs of the students/instructors at HPS. The feedback is performed through internal questionnaires, multi-level discussion (student/graduate-instructor-school management), in regular instruction, staff meetings and student assemblies. The school uses the EURES platform and organizes special seminars focused on foreign internships and/or employment opportunities on foreign labour markets. The school thus maintains its competitiveness with universities and thereby its attractiveness for future applicants. Another expected effect is broadening of the graduates\u2019 career opportunities, which is expedited by their acquisition of comprehensible European documents (Europass-Mobility, Europass-Diploma Supplement, Europass-CV) and the adoption of ECVET, which is a guarantee of quality for the potential employers. Simultaneously, general awareness about the school is spread through successful graduates, which helps its search for new professional partners. A secondary effect of the steady offer of foreign internships is high motivation for current students.\r\nSelected participants represent all departments at the HPS, i.e. Conservation and Restoration of Furniture and Non-polychromed Woodcarving, C&R of Painting and Decorative Techniques, C&R of Ceramics and Fashion and Textile Design. This concerns the second/third year students (6), graduates (14), teaching staff (6) and school management (1). Graduates are unfortunately rarely the target group of grant programmes, although it is them who attest to the qualities of their school the most. The education, however, would lose its purpose should the graduates fail to find work in their field. The support should thus be readily available in the most vulnerable stage of their career development, which is why their number is relatively high compared to the day students. \r\n\r\nThe content of the professional internships for C&R students/graduates corresponds with clearly defined units of learning outcomes for each separate department; i.e. the participant will examine, document, propose a restoration treatment and restore the assigned object. The student/graduate of the Department of Fashion and Textile Design will design an article of clothing based on the assigned criteria, justifying his/her choices, and realize it. Staff and management members will fulfil the obligatory Work Programme (job shadowing, exchange of expertise, practical work internship). All participants will also improve their language skills (some of them in two languages \u2013 in case they reach the B2 level in the main communication language, c.f. OLS) and appropriate soft skills.\r\n\r\nProject implementation consists mainly in the following steps:\r\n- selection of key activities based on the school\u2019s needs (open discussion, internal survey \u2013 appended to the application, staff meetings, student assemblies, special seminars).

EBSs are widely used in extractive industry, automotive safety, space but mostly in security and defense sectors. In the context of harsher European environmental legislation and global concern related to environmental impact and safety in manufacture, use and disposal of EBSs, technological innovations have reshaped the strategy of developers, industry and beneficiaries from the entire spectrum.  Given the fact that EU faces difficult economic times and a lot of EBS production/use capacities have been decreased, relocated or closed due to the environmental legislation or safety issues, the concrete aim of the project will be to provide an Intensive Study Programme for MSc and PhD students coming from four prestigious HEIs across Europe: University of Coimbra; Ecole Nationale Superieure De Techniques Avancees Bretagne \u2013 Brest; Imperial College Of Science, Technology And Medicine - London and Military Technical Academy \u2013 Bucharest, as program coordinator. The IP will address the latest approaches and concepts in the field of greener and safer EBSs, using ICT tools and Open Educational Resources.  This will include a wide range of multi and inter-disciplinary lectures in the following areas: Environmental impact of EBSs; Greener EM and their applications; Insensitive EM and their applications; Materials and techniques for ballistic protection (projectile, blast and shock effects mitigation); ICT tools for modeling and simulation of EBSs and protective equipment; Environmental and toxicology Life-Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) of EBSs including the use of ICT tools. The main target group of the IPs comprises 60 (2x30/IP) students from MSc (BAC + 4 years higher education graduate students) and PhD study programmes related to EBS subject, from the partner universities. A broader target group will be addressed by the dissemination activity, especially by the conferences to be organized after each IP. This group includes at least 100 young teachers, researchers, specialists from industry and governmental organizations, active in the field of EBS. The main activities of the project will consist in: 2x10 days intensive study programmes (one IP/year, during two years); 2 multiplier events (one international conference/year, during two years and one international workshop) that will bring together a minimum of 100 participants/event, national and transnational specialists from the academia, industry, research institutes, and governmental organizations; 4 transnational project meetings and numerous dissemination activities. The main beneficiaries of the IPs will be the participating students. They will have the chance to acquire knowledge and skills in the area of greener and safer EBS under the coordination and supervision of renowned European teachers and researchers. These knowledge and skills gained in cutting edge technologies during an Intensive Study Programme will provide decisive competitiveness in the EBS industry and related governmental positions. The students will have the chance of gaining experience of working in international environment. The teachers will also benefit through the exchange of ideas and best practice in the area of EBSs.  The interdisciplinary approach of the IPs will provide to the teachers and students a wider perspective over the field of greener and safer EBSs, and will enhance their skills in the area of didactical and pedagogical methods.  The IPs will facilitate further development of partnerships in the field of teacher and student mobility between the partner universities. The nature of the lectures and the broad spectrum of teachers will provide new links and opportunities for new joint degree study programs.  Besides the lectures taught during the IPs, the presentations and papers disseminated through the conferences, website, proceedings, brochures etc., will contribute to the education of numerous (more than 100) specialists from industry, government, academia, and research area. The implementation of the IPs will increase the level of cross-cultural dialogue and cooperation by the involvement of students and teachers from four countries.

Such a system is still fragmented and requires to undergo a deep process of modernization, in order to tackle an increasing intra-EU innovation divide.\r\nIn this effort, mobility plays a pivotal role pooling competences and resources without draining local and regional knowledge ecosystems. However, mobility goes beyond the transnational dimension. Indeed borders and divides are not just geographical, but can be clearly observed along other dimensions.\r\n\r\nBy referring to the EU paradox, it has been already emphasized the divide between the academic and the business/social sectors (sectoral divide). From another perspective, due to intra and inter-organizational barriers in HEIs, there is a need to tackle the divide between diverse knowledge domains (disciplinary divide). Thirdly, the need to conjugate efficiency with efficacy requires to explore smart combinations of both digital and face to face education.\r\nThe C-Extended aims at contributing to the EU effort in overcoming boundaries in HE, exploring mobility opportunities going a step further than those focused on geographical barriers. It views mobility also as that occurring from theory to practice (intersectoral) and theory to theory (interdisciplinary) while exploring new opportunities to conjugate the needs for effective physical presence with that of efficiency by means of digital technologies (blending).\r\nSuch a vision is here addressed, more specifically, by designing, testing, monitoring and evaluating an Interdisciplinary/Intersectoral/Blended-Mobility Scheme targeted to master level students in a core scientific domain (in our pilot ICT related) whom are offered to undergo, transnationally, an interdisciplinary pathway (here either energy-climate or socio-economic), engaging also in an intersectoral experience while exploiting blended learning opportunities. \r\nMore generally, the objective is to propose to policy makers a novel pathway in reforming higher education enabling new forms of intersectoral and interdisciplinary dialogues and cooperation between societal actors from the business, public and social sectors while fostering a stronger collaboration and sharing best practice within and across HEIs.\r\n\r\nThe proposed scheme will be targeted to master level students (30 in the current testing) in a core scientific domain (in our pilot ICT related) whom are offered to undergo, transnationally, an interdisciplinary pathway (here either energy-climate or socio-economic), engaging also in an intersectoral experience while exploiting blended learning opportunities. \r\nIn terms of activities, the project will design, develop and disseminate six intellectual outputs, being the key one the Interdisciplinary Intersectoral Blended Mobility Scheme (IIBMS). On the base of these outputs, learning activities are envisioned to implement the proposed mobility scheme with selected participants across the countries of the 6 partner HEIs. In particular the participants will engage in three main learning activities:\r\n\r\n1) interdisciplinary modules during standard Erasmus+ mobility scheme at participating HEIs (host universities). These are 6 per each of the 2 interdisciplinary pathways;\r\n2) blended learning activities in their home universities for the newly developed interdisciplinary modules before and after the physical mobility;\r\n3) interdisciplinary and intersectoral placement in an organization embedded in the local ecosystem of host universities relying on the project\u2019s mobility funding for up to 2 months.\r\n\r\nMethodologically, the project will rely on a mix of methods each able to match specific requirement, ranging from top-down analysis to guide the development of the proposed mobility schemes, to bottom-up through a constant monitoring, evaluation and assessment of the project development, based on the acquisition of both quantitative and qualitative data.\r\nIn terms of main results, besides the tangible outputs and the actual testing of the scheme, the project aims at disseminating and extending these results to new HEIs as well as new HE networks, both in the ICT field and in other core scientific domains. \r\nAs for the impact, the C-Extended Strategic Partnership aims to contribute towards bringing mobility schemes a step further, providing to regional, national and EU policy makers evidence based recommendations that could feed into the reflection on the evolution of successful instruments such as the Erasmus+/Erasmus Mundus or the EIT.  Indeed, beyond the currently envisioned ground testing, the main impact will be the provision of a sound and concrete instrument to transform the C-Extended experience into a seed model able to be transformed in a novel pedagogical methodology for HE.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the ultimate aim of the C-Extended is inscribed in its own name: to contribute Extending the Erasmus vision a step further.", "http://www.imperial.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT02-KA203-037004_4"], ["2DG", "Migrations - broadcasting a new outlook", "Lyc\u00e9e Francais Charles de Gaulle", 49195.0, "Background:Migrations - broadcasting a new outlook is a two-year project starting September 2016. The schools involved are I.M.S. \"Regina Margherita\" from Palermo, Italy, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Charles de Gaulle from London, the UK, and Ivalon lukio (Ivalo Upper Secondary School) from Ivalo, Finland. The Italian and Finnish schools have a long history together in previous Comenius and IPM projects;  the Italian school and the UK school have a common history of cooperating from previous years. The three schools represent Mediterranean, Central and Northern Europe as well as large and small schools. The project aims at combining a current topic with a modern tool: migrations in Europe and web radio broadcasts.Objectives:Participants will become aware of the history of Europeans as a migratory population, how migration affect our lives, and what are the causes and consequences of refugees and migrants today. Other objectives are exchanging opinions on the topic, to contribute to the debate on migratory policies with the aim to break down barriers, to learn how to communicate one's ideas in debates, researches, interviews and to learn how to use and manage a web radio which aims to spread opinions and ideas transnationally. The students will also improve their skills in English and ICT and they will get a broader view of life around Europe by participating in the project meetings in Ivalo, London, Palermo and Rome.Number and profile of participants:There are three schools around Europe: 1) I.M.S\"Regina Margherita\" in Palermo is a Lyceum with Communication as a main point in their teaching objectives and with more than 2 000 students. The school also collaborates in the promotion of activities and projects of the European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education, along with other programmes which promote foreign and second language development. 2) Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais \"Charles de Gaulle\" in London with 4000 students, mostly from families with French background but also British and many other nationalities are represented in the pupils of the school. 3) Ivalon lukio is a small upper secondary school with about 100 students providing general secondary education in the far north of Finland. The distinctive features of the area are long distances, three S\u00e1mi languages and cultures coexisting with the Finnish language and culture, (Inari S\u00e1mi, Northern S\u00e1mi and Scolt S\u00e1mi). The school has an important task to support these languages and cultures, to help keep the only indigenous peoples in Europe and their languages alive. Description of activities:The starting point is the history of migrations in Europe. Students will do research on migrations yesterday and today to understand the causes and consequences of them. Students will look into the situation today mainly from the point of view of culture, music, sports and literature. They will familiarize themselves with ethnic music and artists with various backgrounds, sports teams with players around Europe and some literary extracts depicting the life of immigrants and refugees in their new homelands. Students will make eg interviews and give musical performances which will be broadcast using web radios. They will also learn to communicate their views, opinions, research etc and learn how radio programmes are made. This will be done during ordinary lessons and during project meetings where workshops will be organized to prepare the material. They will learn how to collaborate with each other in English and improve their ICT skills by using online tools in their work.Methodology to be used in carrying out the project: Social reserach mehtod, learning by doing, hands-on method and peer learning will be in use. Ivalon lukio will create a web page where the results of the project can be seen. Suitable eTwinning tools will be taken in use, as well. A Facebook group will be created and ICT will be used when ever it is possible. Web radio broadcasts will be online so that everybody can have access to them fast and easily. A short description of the results and impact envisaged:Students will understand the history of Europeans as a migratory population, the causes and consequences of modern migration and the situation of the refugees, and how this all affects our lives in different parts of Europe. In addition, they will learn how to communicate their ideas via online radio broadcasts, how to do research and make interviews. They will improve their group work skills, English and ICT skills, as well. Students will be introduced new learning environments and new learning methods. Participating students, teachers and hosting families will make new friendships with foreign peers which will, hopefully, last for long. They will get a broader view of life in Europe when attending project meetings, a deeper insight in school systems in different countries, a better understanding of  the situation of refugees and migrants, and receive knowhow in digital radio work.", null, null, "erasmus_2016-1-FI01-KA219-022726_2"], ["2AZ", "Active Campus Europe", "IMPERIAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE", 324717.0, "Active Campus Europe (ACE) is designed as a sustainable collaboration with the aim to promote health-enhanching physical activities within university setting in Europe. 16 partner universities from 7 countries intend to create through ACE a role model for the University setting in Europe.
