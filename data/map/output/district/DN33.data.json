We hope that these changes will leave us better placed to confront the challenges and needs of modern society. After a participative process including all the schools which form a part of our institution .We believe that it is vital that we observe and analyse other education systems and methodologies in order that we can be better informed while making these important changes.\r\n \r\nThe activities that we believe are useful to us in our development project are as follows:\r\n\r\n-In regards to new experiential modern methodologies where the student is the protagonist in their learning, we have chosen a structured course in Reggio Emilia and two observation periods in three schools in the following countries: The United Kingdom, Finland and Estonia.\r\n\r\n-In regards to new technologies in education and AICLE we have chosen two structural courses in the United Kingdom.\r\n-Finally our management team school will visit a school in Estonia in order to observe the management and organization of the institution.\r\n\r\nThe participants attending the aforementioned structured courses have differing and distinct profiles, initially there will be an infant\u2019s school teacher trained in this pedagogy and another from the first stage of primary education. There will also be a representative for all the departments who use English as a vehicle language when teaching. English, Physical Education, Information technologies and art.\r\n\r\nDuring the observation periods the participants will all belong to the management and innovation team of our school. Therefore they already have the sufficient knowledge and skills to implement little by little the necessary changes.\r\n\r\nFollowing the aforementioned activities in the project we believe the results will be gradual. The benefits of this project will be long term and in the short term we can experiment with small changes in management, organisation and methodologies .Furthermore one of the first things we intend to do is to transfer all the knowledge and lived experiences taken from this project to our fellow teaching colleagues. It is through this process we intend to begin constructing a new school.", "http://www.scarthojunior.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-037643_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DN33"}
