These oil additives, through tribochemical interaction with the surface, produce nanostructured composite, self-healing and smart tribofilms at the surface. 2020 Interface involves the design of the complete system; functionalised Diamond-like Carbon (DLC) coating and future generation lubricant to enable the Europe\u2019s stretching targets in fuel economy and durability to be met. There has been much emphasis in research on designing new coatings technology such that the degree of complexity of surface systems has increased dramatically over the last decade. In boundary lubricated contacts, it is the interfacial nanostructured film, which results from tribochemical interactions between the surface and the lubricant additives, which dictates the system performance. No attempts have been made to incorporate \u201cdesign\u201d strategies into optimizing this interface and 2020 Interface tackles this through an interdisciplinary integrated experimental and theoretical approach. The benefits of this approach are accrued from substantial improved fuel economy (protection of natural resources), reduced emissions (protection of the environment) and improved durability (lower waste and maintenance). As the number of vehicles in the globe increases year on year without showing signs of reaching a plateau and the internal combustion engine remains the major platform for powertrain for the foreseeable future, the impact of this project will be large and long lasting. 2020 Interface brings together a world class consortium of 4 Universities, 1 research institute and 4 leading multinational companies from 8 EU countries together in complete supply chain to deliver fast track radical innovation in nanoscience through to a full set of novel lubrication technology platforms, for commercial applications in diesel and", 132361.0, 3283154.0, "2020 INTERFACE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.lubrizol.com", null, "fp7_93335_995282081"], ["2TH", "An innovative phosphorus rich intumescent oligomer enabling commercially competitive high performance halogen free fire protection of polypropylene", "Prometheus Developments Ltd", "Offering good performance at low cost, polypropylene (PP) is a popular commodity plastic within many market sectors. However, due to its high flammability and low charring nature, PP is difficult to fire protected. Whist brominated flame retardants (FRs) are able to achieve excellent FR performance at moderate cost and with little impact on polymer properties, they release toxic and corrosive smoke during fire, are potentially harmful to the environment and restrict PP recyclability. There is thus increased legislative and political pressure for a reduction in halogen FR use. Existing halogen free PP flame retardants are based on low performance & low cost mineral FR additives or high performance & high cost intumescent systems, both requiring high to moderate loadings thereby impacting on polymer properties and restricting use for high performance applications.\n\n\u2018Mixed intumescent polymeric salts\u2019 (MIPS) are a novel cost efficient high performance intumescent FR additive. Utilising phosphorous rich oligomers synthesised from readily available raw materials, the MIPS chemistry integrates the essential components for intumescence within one molecule, locked in a reaction state immediately preceding intumescence, thereby enabling:\n- High performance at reduced loading: Rapid and efficient intumescence at low temperatures achieving enhanced flame retardancy and smoke suppression;\n- Cost Competitiveness: Low cost additive manufacture combined with reduced loading enabling additive package pricing in-line with halogen based systems;\n- Superior physical and mechanical properties: non-particulate and oligomeric nature (melt blendable) and reduced loading levels, achieving significantly reduced impact on base polymer properties;\n\nPP-MIPS will further advance \u2018MIPS\u2019 as an intumescent fire protection chemistry for PP, targeting commercial competitiveness with halogen based FR systems and enabling their replacement for high performance applications. The PP-MIPS compounds will be demonstrated for two high profile case study applications: 1) halogen free UL94-V2 rated PP fibres; and 2) NFPA-262 rated cable insulation jackets. Such applications are currently only possible using halogenated polymer compounds.

EU-funded scientists laid the groundwork for development of eco-friendly fire protection compatible with stringent requirements.", "Cost-effective and high-performance PP is highly flammable yet difficult to protect against fire. Conventional halogenated flame retardants (treated with chemicals in the halogen group, including bromine) serve their designated function well without affecting polymer properties. However, they release toxic and corrosive smoke when heated excessively. Currently available halogen-free products, while effective against fire, require high loadings that have a detrimental effect on polymer properties.\n\nMixed intumescent polymeric salts (MIPS) are an inexpensive yet high-performance alternative. Intumescent chemical systems expand into thick insulating chars when exposed to high temperatures. They provide protection to underlying systems both through endothermal chemical reactions (that absorb heat) and by providing a physical barrier to heat transfer. Scientists have advanced the state of MIPS for PP fire protection through work on the project http://www.pp-mips.eu/ (PP-MIPS).\n\nThey focused on two high-performance applications that are currently only possible using halogenated polymers. These were PP fibres meeting protective clothing standards and PP cable insulation jackets achieving the strictest international performance standards.\n\nMIPS chemistry based on easily synthesised phosphorous-rich compounds combines the essential reaction components in a single molecule one step away from intumescence. Scientists focused on formulations with higher activation temperature and greater resistance to decomposition.\n\nWork included scaling up production of MIPS to supply the quantities needed for testing. Investigators also conducted numerous processing trials to assess whether or not the MIPS affected polymer processing capabilities or mechanical properties of components.\n\nThe vast amount of knowledge accumulated within the scope of the PP-MIPS project has brought eco-friendly fire protection for PP to a mature stage for final optimisation. The rival to conventional halogenated plastics is sure to make a splash given the pressing need to find a replacement fulfilling stricter regulations.", null, "http://prometheusdevelopments.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/149440.jpg", "fp7_96461_985060124"], ["4AN", "Demonstration of 2nd Generation Vegetable Oil Fuels in Advanced Engines", "Lubrizol Limited", "Pure vegetable oil use as engine fuel has the potential for the most comprehensive ecologic, economic and social benefits of all biofuels. The production involves few process steps and can be done economically with small production units. The production process has only small energy losses and provides potential for additional income generation on farms, thereby strengthening rural economic structures. The challenges to be met by pure vegetable oil are engine adaptation, fuel quality control, emissions control and limits to overall production potential. State-of-the-art concepts allow for achieving EURO3 emission levels for road vehicles in specifically adapted diesel engines for rape seed oil fitting to the German pre-norm DIN V 51605. However, advanced biofuels should allow that emissions keep within the limits of the forthcoming EURO6 norm for road vehicles and EU Stage 4 / US Final TIER4 for non-road vehicles. This proposal covers research and demonstration on 2nd generation vegetable oil fuels in advanced engines. It follows a double strategy: engines as well as the fuel are adapted such that both match and the combination allows for achieving high engine performance at minimum fuel consumption fitting with most severe emission limits. The objectives are (1) to widen the range of considered oils, (2) to research on and demonstrate additives for vegetable oils, (3) to research on and demonstrate improved engine oils, (4) to achieve EU stage 4 / US TIER4 emission levels in medium-scale demonstration fleets running in France, Austria, Germany and Poland, (5) to transfer the engine and fuel concepts to hybrid engines, allowing to achieve forthcoming EURO6 emission levels, (6) to prepare proposals for future fuel standards.
