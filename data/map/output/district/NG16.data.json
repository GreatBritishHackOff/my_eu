At the forefront of combating this issue are low carbon technologies. Recently, HEV (Hybrid Electric Vehicles) have come forward as the most achievable solution of the moment. At present, HEV use expensive Lithium ion and NiM batteries due to their high power to weight ratio. Lead-acid batteries are a cheaper option, but due to their lower power to weight ratio they are not used.\n\nThe MEMLAB project aims to solve this through the development of lightweight electrodes for use in lead-acid batteries. The project will use state-of-the-art fibre production technology to create titanium and aluminium fibre networks. These will be coated in lead and lead oxide. The objective is to achieve a greater than 50% reduction in the overall weight of a lead-acid battery thereby significantly increasing their power to weight ratio making them a realistic alternative for application in hybrid electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition to application in the hybrid electric vehicle market, the replacement of standard lead-acid batteries, containing large and heavy quantities of lead, by lightweight lead-acid batteries will also lead to a significant reduction in the polluting effect of road-going vehicles due to the large quantity of vehicles in use. The number of lead-acid batteries currently manufactured in Europe is approximately 70 million per year.\n\nThe project consortium has been specifically constructed so that the research partners deliver the technical research required by the SME consortium partners. Successful completion of project MEMLAB will significantly strengthen the competitive position of the participating SMEs by both opening new markets, hybrid electric vehicles, and expanding opportunities in existing markets, lead-acid batteries. Furthermore, the project consortium will also seek to identify and evaluate further market applications, for example industrial filtration as well as fuel cells.", 278476.0, 1221355.0, "MEMLAB", "Lighter batteries for cars", "New lightweight electrodes for lead-acid batteries will reduce vehicle emissions and power the next generation of environment-friendly vehicles.", "Climate change can be combated through low carbon technology, which includes the development of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Lithium-ion and nickel-metal hydride batteries are used in HEVs due to their high power-to-weight ratio \u2014 but they are expensive. Lead-acid batteries may be cheaper, but are unsuitable because of their lower power-to-weight ratio.\n\nThe 'Melt spun and sintered metal fibre networks for lead-acid battery advancement' (http://www.memlab.eu (MEMLAB)) project was established to solve this problem by developing lightweight electrodes for lead-acid batteries using state-of-the-art fibre production technology. The fibres are coated with titanium and aluminium to form the battery electrode. This reduces by half the weight of lead-acid batteries, thereby dramatically improving power-to-weight ratio and enabling their use in HEVs.\n\nAround 70 million lead-acid batteries are manufactured in Europe each year. Replacing standard lead-acid batteries with the new lightweight battery will therefore help to reduce the quantity of lead used and limit pollution from road vehicles. \n\nSamples of melt spun aluminium and titanium fibres have already been successfully produced by the MEMLAB consortium. The fibres were characterised using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. In addition, aluminium and titanium metal fibre networks (MFNs) have been manufactured and new methods for the coating of electrode substrates investigated.\n\nMEMLAB is now able to produce MFNs from titanium and aluminium and to deposit lead on top of these MFNs. The performance of these new electrodes and their suitability for application in lead-acid batteries will be assessed.\n\nThe work conducted will help the participating small businesses to compete more effectively in new and existing markets.

The extruded Al can be used as is, cut in smaller pieces or used as feedstock for other processes.\n\nScientists are developing a controlled quenching and heat-extraction system for high-grade heat recovery at the profile cooling stage. This will be reused in the energy-intensive heat-ageing process with EU funding of the project http://www.ecoquench.eu/ (ECOQUENCH) . The technology is expected to recover 50 % of energy wasted during spray quenching and to reduce scrap produced at this stage by 25 %.\n\nDuring the first project phase, researchers established the optimal cooling rates for various extruded Al profiles. They investigated a number of oils to be used in the spray quenching process. The selection of candidates was complicated by a number of factors, including the high temperatures to be withstood. This meant that substances with low flash points (temperatures at which they can be ignited in air) such as mineral oil were unsuitable. The team finally determined that synthetic esters were the best candidates and selected one with high flash point, high self-ignition temperature, inertness and safety. \n\nScientists also conducted thermodynamic analyses of spray quenching and developed a test rig to evaluate both the nozzle design and the spray quenching thermodynamics. The entire spray system has now been designed, including air cooling, oil spraying, recirculation and removal of oil from the piece. Investigations of energy recovery during the spray quenching process have begun and will continue during the next project phase. \n\nECOQUENCH plans to deliver an energy-efficient and cost-effective technology for cooling extruded Al that will drastically reduce emissions and material waste.

This can be designed to be stiff (maintaining its position) whilst being light weight. For a similar sized currently used heliostat CSP, the structure would be self supporting (Sandwich structure) the weight would be 627kg, giving a weight saving of 80% of the backed structure and 23% of the unreinforced glass collector.\n\nThis weight saving has benefits in terms of installation and transportation, but the main advantage of the weight saving is, the energy required to adjust the collector would be greatly reduced thus a reduced energy control system could move the collectors during service. With the metal components removed, corrosion resistance is greatly reduced.\nAn advantage of a carbon fibre structure is the low coefficient of thermal expansion. In the areas that will benefit most from a CSP, the arid conditions produce high temperature variations daily.\n\nThe technical goal of this project is to produce lightweight yet robust components for CSP\ncollector components. Materials and processes will be identified and exploited to optimise the product and issues preventing optimisation will be investigated and solved. This proposal will have several aspects of work.

If flaws in a structure can be identified early, the cost of repair will be vastly reduced, and here an effective monitoring system would allow identifying the optimum time to repair as well as improving structural safety. But safety is difficult to quantify and requires a deep understanding of the uncertainty associated to measurements and models for the structure and the loads. TRUSS will gather this understanding by bringing together an intersectoral and multidisciplinary collaboration between 4 Universities, 11 Industry participants and 1 research institute from 6 European countries. The consortium will combine and share expertise to offer training at an advanced level as new concepts for monitoring, modelling and reliability analysis of structures are emerging all the time.

The training programme will be structured into taught modules combined with original research supported by secondments that will expose 14 fellows to both academia and industry.

Capturing 4% of this market by titanium fibre substrate technology will require 3 million of these batteries and 301 tonnes of titanium fibre production yearly. Currently titanium fibre is used only for very specific applications  due to the complexity of the production process and high price. In order to satisfy the new market opportunity, a melting and casting process capable of producing fibres directly from a melt using scrap as a source is required to reduce costs of the fibres. We have developed a 200g prototype PMO system through a new process by integrating plasma arc melting to our unique melt over flow process. This is capable to produce titanium fibre from titanium scrap with specific shape required for the battery. Our system is 41 times cheaper and will create several new titanium fibre market applications. In order to be commercially viable, we would need to upgrade our PMO system from 200g to 50kg capacity, which would be able to produce 550 tonnes of titanium fibres per year. \n\nThe PMO process can be applied to produce other metallic fibres e.g. FeCrAl alloy fibres to be used as the advanced catalyst coating substrate material for self-regenerative Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs). FeCrAl alloy substrate is a good candidate for the next generation of DPFs due to its advantages of reduced cost and superior performance in filtration efficiency (more than 90%) and passive regeneration through soot burn-off.
