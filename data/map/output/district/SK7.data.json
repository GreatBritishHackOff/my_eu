The AquaMar project will develop and provide downstream services turning Marine Core Service products into WQ services, demanded by end user. The team is composed mainly of SMEs (70%) supported by key scientific partners. The objective is to create a reference technical and organisational body at European level for WQ services, organised as an open partnership, through: \u00b7 methodological research extending traditional WQ portfolio along 5 novel product lines \u00b7 turning these into pre-operational services, including adaptation to MCS \u00b7 establishing a validation &amp; quality evolution process and data model \u00b7 evaluate the services with end users through service delivery trials \u00b7 transferring the developed services to other services providers (SP) through a well defined process (technical and organisational framework). The service portfolio includes (1) indicators for the reporting requirement of the Water Framework Directive and the European Marine Strategy, (2) algal bloom forecasting, (3) support to large scale marine infra., (4) services supporting the Bathing Water directive monitoring, (5) aquaculture precision farming. This is complemented by research on methods for improved standard WQ products, geostatistics, and distribution tech., to be used across the service portfolio. In parallel, a validation and quality evolution strategy is developed and applied, including the services sustainability wrt new space sensors. A user &amp; customer board is steering the project, participating in the trials and providing feedback to the MCS, the validation and research activities. The aim is to prepare the ground for a sustainable continuation and growth of WQ services, starting from heritage of 3 GSE projects (CoastWatch, ROSES, MarCoast) comprising a baseline portfolio of standard WQ products, a European wide user base and SP networ", 79167.0, 4118161.0, "AQUAMAR", "Keeping the marine environment clean", "Europe's marine ecosystems are vulnerable to pollution and climate change.

Project partners surpassed the current state of the art with their innovative products based on advanced software algorithms and remote sensing techniques. The products are applicable to all relevant water types.\n\nAQUAMAR's portfolio of services includes indicators for reporting requirements of the Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy, and algal bloom forecasting. Other services include monitoring of offshore activities related to large-scale marine infrastructure and aquaculture. The team also carried out monitoring work in support of the Bathing Water Directive.\n\nTrials were conducted during an intensive validation phase for each of the service lines, ensuring their accuracy and value towards user requirements and practices. Gaps in the technology and further elements for improvement were also identified. Furthermore, the new products and methods were integrated into MARCOAST2, an EU-funded initiative that uses satellite data to monitor marine water quality.\n\nAQUARMAR successfully developed and tested new water quality products and disseminated its results to decision makers and end users to build a user community. The results were also used in the drafting of a roadmap for achieving a sustainable water quality services network at the European scale, in conjunction with MARCOAST2.\n\nThe products and services developed through AQUAMAR will help conserve the marine environment by improving the sustainability of Europe's aquaculture industry and offshore installations.", "http://www.aquamar-fp7.eu/", "http://www.satoc.eu", "/docs/results/images/2014/147518.jpg", "fp7_94247_997874600"], ["2DG", "Improvement of the plastic packaging waste chain from a circular economy approach", "Axion Recycling Ltd", "The European plastic market is not currently aligned with the circular economy. More than 25.8 million tonnes of plastic waste are produced per year in the EU28 being recycled only 29.7%. This represents a clear loose in the plastic market loop (losses of \u20ac10.56bn). Moreover, this goes against the EU legislation on waste (high environmental impact; 23.8 Mt of CO2). \nLow recycling rates of plastic are mainly due to the situation of packaging waste (i.e. main plastic waste fraction), since it is mainly domestic residue and consequently the quality of the material collected depends on the system of segregation available and the environmental awareness of citizens.\n\nPlastiCircle aims to develop and implement a holistic process to increase recycling rates of packaging waste in Europe. This will allow to reprocess again plastic waste in the same value chain (i.e. Circular economy; closure of plastic loop). This process is based on four axes: collection (to increase quantity of packaging collected), transport (to reduce costs of recovered plastic), sorting (to increase quality of recovered plastic), and valorization in value-added products (i.e. foam boards, automotive parts like engine covers/bumpers/dashboards, bituminous roofing membranes, garbage bags, asphalt sheets/roofing felts and urban furniture like fences/benches/protection walls). \n\nThe target is to increase collection from 81.7% to 87% and valorization in a 9.8%. The implementation of PlastiCircle approach in Europe have the potential to increase collected plastic in 861,250t (reaching 14.14 Mt) and valorization in 1.59Mt. The valorization of this new material, represents a market value of \u20ac2.86bn-\u20ac7.95bn. Taking into account current figures of the plastic sector (turnover \u20ac350bn, 62,000 companies, 1.45M employees), this could imply creation of 500-1400 new companies and the generation of 11,900-33,000 new jobs in the medium to long term if PlastiCircle approach is extended in a EU level.", 227409.0, 7583191.0, "PlastiCircle", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_210517_950875093"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2DG", "AXION RECYCLING LTD*", 226906.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_3685", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "SK7"}
