We are committed to improve the conditions of access to raw materials, be it within Europe or by creating a level playing field in accessing such materials from abroad.\u201d The global dimension of access to raw materials was on the agenda of the G8 Summit on June 2007. On that occasion a Declaration on &quot;Responsibility for raw materials: transparency and sustainable growth&quot; was adopted. Several national and international initiatives, both from the private or the institutional sectors, arised to address the sustainable development of the extractive industry and the reduction of its environmental footprint. Meanwhile, the extractive industry is facing increasing environmental and societal pressures, being regulatory or not, during all phases of a project, from exploration to exploitation and closure. The social acceptability of a project is among the major key issues to be dealt with. EO-MINERS scientific and technical objectives are to: - assess policy requirements at macro (public) and micro (mining companies) levels and define environmental, socio-economic, societal and sustainable development criteria and indicators to be possibly dealt using EO - use existing EO knowledge and carry out new developments on demonstration sites to further demonstrate the capabilities of integrated EO-based methods and tools in monitoring, managing and contributing reducing the environmental and societal footprints of the extractive industry during all phases of a mining project, from the exploration to the exploitation and closure stages - contribute making available reliable and objective information about affected ecosystems, populations and societies, to serve as a basis for a sound \u201ctrialogue\u201d between industrialists, governmental organisations and stakeholder", 212591.0, 3508269.0, "EO-MINERS", "Keeping a close eye on mining operations", "Earth Observation (EO) services are being developed by EU researchers to monitor the impact of mining. To take the appropriate action, we must find out how mining activities are affecting our environment.", "In recent years, an increasing percentage of the raw materials such as minerals that the EU consumes has been imported. This means that the environmental footprint of the EU's material consumption has shifted from Europe to other parts of the world. Thus, understanding and monitoring pollution processes in mining areas is of global concern.\n\nEO methods are required to monitor and observe the environmental and societal impacts of mining. These include satellites in space and sensors on the ground, at sea or in the air. The EO-Miners project, funded by the EU, will use EO-based methodology and tools to monitor the exploration and mining of mineral resources.\n\nAn extensive review of stakeholder policies related to the impact of the mining and mineral industry has been carried out by the project. Interviews and meetings of local stakeholders have been conducted at mines in the Czech Republic, Kyrgyzstan and South Africa. In addition, a considerable amount of EO-based data and other information has been collected about these mining test sites.\n\nBased on the policy analysis, the EO-Miners project has identified a list of over 50 relevant indicators. These will be used to assess the environmental, socioeconomic and societal footprints of the mineral extraction industry at every stage, from site exploration through exploitation until closure.\n\nThe EO-Miners project has laid the foundations for environmental monitoring of the test sites. Based on further results, the project will develop a 'trialogue' between the three main groups involved. These three-way discussions will help reconcile interests so as to reach a common agreement on actions to deal with the environmental and societal impacts of mining activities.", null, "http://www.miro.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2013-03/54015.jpg", "fp7_93567_997753350"], ["9PB", "Develop of a new and highly effective modeling and monitoring Energy Management System technique in order to improve Energy Efficiency and move to a low CO2 emission in the energy intensive non-metal", "Mineral Industry Research Organisation", "The EE-QUARRY project emerges from the necessity to control a very demanding energy-intensive industry, which characterizes from its high energy demands and enormous CO2 emissions. The goal is to improve energy efficiency and to reduce CO2 on quarries, through the develop of a new and highly effective modeling and monitoring Energy Management System technique. The use of crushed stone could increase at a quicker rate than any other major material use. Given the market size, ample resources and stable growth potential of this industry, the understanding and dissemination of energy efficiency opportunities is paramount for European energy efficiency goals. Further, since there are literally several thousands facilities throughout Europe, there is a huge opportunity for replicability of identified energy efficiency measures. This project will first review the stone mining and crushing production processes. It is also important to show that energy use is focused in rock blasting, shot-rock transportation, rock crushing, conveying and screening. As such, standard building energy efficiency measures such as lighting retrofits and support system optimization have small impacts on overall plant energy use. The identification of energy opportunities thus relies heavily on systems optimization. System optimization not only encourages energy efficiency, but typically benefits production as well. Coupled with productivity improvements, the economic incentives for energy efficiency measures in this industry have the magnitude and quick payback that could facilitate industry-wide replication. Once the whole extracting industry process is over, and the quarry plant arrives to the end of its life cycle, many CO2 neutralizing activities will take place. The goal is to generate EE opportunities and CO2 compensation activities due to the environmental impact created in its life time cycle.", null, 5361693.0, "EE-QUARRY", null, null, null, null, "http://www.miro.co.uk", null, "fp7_100467_997753350"], ["9PB", "Innovative Technologies and Concepts for the Intelligent Deep Mine of the Future", "Mineral Industry Research Organisation", "The mine of the future will exploit mineral raw materials at greater depths than today, requiring completely different approaches compared to today\u2019s deep mines, in order to get mineral rights.

The mine of tomorrow will run an integrated concept. All operations necessary for the eco-efficient provision of the minerals including waste management will be carried out underground. This will drastically reduce the volumes being transported, minimising above ground installations and thus the environmental impact.\nIntelliMine will develop innovative methods, technologies, machines and equipment for the safe, eco-innovative, intelligent and economical exploitation of mineral raw materials in the EU, including maintenance issues, especially at greater depths. It will investigate autonomous, highly selective mineral extraction processes and machinery based on new sensor technologies as well as innovative concepts for mass flow management and transportation. Such investigations have to be accompanied by rock mechanics and ground control issues as well as health, safety and environmental issues.\nThe concept of an invisible, zero-impact mine requires a refined process underground that selectively extracts the minerals and therefore reduces waste production closer to the mineralisation. Therefore improved near to face processing methods including backfill procedures need to be developed.

This is based on new sensor technologies, face front separation as well as innovative concepts for mass flow management and transportation integrating state-of-the-art technologies.\n\nProject partners have already developed integrated monitoring and numerical modelling tools for detecting and predicting rock stress fields and seismic activities induced by deep mining operations. Afterwards, they have developed a planning procedure for safe deep underground mining applicable to different kinds of mines. The development of a new cutting head able to continuously cut very hard rock, which can today only be exploited by drilling and blasting, has already been finalised. Work toward constructing a new spraying robot for concrete liners has started, improving safety and efficiency.\n\nScientists have also started constructing efficient and autonomous machinery for extraction and transportation in deep underground mines.

Research organisations, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and SME associations or groups joined forces to bring stone mining into the 21st century. The goal is to create zero-impact, nearly invisible mines through the exploitation of technology.\n\nGround penetration radar (GPR) and electrical resistance tomography (ERT) are being calibrated against physical samples and testing. The data and models will be used to deliver non-destructive tools capable of determining rock mechanical properties affecting their use as building stones.\n\nThe team selected three quarries for field studies representing granite, limestone and dolostone. Radar and other measurements were used to develop digital terrain models as the basis for geophysical measurements.\n\nScientists conducted a first GPR measurement campaign in which GPR was successfully used to measure inhomogeneities and discontinuities in different rock types. Data are being utilised in the 3D geological model under development. ERT measurements continue and will be used as a complement to GPR data.\n\nSamples were collected from all three quarries and subjected to two different tests to determine mechanical properties relevant to use as building stones. These data along with GPR data will be exploited in future geological and geostatistical models, also serving as quality indices for natural stone quarries.\n\nSUSTAMINING is creating a technology- and knowledge-based methodology and toolkit for sustainable mining of ornamental stone. The goal is zero impact above ground and near-zero impact below.

Selected sustainability indicators based on regulatory requirements of the European Commission will be applied for feasibility considerations.\nThe main objective of the BioMOre first phase is to design and build an underground test facility for testing the concept of combined hydro-fracturing and bioleaching. The test facility will comprise a 100 m\u00b2 ore block, where boreholes will be drilled horizontally using standard equipment. All necessary equipment for testing different parameters of the intended bioleaching process will be established underground.\nThe intention is to test the bioleaching process in high detail in an in-situ environment at the same time avoiding time consuming and risky permission procedures.
