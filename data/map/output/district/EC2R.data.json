The platform will complement existing Copernicus pre-operational components, but will focus on datasets which provide information on climate variability on decadal to centennial time scales from observed and projected climate change impacts in Europe, and will provide a toolbox to generate, compare and rank key indicators. Expanding climate data volumes will be supported with a distributed, scalable system, based on international standards. Guidance information on the quality and limitations of all data products will be provided. An on-going user consultation process will feed back into all the products developed within the project. The \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d platform will allow users to find answers to their questions related to climate and climate impacts data, and to ensure that the providence of science and policy relevant data products is thoroughly documented. Clarity of provenance will be supported by providing access to intermediate data products. Documentation will include information on the technical quality of data, on metrics related to scientific quality, and on uncertainties in and limitations of the data.

It will provide a viable and sustainable means for the exploitation of outputs from past, present and future projects.\nCollaboration through the exchange of industrial and research innovations is a key factor in achieving the competitive benefits that globalisation can bring to maritime organisations. However, achieving successful awareness and effective collaboration remains a significant obstacle. There is a clear need for European SMEs to fully engage with each other and to adopt a more advanced approach with regard to the exploitation of innovations through the development of collaborations on a grander geographical scale.\nA concerted co-ordinated activity is needed to exploit innovations, making them widely available and supporting their use throughout Europe. Conventionally this would be achieved through knowledge exchange workshops to facilitate networking amongst interested organisations. EuroVIP takes a novel state-of-the-art approach to Virtual Integrated Partnering (VIP) and collaboration for the exchange of advances and innovations, coupled with workshops, demonstration \u201croad shows\u201d, and meetings to bring together research outputs and expertise for exploitation.\nThe project will identify technologies with the highest potential impact and build partnerships for the exploitation of such.

Yet, at present, the industry is insufficiently aware of such benefits, to its detriment, and adequate collaboration has not been achieved.\n\nThe EU-funded http://euro-vip.eu/ (EUROVIP) project aimed to coordinate European maritime SMEs and related organisations, and to promote application of research results. The purpose was to promote operational and technical collaboration. The 21-member consortium ran between June 2011 and May 2014.\n\nProject partners devised two sustainable means of achieving its objectives. First was the European Maritime Collaboration Portal (EMCP), a website enabling industry members to collaborate. The EMCP offers a searchable database listing innovative services and technologies, their providers and opportunities for collaboration such as tender calls. Users may build partnerships according to their needs and resources.\n\nThe project's second solution was the Technical Collaboration Platform (TCP). This provided an integrating and coordinating environment, supporting design and engineering software tools such as computer-aided design and computational fluid dynamic. The core functionality was the web-based ticket system, enabling automated online computation. Such mechanism is cheaper and more efficient than conventional solutions.\n\nEUROVIP prepared six case studies showing how EMCP and TCP benefit the maritime industry. Two operational-level examples illustrated effective use of the EMCP for finding tender calls and potential collaborators. Further examples illustrated TCP use for novel online computation services and for collaborative design work.\n\nDissemination activities included a project roadshow, and a series of events held across Europe. Such events expanded the participating membership almost 10-fold, and the pool of EMCP users increased from 30 to over 200. The project was able to promote three business success stories.\n\nThe team prepared system documentation, including best practice guidelines, and other user information such as instructional videos and presentations.\n\nEUROVIP facilitated collaboration among maritime industry members by offering two sets of online tools.
