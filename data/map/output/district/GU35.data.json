Currently, the most urgent requirements are the capability of modelling noise, NOx stringencies and greenhouse gases in relation to the Kyoto protocol as well as related agreements together with their respective effects. Careful analysis of the complex interdependencies between air transport activities and environmental or economic effects is needed for the assessment of policies and guidance on a political level.\nThus, integrated modelling capabilities have to be enhanced. In the US, this modelling capability is currently being developed in a multi-million dollar project based upon criteria, assumptions and points of view primarily set by the US. TEAM_Play will create a modelling framework to combine and advance European modelling capabilities in order to support the European perspective in the international policy arena.\nTEAM_Play deals with interdependencies and trade-offs between noise, gas emissions, environmental and economic impacts of the air transport sector. The objective of TEAM_Play is to enhance the European modelling capabilities required for policy assessment. These capabilities will be strengthened by creating a common infrastructure allowing for the connection of existing European models (noise, gas emissions, economic and environmental impacts).\nThis is addressed in WP1 by linking the models to a data warehouse in which all required modelling input and output data are stored.WP2 covers the development of model interfaces which will enable the models to be connected. In addition, an economic impact assessment will be conducted. In WP3, assessment studies using the TEAM_Play Tool Suit will be carried out. In WP4, the dissemination will be carried out and a concept for the durable implementation beyond FP7 funding will be developed.", 37011.0, 4438608.0, "TEAM_PLAY", "Modelling tools analyse aviation policy", "A sustainable aviation policy is required to meet the demands of a globalised economy and a growing air transport sector. Of particular concern is the economic and environmental impact of such measures.", "Current models used by the International Civil Aviation Organisation - Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (ICAO-CAEP) are limited in scope. A flexible holistic integrated modelling framework that can adequately predict interdependencies and assess impact of policy measures on noise, emissions and cost is urgently needed. Such a framework could be applied at ICAO-CAEP and European, national and local levels.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'Tool suite for environmental and economic aviation modelling for policy analysis' (http://www.teamplay-project.eu (TEAM_PLAY)) was initiated to address this gap. Researchers successfully harmonised data to enhance modelling capabilities using common interfaces, data formatting guidelines and a central database. As a result, relevant data on aviation and environment can now be used for comparisons and scenario assessments to enable informed short-, medium- and long-term policymaking. A key accomplishment is the interconnectivity achieved between existing stand-alone models and the facility to incorporate other relevant models on a needs basis.\n\nFor the first time ever, a state-of-the-art tool suite has been created in Europe. This modelling framework can adequately and consistently measure the current and future impacts of aviation policies on the economy, air transport system and environment. Moreover, user-defined scenarios can assess the requirements or success level of ongoing or future European research projects in the aeronautics sector.\n\nSuccessful outcomes have led to the planning of a European modelling strategy for the durable implementation of the TEAM_PLAY tool suite. The ANCAT Modelling Interdependencies Task Group (MITG) will work on developing a joint and permanent facility for customisable and up-to-date European aviation environmental modelling. Success would ensure that European competitiveness and influence in the ICAO-CAEP or international aviation policy arena will be considerably enhanced.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813111802.jpg", "fp7_97151_968230430"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["0YZ", "R1C", "CHASE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"], ["0YZ", "RHU", "CHASE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"], ["0YZ", "RN5", "CHASE ACUTE OUTPATIENTS HOSPITAL"], ["0YZ", "RW1", "CHASE HOSPITAL"], ["0YZ", "RX2", "CHASE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "GU35"}
