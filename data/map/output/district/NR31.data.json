SASMAP will take holistic- and process- based approaches to investigate underwater environments and the archaeological sites contained therein.\nSASMAP will benefit the management of underwater cultural heritage in Europe and in the rest of the world by providing valuable tools to plan the preservation of offshore archaeological sites and their contents in accordance with both the Treaty of Valletta (1992) and research driven investigations. The need for SASMAP is based on the results from previous and current EU initiatives, the networks resulting from these projects and on-going research at the consortium\u2019s institutions. Within SASMAP a holistic approach will be taken to locating, assessing, monitoring and safeguarding underwater cultural heritage. This will involve developing and utilising tools and technologies to allow \u201cdown-scaling\u201d from the large scale regional level, moving on to the local site level and finally to the individual components of a site. Results obtained from the down-scaling approach at the proposed study areas will show the effectiveness of such an approach for locating and detailed mapping of archaeological sites and their preservation potential. The end results of this approach will be used to develop a plan for assessing archaeological sites in European waters. From a management point of view this is an up-scaling approach to planning (bottom up).

The consortium includes small and medium-sized enterprises experienced in developing marine geophysical instruments, biogeochemical measuring equipment and hand-held diving tools.\n\nNew tools and technologies developed by SASMAP are aimed at improving both the excavation and raising of fragile organic materials if they cannot be preserved in situ. The consortium is also developing new ways to stabilise sites and monitor their effectiveness, including the impact these stabilisation materials have on the environment. These new tools and methods will be tested in two shallow water sites in Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy and Greece.\n\nTools used by the SASMAP consortium will range from satellite scanning of potential sites to detailed multibeam and shallow seismic surveying of identified targets. Data from these non-destructive studies will be applied to a geographical information service to locate archaeological sites and areas threatened by natural erosion.\n\nBiogeochemical parameters in coastal marine sediments will be monitored by developing marine data logging equipment. Measurements related to the degradation of organic archaeological materials in the marine environment will be used to assess the preservation potential of sediments.\n\nDiver-held tools for sampling sediment cores from archaeological sites are also being developed. So too are tools for assessing the preservation status of waterlogged archaeological wood. In addition, project partners are also developing innovative techniques for raising complex and heavily degraded waterlogged organic artifacts.\n\nArtificial sea grass mats have been developed to stabilise sites in situ, and trialled in Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands. Researchers are currently monitoring their efficiency and the effect of the marine environment on the plastics contained in the mats.\n\nSASMAP will benefit the management of underwater cultural heritage in Europe and the rest of the world.

It has already been shown that nutritional modulation of lipid homeostasis via direct supplementation, e.g., n-3 fatty acids, or via indirect mechanisms, e.g., dietary polyphenols, has beneficial effects on human health. There is growing evidence that ether phospholipids such as plasmalogens play a central role in mediating the beneficial effects, but the underlying mechanisms are not understood.   ETHERPATHS will develop systems biology tools that will facilitate studies of dietary interventions aiming to modulate lipid homeostasis. Specifically, we will develop (1) models that enable studies of gut microbiota and its effect on host cell metabolism, (2) dynamic models of systemic lipid metabolism, and (3) pathway reconstruction methods to study tissue-specific effects of dietary interventions. All models will be optimized in the context of studies of dietary interventions and will be integrated into a sophisticated software platform. In silico strategies will be complemented by multiple experimental approaches, including (1) dietary interventions involving n-3 fatty acids and polyphenols, combined with tracer studies in vitro and in vivo (2) in vitro colon model (3) in vivo germ-free and conventional models of altered lipid metabolism, specifically of plasmalogen deficiency.  ETHERPATHS includes academic and industrial partners with combined unique expertise in information technology, bioinformatics, metabolic and physiological modelling, systems engineering, biochemistry, microbiology, lipid metabolism, metabolomics, obesity and metabolic syndrome, and clinical nutrition.

As a result, understanding the complex interaction between nutrients, host metabolism and gut microbiota holds the answer to improving health.\n\nPlasmalogens are a unique class of ether lipids that are enriched in n-3 fatty acids and play an important role in human health. Scientists of the EU-funded 'Characterization and modelling of dietary effects mediated by gut microbiota on lipid metabolism' (ETHERPATHS) project wished to investigate how plasmalogens, polyphenols and nutrition in general maintain lipid metabolism, at systemic to cellular levels. To this end, they set out to develop a series of informatics and analytical tools that would provide knowledge on how various dietary components and gut microbiota composition influence lipid metabolism. \n\nThe study linked human diet intervention studies with in vitro analysis in a colon model. Scientists tested how certain foods such as green tea and orange, affected the formation of microbial metabolites. Results indicated that dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements had the power to recover the metabolic disturbances associated with plasmalogen deficiency. Additionally, they validated that green tea improved lipogenic capacity and increased catabolism of lipids.\n\nA pilot nutritional intervention in an obese mouse model suggested that treatment with precursors of plasmalogens has a beneficial impact on serum triglyceride, free fatty acid and ketone body levels. Researchers also discovered other factors contributing to lipid homeostasis such as the GNPAT gene.\n\nA human nutritional intervention study was also carried out to evaluate the impact of n-3 fatty acids and polyphenols in lipid metabolism. Participating individuals were fed different levels of these compounds and their bodily fluids were analysed. The results clearly showed distinct effects on lipid profiles as well as on gut microbial composition.\n\nWith respect to data analysis, the consortium developed a nutritional systems biology platform which contained computational and analytical tools. The goal was to be able to process metabolomics data through specialised software and also to offer appropriate tools for experimental data management and model simulations.

This project builds upon previous  projects which comprised 11 visits by 60 VET Lecturers to Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Czech Republic, Finland and Sweden, Lithuania, Cyprus, Portugal and Finland. The lecturers and managers representing 11 ACER colleges were drawn from specialisms including Construction, Motor Vehicle, Electronics, Agriculture, ICT, and Business Studies, Health and Social Care, Hospitality and Catering, Travel and Tourism and Leisure and Sport. The participants also explored to what extent the host country has matched its National Qualification Framework against the EQF and implemented the ECVET system.

Individuals will have the opportunity to widen their knowledge and expertise, including experience of different teaching and learning methodologies, innovations in technology and learning and diverse cultures to help to adapt training courses to meet employers changing skills needs.  All participants will engage in learning the basic language of the host country.
