The network will deliver a joint multidisciplinary research training programme which will encourage and foster the growth of the researchers\u2019 skills in scientific expertise, technological knowledge and professional aptitude. The key vehicle in this strategy is a supervised personal, original research project in a critical aspect of sustainable packaging.\nThe network has been designed to achieve the following objectives (i) to conduct top-level research and training and devise innovative solutions for specific EU needs in the area of sustainable packaging, (ii) to advance the state-of-the-art in wood cellulose based sustainable packaging in three specific areas (a) next generation packaging composites, (b) cellulose-fibre based active packaging and (c) environmental, economic and societal aspects of packaging production, (iii) to educate the next generation of researchers inside a broad European research training network which includes universities, research centres and industry, thereby accelerating the researchers\u2019 advancement to team leader status, (iv) to improve the career prospects of ERs and ESRs through complementary training such as; writing and presentation skills; language, effective communication and collaboration; project management and finance; project/product cycles; entrepreneurship; IPR, (v) to create an integrated, long-term sustainable packaging research and training base in the EU by bringing together universities, research institutes and industrial players active in key research disciplines.", 96751.0, 2558838.0, "NEWGENPAK", "Superior natural packaging materials", "Recycling and garbage bins are loaded with fossil fuel-based packaging materials left over after the foods they contained are consumed.

Seventeen partners are supporting 13 researchers in their investigations within the EU-funded project 'New generation of functional cellulose fibre based packaging materials for sustainability' (http://www.newgenpak.eu/ (NEWGENPAK)).\n\nAddition of nanocellulose can significantly offset some of the weaknesses of other biopolymers in mechanical strength and barrier properties. It can be functionalised for anti-oxidant and anti-bacterial activity and even yield intelligent or active packaging solutions.\n\nThe first pillar is improving barrier properties of coatings and films. Modelling techniques are being used to understand and predict the relationship between structure and function. The team produced a mineral oil barrier with effectiveness up to 98 % in the lab. Scientists also produced a multi-barrier system with dry oxygen permeability similar to polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the most common type of polyester.\n\nA second line of research is focused on developing cellulose fibre-based active packaging. The team has already had promising enhancements in anti-microbial activity. An SME, that is a full partner in the project, has assessed a number of commercial thermochromic inks for printability on both benchmark and modified substrates. They will used in studies on intelligent packaging, for fruits and vegetables, that changes colour with temperature.\n\nFinally, scientists want to ensure that the processing is as sustainable as the product. They have developed 10 criteria to evaluate the environmental, economic and social impact of manufacturing processes. A comparison life cycle assessment of conventional versus active packaging shows that the overall impacts are comparable. The environmental impact due to incorporation of active agents can be offset by their contribution to increased shelf life.\n\nNEWGENPAK is focused on the development of barrier and active technologies to enhance the performance and thus the use of carbon dioxide-neutral, cellulose-based packaging materials.

An automated enzyme activity testing method based on mass spectrometry has been successfully developed to detect CLN1 and CLN2 gene mutations from dry blood spots. Researchers have also developed a cost-effective, rapid genetic diagnostic tool to detect all NCL forms through comprehensive analysis. Work is ongoing to adapt this for high-throughput applications.\n\nAdditionally, scientists identified a novel signalling pathway associated with CLN3 disease that could be a potential target for therapy. Animal models have been used to study proteomic changes due to CLN mutations and certain biochemical changes specific to CLN1 have been identified. Researchers also identified a to-date unknown NCL disease gene called ATP13A2/CLN12.\n\nPre-clinical testing of therapeutic options is ongoing. Adeno-associated virus constructs carrying the CLN3 or CLN6 gene for mice deficient in CLN3 or CLN6 transmembrane proteins were developed and testing is being carried out. Neural stem cell lines that over-express proteins responsible for the growth, survival and maintenance of neurons have also been established. These cell lines will be used in intra-vitreal transplants to test vision recovery in mice.\n\nProject outcomes have been disseminated through DEM-CHILD teaching seminars, the http://www.dem-child.eu (project website) , workshops, conferences, a diagnostic hand-out and a teaching video.

Differentiation is also governed by epigenetic mechanisms that fix cell fate decisions by providing some sort of cell memory.\n\nDeregulation of this transcriptional or epigenetic profile by acquired genetic abnormalities leads to haematological malignancies.

We prioritise making our placements accessible to those with fewer opportunities and those who will benefit most from the personal and social development opportunities which the scheme offers. Selected volunteers will have the opportunity to take part in a range of humanitarian projects, which will enable them to develop their understanding and experience of active citizenship in a global world and enhance their employability skills.\r\n\r\nThe various projects included in this application are thematically linked by a common commitment to the inclusion of vulnerable groups, both at the local and community level; this focuses primarily on supporting vulnerable individuals in the community such as refugees and asylum seekers, the elderly, people with learning disabilities. \r\n \r\nIn line with Erasmus+ Programme specific objectives in the field of youth, our project aims to achieve the following:\r\n- encourage young people\u2019s active participation in society by helping them to increase their self-confidence and sense of initiative;\r\n- enhance young people\u2019s employability and career prospects, by enabling them to develop their skills in a safe, supported environment and validating these through the Youthpass framework;\r\n- facilitate opportunities for young people to develop enhanced inter-cultural dialogue. \r\n\r\nThrough a range of informal and non-formal learning activities and experiences, volunteers will be supported over the course of the placement to take an active role in society, and will also have the space for personal development, self-reflection and learning. The personal development and training opportunities available will enable participants to develop skills crucial for future training or employment, while given them the chance to be engaged as active citizens in civil society. At the local level, the participants will be directly involved with the delivery of services to vulnerable people in the community.

Its objective is to identify ways to improve the education and inclusion of these students, to strengthen their skills in the language of the host country, to allow access to culture and facilitate employment, to better train teachers of French as a Second Language (FSL) and all teachers who participate in the inclusion of these students in regular curricula. \r\n \r\nThe consortium counts 24 members and cooperates with 13 international host institutions. Different profiles of staff are concerned by the inclusion of migrant pupils and students not speaking the language of the host country, and participate in the project: teachers involved in UPE2A \u2013 classes meant for newly arrived migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, regular class teachers, senior management teams of schools and executives of the local education authority of Strasbourg, inspectors and pedagogical counsellors, \r\nproject managers of different departments of the local education authority of Strasbourg. \r\n \r\nThe welcoming and training practices in Alsace are managed by the CASNAV - academic centre for the schooling of newly arrived students and students from traveling families - and can be enriched according to each situation - initiation, improvement, enhancement, broadening, diversification) by the expertise of our European partners and the devices they have put in place.\r\n \r\nThis is why the local education authority of Strasbourg has decided to set up a consortium to apply for an Erasmus + mobility project, in accordance with European values and its regional educational priorities: inclusion in schools, social integration, equal opportunities, diversity and gender equality, employability of youngsters, fighting against school dropout and radicalization.\r\n \r\nThe host organizations were selected according to the following criteria:\r\n- diversity of their experiences in the field of welcoming migrants, refugees, asylum seekers not speaking the languages of the host countries, \r\n- situations in countries which are first faced with massive waves of migrants;\r\n- quality of the historical cooperation that binds them to the local education authority of Strasbourg\r\nTaking into account the destinations of the mobility and therefore the choice of the host partner for each delegation, the steering committee considered it relevant to take into account the matching with the teaching cycle, the level and the specialization of the participants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will make it possible to carry out 128 mobility for the staff of the whole education authority of Strasbourg according to 3 strategic levels:\r\n- level of institutional steering;\r\n- level of management of schools;\r\n- school level of EANA - newly arrived migrants, refugees and asylum seekers not speaking the language of the host country.\r\n \r\nThe activities will consist in work-shadowing lessons, shared teaching and exchanging of best practices, meetings with local, institutional or non-profit organization partners. They will cover the practical aspects of hosting migrants, teaching, methods and material, also the transmission of European values and access to culture and to different forms of artistic expression that are the roots of social cohesion and democracy as well as the education to citizenship.\r\n \r\nThe result of the mobility project will fuel an analysis and a reflection on transferable practices in our local education authority of Strasbourg. \r\n \r\nThe eTwinning platform will be the tool of choice for the organization and communication of the project. This platform will serve as a means of exchanging, sharing and disseminating the results.\r\n \r\nThe expected impacts are at three levels:\r\n - academic steering and institutional management of welcoming migrants, refugees and asylum seekers not speaking the language of the host country, \r\n- the management of schools in terms of welcoming strategy;\r\n- support of newly arrived pupils and students who have newly arrived in the class and their inclusion in the regular curricula.\r\n\r\nThe transferable practices that we have observed during the mobility will make it possible to improve the education of newly arrived migrants, refugees and asylum seekers and their inclusion in the regular curricula to allow a fluent schooling and follow up of the newcomers in regular classes. To put it in a nutshell, all pupils and students with special needs will benefit from the results. \r\nGiven the current political and climatic trends, it is highly likely that the migration phenomenon towards Europe will keep increasing in the forthcoming years. Observations and exchanges of best practices carried out during the project are all elements that will make it possible to anticipate possible geo-political dramatic changes to come.", "http://www.emfec.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA101-047138_4"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NG8"}
