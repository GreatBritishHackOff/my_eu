Embedding European citizenship and an international dimension in the curriculum and ethos of our school. We want to achieve something which may sound abstract but can become tangible in many different pratical ways by working in collaboration on concrete topics with  colleagues in schools elsewhere in Europe and across departments at Madonna della Neve school.\r\n2. Enhancing teaching and learning standards through sharing best practice from foreign partner schools. Enriching the education that the school provides will involve a wide range of subjects and departments that will all benefit from the Erasmus+ initiative. Besides, the teachers involved will also gain management experience both from running the project and disseminating the results of  their mobility in the whole school.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\r\nOur project of teachers' mobility developed in a secondary school in which teachers have been constantly considering how teaching and learning standards can be enhanced so that teachers can become more aware of their action in class and more conscious of the strategies and methodology used with students. This goal can be achieved only by reflecting on the use of innovative tools and methods, different from the ones we already know. Sharing practice with foreign colleagues would inspire our teachers to adopt new strategies in order to:\r\n1. help strong students outperform national standards\r\n2. develop for the better skills and competences of weak students or students with learning problems\r\n3. promote more interactive and less academic activities  such as : problem-solving, cooperative learning, workshops and use of laboratories...\r\n4. enhance students' motivation\r\n5. embed a European dimension into  daily lessons, promote awareness of European, and extensively global, citizenship.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES AND METHODOLOGY\r\nWe mean to start by involving in the project three  main subject areas: science, sport/PE, foreign languages although our ambition is to open up to other areas such as mathematics/physics and history.\r\nOur school has been working for over a decade in departments (subject areas), so the heads of departments involved together with the headteacher will select the staff participating in the project. \r\nTogether with our partner schools (which we have been working in collaboration for years on bilateral exchanges with students) we identified the following stages:\r\nA) work-shadowing and observation in class (with a grid to fill in) in an agreed and significative number and variety of subjects in order to give foreign colleagues a good picture of the best practice of the school. Observations will be debated later.\r\nB) planning of modules shared by same departments of partner schools on the topics as pinpointed at number E of the form and arranging of same assessemnt test for students.\r\nC) sharing of results of tests with reflection on assessing parameters.\r\nD) possible exchange of staff among schools, teachers will swap and replace colleagues in partner school giving lessons on agreed topics.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\nTeachers involved will have to relate to the headteacher, the heads of department and the whole school staff on the activities done. They will be directly responsible for the positive outcomes of the project and will be expected to promote and disseminate the results, firstly inside the department, then among the whole group of teachers and finally outside the school uploading positive educational developments using appropriate portals, the blog and site of the school, e-twinning portals, local mass-media (press, radio) and any other possible way of communication.\r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT ENVISAGED\r\nAs already highlighted the entire school will be, in the end, the one to benefit from this project that will help staff  improve the school's good pratice and embed in the curriculum and ethos of the school  both European citinzenship and  internationalization. We are positive that enhancing teaching standards will lead to a tangible improvement in students' learning strategies and skills too. Besides, the staff involved will benefit personally, culturally and professionally and these benefits will be cascaded down to through departments and through the whole school.", "http://www.st-cuthbertshigh.newcastle.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA101-002324_1"], ["0BJ", "Nauka z pierwszej r\u0119ki - poprawa jako\u015bci pracy plac\u00f3wki poprzez rozw\u00f3j kompetencji lider\u00f3w zmian.", "Heddon-on-the-Wall St. Andrew's CE First School", 23512.0, "The \u201cFirsthand learning \u2013 improvement of the operational quality of the establishment and consolidation of its potential through the development of change leaders\u2019 competences\u201d project was created based on the analysis of the most important requirements related to the development of the establishment.

The goals of the project include:1)    The development of knowledge procurement and relaying (sharing and implementing a learning conception more focused on the learner; improvement  of educational results in general preparatory and English subjects; an increase of key and social competences of students with the consideration of students with special educational requirements; creating or acquiring new materials and didactic support; an increase of the effectiveness for the use of ICT; an increase of motivation for students to learn and for teachers to work).2)    Strengthening the potential of the establishment (improvement of the identification of students and teacher with the school as a place for learning and working; teachers and management cadre integration; strengthening the European potential of the establishment; an improvement of language and intercultural skills, as well as professional ICT qualification of teachers and the cadre).In the project, a methodology will be used, which is based on acquiring knowledge, by the management cadre and the teachers, through participation in specialist training and observing work at similar job positions (job shadowing). Mobility will be conducted directly in training companies and at schools that are leaders of innovation, which in portrayed by the project title.The result of the project will be the acquirement of new methodological and didactic competences by the teachers, broadening the range of used teaching methods, introducing new didactic support and focusing the learning process on the student. The project will impact the students by increasing their learning motivation, as well as the work organisation of the establishment through strengthening its potential and competitiveness.In a long-term perspective, the project will give us the opportunity to implement (achieve) clourable solutions in the most important issues, such as: elementary education and training as well as development of social skills.", "http://www.heddon-school.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PL01-KA101-024469_2"], ["6AF", "Continuous Professional Development", "Laidlaw Schools Trust T/A The Excelsior Academy", 14078.0, "The RSG Enkhuizen is a Dual Language Education School (tweetalig onderwijs) and its teachers are required to ensure that their English language and didactic skills are kept up-to-date during their teaching career.

Considering the different cultural and economic backgrounds students come from,the school activates some strategies to control and solve pupils\u2019 special educational  needs which can refer both socio-cultural linguistic disadvantages or learning difficulties.  Many students come from medium high standard families and a great number of students belong to imigrant families, all the students  receive the same opportunities  from the school. Our school is inclusive and welcoming ,it tries to offer all the students the same opportunities and it is engaged to appreciate the excellences. In such complex situation ,all the school staff ,especially teachers, need to be trained and kept up-to-date in order to be able to face all the organisational, communicative, methodological problems as well as being closer to the European standards. According to the self-evaluation report,which suggests some areas of improvement, it is important to:\r\npromote  new teaching-learning methods in an European perspective\r\nreinforce the profile of all teaching roles and develop linguistic competences, CLIL  and ICT methodology\r\nkeep the school up-to-date and closer to the European standards\r\nimprove the school integration\r\npromote the excellences\r\nimprove  management\u2019s skills\r\nsupport the educational research.\r\nThe project provides for 41mobilities which are fairly divided between job-shadowing and structured courses; 4 activities are for the management, administration offices and technicians the other 37 ones are for teachers who belong to all the school subject.\r\nWe will be able to share procedures and good practices , which deal with  school institutions\u2019 organisation and the learning-teaching methodologies by exchanging  experiences with other European colleagues. The development of new learning processes of quality realized in the prospect of the research-action will promote the pupil\u2019s active and creative role. Nowadays the entire school system needs to be redesigned about its traditional teaching-learning role models and the school organisation and management should be thought  avoiding any kind of  socio-cultural and economic situation of marginality; a modern school needs new  plans, with  precise actions  shared with all the school staff. The project aims to realise this process by investing in  teachers\u2019 professional growth which has to be addressed and oriented towards the new generations\u2019 communicative dimension.The objective is in fact to acquire and establish a new creative open teaching methodology which is able to overcome the physical limits of the classroom, centered on the students\u2019 active role and on the informed use of new technologies.\r\nAll the teachers involved in the project will contribute to the development of the school,the best acquired practices will be analised, adapted to the needs of our school shared and realised by the teachers;workshop will be planned to involve people inside and outside the school.\r\nA lot of  courses have been chosen among those ones School Education Gateway has proposed, the school partners for job shadowing are recommended by European colleagues met in previous activities of European projects.  Teachers are expected to have: better competences  in methodology, prevention of bullying, CLIL and ICT, service learning e coaching; better Knowledge of the educational school systems  other countries have; better skills to bring the learning process up-to-date; the ability to use the opportunities  of the professional development which can be found in other European countries; better linguistic skills; motivation and satisfaction in daily work.\r\nThe experiences  of training will be included in POF (plan of formative offer) so that they will get a good practice. The acquired skills and competences such as the internationalizing strategies of learning,the cooperation with partners from other countries,the ability to find and use resources according to various subjects, the continuous practice of individual  strategies such as \u201ccoaching\u201d will allow all the students to be  active and motivated in the learning process and successful to overcome all the difficulties and at the same time to promote the excellences.
