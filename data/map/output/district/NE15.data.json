As part of the school's Continuous Professional Development (CPD) programme, teachers are required to spend a period of one week abroad in a British school observing and teaching their subject to native speakers.\r\n\r\nWe have invested considerable time in building our relationship with Excelsior Academy and we are confident that Excelsior Academy can offer us the on-the-job refreshers' course that our teachers need. We hope that our British counterparts will be able to take part in a reciprocal programme, should their Erasmus+ application be successful.\r\n\r\nWe intend to send two sets of six qualified teachers from the RSG Enkhuizen to our sister school in Newcastle-upon-Tyne (Excelsior Academy) for a period of one school week per set over two academic years. The teachers will also be researching a group project to present back to the school on a topic that the management team in their judgment deems worthy of our educational needs. The topics at present are: Personalised Learning, differentiation in the EAL classroom; EAL techniques for teaching and comparing these to our CLIL techniques already in use for example, however, we wish to be flexible and be able to play in extra research as deemed necessary to complement any further initiatives taking place at our school at any given time. \r\n\r\nIn addition, teachers will be required to complete a personal project that will form part of the PDP (Professional Development Plan) and this will be monitored and assessed by the owning manager at school. \r\n\r\nOur teachers will observe the lessons for the first day and then build this up to teaching small groups before taking on a full class at the end of the week's visit to Newcastle. They will be harvesting authentic materials that can be used in the DLE/TTO classroom and building partnerships with the teachers present so that future projects small or large can be confidently set up with learning goals that will suit both schools.\r\n\r\nThe RSG Enkhuizen will benefit with this English refreshers' course empowering our teachers to deliver first class education to our DLE pupils in the department. This will no doubt play a great role on the pupils' results as our teachers pick up and adapt new approaches to their subjects for our DLE classrooms.\r\n\r\nWith relationships strengthened between the management teams in both countries and the teaching body, we would like to build on this to create a teacher exchange for both schools and of course create an educational exchange for our pupils.", "http://www.excelsiornewcastle.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA101-035004_1"], ["6AF", "Continuous Professional Development", "Laidlaw Schools Trust T/A The Excelsior Academy", 16590.0, "Context of the project:\r\nExcelsior Academy serves a multi-cultural and multi-national community with exceptionally high levels of deprivation, poor general health, poor mental health and low aspirations.  Within our Academy in comparison to national average; attainment on entry is low; pupils premium, free school meal allowance, SEN and EAL are all high. \r\nWe have made significant year on year improvements since opening in 2008 and we would like to use this project and partnership to draw on these improvements, specifically focusing on some identified areas for improvement. \r\n \r\nObjectives of the project:\r\nOur main objectives are to focus CPL; independent learning; staff health and wellbeing; EAL and esafety. This will be through sharing good practice and developing a strong professional relationship.  \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\nWe intend to send a maximum of 6 members of staff to Holland for a week per year (for a two year period) for job shadowing in the areas relevant to this proposal. The group of 6 staff will also have a member of the management team, who will liaise with the team in Holland and look at different approaches in management and use the opportunity to share good practice and learn from the experience and bring back good practice to our Trust. \r\nThe staff involved will spend the time in Holland working alongside staff of the same discipline sharing good practice. This will then lead to delivering sessions with the pupils in Holland. On their return staff will need to produce reports; evidence their dissemination of good practice and deliver sessions to other staff to share learning,. \r\n\r\nDescription of activities:\r\nOur objectives will be met by job shadowing; meeting with staff and pupils; delivering sessions including teaching lessons and gaining and understanding of policies and procedures of the school. \r\n\r\nResults:\r\nFollowing our visit we will continue to work on our objectives by disseminating learning. We will complete our report, publish these on our virtual learning space and social media, and meet with staff in the relevant disciplines. We will also share our results with  our senior leadership group and Trust schools on training days. \r\n\r\nImpact envisaged:\r\nWe envisage 3 areas of impact for this project; the participants (staff members); the organisation and the targeted groups.  \r\n - Participants will have increased knowledge and greater understanding of the issues relevant to the project they were focusing on.  \r\n- Our organisation will see an improvement in the quality of teaching and learning and staff wellbeing\r\n- Our target groups will benefit from additional intervention and new ideas being brought to their curriculum \r\n\r\nWe have invested considerable time in building our relationship with RSG Enkhusen and we are confident that they can support us with our project and share their good practices. We hope that our Dutch colleagues will take part in a reciprocal programme through Erasmus+. \r\n\r\nWith relationships strengthened between the management teams in both countries and the teaching body, we would like to build on this to create a teacher exchange for both schools and of course create an educational exchange for our pupils.", "http://www.excelsiornewcastle.org.uk", "Laidlaw Schools Trust T/A The Excelsior Academy", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036263_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NE15"}
