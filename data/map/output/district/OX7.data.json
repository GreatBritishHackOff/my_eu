BELE (Bilboko Euskal Lutheria Eskola-Escuela Vasca de Lutheria) part of the Conservatorio Profesional de M\u00fasica Juan Cris\u00f3stomo Arriaga de Bilbao, follows up with the internationalization process launched last year. BELE is the only school in Spain where violin making skills are taught (Building and Restoration of bowed instruments-violin, viola and cello- Level III of the National Catalogue of Professional Qualifications (CNCP).\r\nIn 2013 we started the track to renewal with the aim to overcome the employability difficulties, through an ambitious plan to improve the quality of student training, a new curriculum, the improvement of the skills of the teaching staff,  provision of the needed personnel, equipment and financial support, job training in qualified shops, etc. On the other hand we carried out different activities to acknowledge the sector professionals, violin making businesses as well as  musicians, about our quality improvement.\r\nOn 2016  we promoted our first  mobility project for students and staff. At the moment we are on the first year of our Internalization Process.  The progress achieved so far reassure us the path we have taken is on the correct diretion  as it is responding positively to the quality and prestige needs detected, as reflected in our Strategic Plan 2015-2020. Connecting with schools, professionals and companies from other European countries, especially Italy, France and the UK, is encouraging BELE to have a bigger and better presence in the sector. \r\nThe initiatives taken in the line of student and teacher mobility through KA102 actions and the strategic partnerships carried out with other European organizations through the KA202, are leading us to improvement and innovation, creation and transmission of knowledge, demonstration of our work and the recognition of our training quality. Today we can say that thanks to all this the training of our students is better, as it is their recognition abroad, promoting their employability. \r\nWe are knitting a network of relationships between professionals, training centers and companies, based on the reliance among the people responsible for them,as we share the same interests on improvement and growth, quality and efficiency, favoring the sector and improvement of the response to the market needs. Connected and sharing we are wiser, more creative, more skilled, more efficient, thus giving better response to the needs of the \u201cindustry\u201d, musicians and training centers. \r\nWith the aim of continuing and strengthening this dynamic, in the present project we request ten mobilities, four of them are student mobilities, three job-sadowing for  staff and three other for experts to teach at BELE. Our partners are companies, schools and professionals from the United Kingdom, Italy and France, with great prestige and deeply rooted in the sector.Especially interesting is the openning of a collaboration with the Scuola Internazionale di Liuteria Antonio Stradivari of Cremona, for its long tradition and well known talent.  All this means an opportunity to improve the training of the students and, at the same time, it will allow us to share and contrast curriculi, teaching methods, teaching materials, connecting strategies with the market, experiences of relationship with the workshops, etc. \r\nWe are aware of the ambition of our project, so we have articulated all the necessary mechanisms to achieve the objectives, from an adequate selection and preparation of participants and partners, correct programming of mobilities, effective monitoring and coordination, to assessment and final disclosure.\r\n\r\nWith this project we hope to continue along the path of growth and improvement of all the people aenriquecernd institutions engaged in it. Mobilities generate dynamics of cooperation, communal creation, and exchange of knowledge and experiences; This, in turn, generating other movements and connections that  will further enhance the designed project once it is launched.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037052_2"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["5UE", "ISSEE LIMITED", 17288.0, "Support expenditure for research and innovation programmes in the \u2018Direct research\u2019 policy area (10.01.05)", "fts_2017_67510", 2017]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["5FA", "RNU", "CHIPPING NORTON COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"], ["5FA", "RTH", "CHIPPING NORTON COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "OX7"}
