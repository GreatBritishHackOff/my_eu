Indeed, WBL and transnational mobility experiences are important to (re)motivate VET learners (preventing early school leaving) and to provide them with the competences required by the companies. \r\n\r\nTherefore the DUAL MOB project will give students the chance to develop technical competences and soft skills \r\nthrough WBL mobility experiences abroad. These experiences will be carried out during VET qualification path and with the final aim of assessing and validating the learning outcomes acquired during the mobility so as to facilitate future inclusion of the young participants in the labor market or to continue their studies.\r\nThe project will involve 300 students (1/3 suffering from economic/social/cultural disadvantage) enrolled in VET courses in one of the 150 VET Centres run by the Consortium Members in 18 Italian Regions. \r\n\r\nThe project has a wide sectorial and geographical coverage. The sectors in which the students will have the chance to take their internship are the following:\r\n- Agribusiness (Backery and Pastry; Agriculture)\r\n- Arts and Crafts (Fashion, Wood)\r\n- Mechanic and Construction (Mechanics, Masonry, Electric, Electronic, Thermo-hydraulic)\r\n- Graphics\r\n- Administrative, Selling\r\n- Tourism and Catering\r\n- Personal Service (Beauty and Hairdressing)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the partnership will involve 16 partners from 6 different countries (ES, IE, UK, FR, DE, FI). Such a wide partnership will result in fruitful experience for the students, suitable to any professional path. \r\n\r\nThe DUAL MOB project promotes 2 different types of Transnational Mobility: 1) 3-4 weeks internships in a company abroad, carried out by students attending an Initial VET course; 2) 3-4 weeks in a VET centre abroad, with periods spent in company or other context, carried out by students attending an Initial VET course. \r\n\r\nThe Learning Outcomes will be valorized and recognized through the ECVET system. In fact, the Consortium Members will take advantage of the experience and the ECVET tools developed during the GORES project. \r\nThe project will have an impact on the development of professional and transversal skills of VET students and staff involved (accompanying persons), as well as on the offer of VET  training provision which will be possible thanks to the improvement in the use of the WBL approach and by strengthening the mutual trust among project partners.\r\n\r\nThis project will also lay the groundwork for enrichment in terms of organizational and teaching methods that the sending organisations may exploit during the pilot project related to the Dual System in Italy.", "http://www.gbmc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005930_1"], ["6NU", "Forlagt undervisning til fremme af sproglige og interkulturelle kompetencer.", "Greater Brighton Metropolitan College", 66804.0, "We would like to apply for Erasmus+ fundings again this year, as we have experienced the huge impact this project has had on many of our former students. \r\nMany of our students have never been abroad, and it's a fantastic possibility for them to learn about the British and reflect to themselves and Denmark. They will learn to be open and tolerant to other cultures, and thereby see their own possibilities in other places than their hometown. \r\nThe purpose is to promote the students ability to interact with foreign cultures and to improve their skills in foreign languages. The project is to fulfill the students' needs of working internationally and to give the students both linguistic and personal competences, and hereby give them an idea of the benefit of geographical mobility. \r\n\r\nParticipants will be students of vocational training from Frederikshavn Business College, 1. year students from EUD/EUX/HHX.\r\nThese students are mostly 16-17 years old.\r\n \r\nWe apply for two flows with each 25 students, which are to take place in September 2017 and September 2018 at City College Brighton and Hove in Brighton UK. We apply for 25 students pr. flow, as we brought 27 students last year, and this is a realistic number. We intend to go with one group each year, and in each group we have both VET-COMP and VET-SCHOOL participants.\r\n\r\nThe students will be tought at City College Brighton and Hove, where they will have have subjects like English, history, social science and culture. They will end up making a project about either opening a new shop/firm in Brighton with Danish products, to introduce a new product to the British market, or they will make a culture project, where they have to introduce Brighton, Britain and the culture to new international students. These projects allways end up beeing presented to academic staff from City College and the danish project manager. The students know that it is serious, as the presentation and the products will be assessed.\r\nThe HHX students will also be tought at City College, but instead of doing the project, they will be in work practise in e.g. different shops for the last week.\r\n\r\nIn the sparetime, there will be different excursions to places in and near by Brighton, but also a daytrip to London. We will, in cooperation with City College, also do our best to find interesting local companies and organisations to visit.\r\nThere will be a social or cultural activity every day after school, afternoon or evening.

We have a clear agreement on \"who does what\". \r\nCity College is in charge of the teaching at City College, as well as of placing the students with hostfamilies and pick up from the airport. City College will send a member of Staff for one of the preparation meetings. This will then be a 1-day meeting, where the students are getting information about the hostfamily, the College and teachers, Brighton, excursions etc. \r\nWe will also in cooperation make a set of rules and talk about safety precautions.\r\nCity College has an emergency number, so the participants will allways be able to get help from there day and night.\r\n\r\nProject manager/accompanying teacher is in charge of \r\nThe selection of participants.\r\nBooking the flights and making sure everybody has an insurance.\r\nPreparation of the participants through information-meetings and partly through English lessons.\r\nMonitoring and support of the students before, during and after their stay in Brighton.\r\n\r\nWe expect the students to achieve better language and inter-cultural skills. \r\nPersonally, they will be more confident using another language and interacting with other cultures.

Participants are students at the end of their 4th year from the chosen educational fields and 6th year students of the enotechnical sector. The inclusion of this latter student profile (approved by the MIUR since school year 2015/16) in the Project  fits in with the goal of the Cerletti Institute to internationalize the professions taught there. \r\nForeign partnership has been confirmed in order to continue and reinforce the educational alliance that has developed over time. \r\nFurthermore, International vision has been increased, according to the  Project strategy, thanks to two new partners: Czech Republic (Prague) and Slovenia (Maribor); these countries are wine competitors and are particularly interesting for the educational and training opportunities they can offer in this field. \r\nThe other destinations are confirmed: United Kingdom (Reading, Cardiff, Plumpton, Brighton), France (Cannes), Spain (Valencia), Austria (Wien). Some accompanying staff will be required as many participants are under age at the end of the fourth year.\r\nThe 6 staff mobilities  will be partially realized in 2017 (4 teachers) and completed in 2018.This planning has taken into consideration  the fact that the staff mobility has been fully and successfully realized in the current project and, thanks to the interest  and expectations aroused, it has had a positive impact  on the sending institutions.\r\nThis is the reason why the schools want to make the most of the results achieved that are: implementation or increase of CLIL modules; development of language education; increased number of   certifications for teachers (5 more certifications according to the number of teachers enrolled at certification courses). In addition, next year the number of staff applications will be more than double the places available thanks to the promoting activities carried out by each individual institution.\r\n\r\nAn important element in the Consortium plan of international development is the increase of other kinds of mobility: the schools are applying for MOVE 4.0 Call (DGR Veneto n.1866/2016) in order to organize study holidays with compulsory B1 certification. If financed, 90 3rd year students will be involved and they are prospective candidates for Erasmus + mobility in 2018. The school will organize, as usual, self-financed study holidays (50 participants) and school trips focused on linguistic, cultural and professional learning. An increase of 1-2 groups for each school is foreseen. This number is only apparently low as these activities are often an alternative to exchanges, that are the most important mobilities in the schools of the Consortium. More in detail, the institute Cerletti aims at increasing the following actions: mutual cooperation with foreign vocational institutions; training in internationalized firms (two exchanges in FR, 2 in DE, 1 in CZ); continuation of the project VITEA 2015-FR01-KA202-015381 regarding high vocational training for the profile of Certified Trimmer integrated in the ECVET system. In 2016 this Project involved 32 students, 18 teachers, 2 French ECVET experts and 8 European schools. Furthermore, next year the Institute Cerletti is planning to start two new exchanges: one institution in Krems (AT) following the Vinea Project and one institution in Novo Mesto (SL). \r\nThe Institute F. Da Collo, in addition to the exchange with a school of Isernhagen (DE, 40 students), will go on with the organization of an exchange with the French  \u201cLycee de la Vallee du Cailly\u201d (Rouen,  4th year students). An additional mobility, if financed, is the school-work experience abroad (MOVE Call for ASL DGR 1914/29-11-16 POR-FSE).\r\nThe Consortium will increase the number of the B1, B2, and C1 certifications for the students (120 at the moment) in the languages studied.

It aims at creating innovative E-CLIL learning laboratories with the use of ICT. \r\nThis very important result has a great impact on the whole mobility project and it encourages the schools to promote the mobility of the staff and to foster the activities of language training for teachers (with an increase of + 20% of language certifications next year). \r\nThe language certifications (B1-B2-C1) of the students will increase too (+ 13%), this result will be reached thanks to promotion inside the schools, an increase of the number of language courses, school grants  for the certification exams (whose total amount has been so far  paid for by the students\u2019 families), the participation to the call of the Regione Veneto MOVE 4.0 POR-FSE for language studies abroad which  aims at making the students get the language certification. \r\nIn order to reinforce and improve language skills, the schools will promote activities with mother tongue teachers (115 hours), one language assistant of the project EduChange will be involved, language study holidays during the summer and school trips abroad will be organized, the project Smarter English will be implemented (a week of full immersion in the English language with activities held by mother tongue teachers for about 150 students). \r\nThe internationalization strategy  will be pursued with activities organized with local and foreign partners, through actions taken by each school:  Exchange Program with two German VET Schools (Marzotto e De Pretto with about 25 incoming students and 25 outcoming students); short training periods for 10 Polish students (at Marzotto and Chilesotti)  Erasmus+ VET coming from the foreign partner who is a host partner in this project too; in case the projects, submitted in the different countries, will be approved some mechatronics students coming from (BG and CZ ) will do a short period of training at De Pretto, and others  of  a textile course from Brno-CZ will do the same at Marzotto. The activities to promote Intercultura will continue; three students have already left for the USA where they will be staying for a year, however no prevision of this type of mobility is possible. The schools in Schio will continue to take part in the activities for the Exchange Program promoted by the Municipality of Schio with Landshut, German partner of the consortium. Other activities in English will be organized with local partners: conferences on international topics (\u201cIndustry 4.0\u201d and \u201cSharing Economy\u201d) held in English by Federmanager,   addressed to students of the fourth and fifth year, a whole day to promote work-training during the school period (ASL)  will be addressed to students of the third year, during this day all the activities will be in English. The event to promote European projects and let people know about them and the results  achieved, is being organized on the Europe Day 2018.
