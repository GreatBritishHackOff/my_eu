As a non-governmental organisation the BOF aims to improve the practical skills of young and senior environmental conservationists in order to enhance the successful employment of this special target group. Many of the Foundation\u2019s ongoing programmes are addressing recent, sectoral challenges such as the lack of hands-on trainings and linguistic skills. During the course of these partnership projects the BOF pinpointed several areas where adult education staff ought to be trained to become more efficient and more competent trainers. In this project the BOF intends to reinforce its adult education capacity through a) the modernisation of the pedagogical methodology in adult education, and through b) the development of adult education staff in the field of entrepreneurship. To achieve these objectives this programme will select 16 volunteers and/or professional trainers who are active in environmental adult education. The 16 participants will take part in a combined training which comprises a preparation phase in Hungary and a two week long tailor-made training course in the UK, hosted by Ambios Ltd. The preparatory training in Hungary will provide the participants with sufficient preliminary information on the four selected learning outcomes:\r\n\r\n1) New approaches and pedagogical views in adult education, skills and competencies\r\n2) The concept of organic life-long learning for adult learners\r\n3) The development of linguistic toolset (technical English course)\r\n4) Entrepreneurship in the environmental sector           \r\n \r\nThe learning topics will be actively discussed, demonstrated and experienced in depth during the course of the English training. Formal and informal teaching will deliver the learning content in English. The project duration is 12 months. Ambios Ltd (UK), the host organisation, has more than 20 years of experience in environmental and adult education.  \r\nThe most important expected impact of the project is that the beneficiaries will be more capable trainers because of the up to date knowledge (in methodology of adult education and entrepreneurship) which the project will provide. The entrepreneur thinking is regarded as a key competence to reduce the vulnerability of employees and career starters in such professions where employment prospects are not great. Hence, as a long term impact this project hopes to foster self-employment and entrepreneurship in the environmental sector. As a short term effect the Barn Owl Foundation intends to increase its weight in the environmental adult education with the help of the volunteers and staff as they develop their professional knowledge in adult education.", "http://www.ambios.net", null, "erasmus_2015-1-HU01-KA104-013125_1"], ["1DJ", "Conservation and Rural Employability", "Ambios Ltd", 6331.0, "CARE, Conservation and Rural Employability, is a joint UK : Portugal project that aims to widen participation in youth volunteering to 2 young people suffering isolation in rural Madeira, Portugal.

We have identified a continuing and growing national skills gap in the wildlife conservation employment sector in the UK for wildlife species identification and interpretation skills.  \r\n\r\nThe address this, and in line with Erasmus+ objectives, this Wildlife Survey and Interpretation Skills EU (WSIS-EU) project will fund 72 x 2-week and 16 x 3m+ (100 day) work-based mobilities for VET wildlife survey and interpretation skills trainees, 26 accompanying persons, 4 Advance Planning Visits linked to long duration mobilities and 6 VET staff training abroad mobilities and 4 host staff training visits.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to (within the lifetime of the project): \r\n1. Provide a period of \u2018real work\u2019 experience for wildlife identification, survey and interpretation skills VET trainees to increase their skills, confidence and employability via a mobility to a European wildlife organisation \r\n2. Ensure that this period of European experience is of relevance to the trainee and is certificated \r\nthrough our Wildlife Survey and Interpretation Skills ECVET curriculum\r\n3. Provide trainees with sufficient time and support to increase language skills and key competencies including: species identification, tracking and surveying, camera-trapping, bird ringing, live interpretation for different audiences (schools, families, public, specialists), team working and communication.\r\n5. Develop a sustainable European VET partnership which can share experience and develop future cooperation projects\r\n6. Enhance UK VET training provision by providing staff learning mobilities for our VET staff to relevant European hosts and vice versa\r\n\r\nWe will use the UK Diploma in Work-Based Environmental Conservation for national certification (City and Guilds) of our Wildlife Survey and Interpretation Skills ECVET curriculum and combine this with the European instruments ECVET and Europass and develop an e-badge certificate.  We will match the needs of the learner with the VET skills to be acquired during the mobility. \r\n\r\nOur Internationalisation Strategy has Strategic Goals (2018-2021) to offer mobility experiences that support trainees with different needs, to provide [trainees] with recognition for the skills needed in the world of work and to continue to develop a strong international focus and awareness in all our staff.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these goals, we wish this project to simultaneously address our international aspirations, the employment skills gaps identified above and our internal organisational needs.  These needs are: to widen participation in our VET offer; to focus our curriculum on being representative of the needs of the employers in the wildlife conservation sector, to expand our delivery of Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) into different European languages and to embed and update our VET Teaching and Learning delivery across all our staff.\r\n\r\nTo widen participation we will target VET learners from the following backgrounds:\r\nRecent graduates from first generation into Higher Education and/or low family income backgrounds, young people (18-30yrs), facing mental health challenges, educational difficulties, in long-term unemployment or those facing geographical obstacles such as living in a remote rural area.\r\n\r\nAs wildlife does not recognise borders it is important to engage trainees in this understanding and to look at the impact on the management of species in the context of global climate change and wildlife conservation at a European scale.  A European perspective therefore forms an important part of training the next generation of wildlife professionals to understand and mitigate the effects of global climate change.", "http://www.ambios.net", "Ambios Ltd", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-046951_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EX17"}
