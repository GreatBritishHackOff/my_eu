It will also design selective assays for screening and will obtain a new class of antimicrobials: compounds to block bacterial division.  New medicines to attack Gram-negative pathogens will decrease the burden of infectious disease and have a highly beneficial social and economic impact in Europe and beyond. Cell division is an essential and still underexploited process with excellent properties to yield new inhibitors to attack infection by blocking the proliferation of pathogens. Inhibitors directed against bacterial division targets, that are not present in eukaryotic cells, will be both effective and innocuous to humans and animals. In addition, as many of their structures will be based on interaction domains and synthetic scaffolds, they will generate resistance at levels lower than the present antibiotics. DIVINOCELL will apply existing and new knowledge on the molecular biology of Gram-negative cell division as well as novel analytical (nanodiscs), bioinformatic (molecular dynamics), structural (membrane protein crystals) and imaging (lanthanide staining) tools to exploit in the test tube the structures and interactions of targets in the divisome and the septum. DIVINOCELL will develop potent systematic screening assays and will use them to select compounds specifically tailored to inhibit the division of Gram-negatives (not precluding broad spectrum ones). Secondary activity and cell assays, based on the properties of bacterial division, will be generated to validate hits and advance them to leads. The medicinal properties of selected leads will be improved. The translational steps of the project will be developed by 4 SMEs in close collaboration with the 8 academic partners having well-proven expertise in molecular microbiology, protein chemistry, structural biology, biophysics, imaging  and bioinformatics.", 419046.0, 6973813.0, "DIVINOCELL", "Novel drugs against gram-negative bacteria", "Cell division is an essential process with potential to yield new inhibitors of infection by blocking the proliferation of pathogens. Inhibitors against bacterial targets, that are not present in eukaryotic cells, are both effective and specific.", "Gram-negative bacteria \u2014 such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella \u2014 cannot retain the crystal violet dye used in the gram-staining protocol. This is due to their complex outer envelope, which is formed by two flexible membranes that together maintain the integrity and shape of the cell.\n\nDue to this complexity these bacteria are less susceptible to antibiotics than those that do not contain a second membrane. To address this issue, the EU funded the project 'Exploiting gram-negative cell division targets in the test tube to obtain anti-microbial compounds' (http://www.cnb.csic.es/~divinocell/ (DIVINOCELL)).\n\nThe main focus was to inhibit bacterial proliferation by blocking known and novel targets in the process of cell division and envelope synthesis. This was carried out using E. coli as a model bacterium to screen various antimicrobial compounds that interfere with its proliferation. During E. coli proliferation, several proteins (FtsZ, FtsA and ZipA) assemble in the middle of the cell to form a division ring. Failure to do so results in bacterial death.\n\nDIVINOCELL developed an assay to screen for inhibitors of cell wall synthesis as well as a positive whole-cell assay based on properties of E. coli peptidoglycan hydrolase mutants. These assays helped to screen the library of compounds provided by partners.\n\nUsing models for the active centre of FtsZ, in silico procedures have identified three molecules that inhibit the activity of the protein and are active against E. coli. From a collection of kinase inhibitors, new inhibitors of in vitro FtsZ polymeriszation have been identified that induce the misplacement of division components.\n\nAdditional compounds also modified the interaction of FtsZ with ZipA and the interaction between FtsZ and FtsA. One of them was active against Burkholderia thailandensis, a multidrug-resistant bacterium. From a Streptomyces strain extract researchers obtained a new antimicrobial with a broad action spectrum. These compounds are currently at different phases of intellectual property protection.\n\nDIVINOCELL participants have published over 63 papers in top-ranking scientific journals and have participated in over 80 dissemination activities targeting the general public. Overall, project discoveries promise to open up new avenues for studying microbial proliferation and developing antibiotics to cure infections.", null, "http://www.demuris.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/149403.jpg", "fp7_89836_997611051"], ["3DG", "Intensified by Design\u00ae for the intensification of processes involving solids handling", "Reay David Anthony", "IbD\u00ae will create a holistic platform for facilitating process intensification in processes in which solids are an intrinsic part, the cornerstone of which will be an intensified-by-design\u00ae (IbD).

Five PI industry case studies will be implemented in mining, ceramics, pharmaceutical, non-ferrous metals and chemical processes using the IbD approach and to validate the IbD methodologies, tools, PI modules, control and fouling remediation strategies and the ICT Platform itself for the industrial implementation of PI in processes involving solids.
