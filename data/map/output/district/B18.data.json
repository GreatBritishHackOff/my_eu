Trends in globalisation have led to a convergence of spectator interest to just a few mainstream sports with culturally homogonous identities. Re-Play will focus on two families of TSG (Gaelic and Basque), that are integral to the fabric of their communities of origin and have successfully staved off this trend of convergence. Gaelic and Basque sports are also practiced internationally and experience high levels of participation amongst all genders and age groups. They also share common techniques and forms of play and thus, open the opportunity for the Re-Play project results to be applied to other TSGs. To this end Re-Play will include an advisory group of other TSG associations and its results will be made available under Open Source or Hybrid license models.

The goal is to enable fully interactive and personalised radio solutions, integrating broadcast radio with digital and social media, amounting to converged radio experiences. To realize this goal, MARCONI will pursue two concrete objectives. First, consumers will be able to interact with \u201clive\u201d radio through their preferred communication channel in ways that are richer than is feasible today, so that consumers feel more connected to the radio brand -even when not listening linearly- and better served in an individual way. Second, radio-makers will be given an integrated view on audience interactions and will be supported by interaction automation services. The net outcome will be enhanced audience engagement.\n\nMARCONI brings together a multi-disciplinary consortium to realize its vision.
