Our mission is to establish a best practice framework to rapidly provide robust data on vaccine benefits and risks to support accelerated decision-making.\n\nApproach: To achieve this vision through a public-private partnership, ADVANCE partners \n1. establish common grounds and rules for collaboration between public and private stakeholders for best practice conduct of studies on the benefit-risk of vaccines.\n2. map and promote synergies with pertinent other initiatives to maximize utilization of foreground and identification of gaps for program strengthening. \n3. profile data sources that will yield rapid access to burden of disease, vaccine coverage, and benefits and risks of vaccines \n4. adaptat and develop new methods for integrated benefit/risk assessment \n5. create the ADVANCE phase I and phase II data platforms to evaluate a code of conduct, data sources, and methods developed in other WPs via a series of public-private co-operative studies proof-of-concept studies. \n\nADVANCE partners embrace the enormous potential to improve public health across European Member States by collaboratively utilizing the rich information generated in clinical routine care and captured in health care databases. While the ADVANCE Forum concept engages all stakeholder groups in a parliament-like structure, specific representative committees drive the innovative progress. Specific attention will be given to workflows depending on the level of urgency and on who is requesting utilization of the framework: regulatory authorities, vaccine manufacturers, public health organizations.\n\nADVANCE partners leverage their recent pioneering achievements in establishing operative technological platforms, developing pharmaco-epidemiological methods for burden of disease, coverage, effectiveness and risk. ADVANCE partners also build on a track record of delivering results of ground breaking international collaborative studies of unprecedented population size. ADVANCE capitalizes on these achievements and tailors structures and processes to the needs of collaborative public-private vaccine benefit-risk assessment. ADVANCE partners will provide access to data on more than 40 million subjects for testing of methods and immediate studies.  \n\nThe existing technical platform boosted by the strong connection to the IMI EMIF project and many other synergistic initiatives will allow ADVANCE to focus on creating access modalities and accelerating exploitation of both underutilized and established rich data sources, to test innovative methods for integrated and vaccine specific benefit risk assessment, and to undertake real life studies from the outset of the project. \n\nConsortium: The ADVANCE Consortium is designed to engage all stakeholders in Europe, while ensuring project feasibility by careful selection of a small group of 15 partners driving progress.. The ADVANCE consortium comprises partners in multiple domains that collectively will allow us to achieve the goals of the call. The first domain consists of European and national organizations responsible for vaccine product assessment and program evaluation. The second domain comprises renowned scientists at the forefront of providing innovative solutions for integrated vaccine outcome assessment. The third domain represents organizations with access to electronic health care records of large populations and with ample expertise in the statistical analysis of large observational data from a public health and pharmacoepidemiological perspective.

The existence of a well-developed HIV/TB/Malaria infrastructure presents a prime opportunity to address other sexually transmitted diseases such as viral hepatitis efficiently and effectively. The overall goal of the EURIPRED is to coordinate and integrate international resources into a single specialised infrastructure to support European HIV, TB, Malaria and Hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis C virus studies from early drug, vaccine and microbicide discovery to clinical trials. This will be achieved by creating partnerships between European scientists and international research teams from disease endemic countries and strong collaborations between industry and public sector research. Although vaccines, drugs and microbicide research is being conducted in the European Union (EU) there is no single European infrastructure that brings international resources and facilities together to develop cost-effective products for the European market. To underpin this need, EURIPRED will integrate worldwide resources to allow European access to shared reagents. This integrated approach will strengthen international cooperation, increase research capacity in EU and developing countries and significantly contribute to the European Research Area (ERA). By minimising fragmentation and duplication of research efforts and pooling fragmented resources EURIPRED can improve European research efficiency and effectiveness.

It elaborated a novel industrial model for collaboration among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) throughout the product and network life cycle, focusing on the shift from development partnerships to production networks. Put more simply, this helps SMEs combine competences and resources to overcome obstacles such as targeting new markets, handling new materials or applying new technologies.\n\nIn this context, SMARTNETS designed tools and methods to support networks as they grow, all the way to final production and marketing. The approach is supported by the concept of smart organisations involving flexible virtual teams, dynamic processes, advanced communication technologies, combined competencies and synergy in development. In summary, the project team worked on supporting three key pillars: product life cycle, network coordination, and conscious transformation from development to production.\n\nA valuable series of complementary results emerged from the project in the form of processes, methods and guidelines to support SMEs in the industrial arena.
