The recent data deluge has made finding relevant content a daunting task. Users are presented with seemingly infinite choices for consumption and because recommendation systems are typically service or application specific and based on little or narrow data, which results in too coarse-grained recommendations. Furthermore, existing content delivery systems focus their media adaptation to match device and network characteristics, instead of users' context and profile that could help increase the relevance of content search and the viewing conditions.<br/>We introduce User Centric Networking (UCN), a new communication paradigm that leverages user information at large to store, discover and deliver content in the most optimal conditions at any time, for a given user in a specific context. UCN relies on a distributed Personal Information Hub (PIH) that contains information such as the user context, her mood, historical data about her taste, expectation, social acquaintances, and her network/device resources. UCN will use these data to decide at any point in time where to search content and where to deliver it from, and how to configure the delivery for a user in her context. In addition, UCN creates opportunities for a new range of personalized services, based on geo-location or fusion of very different sensor data for example.<br/>UCN will deliver prototypes for a new generation of Internet-based applications and services in the digital media sector and beyond. These prototypes will deployed in Technicolor's Home Networking product line, designed with real data and tested in real conditions at Portugal Telecom and a NICTA who both use Technicolor's most recent gateway technology.", 163028.0, 3861506.0, "UCN", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_111271_996266146"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0QW", "Learning  and holistic development for all pupils", "East Hunsbury Primary School", 35364.0, "East Hunsbury Primary School and Specialist Unit is committed to providing an inclusive and inspiring school experience that enables children to be the best they can be. We seek out high quality professional development opportunities that enable us to build on good practice, and inspire and enthuse us to grow further.  \r\nIn  2014 we set up a Nurture Group to support the social and emotional development of target pupils who were finding home and school expectations very challenging.  We employed specialist HLTAs, Leaning Mentors and Behaviour Support Assistants to work with children with cocial , emotional and behavioural needs to  enable us to remove some of the many barriers to learning and inclusion. We trained all staff in best practices relating to pupils on the Autistic Spectrum in mainstream Schools. In  2015, we began to set up a forest school on a small scale and make links with other outdoor learning opportunities. \r\n\r\n As  an IQM Flagship School  and Local Authority Partnership School we intend to actively seek out ways to further improve our successful  practice through first hand experience of the inclusion of SEN in mainstream schools, Specialist Units and Special Schools in Iceland and Croatia.\r\nThis is a good time for us to also reflect on what we do and look at inclusive practices in Sweden, where outdoor education is firmly embedded in the school curriculum.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we have set out clear objectives for this project:\r\n\r\nDevelop our outdoor provision\r\nDevelop a greater understanding of practices across Europe in order to enhance teaching and learning in school\r\nDevelop a greater understanding of nurture and well being across Europe\r\nFurther develop links to expand our European collaboration with new countries\r\nDevelop leadership models\r\n\r\nTo address our needs and to meet our objectives, we have chosen two paths:\r\n\r\n- Attendance at 3 different structured training courses in Sweden and in Iceland\r\n- Job shadowing opportunity in Croatia\r\n\r\nBoth mobility opportunities will provided an invaluable experience to develop our expertise, skills and knowledge as well as enhance our schools European dimension.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, all  mobilities focus on the areas of our needs and will allow us to reflect, adapt and improve our provision, which in turn will promote an environment where children have different opportunities to succeed as learners, spark interest and motivate, and develop to their full potential.\r\n\r\nAll participants have been chosen based on their motivation, interest and passion for these soecific areas as well as for their ability to drive change in school. All are able to reflect on their own practice in light of their findings, and work collaboratively with others to develop new experiences and methodology. T\r\nhey are:\r\nSenior leaders- to drive the project with passion, enthusiasm and successfully cascade to others\r\nSenCos- to support the identification of pupils who will benefit academically, socially and emotionally from forest school learning experiences\r\n Specialist Unit Teachers- committed to professional development and able to disseminate new learning to others\r\n1 Forest school leader  and Teacher- who shows commitment and drive to further develop highly effective outdoor learning and forest school provision, both in her own practice and by enabling others\r\n2 Forest school assistants - who show a real commitment to developing forest school and outdoor education throughout the school - and understand its potential through their own forest school training and experience. \r\n3 HLTAs ( Specialist Unit KS1 & 2) - who show a daily commitment to providing quality experiences for our children.\r\nA range of teaching and non teaching staff \r\n\r\nIn particular, participation  in this project  will lead to improvements in many areas, such as:\r\nOur ability to work collaboratively with European partners\r\nOur general standards of teaching and learning\r\nMotivation of staff (which we have previously experienced through participation in similar projects)\r\nA range of new teaching methods as a direct and indirect of each course\r\nUnderstanding other national learning contexts and methods\r\nKnowledge of culture and inter-cultural ideas and practices\r\nEnhanced learning opportunities for our children \r\n\r\nThis opportunity will allow us to further develop partnerships, working with other European colleagues that we meet in the host country, and colleagues visiting from elsewhere, that we hope will last beyond our visit. The cultural experiences for all the staff will be invaluable, to gain knowledge and understanding of the outdoor curriculum and SEND school system in Sweden and Iceland  as well as in Croatia and to share the cultural richness and  traditions while enabling future  partnerships which have the potential to support the success of our pupils in our academic learning and global citizenship.\r\nIn the long term we envisage an enhanced and inclusive curriculum experience for all our  children and the communities", "http://east-hunsburyprimary.net", "East Hunsbury Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035523_coordinator"], ["7HT", "Boost your career and discover Europe", "DACHSER Limited", 59915.0, "The mobility project (pool project) is aimed at 30 trainees and graduates that are between 18 and 28 years old and have studied or are currently studying in the following fields:\r\n- Aircraft Mechanics/ electronics \r\n- Commercial assistant with the focus onlogistic\r\n- Commercial industrial trade assistants or language assistants\r\n\r\nThe project will be coordinated by Education GmbH in cooperation with the following vocational schools and training companies:\r\n\u2022 DACHSER GmbH & Co.

These are adjusted to the above mentioned objectives, training needs of the trainees and guidelines of their respective educational institutions.\r\n\r\nTrainees and graduates who have completed the training recently are promoted from the 2nd and 3rd year of training on, so that theoretical knowledge and/ or professional experience can be provided by the trainee as a solid foundation for an internship of quality.\r\nEach educational institution establishes the practical training content. These are based on the teaching and training plan of the training course and are the substantive basis of the planned internship abroad. Internships are arranged individually and take place in the respective sector of the trainees.This is coordinated in cooperation with the receiving facilities in advance, with the result that the content quality of the project is ensured. \r\nA special form of mobility projects offers further professional education by the AHK Paris. The training is aimed exclusively at graduates in the commercial sector with good knowledge of french. The training consists in a practical part (4 days a week) and a theoretical training (1 day a week).
