Moreover, preventable adverse drug reactions are estimated in additional hospitalization costs of 1750-4500 \u20ac/patient. Currently, the allergy diagnosis is mainly based on the information given by invasive, single, and risky in vivo assays. In daily practice, few in vitro diagnostic methods are available and only used at the tertiary health services. These tests also lack of sensitivity (>0.35 kUA/L) and selectivity (<98%), resulting in an inaccurate diagnosis, analyze few drugs allergens (5), are time consuming (60-180 min), and expensive (30 \u20ac/allergen).\n\nCOBIOPHAD aims the development of an innovative in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device for diagnosis of IgE-mediated drug allergies by building an integrated biophotonic system based on compact disc technology. For that, key enabling technologies will be integrated in order to achieve high sensitive (<0.1 kUA/L), selective (>98%), multiplexed (10 BLCs), rapid (30 min), and low-cost (2.4 \u20ac/allergen) drug allergy test. The solution involves an advanced approach to the diagnosis and management of drug allergy with the aim to ameliorate patient safety. \n\nThe consortium comprises multidisciplinary knowledge on optics, electronics, advanced materials, biotechnology, smart microstructures, microfluidics, surface/organic chemistry, allergy, manufacturing systems, and telecom networking. Also, the key industrial actors, present in the consortium, will contribute to the manufacturing and placing the product on the IVD market.", 130686.0, 3668415.0, "COBIOPHAD", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_199874_953962021"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 1126.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_3888", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 2184.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_10346", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 2962.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_36054", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 1278.0, "Ensuring effective, efficient and reliable controls (17.04.03)", "fts_2016_42730", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 6034.0, "Supporting better environmental governance and information at all levels (07.02.03)", "fts_2016_45188", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 577.0, "Support expenditure for Erasmus+ (15.01.04.01)", "fts_2016_46032", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 469.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_48205", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 1711.0, "Better climate governance and information at all levels (34.02.03)", "fts_2016_56836", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 166.0, "Free movement of workers, coordination of social security schemes and measures for migrants, including migrants from third countries (04.03.01.03)", "fts_2016_66073", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 9031.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_6122", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 12700.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_14245", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 1160.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_27687", 2017], ["6PA", "JINGA FILMS LIMITED*JINGA", 5033.0, "MEDIA -programme \u2014 Operating transnationally and internationally and promoting transnational circulation and mobility (09.05.01)", "fts_2017_28615", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 528.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_29351", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 258.0, "Free movement of workers, coordination of social security schemes and measures for migrants, including migrants from third countries (04.03.01.03)", "fts_2017_39695", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 1033.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_43380", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 1072.0, "Providing quality statistical information, implementing new methods of production of European statistics and strengthening the partnership within the European Statistical System (29.02.01)", "fts_2017_45546", 2017], ["4TA", "INTER-CULTURAL YOUTH EXCHANGE LTD", 6172.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European youth area and the participation of young people in European democratic life (15.02.01.02)", "fts_2017_45760", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 300.0, "Ensuring effective, efficient and reliable controls (17.04.03)", "fts_2017_47046", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 1027.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_52130", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 475.0, "Support expenditure for research and innovation programmes in the \u2018Direct research\u2019 policy area (10.01.05)", "fts_2017_55342", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 205.0, "Support expenditure for European Social Fund and non-operational technical assistance (04.01.04.01)", "fts_2017_60425", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 102.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_68752", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "NW6"}
