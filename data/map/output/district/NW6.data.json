The activities are to a great extent either a continuation of former or current projects and this is with a view to give a chance for more colleagues to benefit from the first moves that the staff mobilities created for us in previous one year plus. At the same time, we are requesting two additions, which happen on a background of 1) already knowing the partners very well from a KA2 and Interreg collaboration and wishing to consolidate results by staff learning exchanges. And 2) to step-up the support for our students to make shorter stays to explore possible new opportunities for finding traineeships with companies across the German Border. \r\n\r\nPlans of mobilities as per description in the Charter application:\r\nFirst year (2016) Learners planned: 35 - realised: 37\r\nFirst year (2016) Staff planned: 20 -realised:  18 (1)\r\nSecond year (2017) Learners planned:  20 (2) \r\nSecond year (2017) Staff planned: 11 and 2018: 16 (3)\r\n\r\n1) The 18 staff mobilities include accompanying teachers. Remaining will take place during in 2017. It is worth remarking that the first administrative staff will be among these.\r\n2) For learners, the mobility programme for 2017 will contain that of Tietgen Business only. The turn has come to the gymnasium to have a new reform to fall into place and it has not been possible to involve a mobility trip in this year\u00b4s study schedule. It is expected that new learners\u00b4 mobility trip can be tested and approved for autumn of 2018.\r\n3) We continue to follow a more restrictive number till staff have had a chance to be more familiar with the new reforms.\r\n\r\nWe recently shared this with our existing partners, and we received a very positive feedback; \r\n\u201cAt Tietgen we are very pleased and thankful for the spirit in which the collaboration around the exchanges has taken place. \r\nPartnerships for collaboration in education (PACE)\r\nThis will be the heading of our 2017 application and in which we are stating that our aim is to continue and consolidate the results Tietgen has experienced, in particular:\r\n- Staff members returning with a lot of excitement \u201cin their luggage\u201d. They have been transferring this into a highly motivated and focused approach of including concrete international case material or advocating for getting a first hand international experience to their colleagues and students.\r\n- Tietgen is keen to further develop such effects and shall be seeking to make our motilities go closely hand in hand with the needs and objectives for the various study programmes e.g.:\r\no Students\u2019 search for internship/international practical training and trainee/apprentice  contracts;\r\no Teachers\u2019 search for best practices in learning styles, learning facilitation, guidance activities etc.\r\no Staff\u2019 search for broader understanding of practices around systems in education across countries incl. solutions to the ever-chancing profiles of special needs.\r\no As digitalization impact every field of business, our specific business related educational aims and practises cannot be excluded from this development. Knowledge and inspiration to/from the international community is vital for us also in this field.\u201d\r\n\r\nNeed for accompanying persons for student groups during their stay overseas. \r\nThe goal of the project in collaboration with London is that the students gain competencies of languages, cultural understanding majorly. Each student is required to prepare him or herself thoroughly and make a motivational application including their personal objectives with their education and traineeship. In addition, common objectives have been set for the exercise towards \u201cincreasing independence and self-confidence\u201d. To these achievements, goes organising own meals, logistics etc.  What is then left as the teacher\u2019s role and responsibility as accompanying teacher is on the one side practicalities in case of mishaps or emergencies. On the other side, it is to act as a mentor in support of the students\u2019 recognising their own achievements and grow in self-confidence from it. The mentor support concludes in London during the evaluation session at the last days of their stay. The evaluation session is attended by IL London\u2019s and Tietgen\u2019s representatives and the student. The students receive a quality copy of their Europass Mobilty after this session. \r\nImplementation of our internationalisation strategy\r\nThe fact that learner mobilities are now supported and to be tested on-line for their language skills is a good match to Tietgen\u2019s Internalisation Strategy. Language skills as part of the preparations for a stay, marks a quality assurance. Language check has been practiced at Tietgen and we look forward to embrace the digital elements.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-DK01-KA116-034170_1"], ["6NN", "\u0160tudent - \u0161kola \u2013 mobilita", "Kilburn Library", 54689.0, "Project Student-school-mobility is designed for two target groups:pupils and teachers of vocational subjects at Secondary Technical School in Snina.Main objective of the project for the 1st group is to form solid triangle with vertices which form symbiosis and connections:theory acquired at school,experience gained during internships in companies and area of work developed dissemination activities after completion of project activities.International dimension of project is defined by acquired linguistic competences and professional development of ICT technologies.Mobility internships are part of learning process.Basic objective is to enable participantsof professional training in companies that support priorities t we have identified in signing of Memorandum where rules and conditions of parties involved in project are explicitly stated, based on respect of rules of its own assessment of ECVET.Added value is to ensure conditions of professional experience in environment with use of modern technical equipment, which is not accessible to target groups atschools and companies in region.It includes strengthening of professional terminology in foreign language environment and teaching students operation of production process from is1st stage to shipping and overall functioning of the company.Pupil has to: acquire practical skills compatible with study focus of students, integrate directly into employment,understand the operation and management of companies,get to know technoequipment in companies,apply latest technological processes and trends learned in theory in practical activities,develop technical and economic thinking,develop digital skills and IT technology,gain comprehensive picture of running another company in  form of professional excursions,achieve professional linguistic competence in Eng. and German.Dominant element of project is development of ECVET plan, which is divided into 3 stages and at each stage are specified activities that will be monitored,evaluated,validated by internally defined criteria.Choice of partner organizations and  companies was based on experience of previous years, where we placed our students.Partners are  tried and we know their workload.
