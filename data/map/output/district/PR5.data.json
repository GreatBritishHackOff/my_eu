Yield losses due to the parasitic affects of nematodes vary significantly for different crops, however, it is estimated that over \u20ac1 billion/year of crop yield is lost in the EU and the figure is speculated to between \u20ac10-20 billion/year world-wide.  There are a number of existing solutions to prevent the huge losses due to nematode infestations, including; chemical nematicides (soil fumigants), solar heating/steaming and robust crop rotation.  However, all of these solutions have significant problems such as very negative environmental impact, high-cost, geographically specific and they all kill nitrogen fixing bacteria.  Nemasys proposes to develop a unique blend of naturally occurring essential oils (EO) as an alternative, cost-effective, soil treatment, which will be delivered by a novel time-release capsule.  A unique EO formulation has been discovered by Plant Impact (SME Co-ordinator), which shows a unique synergistic behaviour, to give significantly improved (>30%) improvement in nematicide efficacy. Allowing lower quantities of EO to be used and overcoming their limiting factor of \u2018taint\u2019.  The main work in the Nemasys will be to further investigate (and optimise) this effect, develop the delivery of the EOs to the soil and undertake the field-trials to allow future commercial funding to license the nematicide (in partnership with an LE distributor) under the pesticide safety directive.", 291816.0, 1146555.0, "NEMASYS", "Worming our way naturally to healthier soil", "Toxic pesticides and harmful methods to kill round worms in soil are giving way to natural, cost-effective alternatives. The result is safer crops, healthier soil and a cleaner environment.", "Nematodes or roundworms are one of the most common parasites found in soil. They feed on plant roots, stems, leaves, flowers and seeds and are a major contributor to agricultural crop losses. A vast number of crops in the EU are lost to nematode infestations, and current treatments have shown to be impractical, costly or toxic to the environment. Existing treatments include chemical nematicides (soil fumigants), solar heating/steaming and intense crop rotation.\n\nThe project ?Non-toxic and cost-effective essential oil-based nematicide and soil delivery system (Nemasys) is working on a radically different approach. It is developing an eco-friendly nematicide from a unique blend of naturally occurring essential oils that can combat nematode infestations without harming the soil and environment. These non-toxic oils have been tested positively in laboratory research on potato cyst nematodes.\n\nThe overall objectives of the project are to develop better essential oils that are more effective at eradicating or neutralising nematode activity. This requires the formulation of a suitable emulsifier to allow these oils to come into contact with the nematodes in soil. It also requires a new biodegradable soil delivery system, with plans for a time-release delivery system already under development. Once these have been achieved, minor issues such as treatment instructions, dosage and field trials must be established. Needless to say, the environmental impact must continuously be monitored to ensure it is safe. If all goes to plan, the Nemasys approach will yield a non-toxic nematicide that can be applied in a timely and cost-effective manner, removing the need for complete soil sterilisation which occurs with traditional methods such as toxic fumigation or steam.\n\nThere are several potential environmental and health benefits to this project. The acute neurotoxic effects of the highly toxic chemical nematicides have been linked with cancer and birth defects. The project is expected to reduce negative health effects on operators and others caused by wind drift, water pollution, etc. The project will also contribute to enhancing food quality and safety by providing consumers with fruit and crops free from pesticide residues. Important progress has been made here, and field testing and licensing are imminent.\n\nUltimately this eco-friendly approach to combating pests in agriculture may open the door to other similar ideas in the future, leading to better health, better food and better environments.", "http://www.bovinose.eu/", "http://www.plantimpact.com", "/docs/results/images/2011-02/45547.jpg", "fp7_92365_997887404"], ["6AW", "European Security in Health Data Exchange", "Lancashire Care Nhs Foundation Trust", "SHiELD will unlock the value of health data to European citizens and businesses by overcoming security and regulatory challenges that today prevent this data being exchanged with those who need it.

As a result of this project, our subject leader is now training staff through INSET and staff meetings in language skills in Spanish, our Teaching Assistants are now delivering Spanish sessions in certain year groups in school, and Spanish is now embedded throughout school as main language of learning. \r\n\r\nThe confidence of staff involved has increased through the teaching ideas learned and good practice shared.\r\n\r\nLanguages are a key element of our school development plan and we intend to use this experience to drive our school forward both in terms of our own language teaching and also in the support we will offer to other schools. \r\n\r\nWe need to build on the success of our current project.

This will involve six members of staff (one of which will be our languages coordinator) taking part in 8 day structured training courses in Santander, Spain. \r\n\r\nThese will be for immersion courses in Spain incorporating intensive language training, cultural immersion and activities, teaching methodology focused on primary languages teaching and the opportunity to spend time in the Spanish link school.

We have already employed a \u2018language specialist\u2019 teaching assistant so we have greater provision on delivering languages from September and will use this member of staff's language skills to help prepare us for our visits. We have planned some staff language courses, primarily for staff involved in the courses  but also the for whole school staff to enhance the profile of languages in our school. Our intention is to roll this out to parent beginner language sessions.\r\n\r\nThere will be a great impact on our curriculum as Spanish will be taught more consistently throughout the school, rather than just in KS1. This will impact on progression and long term attainment.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to disseminate the results of our project to our pupils through the changes we make to our teaching. We will have greater confidence in our linguistic and cultural knowledge and will also have lots of new teaching ideas. We will timetable special sessions in order to disseminate information about our courses and the project as a whole to all of our pupils. We will also have whole school assemblies at regular intervals during the course of the project and will use display areas to inform pupils and staff about what we are doing.\r\n\r\nThis project will follow on seamlessly from our current project. We will make good use of the final evaluation data from project 1 to give us a strong baseline to measure the impact of our second project.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the project, we will review our objectives and assess where we are already.
