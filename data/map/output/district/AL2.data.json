Such treatments are generally achieved through the preparation of the surface by grit/shot blasting, followed by the application of a primer, and followed by the application of several layers of intumescent coatings. This methodology has a number of drawbacks for a large community of end users, including: a)Drying times of intumescent coatings are very long, resulting in high cost associated to labour, site disruption, and space required for painting; b) As a consequence of those significant costs and burdens, the reality is that many end users, particularly SMEs, end up applying fewer layers than required, uneven or irregular layers, or none at all, breaching therefore current legislation, facing serious penalties and fees and endangering the security of their own installations. The STEELPROST project aims to provide a solution to current surface treatment limitations, by developing a second generation of fire-protective coatings that are: easier to paint on, covering a larger area faster, having improved adhesion and quick drying properties. This will be achieved through 3 core innovations: 1)Development of low cost fire-retardant agents using novel tin-based technology, based on nontoxic halogen-free additives ; 2)Combination of the above fire retardant agents with further nanoparticle additives to confer the paint outstanding adhesion to the metal, and increase abrasion and wear resistance properties; 3)Design and optimisation of a procedure for fast curing of the coating using existing heating source technologies such as infra-red (IR). The proposed technology is expected to reduce steelwork treatment cost in constructional projects on a 25% for on-site applications and 50% for off-site application.", 14410.0, 2002379.0, "STEELPROST", "Improved fire protection for steel supports", "Scientists developed novel fire-protective paints for steel supports with superior technical characteristics at reduced cost. This should boost steel construction, which has been losing ground to concrete in recent years.", "Fires can cause damage to steel support structures, leading to collapse in the most severe cases. Application of special fire-retardant (intumescent) paints is the most common protective action, yet it is plagued by difficulties. Among the most prohibitive is the long drying time and application of several layers of paint. Given that treatment is typically done on-site, the result is high labour costs with extended disruption of the work site. Moreover, faulty application leads to potential fines and questionable protection.\n\nEU-funded scientists developed a new generation of protective paints with work on the project 'Innovative fire protective coatings for steel structures' (STEELPROST). The novel formulations are designed to go on easier, stay on better and dry faster for an effective, economical and safe solution.\n\nLab-scale water-based coatings showed improved fire resistance and lowered intumescent temperature (where the coating puffs-up to form a protective shell around the steel structure). They also exhibited reduced drying times, significant reductions in cost with good mechanical and chemical performance accompanied by minimal smoke generation or toxic gas emission.\n\nStable intumescent dispersions were manufactured on industrial scale. Formulations were evaluated according to the Eurocodes for structural design (particularly the Structural Fire Engineering Design) to integrate them with advanced engineering criteria.\n\nSTEELPROST partners have applied for a Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), an international agreement for filing of a patent. In addition, they have identified an investment strategy for certification and marketing.\n\nMarket statistics demonstrate a decline in the use of steel construction in favour of concrete due to the difficulties associated with fire protection. The large number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that manufacture steel structures for the construction sector stand to benefit tremendously from STEELPROST outcomes.", null, "http://www.itri.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2013-11/57322.jpg", "fp7_96291_998109437"], ["2DD", "Life Cycle Assessment of Environment-Compatible Flame Retardants ( Prototypical case study)", "ITRI Ltd", "Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) will be phased out because of their environmental hazards. Less toxic alternatives appear to be available already but comprehensive information on their possible toxicological effects are lacking. ENFIRO offers a prototypical case study on substitution options for BFRs resulting in a comprehensive dataset on viability of production and application, environmental safety, and a complete life cycle assessment. Dissemination will ensure the project results to arrive at policymakers' desks. The ENFIRO consortium is a unique collaboration between industries, SME's and universities with a wide variety of scientific disciplines. ENFIRO will contribute to the phasing out of BFRs as proposed in the European Water Framework Directive. The approach and the results of ENFIRO will be useful for similar substitution studies, e.g. in REACH.  Following a study on literature and industrial information, and prioritizing , three flame retardant (FR)/product combinations will be selected (e.g. metal-based FRs, phosphorous-based and nanoclay-based FRs in printed circuit boards, paints and foam). These will be studied for environmental and toxicological risks, and for viability of industrial implementation, i.e. production of the FR, fire safety and application of the FR into products (electronics, furniture, paints, foams, etc.). All information from these tests will be used for a risk assessment. The outcome of that assessment will, together with socio-economic information be used in a complete life cycle assessment. The project will follow a pragmatic approach, avoiding final recommendations on environment-compatible substitution options that would not be viable for implementation by industry.
