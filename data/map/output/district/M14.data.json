These properties coupled with CMOS compatibility offer promise for a new generation of smart miniaturised systems for wireless communications.Graphene also exhibits impressive electrical and mechanical properties.CMOS compatible microwave graphene devices, still at their infancy, hold promise for extremely low noise and high speed communications.The coordinator (TRT) is one of the major world players in civilian & professional electronics.TAS is N\u00b01in Europe and N\u00b03 worldwide for civil and military aerospace products. One key area for their products is T/R front-end systems for applications like radars for which long term solutions are continuously sought after.The main concept of NANO-RF is the development of CNT&graphene based advanced component technologies for the implementation of miniaturised electronic systems for 2020 and beyond wirelesscommunications and radars.The major objectives of NANO-RF are the development of: Active components from CNTs&graphene Passive components from CNTs& grapheneCapacitive RF NEMS from CNTsCNTs based vertical interconnectsCNTs & graphene based ICsThe developed components and technologies will be implemented in the following demonstratorsReflect array antennae for wake vortex and weather radars and Graphene receiver moduleThe demonstrators will exhibit the reconfigurability, systemability, integratability and manufacturability of thedevelopedtechnologies and unify advanced", 148809.0, 4955437.0, "NANO RF", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_104973_968233922"]]}}, "outwardCode": "M14"}
