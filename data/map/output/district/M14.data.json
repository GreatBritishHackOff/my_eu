These properties coupled with CMOS compatibility offer promise for a new generation of smart miniaturised systems for wireless communications.Graphene also exhibits impressive electrical and mechanical properties.CMOS compatible microwave graphene devices, still at their infancy, hold promise for extremely low noise and high speed communications.The coordinator (TRT) is one of the major world players in civilian & professional electronics.TAS is N\u00b01in Europe and N\u00b03 worldwide for civil and military aerospace products. One key area for their products is T/R front-end systems for applications like radars for which long term solutions are continuously sought after.The main concept of NANO-RF is the development of CNT&graphene based advanced component technologies for the implementation of miniaturised electronic systems for 2020 and beyond wirelesscommunications and radars.The major objectives of NANO-RF are the development of: Active components from CNTs&graphene Passive components from CNTs& grapheneCapacitive RF NEMS from CNTsCNTs based vertical interconnectsCNTs & graphene based ICsThe developed components and technologies will be implemented in the following demonstratorsReflect array antennae for wake vortex and weather radars and Graphene receiver moduleThe demonstrators will exhibit the reconfigurability, systemability, integratability and manufacturability of thedevelopedtechnologies and unify advanced", 148809.0, 4955437.0, "NANO RF", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_104973_968233922"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["4FS", "Youth for Change", "Moss Side Sports Club", 23942.0, "The project \"Youth for Change' is an exchange project, which will take place in Stockholm. Young people from the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom will come together to learn with and from each other.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to empower young people by encouraging the development of skills and competencies needed to participate fully in European societies. In addition, the aim is to raise awareness of European values and socially relevant subjects.\r\nSUFIS  from Stockholm  is working on this project together with Moss side in the UK, Dalmar from Netherlands, and GIK from Denmark. These NGOs noticed in their daily work with migrant and refugee youth that they often experience barriers to full participation in the European society. They grow up in a society that differs culturally from the society in which they and / or their parents grew up. They are therefore confronted with cultural differences, but they are unaware of what that means for them. These  youngsters are not used to reflecting on this. Thus making their bi-culturality  a risk rather than an opportunity. They experience uncertainty and are unaware of the value of their latent inter-cultural competencies. Socio-economic inequalities are additional barriers to participate as full citizens.\r\n\r\nBy this exchange we offer 36 youngsters, aged 18 to 26 years with different background, the opportunity to enhance their knowledge and skills, and give them a learning experience in an international and inter-cultural environment. The participating youngsters participate in a program of diverse informal learning methods: energizers and other playful games, workshops, excursions, dialogue, debate and cultural exchange. They are encouraged to reflect on and take full responsibility for their learning process. This project enables young people to become active and socially engaged citizens and to use the gained knowledge and experience for the benefit of their societies.", "http://www.mosssidesportsclub.com", null, "erasmus_2017-2-SE02-KA105-001835_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "M14"}
