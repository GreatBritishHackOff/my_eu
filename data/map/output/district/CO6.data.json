As a result of this price fixing and market abuse by large enterprises, the SME involvement in this sector has diminished and requires research investment to re-build its presence. Additionally there is increasing pressure to replace the vulcanisation accelerator, ethylene thiourea (ETU), due to its assessment as a Cat 2 rep carcinogen as per the EU classification, IARC and EPA. It is believed that under REACH it will be classified as a CMR substance (Carcinogenic/Mutagenic/toxic for Reproduction) which will lead to legislation prohibiting or banning its use. The \u2018SafeRubber\u2019 project aims to develop a safer alternative accelerator to replace the carcinogenic ethylene thiourea (ETU) based accelerators to be used in the manufacturing of rubbers such as polychloroprene (CR) and epichlorohydrin (ECO). This will be based around a new catalyst molecule that has tri-functionality, which offers the added benefit of reducing consumption of metal oxides during manufacturing, lowering manufacturing costs and giving SMEs another unique differentiator, allowing them to compete in the market.", 59113.0, 2222733.0, "SAFERUBBER", "Quickly and safely getting up to speed", "Vulcanisation is a chemical process that makes rubber more durable. A novel process accelerator developed with EU support is an eco-friendly alternative to the currently used carcinogen and will help put EU manufacturers ahead of the competition.", "Ethylene thiourea (ETU)-based accelerators have been the industry standard for speeding the vulcanisation process (acting as an accelerator). However, ETU has now been classified as a suspected human carcinogen by various EU bodies. Its use is expected to be restricted or prohibited by the EU in the near future.\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) working in the rubber sector will be particularly hard hit, particularly in the face of rising competition from Asian countries with less stringent health and safety requirements. A large consortium took advantage of EU investment to find a safe replacement for ETU. Scientists developed an eco-friendly and inexpensive alternative within the context of the project http://www.saferubber.eu (SAFERUBBER) .\n\nThe additive SRM102 demonstrated many important benefits. Chloroprene rubbers made with SRM102 have improved flow characteristics, much more easily filling the mould. This has potential to reduce both the mass of rubber used and the scrap generated. In addition, it is possible to reduce levels of zinc oxide, a vulcanisation activator.\n\nOptimisation of the SRM102 may also decrease the cure cycle for savings in time and energy consumption. Finally, results of studies of algae growth on samples produced with SRM102 suggest it is not toxic.\n\nFive factories in three countries tested processing of chloroprene rubber containing SMR102. Scientists found the additive to perform as well as or better than compounds containing ETU. In rubber manufacturing trials, SRM102 was shown to be a viable replacement for ETU.\n\nWhile technical viability is critical, commercialisation relies on the bottom line. Since the percentage of SRM102 required compared to rubber content is similar to that of ETU, the new additive is expected to have minimal effect on the final manufacturing cost.\n\nSAFERUBBER has delivered a safe and cost-effective alternative to the carcinogenic rubber vulcanisation accelerator additive ETU. The numerous European SMEs active in the sector stand to benefit tremendously. Technology will help them meet the challenge of increasing competition from Asian countries unlikely to be affected by stricter regulations.", null, "http://www.brppa.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/148614.jpg", "fp7_96346_991713839"], ["3BW", "Identification of legal rules and administrative processes applicable to Fuel Cell and Hydrogen technologies\u2019 deployment, identification of legal barriers and advocacy towards their removal.", "Uk Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association", "The fuel cells and hydrogen (FCH) industry has made considerable progress toward market deployment. However existing legal framework and administrative processes (LAPs) \u2013 covering areas such as planning, safety, installation and operation \u2013 only reflect use of incumbent technologies. The limited awareness of FCH technologies in LAPs, the lack of informed national and local administrations and the uncertainty on the legislation applicable to FCH technologies elicit delays and extra-costs, when they do not deter investors or clients.\n\nThis project aims at tackling this major barrier to deployment as follows:\n   \u2022 Systematically identifying and describing the LAPs applicable to FCH technologies in 18 national legal systems as well as in the EU proper legal system.\n   \u2022 Assessing and quantifying LAP impacts in time and/or resource terms and identify those LAP constituting a legal barrier to deployment. \n   \u2022 Comparing the 18 countries to identify best and bad practices\n   \u2022 Raising awareness in the countries where a LAP creates a barrier to deployment. \n   \u2022 Advocating targeted improvements in each of 18 countries \\ EU level\n   \u2022 It will make all this work widely available through: (1) A unique online database allowing easy identification, description and assessment of LAPs by country and FCH application.

(3) A series of national (18) and European (1) workshops with public authorities and investors.\n\nHyLAW sets up a National Association Alliance not just for the duration of the project, but for the long term consolidation of the sector under a single unified umbrella.
