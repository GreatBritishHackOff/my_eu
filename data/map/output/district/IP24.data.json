This unique approach, moving on from the current state of the art using rigid cell or film based PV materials and batteries, will allow development of large-area deformable products, including agricultural shading, automotive soft-tops, building facades, rollable shades, curtains and roofing, aerospace fabrics, and outdoor goods.\n\nThe key challenges are:\n\u2022\tFormulation of PV and energy storage materials to be applied as flexible thin coatings on monofilament fibres. SME materials suppliers Cyanine (PV dyes) and PPC (polymer coatings) will work with universities, EPFL (PV) and Brunel (storage) who are leaders in these fields.\n\u2022\tDevelopment and application of fibre spinning and coating methods to make the two multi-layer fibre types, followed by generation of a textile combining the two. Fibre and fabric manufacturers Sefar, CeNTI (SME) and VDS weaving (SME) will work with textile and coating experts, Centexbel and TWI.\n\u2022\tIntegration of the two fibres, requiring end preparation to reveal conductors, interconnect and micro-circuitry, followed by attachment to a load device. Materials joining and smart textile experts, TWI, Cetemmsa and Ohmatex (SME) will work on this.\n\u2022\tDemonstration activities which will involve a small-scale autonomous airship by Lindstrand (SME), and agricultural textiles by BTF, both strong innovators in their fields.\n\nThe 6 innovative SMEs, 2 LEs and the RTOs with extensive links in solar power, microsystems and textiles industries, are well placed to quickly exploit the project developments and provide extensive exposure of the ideas into a wide variety of markets requiring a continuous, fully autonomous and truly flexible pow", 57942.0, 4378156.0, "Powerweave", "Textiles that generate and store electricity", "Imagine incorporating photovoltaic technology with energy storage in flexible fabrics for convertible car tops, tents, awnings, curtains and greenhouse covers. EU support is making it possible.", "Rigid photovoltaic devices can now be seen on rooftops and solar farms around the world. Flexible fabrics that do the same work could easily exploit the exact places where the Sun is most intense and shade is desirable.\n\nNovel fibrous materials to harvest sunlight and store electrical energy are under development by EU-funded scientists within the scope of the project \u2018Development of Textiles for Electrical Energy Generation and Storage\u2019 (http://powerweave.eu (POWERWEAVE)) . The technology combines photovoltaic fibres based on dye-sensitised solar cell technology and rechargeable energy storage fibres exploiting thin-film battery or supercapacitor technology. Fibres are knitted or woven together into a photovoltaic textile for significant benefits of reduced weight, flexibility, ease of storage and transportation.\n\nScientists have already produced small samples of fibres for the photovoltaic cell that exceeded performance objectives. Innovative sensitiser dye formulations have scored a world record efficiency of 11.1%. Energy storage research has produced amazing results with single-wire supercapacitors up to 10 metres in length successfully woven into a fabric without loss of performance.\n\nWork is now focused on the development of industrial-scale production techniques for the two types of multi-layer fibres. Researchers are also developing a fabric prototype that can integrate photovoltaic and energy storage functions. Preliminary tests of various design concepts and optimisations will be integrated to yield a simple and reliable foldable fabric power supply.\n\nThis light-weight fibre-based technology facilitates production of systems with large surface area to address areas where heavy infrastructures are problematic such as on roofs. With development of both generation and storage technologies, it should be possible to produce 100% generation or 100% storage materials or a combination of both. Finally, these systems would aim to require minimal installation, just a roll out and plug in.\n\nPOWERWEAVE technology will be a welcome addition to large markets for both commercial and consumer applications. Besides currently targeted sectors, this technology could also be applied to sectors such as commercial greenhouses, aircraft, clothing and areas without access to electricity grids.", null, "http://www.peerless-coatings.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140725919.jpg", "fp7_103712_954688454"], ["1HZ", "Development of safe and resilient flooring with controlled slip under varying environments", "Peerless Plastics & Coatings Ltd", "The production and installation of resilient flooring in public and private buildings is a major business in Europe involving various sectors including material and coating production, designers, architects, installers, cleaners as well as the end-users. The main requirements are: durability, ease of installation, optical appearance, ease of cleaning and low cost maintenance.\nOn the other hand slip accidents are a major source of injury in Europe. The floorings industry is therefore challenged to develop flooring with improved slip behaviour under varying environmental conditions (humidity caused by rain or cleaning can reduce friction dramatically). Besides there is often a conflict of interest between decreasing slipperiness and maintaining ease of cleaning  because conventional approaches to reduce slipperiness imply the macroscopic roughening of the surface resulting in the collection of dirt (problem in hospitals).\nWith new standards and testing methods harmonised in Europe this problem becomes more prominent, requiring substantially new and innovative approaches to address the problem by the flooring industry, like material suppliers, coating technology manufacturers, flooring installers, cleaners and companies developing testing methods.\nSlipSafe involves the key players in the industry in an integrated bottom-up approach. Based on fundamental studies of the tribological phenomena of slip under varying environmental conditions, SlipSafe will develop new intelligent material formulations and processes to gain control of the interface between flooring and shoe. New technologies will allow the use of these new materials in flooring manufacturing as well as in an after-treatment process to renew existing or worn out floorings with anti-slip properties. A key aim is to at least double service life and to allow easy cleaning. An important factor will be development of a new testing method, allowing monitoring of slipperiness as a function of the wear of installed flooring material.", null, 2158258.0, "SLIPSAFE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.peerless-coatings.co.uk", null, "fp7_111374_954688454"]]}}, "outwardCode": "IP24"}
