These needed competencies we wish to develop with an apprenticeship exchange program. The development of personal competencies, especially strengthened confidence, will enable apprentices to be more practically oriented in their daily tasks. Additionally, during the exchange apprentices will be able to identify best practices regarding processes, techniques and ways of working and will share them with their home country as well as the partner organizations.\r\nAfter our pilot project in 2016, we plan to send abroad 12 apprentices of the supply chain track to support our business units overseas for a duration of 5-12 weeks. They will be placed operationally in one of our core products, which compose of ocean, air and road freight. Activities, which will be taught and trained during an exchange period in the department air freight import may involve training in new IT systems, incident handling as well as creating and validating invoices. Activities with regards to air freight export include creating AWBs, identifying security status and enhancing customer communication tools. The exchange program will be supported and apprentices will be supervised locally by mentors who are operationally embedded in the respective departments. Together with trainee managers in Germany, they will verify whether the agreed training plans are followed properly. Next to the development of competencies and skills like mobility, self-confidence, language and inter-cultural skills, the apprenticeship exchange program offers a platform to network with diverse people in the partner organizations. This can build the basis for the development of career opportunities either directly after graduating or at a later stage. Further, with these efforts we wish out local business units to further development an attractive branding specifically for apprenticeship candidates on both local and regional level. Overall, in the long-term we aim at implementing an apprenticeship exchange program as a fixed part in our apprenticeship studies in order to build closer networks with our business units overseas, to optimize processes and to develop our internationalization efforts.", "http://www.panalpina.com/www/gbr/en/home.html", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003906_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TW14"}
