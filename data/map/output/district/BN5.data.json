The project focuses on sports coaching and tourism as these are two areas where there is a proven need for a more skilled European workforce, and for which the town of Lebrija is rich with work experience opportunities. Additional factors such as increased linguistic competences, the cultural experience of living in another country, and the personal benefits to be gained by successfully undertaking a period of work experience abroad, make this project an overwhelmingly positive opportunity for our students.\r\n\r\nProject Objectives:\r\nThe main project objectives are as follows:\r\n1) Supporting participants to develop vocational skills and gain relevant work experience\r\n2) Tourism skills: helping our tourism students gain an understanding of the sector in Spain and wider Europe\r\n3) Sports coaching skills: helping our sports students gain an understanding of European coaching methods in sports\r\n4) Improving the participation of young women in sports coaching and providing significant added value to our disadvantaged students\r\n5) Empowering and improving participants\u2019 confidence by positive interaction with others\r\n6) Deeper cultural understanding of Europe and European projects\r\n\r\nNumber and Profile of Participants:\r\nThe primary target group for the AIM project is young people aged 18-24 from Brighton & Hove who are interested in careers in either sports coaching or tourism and have taken \u2013 or are taking \u2013 either our Level 1 Award in the Principles of Coaching Sport or our Level 2 Certificate in Travel and Tourism Destinations. Additionally, we will place special emphasis on recruiting young women, particularly in the area of sports coaching. We expect that many participants will not have lived, worked or travelled abroad before. \r\nThe project will last one year and involve 28 participants in total; 7 participants at a time over the course of 4 flows. Each flow will alternate between Sports Coaching and Travel & Tourism and there will be an equal division between each sector (2 flows of each). \r\nDescription of Activities:\r\nThe main project activities will include:\r\nRecruitment: CoCo will distribute information about the project to current and past learners, who will then undergo an application process involving an application form, an interview with a CoCo member of staff and then a confirmation from the host employer. \r\nPreparation: The participant, tutor and host employer will sign a Learning Agreement specifying the main learning outcomes to be worked towards during the mobility. CoCo will organise group meetings with the other participants ahead of departure. 10 hours of language training will be given to students. \r\nPlacement: Six weeks of work experience including weekly progress meetings with host employer and a member of 3Si. Cultural activities will involve visits to nearby towns and cities and trips to places relevant to the students\u2019 interests e.g the Sevilla FC stadium for the sports coaching students. Participants receive weekly Spanish classes.\r\nFollow-up and Evaluation: Participants write case studies, attend exit interviews and fill in a final monitoring report to provide us with feedback. We encourage them to stay active on our social media pages so that we can track their professional progress.\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nThe project provides a robust framework of support for our participants, many of whom will be from disadvantaged backgrounds. We believe that for young adults who have not lived or worked abroad before, six weeks is a manageable period of time for them to gain valuable skills, increase their cultural awareness and benefit from a renewed sense of confidence in their ability to face challenges and succeed. By combining a theoretical course with practical work experience, our participants will hone a whole range of both hard and soft skills.\r\n\r\nResults and Impact:\r\nOur aim is that each participant will be the beneficiary of an invaluable experience which will have positive impacts on their personal and professional lives. Based on discussions with potential participants as part of our research, we expect at least 65% to go onto further education or employment after their placement in Lebrija.\r\nWe also believe that the programme will bring added value to the other partners involved, particularly in the areas of staff training, capacity building and quality management. \r\n\r\nLong-term Benefits:\r\nWe will share the results of the AIM project with national and international partners as a means of encouraging efforts to integrate our target groups (in particular, disadvantaged groups and young women) into the European workforce. Feedback from the project will enable us to improve the services and support we offer as a training provider and develop more projects in the future.", "http://www.community-coach.co.uk", "COMMUNITY COACH LTD", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047233_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BN5"}
