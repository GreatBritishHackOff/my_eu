It significantly affects the concentration of greenhouse gases and it threatens electrical and electronic devices, in particular, when placed on elevated structures like wind turbines or aircraft, and when these structures are built with modern composite materials with inherently low electric conductivity. In addition, even our fundamental understanding of atmospheric electricity is far from complete. New discharge processes in the atmosphere above thunderstorms have been discovered, the so-called Transient Luminous Events (TLEs)   in the stratosphere and mesosphere, and Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs) that emit particle beams of antimatter. These phenomena demand thorough investigations, in geophysics and in the related fields of plasma and high-voltage technology where similar discharges appear.\nThese challenges are approached within the SAINT project with a multidisciplinary and inter-sectorial training platform for 15 ESRs. The platform brings together satellite and ground observations with modelling and lab experiments. It couples scientific studies to applications relevant to industries developing satellite data products, plasma discharge technologies, lightning detection systems and lightning protection devices.  \nWith SAINT, we take advantage of the extraordinary opportunity presented by three simultaneous space missions with dedicated instruments to study lightning discharges, TLEs and TGFs, to integrate the unique space data with dedicated novel ground observations, model developments and lab experiments.

This approach also eliminates the need for: \n -) voltage limiting \u2018wet mate\u2019 inductive couplings; \n -) expensive subsea interventions for maintenance and defouling;\n -) expensive subsea construction techniques.\nThe technology has a low environmental impact (no piling for the deployment of the deadweight anchors and limited seabed trenching are required), an easy installation, a low visual impact in comparison to industry alternatives (it protrudes 10 meters above water level), a full material recovery during the decommissioning process.\nBy WATEC, low-head hydropower sector will be revolutionized as it will be possible to apply a technology able to make competitive damless HP, thus dramatically enlarging the HP application potentialities.'", 44080.0, 62971.0, "WATEC", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_210382_921132177"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["7BH", "PLIOSAUR ENERGY LTD", 43613.0, "Making the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system (08.02.03.03)", "fts_2017_57564", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "BS20"}
