To a large part this is necessary for keeping up performance and function, often for health reasons, although sometimes this is for purely aesthetic effects. Thus, easy-to-clean, soil release and antimicrobial properties are linked aspects that are of great importance such: health and avoidance of cross-contamination in medical textiles; improvement in comfort and freshness in consumer apparel; reduction of spoilage or wastage during storage and transport; increase useful lifetime of articles. These benefits further contribute to the overall goal of sustainable product development, to save energy and to protect our water resources. As alternative to commonly used biocidal chemicals, we propose a new surface modification concept that can control surface microbial contamination, particularly the development of bacterial colonies and biofilms.  Taking into account the needs of customers and environmental protection, the NanoBond Project aims to develop a new antimicrobial \u201csoft nanotechnology\u201d that comprises:  \u2022Adaptability to a wide range of consumer and industrial applications.  \u2022A responsive technology that adapts to the particular requirement for anti-microbial effect without \u201cswamping\u201d the environment with the un-restrained release of chemical antimicrobial agents, which is typical of other antimicrobial technologies.  \u2022Highly-tailored solutions by altering the characteristics of the polymeric nano-film. The NanoBond Project will exploit the \u201csoft nanotechnology\u201d to create nano-structured and functional surfaces that can impart multiple beneficial properties, or can act as a scaffold for the further incorporation of other performance finishes.  \u2022Durability and effectiveness for the life of the goods. \u2022Easy application and low application levels.", 110552.0, 1900330.0, "NANOBOND", "Taking technical textiles to the next level", "While Europe's traditional textile industry has experienced increasing competition from low-cost manufacturing countries for decades, a prosperous new technical textile industry has emerged. An EU-funded project sought to exploit this potential new market.", "Technical textiles \u2013 which are manufactured for non-aesthetic purposes \u2013 are used in a number of sectors for protective clothing, furniture and construction. To remain competitive, however, the technical textiles sector needs to develop new flexible production technologies to respond rapidly to market demand. Such technologies must achieve a balance between efficient large-scale production and customer-oriented diversification.\n\nThe aim of the EU-funded 'Integration of emerging soft nanotechnology into the functionalisation of textiles' (NANOBOND) project has been to enable easy diversification and fast adaptability in the sector. The project focused on technical niche markets where cost is less of a determining factor in the take-up of new technology. This is consistent with the aim of sustaining specialised industries in Europe and will be less prone to copying and substitution.\n\nProject partners successfully developed a new novel bonding technology that permits the development of antimicrobial and multi-functional textiles. Current antimicrobial treatments tend to be harmful to both humans and the environment.\n\nNANOBOND's technology (I-link\u00ae) is based on the formation of a nanocoating film on textile surfaces, which structure the antimicrobial molecules.  The antimicrobial molecules are well organised and structured such that the surface of the substrate is protected from harmful germs. This also guarantees that the antimicrobial network does not leach from the substrate, and therefore does not damage skin or the environment.\n\nNANOBOND members also succeeded in increasing the wash durability of the antimicrobial treatment on work wear, increasing its lifespan and reducing the wash temperature. The new technology has the potential to expand into new applications in non-related areas. Staff training and education in the traditional textile industry will generate a new and highly technical workforce better able to meet the future demands of this changing industry.", "http://www.nanobond.org", "http://www.dcsdesigns.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2013-03/54701.jpg", "fp7_93699_996536679"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PO2"}
