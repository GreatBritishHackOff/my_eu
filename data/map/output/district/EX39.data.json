The outcome is damage on an extraordinary scale, to the hugely expensive aircraft they are servicing. The direct cost of ground accidents involving Ground Support Equipment (GSE) and their aircraft amounts globally to \u20ac1billion annually and a staggering \u20ac5billion in indirect costs. As more aircraft manufactured from composite materials come into service, these costs are likely to rise even higher. More worryingly, safety will be compromised as damage to composites can easily go unnoticed.\n\nExisting state-of-the-art technologies cannot address this growing problem. The Ramp-Aware project will develop a novel system for sensing the location of GSE in relation to aircraft, thereby greatly reducing the number of costly collisions between GSE and aircraft. This system will provide a robust solution for its environment, by achieving the following objectives: specialist short range radar capable of 50mm ranging accuracy at 30m from aircraft with a vehicle orientation detection accuracy of 0.1\u00b0 in all weather conditions and a GSE positional tracking system with overall accuracy of 50mm.\n\nUsing this solution the project expects to comprehensively address the problem of accidents involving GSE & aircraft on the ramp. In doing so, we will deliver \u20ac42.02 million revenue with a profit of \u20ac10.95 million to the SME partners after 5 years. This will lead to the creation of over 200 highly skill jobs, greatly reduce the enormous direct and indirect costs of damage for ground handling providers and airlines, alleviate travel disruptions to passengers, make the job of the ground handler more manageable and safer, reduce the emerging threat of unnoticed damage to composite aircraft which will maintain and improve air safety standards.", 265916.0, 1319889.0, "RAMPAWARE", "Safely guiding airport vehicles", "An EU group is developing tools that prevent drivers of aircraft support vehicles from colliding with parked aeroplanes. The system employs several sensing and navigation methods plus analysis software, which together alert drivers about proximity.", "Major European airports are becoming steadily more overcrowded, and the EU is addressing the problem with certain measures intended to improve airport ramp efficiency. Yet, as a consequence, airport-apron accidents have dramatically increased, causing worker injuries and many billions of euros worth of damage to aircraft.\n\nThe EU-funded http://rampaware.eu/ (RAMPAWARE) project  comprises eight-members in a consortium whose expertise includes radar design, control systems, system integration and navigation systems.\n\nThe proposed sensing and navigation technologies include synthetic aperture radar (SAR), the automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast (ADS-B) type of satellite positioning, an inertial navigation tracking system and other smart sensors. The project is also summarising the sensor information for the vehicle driver via a graphical user interface.\n\nTeam members initially developed specifications for system requirements and conducted basic SAR research concerning quick detection of large objects. The research yielded optimal algorithms for accurate tracking of vehicle position and shape changing, control systems suitable for most GSE vehicles and an automated immediate braking system. The project also developed its inertial navigation tracking system, and validated the associated prototype software. Other technologies under development include a radar sensing system for feature extraction and accurate, all-weather positioning.\n\nThe RAMPAWARE project deliverables stand to create jobs and business opportunities, while improving airport worker safety and increasing aviation profitability.", null, "http://www.navtechradar.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-07/159409.jpg", "fp7_107426_953544630"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["3AG", "RBZ", "BIDEFORD HOSPITAL"], ["3AG", "RBZ", "NURSE PRESCRIBER BIDEFORD HOSPITAL"], ["3AG", "RH8", "BIDEFORD HOSPITAL"], ["3AG", "RWV", "BIDEFORD AND DISTRICT HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EX39"}
