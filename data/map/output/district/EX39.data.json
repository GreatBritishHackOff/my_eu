The outcome is damage on an extraordinary scale, to the hugely expensive aircraft they are servicing. The direct cost of ground accidents involving Ground Support Equipment (GSE) and their aircraft amounts globally to \u20ac1billion annually and a staggering \u20ac5billion in indirect costs. As more aircraft manufactured from composite materials come into service, these costs are likely to rise even higher. More worryingly, safety will be compromised as damage to composites can easily go unnoticed.\n\nExisting state-of-the-art technologies cannot address this growing problem. The Ramp-Aware project will develop a novel system for sensing the location of GSE in relation to aircraft, thereby greatly reducing the number of costly collisions between GSE and aircraft. This system will provide a robust solution for its environment, by achieving the following objectives: specialist short range radar capable of 50mm ranging accuracy at 30m from aircraft with a vehicle orientation detection accuracy of 0.1\u00b0 in all weather conditions and a GSE positional tracking system with overall accuracy of 50mm.\n\nUsing this solution the project expects to comprehensively address the problem of accidents involving GSE & aircraft on the ramp. In doing so, we will deliver \u20ac42.02 million revenue with a profit of \u20ac10.95 million to the SME partners after 5 years. This will lead to the creation of over 200 highly skill jobs, greatly reduce the enormous direct and indirect costs of damage for ground handling providers and airlines, alleviate travel disruptions to passengers, make the job of the ground handler more manageable and safer, reduce the emerging threat of unnoticed damage to composite aircraft which will maintain and improve air safety standards.", 265916.0, 1319889.0, "RAMPAWARE", "Safely guiding airport vehicles", "An EU group is developing tools that prevent drivers of aircraft support vehicles from colliding with parked aeroplanes. The system employs several sensing and navigation methods plus analysis software, which together alert drivers about proximity.", "Major European airports are becoming steadily more overcrowded, and the EU is addressing the problem with certain measures intended to improve airport ramp efficiency. Yet, as a consequence, airport-apron accidents have dramatically increased, causing worker injuries and many billions of euros worth of damage to aircraft.\n\nThe EU-funded http://rampaware.eu/ (RAMPAWARE) project  comprises eight-members in a consortium whose expertise includes radar design, control systems, system integration and navigation systems.\n\nThe proposed sensing and navigation technologies include synthetic aperture radar (SAR), the automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast (ADS-B) type of satellite positioning, an inertial navigation tracking system and other smart sensors. The project is also summarising the sensor information for the vehicle driver via a graphical user interface.\n\nTeam members initially developed specifications for system requirements and conducted basic SAR research concerning quick detection of large objects. The research yielded optimal algorithms for accurate tracking of vehicle position and shape changing, control systems suitable for most GSE vehicles and an automated immediate braking system. The project also developed its inertial navigation tracking system, and validated the associated prototype software. Other technologies under development include a radar sensing system for feature extraction and accurate, all-weather positioning.\n\nThe RAMPAWARE project deliverables stand to create jobs and business opportunities, while improving airport worker safety and increasing aviation profitability.", null, "http://www.navtechradar.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-07/159409.jpg", "fp7_107426_953544630"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["4DX", "VET Itineraries with a Variety of open Educational Resources enhanced by a multilingual repository", "Torridge Training Consultants Ltd", 177546.0, "VETIVER deals with the creation and use of OER both as standard SCORM packages available from the repository and as learning itineraries. The resources will be about Service Based Training for teachers and about entrepreneurship, ICT, English, Interior Designer and Furniture and interior Design Technology for learners. Learners will be between 14 and 18 years, and the main target group will be VET students, though due to the possibilities of personalization and inclusion the environment will provide, they will be also available for 14-16 pre NEET (Not in Education, Employment and Training), 16 yrs+ in further education and also Companies for their training processes.The partnership comprises of five partners in five European countries: Spain (FS22), UK (TTC), Turkey (Afyon MTAL), Greece (ACHAIA), and Hungary (SZAMALK). Selected by their knowledge and practices, but, also to ensure a European width to provide greater integration of EU member states educational systems and practices.The project improves an existing repository from Revetax project to make it multilingual, more interoperabel and with better user experience and usability, within an environment with eLearning and ePortfolio platforms. We will work with teachers/mentors of students, to be sure they understand the system and the project methodology.The project will start with the development of the common communication and management tools and reports:Website,Promotional materials (leaflet and poster).Dissemination Plan (communication activities and social networks) 4 newsletters in all partners languagesEvaluation Plan.Exploitation plan.\u2028The project will have seven intellectual outputsVETIVER HANDBOOK AND TAXONOMIES: design of the information and knowledge will be used as the key driver to other outputs and handbook where teachers can find what to do with the project and how to do it.VETIVER Repository: From the repository developed in the revetax project (and awarded by the Spanish National Agency as the best VET partnership in 2015) and available at http://revetax.eu/repository we want to expand and improve. Make it multilingual (currently only in English), and index all the resources using LRE thesaurus (http://lreforschools.eun.org/web/guest/lre-thesaurus). Also a multiple level evaluation and better user experience.OER CREATION: it is important to create good content for teachers (Service Based Training) and students (about all the areas mentioned above). All the resources created will be creative common licence (by-nc-sa) so that they can be used freely after the project. To create the OER, we will used the instructional design and generate videos, animations, \u2026, needed to generate afterwards a SCORM package using Captivate, to be used in any LMS which is SCORM compliant. We\u2019ll create between 8 and 10 packages for each area. All the packages will be translated to all the languages of the project partners.COURSES, ITINERARIES AND VETIVER PLATFORM IMPLEMENTATION: to run the courses, we will develope e-learning+knowledge management (moodle) and eportfolio (Mahara) environment, with\u00a0single-sign-on. Then at least one course per area will be created. Both will use the related SCORM packages developed in O3, and will include all the interaction with users (ie, tasks, questionnaires,...) together with the link to eportfolio, and how it will be used. Teachers will learn how to evaluate using ePortfolio.VETIVER PILOT:\u2028Once the virtual platform is available, we will run 3 pilots. The first one with teachers, and the others with students. We will pilot the whole environment. Each pilot will give information to improve the Guidelines of the project for teachers.VETIVER GUIDELINES: 3 guidelines will be developed, compiling the knowledge of the project and how to use it.\u2028There will be a core group of at least 10 expert people from project partners who will have a training for that, so that they will be able to teach the participants in their own countries.The project will hold five transnational partner meetings to discuss the progress and approve any outputs, resolve operational and financial issues. Look into possible problems and plan the work for the next period.There will also be 1 multiplier event in each country in order to disseminate and expand the results of the project.The project will also development a promotional video using seminars and events images, to be used for the exploitation phase.Dissemination of the project done by the partners will cover all levels, local, regional, national and European. And will focus on all target groups of the project.Sustainability will be achieved due to the partnership, which already has strong relations with several associations of educational institutions and work regularly with teachers and learners.We hope and believe that educational organisations will experience that the finished products will become a tool of preference which will provide longevity.", "http://www.torridgetraining.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-HU01-KA202-022952_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EX39"}
