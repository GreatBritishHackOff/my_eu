On the basis of this knowledge the association will identify, if and how its vocational education has to be supplemented and/or upgraded.   The exchange program encourages students to acquire cross cultural skills, to improve their specific English terminology and to prepare them to work with international colleagues. They will also establish first international contacts for their own artistic work. The challenge of staying abroad will further the personal development of the students and teachers involved in the project. By getting to know other approaches the participants will broaden their artistic and intellectual horizon. Teachers gain more expertise and educational competence.The mobility project will also favour the cooperation with other European secondary vocational schools of music and thus create prospective mutual educational standards. In this way European musical apprenticeship on secondary educational level can become more comparable.For each mobility action Neue Jazzschool M\u00fcnchen e.V. chooses two students of their second and third grade whose school performances justify their participation.  Because these have to catch up with the missed subjects taught during their stay abroad. In addition the head of school chooses one teacher for each mobility action who\u2019s interested in getting to know new educational methods and is willing to realize them at the Munich institute. These are the planned activities of the attending students during their stay at the partner organizations: attendance at ensemble rehearsals, attendance at practical and theoretical musical subjects, directing a choir or an ensemble in English during a lesson, preparing a gig with the school ensemble, getting to know the musical scene in the partner country by visiting concerts and jam sessions in the respective musical clubs.These are the planned activities of the teachers during their stay at the partner organizations: attending classes of their partner teachers, directing of choir and ensemble rehearsals with own arrangements and compositions, teaching the practical and theoretical subjects of the partner teacher, communication and exchange of educational matters with the teachers of the partner organization, analyzing and comparing the individual curricula.The project language will be English.

In December 2014 RCCS joined the network of 7 European secondary vocational music education schools, and it gives us the chance to use the framework of ERASMUS+ and offers our students and teachers international exchanges as well. We would run this project to solve the problems we face in RCCS - a need to improve the attitude towards learning, decrease the number of missed lessons, improve the level of spoken English and the knowledge of professional terminology in English, as well as improve the communication skills and general openness. In school year 2016/2017 we are expecting the reorganization of two schools - RCCS and Janis Rozentals Art Highschool into vocational education competence center, that also means the need for adaptation to the new situation.The objectives of the project are:* finding new international professional and personal contacts,* improving adaptation and communication skills for individual participants of the exchanges,* improving the level of spoken English and the knowledge of professional terminology,* for students - improving the general attitude towards learning,* for teachers and staff - searching for new teaching/learning methods, analyzing interdisciplinary educational programs we could develop and invent in our professional education competence center.During two school years 16 students and 8 staff members of RCCS will participate in international mobilities. Partner schools of the project are:* Rijn IJssel (The Netherlands)* Kainuu Vocational College  (Finland)* Conservatory of music and ballet Ljubljana (Slovenia)* Neue Jazzschool M\u00fcnchen e.V.  (Germany)* Lewisham Southwark College (United Kingdom)* Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 College (Finland)In the project we plan three types of activities: student, teacher and staff mobility. Student mobility includes attending music lessons, rehearsing together with partner school students in school collectives (choir, orchestra, big band, jazz combo etc.), learning new music repertoire and performing in a concert, in that way collecting training lessons. Teachers will have both - teaching and training assignments in partner schools. In the beginning they will have to watch their lessons in specialty and learn new teaching methods, later - they'll have to host lessons/workshops/seminars by themselves. Staff members will learn from the experience of Finnish colleagues about managing international longterm educational projects. Both teachers and staff will have to find out about partner school experience about interdisciplinary educational program development, so we could integrate such in our vocational education competence center.Methodology to be used in carrying out the project will include setting individual goals for the exchange period together with career consultant, actively participating in the lessons, cooperating in rehearsals and concerts, hosting lessons, workshops and/or seminars, presenting project results for other colleagues - students or teachers, school administration, expressing the ideas and the experience orally and in written form.As the result from this ERASMUS+ project we expect that the participants will obtain new professional and personal contacts, their English language  and communication skills as well as the results of State English exam will improve. The work in lesson will improve because of new integrated methods. In next school years there will be several new interdisciplinary (art and music) education programs in our vocational education competence center. One more important point would be the variety of the music repertoire including different European traditional and popular music pieces students and teachers will have been taken home from exchanges. As a result of the project all the participants will have better management skills - starting from surviving in international environment, and ending with experience in managing other international cooperation projects.In longer term we predict that Riga Cathedral Choir School and Janis Rozentals Art Highschool together will turn into creative, modern and innovative educational institute and it will become even more attractive to its potential students.
