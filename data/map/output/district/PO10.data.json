This goal requires developments by radical innovation which may then lead to \u201cdisruptive technologies\u201d. In this frame new thermal shielding and low risk return strategies are defined as European key activities in the future. In Europe the design of spacecraft for high-energetic interplanetary or sample return flights is still performed with big safety margins, which means high mass. This again leads to higher costs and a reduction in scientific payloads or instrumentation.\nAblative thermal protection materials are a key technology for current and future space exploration missions. However, the mission feasibility is determined by the materials available, and the development of new materials is performed, essentially, by an iterative trial-and-error process. This is due to the absence of validated predictive models for ablative material behaviour \u2013 models are tuned to bulk material properties from tests. For each new material, this tuning has to be redone because the models are not of sufficiently high fidelity to be able to make even small extrapolations. This means that materials cannot be designed to a specification to fulfil the needs of a particular mission. The aim of this project is to make a substantial step towards a predictive model of an ablative thermal protection system by incorporating aspects of high fidelity mesoscale ablator physics within a modular framework.\nIn order to successfully develop such physics modules, the understanding of the fundamental processes occurring within the ablative materials must be improved. To this end, existing ablative materials will be tested in the most powerful European long duration high enthalpy facilities using both standard instrumentation and advanced measurement techniques. From the data obtained, and the state-of-the-art knowledge of ablator physical processes, modules for the specific processes of internal gas flow, internal radiation and gas-surface interaction will be developed to fit inside an overall multi-scale ablator modelling scheme. The improvements made in the representation of an ablative material will be validated against the ground testing, and this advanced ablator model will be applied to realistic flight configurations to demonstrate the impact of the enhanced physics on the understanding of real ablator performance.\nThe existence of this capability will allow improvements in the efficiency and cost of developing advanced new ablative materials which are tailored to meet the specifications of Europe\u2019s future mission needs. In order to reach this objective, the ABLAMOD project brings substantial expertise from across Europe in ablator materials, thermochemistry, microfluidics, entry systems and instrumentation.", 111640.0, 2174389.0, 7, 10, "ABLAMOD", null, "http://www.fluidgravity.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/156079.jpg", "fp7_106604_973760400"], [1356998400000, 1451520000000, "INNOVATIVE THERMAL MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS FOR THERMAL PROTECTION OF FUTURE SPACE VEHICLES", "Fluid Gravity Engineering Limited", "There are key space technologies existing at European level and during the last space calls many European projects are framed on space re-entry, but none of them dealing with radically new technologies, able to compete with technologies from other leading countries or allowing collaboration with them. The THOR project will provide knowledge in key space technologies for accessing space, through the design and development of disruptive technologies based on novel thermal management concepts which are specifically targeted to atmospheric entries of future space vehicles and hypersonic transport vehicles. This project, including the participation of several SMEs and relevant end-users, aims at the collaboration among them to strengthen the European space sector and enable international cooperation.\n\nThe technical approach is focused non-local concepts for thermal management including active cooling as well as passive cooling technologies, in order to extent the capabilities of re-usable Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) towards the requirement of future space flight including hypersonic transport. To achieve this technical target radically new thermal management solutions will be implemented in a new concept of TPS together with innovative materials and unique ceramic structures, reaching a TRL 2-3 at the end of the project. The passive systems will be based on thermal equilibration establishing an efficient heat transfer from highly loaded areas to regions with less loading. New ceramic matrix composites incorporating a new generation of highly thermal conductive fibres will be applied. In addition, active cooling will be implemented by passing a fluid through a ceramic porous structure. The project includes a strong effort on design, modelling and simulation in order to fulfil the technical requirements before integrating the complete TPS.
