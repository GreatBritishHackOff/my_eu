For that, it applies a twofold strategy: 1)persuades users to increase their energy-awareness and change their e-consumption habits and 2)embeds intelligence in the devices to let them autonomously decide about their operation mode for energy efficiency purposes. For the first part, it will use a variety of techniques, from persuasive social applications to physical interaction mechanisms linked to the devices. For the second part, it will learn from the usage habits, acting only when an energy wasteful behaviour is detected or the users do not heed the devices\u2019 suggestions. The aim is to add a green-soul to devices in a pluggable manner to avoid costly replacement of equipment and the corresponding disposal of old-fashioned devices to the landfill.\n \nGreenSoul\u2019s exploitation potential is addressed towards buildings of public use. There, the persuasion of users is particularly challenging since they hardly perceive the benefits of having eco-friendly behaviour, i.e. they do not pay the electricity bill. GreenSoul will design and develop an integrated ICT platform to: a) improve users awareness of their energy consumption habits; b)study the ecological behaviour of the people in shared environments; c)analyse the effectiveness of different persuasion techniques; d)assist users through a decision-support engine\u2019s recommendations; and e)provide socio-economic evidence about the viability of the changes proposed.\n \nGreenSoul aims to prove that combined behavioural and ICT interventions over public buildings result in energy savings which surpass 20%. It will be deployed in five building pilots at different climatic areas and associated to different usage and facilities, ensuring the cross-country and cross-building analysis of the impact of GreenSoul.", 77831.0, 1622585.0, "GREENSOUL", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_200131_927373060"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9XB", "Spanish Language Project", "Tunbridge Wells Grammar School for Boys", 2621.0, "The project has been designed for a French and Spanish teacher at Tunbridge Wells Grammar School for Boys where French and Spanish remain popular subjects and many students study two languages at GCSE. Some study two languages at A-level. It is mandatory that students study at least one at GCSE level. The first objective of the project is that the participant raises the level of her Spanish skills so that she would have the capacity to teach Spanish to A-level students. The nine members of the MFL department at the school  all strive to ensure students achieve their potential and this project's second objective is to extensively contribute to raising the profile of Spanish and other languages, and to impart cultural knowledge to students. Upon completing the course, the teacher would share the experience with students: this would enable them to gain an understanding and appreciation of the benefits that learning a language both in the UK and abroad can bring. Lastly, this project aims to develop links with European teachers and share teaching practices.The activities undertaken during the course would include group classes, individual classes and cultural activities organised by the language school. Whilst carrying out the course, the teacher would form links with other European schools and share teaching practices and learning strategies through meeting teachers attending the same course. This would have long term benefits for the school and its students and increase opportunities for students to gain experiences abroad.The project would involve evaluation stages before, during and after completion of the course. Expectations of the course's outcomes would be established prior to departing and misconceptions that may arise would be addressed during the course. This teacher would expect to make progress in all levels of her Spanish, and build on skills she has acquired over the years. Self-assessment would play a key role in assessing language proficiency and progress. The language school would also assist in monitoring the participant's progress. Upon completion of the course, progress that had been made would be measured through written and speaking tests.The results of the progress that the teacher had made would be gathered using data from language tests and self evaluation forms.  In order to gain information on Spanish culture, interviews with native Spanish teachers would be recorded in the target language, which could be imparted and played to students. Interviews with teachers from other European countries would also be made in order to gain insight into other teaching and learning strategies: these would be shared with other members of the department. The impact of these results would serve to raise the attainment of French and Spanish in the MFL department, impart cultural knowledge to students and assist the department and the wider school in implementing different different teaching and learning strategies. The participant intends to share experiences and impart knowledge through discussing and sharing teaching approaches and learning strategies with her colleagues. Since links with European schools would be made, the longer term benefits of this project would be enhanced through collaborating with other European teachers in order to promote language learning and share practices. In addition to this, oppportunities to study abroad may ultimately be offered to students.", "http://www.twgsb.org.uk", "Tunbridge Wells Grammar School for Boys", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023422_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TN4"}
