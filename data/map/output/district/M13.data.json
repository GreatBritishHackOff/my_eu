That is, the standardization and harmonization of data and key measures of life-style, social circumstances and environment, as well as critical sub-components of the phenotypes associated with common complex diseases. This is the mission of BioSHaRE-EU.\nBioSHaRE-EU will work hand-in-hand with BBMRI (Biobanking and Bio-molecular Resources Research Infrastructure) and P3G (Public Population Project in Genomics), to build directly on extensive precursor work in the field of harmonisation and standardisation. The project will deliver tools to harmonize phenotypes of complex diseases, as well as lifestyle and environmental factors. In addition, it provides statistical methods and biostatistical tools for meta-analysis of large scale studies.

I aim to develop new, innovative techniques and beyond state-of-the-art methods to extract the Yukawa coupling between the top quark and the Higgs boson, which is expected to be of the order of one - much higher than that of any other quark. I will analyse the only process where the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling can be measured, in associated production of top quark pairs and a Higgs boson. The Higgs boson mainly decays into a pair of b-quarks. This is one of the most challenging channels at the LHC, as huge background processes from gluon splitting contribute.  In particular, I will develop and study color flow variables, which provide a unique, powerful technique to distinguish color singlet Higgs bosons from the main background, color octet gluons.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the project is the first measurement of the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling and its confrontation with SM and beyond SM Higgs boson models, resulting in an unprecedented insight into the fundamental laws of nature.\n\nThe LHC will soon reach a new energy frontier of 13 TeV starting in 2014.

As an elementary particle, Majorana fermion is a hyphotetical object. However in condensed matter it can be built out of what nature offers us: electron and hole excitations. Recently a number of experimental setups have been proposed to support Majorana zero modes, among which are planar superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures and superconductor-topological insulator hybrids. Despite the fact that such solid-state-devices consist of rather 'conventional' building blocks, the actual experimental observation of Majorana fermions is still the biggest challenge in the field.

However, key challenges are compliance with various ethical, legal and privacy requirements (and acceptance by the general public, patients, and medical professionals), providing a platform that works across many EHR systems and is sustainable within a scalable business model.\nA 4-year project, EHR4CR will involve a team of recognised European academic and industrial partners.  The project will build a platform to enable the use of EHR for more efficient medical research and run pilots (on interoperability, security, data quality, data storage solutions, organisational issues, accreditation and certification, etc) to demonstrate the viability and scalability of an EHR4CR business model.\nThe EHR4CR project supports the IMI strategic agenda with an information gateway solution to enhance clinical research efficiency and innovation.  A key IMI aspect is the development of a knowledge management capability that can, for example, provide information management support for other research on personalized medicines, now an IMI 2010 call topic.  EHR4CR also supports other IMI R&D projects by enabling the use (and reuse) of large amounts of health data \u2013 in an ethical and cost-effective way.", 267298.0, 13481077.0, "EHR4CR", null, null, null, null, "http://www.manchester.ac.uk", null, "fp7_203693_999903840"], ["9PL", "\"Development of a Common Sensor Platform for the Detection of IED \"\"Bomb Factories\"\"\"", "The University of Manchester", "The detection of IED manufacturing facilities is crucial for the security of citizens, as well as infrastructures and utilities.

This potential includes the ability of ENM to induce damage at the cellular, tissue, or organism levels by interacting with cellular structures leading to impairment of key cellular functions. These adverse effects may be mediated by ENM-induced alterations in gene expression and translation, but may involve also epigenetic transformation of genetic functions. We believe that it will be possible to create a set of biomarkers of ENM toxicity that are relevant in assessing and predicting the safety and toxicity of ENM across species. The ENM-organism interaction is complex and depends, not simply on the composition of ENM core, but particularly on its physico-chemical properties. In fact, important physico-chemical properties are largely governed by their surface properties. All of these factors determine the binding of different biomolecules on the surface of the ENM, the formation of a corona around the ENM core. Thus, any positive or negative biological effect of ENM in organisms may be dynamically modulated by the bio-molecule corona associated with or substituted into the ENM surface rather than the ENM on its own. The bio-molecule corona of seemingly identical ENM cores may undergo dynamic changes during their passage through different biological compartments; in other words, their biological effects are governed by this complex surface chemistry. We propose that understanding the fundamental characteristics of ENM underpinning their biological effects will provide a sound foundation with which to classify ENM according to their safety.

Nanostructured surfaces have the potential to improve efficiencies of cells by up to 25% (rel), having dramatic impact on commercial viability. Impact Area 2 focuses on biocidal surface structures. Increasing concerns about infections leading to the conclusion, that only multi-action approaches for control of infection transfer can be effective. We plan to combine such surfaces with 3D nanostructures, which will both immobilise and deactivate pathogenic organisms on surfaces.  Impact Area 3 is the direct growth of aligned carbon nanotubes on electrode surfaces. The material is under investigation for use in high load capacitors which are seen as key components for energy storage systems, e.g. for Hybrid Electric Vehicle.  Impact Area 4 focuses on tailored interfaces to achieve durable adhesion on polymer surfaces by 3D nanostructuring and coating. Target is to reduce energy consumption by introducing lightweight materials.  The N2P partners have been chosen to ensure a strong capability to exploit and disseminate the outcomes.

After sealing the chosen radionuclides, the external walls of the nanocapsules will be decorated with biomolecules to render them biocompatible and for targeting purposes. In a recent study we have recently observed that these nanocapsules allow the delivery of unprecedented radiodosage and remain stable for extended periods thus guaranteeing essentially zero leakage of the radionuclides. Surface functionalisation of these nanocapsules offers versatility towards modulation of tissue biodistribution of the radioemitting crystals in a manner determined by the nanocapsule that delivers them. The delivery of radioactivity takes place through the walls of nanocapsules (carbon) and release of the encapsulated radionuclides is therefore not needed and certainly not desired.

The system under development is based on short CNTs that are filled with radionuclides and functionalised for biocompatibility and targeting.\n\nExcellent progress has been achieved on the scientific side. Purification of CNTs and strategies for shortening them are under development and the team has now optimised the filling protocol. The radionuclides have been selected and scientists have successfully encapsulated non-radioactive (control or model) versions of them. A computer simulation will aid researchers in prediction of dosimetry, the radiation dose that is received by the cells and tissues.\n\nNumerous different surface functionalisations are being explored and tested. Sugars (carbohydrates) and antibodies are among the most important natural cell recognition entities in general. The team is currently preparing carbohydrate-based ligands for targeting. Antibodies will be explored in the coming months. Preliminary studies on cellular uptake of some prepared nanocapsules are providing important insight.\n\nSo far, progress has contributed to seven publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals and many more in various stages of preparation and review.

This radical approach recognises we are still some way away from hardware to implement it at flight scales but if successful, would establish a first important step towards our ultimate ambition.\nThe focus of MARS will be on the effects of a number of active flow control devices on the discrete dynamic components of the turbulent shear layers and the Reynolds stress.

These two hypotheses will allow the project to avoid extensive scenario studies. The economic impact will be evaluated for investment cost, associated fuel cycle and operational cost but not the needed R&D cost. A crucial parameter to be established for both reactor systems is the maximal minor actinide (MA) content in a core loading. This maximal MA value is determined by operational safety criteria to be adhered by the dedicated burner. An evaluation of a number of safety parameters for the systems will give an upper boundary for the minor actinide mass present in the core.

The vision is that domestic and small commercial consumers\u2019 electrical demand can be made flexible optimising the operation of loads, embedded generation and storage systems. The ADDRESS architecture were validated at three complementary test sites in Spain, France and Italy.\n\nWithin the ADN, aggregators are the mediator between consumers on one side and markets, distribution system operators (DSOs) and transmission system operators (TSOs) on the other. The aggregator, managing a portfolio of consumers, is able to offer active demand services, in markets or through bilateral relationships, to the other energy market players.  The project delivered an Aggregator Toolbox that was field-tested at two test sites that deal with consumers (France and Spain). The Toolbox contains modules for consumption and market forecasting, management of consumer and market portfolios, optimisation of operations related to prices, volumes and bidding. In addition, the Aggregator Toolbox facilitates paying incentives to consumers and billing of AD buyers.\n\nConsumers are also the suppliers of AD. Domestic and small commercial consumers have an energy box that manages home loads, optimising control of smart appliances to modify energy consumption and meet market demands. Distribution System Operators (DSO) play a key role, because target consumers are directly connected to the electrical distribution grid. On one side DSOs are commercial players, buying active demand services for their own purposes, as for voltage regulation and power flow control. On the other side they are technical players, ensuring the secure operation of the grid in presence of active demand. \n\nResults coming from the field tests point to several general conclusions. The trade of AD products has the potential to reduce energy costs and emissions while improving market and system performance through reduced price volatility and greater energy quality and security. By reducing congestion and adapting better to network capacity, AD can also reduce network losses. \n\nADDRESS has built a strong basis for the adoption of AD and interactive energy networks in Europe with important benefits for consumers, system operators and the environment.", null, "http://www.manchester.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140725221.jpg", "fp7_100636_999903840"], ["9PL", "Integrated numerical modelling of laser additive processes", "The University of Manchester", "The processes of laser cladding, deposition and surface alloying are increasingly used in modern manufacturing as surface enhancement, rapid manufacturing, tooling and repair processes.

The main objective was to promote therapeutic strategies for the treatment of leukodystrophies.\n\nThe consortium generated a European database with the clinical data, mutations and biological samples of more than 500 patients. They validated biomarkers found in patients' biological fluids such as the peptide neurotransmitters N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) for leukodystrophies with inborn error of myelin formation.\n\nAdditionally, they investigated the role of oxidative stress in axonal degeneration to screen for new biomarkers. Patient fibroblasts exhibited an impaired mitochondrial metabolism. Without anti-oxidant compounds, this would result in oxidative damage. This finding alongside other results clearly indicated that oxidative stress constitutes a major causative disease-driving factor in leukodystrophies.\n\nA compound screen led to the identification of anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, or neuroprotective compounds for ameliorating disease symptoms. This was exemplified by a cholesterol derivative which induced a delay in the appearance of some behavioural symptoms in young mice.\n\nEnzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has limited efficacy in treating leukodystrophies due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB limits the delivery of arylsulfatase A (ARSA) from the blood to the brain parenchyma. To overcome this problem, the consortium explored the use of implantable minipumps to deliver ARSA directly to the brain.\n\nResearchers explored further therapeutic avenues in the form of innovative cell and gene therapy approaches. Clinical trials were initiated using haematopoietic stem cells transduced with viral vectors for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and presymptomatic metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). Results showed that expression of the mutated protein in nearly 10% of their circulating haematopoietic cells was restored. Moreover, this approach successfully arrested the progression of cerebral demyelinating lesions.\n\nIn symptomatic forms of MLD, gene therapy with direct brain injection of the viral vector has been successfully tested in animal models.

The last two decades have seen the emergence of a more straightforward alternative: the direct functionalisation of C-H bonds. Through this strategy the typically inert C-H bonds, ubiquitous in organic molecules, can be activated by transition metal catalysts and subsequently functionalised. This approach has allowed us to dream of a future where any organic molecule could be synthesised in a direct manner by simply replacing the C-H bonds of a substrate with the required functionalities, as if building a ball-and-stick molecular model with our hands.

Indeed, countless possible cation-anion combinations create billions of possible ILs, which calls for a rapid and reliable toxicity prediction. This can only be achieved through computation. Quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR) solve the problem created by the current stringent environmental regulations and the impossibility of costly and time consuming experimental determination. This is why the EU-implemented REACH regulation recommends valid QSPRs for predicting ecotoxicity when experimental data are not available. In the present project, ecotoxicological models for ILs will be developed in silico, obeying OECD principles, based on available toxicity data against various endpoints.  Considering the ever growing interest in ILs, truly predictive QSPR models will be highly advantageous in designing desired ILs.

All solutions require some form of separation and purification, which is currently accomplished through primarily energy-intensive processes such as absorption, cryogenic separation and distillation.\n\nPolymer membranes are considered one of the most energy-efficient methods for separating gases.

Addition of nanofillers such as carbon nanotubes, zeolites, mesoporous oxides and metal-organic frameworks allowed increasing the polymer-free volume and creating preferential channels for mass transport.\n\nOther than developing high volume polymers such as polynorbornenes, scientists also produced polymers of intrinsic microporosity.

Thermoacoustic energy conversion is a generic cross-cutting energy technology that can be applied in a vast number of applications, requiring heating, cooling, or power both in industry and build environment. Thermoacoustic is concerned with the thermodynamic conversion between heat and intense sound in the presence of a solid boundary. The working principles of thermoacoustic systems are quite complex. However, the practical implementations of these are relatively simple. This offers great advantages with respect to the economic feasibility of this technology. The systems lack moving parts, use environmentally friendly working media, and only ordinary materials.   The development of thermoacoustic systems will lead to energy and cost savings and economically attractive renewable energy options. The attractive feature of thermoacoustic technology is that all the different applications can be developed based on the same technological principles. This means that the components of such systems can be made in large quantities at low cost.   This project will be dedicated to the exploration and the study of different conversion processes involved in the thermoacoustic systems and the potential they have for energy applications.

It can be used in a variety of applications that require heating, cooling or power in industrial and residential settings.\n\nAlthough the principles are complex, the practical implementation is relatively simple. A thermoacoustic system typically consists of an engine and a heat pump enclosed in a resonator. The engine produces acoustic power from heat. The heat pump then uses that power to pump heat. No moving parts are required and environmentally friendly materials are used.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Thermoacoustic technology for energy applications' (Thatea) project is evaluating thermoacoustic conversion processes to identify the most promising systems.

Scientists also tested the concept of a mechanical resonator that employs a two mass-spring system to replace the acoustic one. Alignment of the cylinder in the piston was found to be a critical parameter and a topic for further study.\n\nTheoretical and experimental investigation of non-linear effects that degrade the performance of thermoacoustic systems (e.g. streaming) were carried out and this led to enhancements in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of oscillatory flow.

Many diseases are caused by proteins aberrations, and proteins are frequent targets of intervention. Mapping all proteins and their functions are expected to yield pervasive medical and biotechnological benefits. However, even the most comprehensive and high-throughput proteins discovery technologies are seriously challenged by the extreme diversity and low abundance of many proteome components; a problem, compounded by the lack of affinity reagents and validated probes for sample preparation and identification. Our concept is that shorter protein fragments, or peptides, may offer solutions to many of these problems as peptides may represent or mimic proteins. Using in situ solid-phase peptide synthesis, computerized photolithography and novel photochemistry, we have recently generated peptide microarrays of up to 2 million addressable peptides. This unprecedented high-density and high-content peptide microarray technology could make inroads into the kind of high-throughput analysis needed to address the entire human proteome. Here, we aim to exploit this potential by using and improving three different, yet complementary, label-free detection technologies allowing sensitive, high-resolution determinations of the identity, quality and/or modification of individual members of a peptide microarray, and real-time monitoring of any interacting molecular receptor. We will also develop peptides as rapid, specific, and renewable affinity reagents for complex sample preparation, and develop peptides as probes and complex biosensors.

The project team defines impact as 'a clearly attributable difference over time', and the team is looking for both intended objectives and unintended impact of the ERC funding schemes. In light of this, the project and involved research are being structured around three framework issues: how to measure impact, how to attribute impact and how to assess impact.\n\nMeasuring impact is challenging in science. It must draw on theories and concepts from the sociology of science and political science among other disciplines.

The lateral dimensions of NS can be tailored on tuning the metal salt concentration, while suitable counter anions of LDH can alter the NS thickness. NS will be released from template by mild sonication. Free standing NS will be analyzed by transmission electron and atomic force microscopy. Besides, the NS will be characterized using various other high end characterization tools to get a deeper understanding of structural and atomic arrangement in NS. Possibly, the size reduction to a monolayer or a few layer thickness would give rise to many interesting properties. Among the various anticipated properties, the foremost one would be finding a new crystal structure. The reduction of the thickness of NS reduces the local coordination number to as lower as two which would enhance the catalytic activity for the reduction of environmental toxic gases such as CO2 to a fuel.

Precisely, the applicant will collaborate with Prof. Gray who is an expert in the field of grain-size segregation of dry granular flows to develop a mathematical model. Analogous to the way in which large grains are segregated to the surface and preferentially transported to flow fronts by velocity shear, the core of this model is to derive a transport equation for the dry layer that forms at the surface of a debris flow, as the granular mixture undergoes shear-induced dilation and the liquid is sucked into the expanded pore space between the grains. This surface dry layer, together with large grains, which also rise to the top of the flow, are then sheared towards the flow forwards to create a highly resistive large rich dry front and shouldered aside to form coarse-grain-enriched levees.

The facilities cover a variety of experimental and in silico operations and disciplines, and together represent the R&D continuum in the range TRL2 to 6 needed to build quality biomanufacturing processes for industrialization. In addition to hardware, IBISBA 1.0 will operate an ICT platform, linking all project events occurring on facilities, and external data repositories, and provide users with end-to-end project management and access to a wide variety of research assets. Together, these developments create the basis for a future pan-European research infrastructure for industrial biotechnology, the feasibility of which will be established during the project. Through IBISBA 1.0, the participant facilities will be opened for transnational access, thus providing cutting edge technologies to a cross section of Europe\u2019s researchers, including early career stage scientists. Users and facility operators will receive remote and on-site training, and immersion in the hallmark multidisciplinary environment of IBISBA 1.0. Transnational access will be facilitated by an ambition outreach plan that will provide users, including SMEs and other industry players, with complete information about service offers, but also insight into the potentiality of IPR held by IBISBA 1.0 partners and the opportunities for innovation. Interoperability will be a focus of considerable attention, with actions directed towards harmonization and the implementation of repeatable working practices that integrate experimentation with data analysis, and data management, thus providing the basis for the sharing and reuse of data assets in a framework of Open Science.", 428208.0, 4360660.0, "IBISBA 1.0", null, null, null, null, "http://www.manchester.ac.uk", null, "h2020_212584_999903840"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9PL", "European Art-Science-Technology Network for Digital Creativity", "THE UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER", 1199224.0, "EASTN-DC, European Art-Science-Technology Network for Digital Creativity, is a network dedicated to the time-based digital arts: musical arts, visual arts, performing and interactive arts. In this field, the democratization of digital tools has provoked a spouting of new contents, ideas and commitments, premises of ongoing profound changes that rattle the practices along with the actors and the public.In the meantime, a lack of synergy between the different functions carrying the digital mutation (research, creation, pedagogy, diffusion and valorisation) led to some deadlocks. The latters range from disciplinary imperviousness to inadequate relations between researchers, artists, educators and mediators, or from the very form of the new art pieces, the matter of their presentation to the public, to pedagogical concerns regarding the teaching of digital tools and their concepts.In that frame, and by this fact, EASTN-DC actions aim at:- Experimenting this synergy between research, creation, pedagogy, diffusion and valorisation at the European level- Proposing new models for cooperation and digital contents production connecting Art, Science and Technology.- Establishing a sustainable base for a large European network in the field of time-based digital arts.To do so, EASTN-DC is gathering 17 partners in 13 different countries from Europe to the Americas.
