Participants will be youth workers/trainers, many of whom are parents themselves, who will bridge support between this triangle and are committed to the local delivery as follow-up.  \r\n \r\nPersonal experience of a group of European-level trainers at the Bridges for Trainers event in November 2016 gave a shared frustration on the gap between formal and non-formal educational approaches in their own community, and a passion to use their expertise from international youth work methodologies to bridge that divide.\r\n\r\nThe aim of supporting a more positive interaction between schools, needs of young people and the community through the values of youth work shall be achieved through:\r\n\r\n1. Exchange \u2013 compare existing experience of linking schools, young people and the wider community through non-formal education approaches in different contexts. (WHAT DO YOU DO?)\r\n\r\n2. Explore \u2013 visit a range of educational contexts in Vienna that approach the triangle of schools/young people/community with different balances, to provide reflection and transferability back to communities across Europe (HOW DO THEY DO IT DIFFERENTLY HERE THAT I CAN LEARN FROM?)\r\n\r\n3. Empower \u2013 to further develop the competences and engagement of the youth worker/trainer participants by raising awareness of the values for which they work, and underlining the power of the multiplier effect of this, thereby increasing recognition and impact of their work on a local, regional, national and international level. (BECOMING BETTER NFE TRAINERS/YOUTH WORKERS)\r\n\r\n4. Impact \u2013 to reflect and create action plans that will use non-formal education as a multiplier effect on return home from the Study Visit in communities across Europe (MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN MY OWN COMMUNITY)\r\n\r\nThe Short Study Visit is the mobility part of this project: it will be 4 full programme days and will take place in Vienna. The activity brings together 10 countries, 25 participants and a Core Team of 3 experienced Trainers. Participants will be NFE experts, many of whom have strong level of expertise at international level. Using non-formal quality methodology, the focus will be learner-centred and experiential, to share practice, experience and expertise, in order that each participant returns home to implement on a local/regional level. Specific emphasis will be placed on reflection of observations and transfer of knowledge to own practice. There will be visits to different educational institutions in Vienna, to showcase a variety of models where NFE is used, as well as invited inputs from experts in the field.  The themes of Exchange, Explore and Empower will be reflected in each of the intensive working days, culminating in personal learning and development of competences, as well as concrete Action Plans to take forwards with local partners on return.\r\n\r\nProposed outputs include: increased recognition of NFE and its methodology, on a local, regional and international level; local action plans for each partner attending, with consideration of SMART objectives, to be delivered on return back home; definite figures of impact on a local level have been agreed by all partners; future strategic partnerships to embed the linking over a longer time frame and support research into this area which could be published; development of the systems that connect community to education institutions to be transferred to other communities in areas of need, especially related to the cross-sectoral approach for young people at risk of dropping out of the system and/or radicalisation.\r\n\r\nResults, inspirations and outcomes from this project will be disseminated to local/regional/national networks, social media sites and newsletters of the various organisations, reaching more than 15,000 readers in the different countries.\r\n\r\nThe longer-term benefits of this project include non-formal education providing the cohesion in strengthening relationships between the teachers/young people/community representatives which will become more inter-dependent.\r\n\r\nIncreasing recognition for the power of Non-Formal Education and linking the local and regional approach to the international, through Erasmus+, will bring inspiration and momentum to make a positive change in strengthening cross sector working in Education for the benefit of future generations.", "http://www.ukambassadors.org", null, "erasmus_2017-2-AT02-KA105-001906_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WF16"}
