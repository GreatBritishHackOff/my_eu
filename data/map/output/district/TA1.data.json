FODIAC will enhance the quality of R&I in Europe, promoting cooperation along the Food Value Chain. This is achieved through advanced international, intersectoral, cooperation between 7 academic and 8 industry partners. For this purpose, FODIAC assembles a European multi/interdisciplinary consortium, composed of partners in 5 countries that provide expertise in: extraction and purification of bioactive molecules, nanotechnology, nano/micro-encapsulation, toxicology, nutrition, biomarkers, clinical trial management. \nRationale: lack of knowledge sharing among academia and industry  acts as a barrier for the development of functional foods for the elderly, who represent one of the fastest-growing population segments worldwide. \nApproach and Outcomes: FODIAC coordinates the actions of individual partners, academic and industrial, using Exchange of Staff as a tool to capitalize on complementary competences to: i) conduct joint research; ii) protect the Intellectual Property based on this research; iii) foster the transference of the generated knowledge, skills, and technology to the industrial sector; and iv) exploit research output to the benefit of society. FODIAC\u2019s outcomes will include: i) an increase in the R&I capacity among participating partners; ii) boosting of knowledge transfer of emerging micro/nano-biotechnologies from academia to industry, to develop cost-effective processes; iii) commercialization of new functional ingredients and functional foods containing antidiabetic and cognitive-enhancing bioactive molecules; iv) acceleration of the development of dietary recommendations and interventions based on those products, to improve the quality of life of the elderly; iv) a sustainable research network of academic and industrial partners and v) the leveraging of career perspectives of individual researchers, both in and outside academic institution", 7839.0, 376275.0, "FODIAC", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_214785_913079722"], ["2UH", "Upgrade Speed To Accelerate Revolutionary Telecoms", "Fast2fibre(holdings)limited", "The replacement of aging copper wire telephone legacy, internet infrastructures requires substantial investment and civil engineering works, such as the digging-up of roads to lay down high-speed broadband, account for up to 80% of the cost of deploying high-speed networks.
