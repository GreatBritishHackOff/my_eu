Existing measures to manage pressures have proven inadequate and the EC has responded by proposing a new policy (Maritime Strategy Blue Book) and environmental legislation (Marine Strategy Directive), both currently close to adoption. These instruments rely on the Ecosystem Approach, a management paradigm that encompasses humans and the supporting ecosystem. But the science base for this approach needs strengthening and practical tools must be developed and tested for policy implementation. In particular, criteria for assessing costs and benefits of management actions are poorly developed, particularly in the complex marine environment where multiple uses and management conflicts are common. The KnowSeas consortium will strengthen the science base for managing Europe\u2019s seas through the practical application of systems thinking. It will work at the two scales envisaged for emergent EU policy: the Regional Sea Scale and Member State Economic Exclusive Zones (EEZs). We have developed a new approach of Decision Space Analysis to investigate mismatches of scale. Knowledge created through the FP6 European Lifestyles and Marine Ecosystems project, augmented with necessary new studies of climate effects, fisheries and maritime industries - in EEZ case studies - will provide a basis for assessing changes to natural systems and their human causes. New research will examine and model economic and social impacts of changes to ecosystem goods and services and costs and benefits of various management options available through existing and proposed policy instruments.

Such infrastructures also constitute attractive terrorist targets due to their accessibility and great potential impact on human lives and economic activity. Attacks may cause considerable damage, including structural damage or demolition, substantial human casualties, socio-economic losses (unemployment, relocation of firms, reconstruction costs) and socio-political damage (public uncertainty, confidence loss) and even environmental consequences, each being accompanied by the related costs.

Researchers in the 'Security of road transport networks' (SERON) project are keen to help authorities identify the risks and take appropriate steps to protect the road system in the event of an attack.\n\nSERON researchers studied the possible impacts of human attacks on the transport network, in particular the effects on regional and supra-regional transport links.

It also provides guidance for putting in place counter measures and risk-mitigation strategies.\n\nA threat and hazard analysis revealed that threats based on fires and explosions are the most relevant to road networks. Through surveys and interviews, the team also identified and categorised critical infrastructure objects such as bridges and tunnels.\n\nBased on the types and classes of infrastructures defined, a risk assessment tool was developed which takes into account various assessment parameters and risks at object level.\n\nThe team also set up a knowledge repository to manage the data gathered on different infrastructure objects. This database has proved useful for handling data collected in the wider context of the SERON project and relevant findings from other research projects.\n\nSeveral test regions were defined to analyse individual objects (bridges, tunnels). National bodies in Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom were called on for input. This helped SERON develop risk assessment methodology for the relevant infrastructures based on defined scenarios.\n\nThanks to SERON project activities, the partners were able to identify those elements of the road network most in need of protection measures.
