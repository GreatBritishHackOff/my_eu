Existing measures to manage pressures have proven inadequate and the EC has responded by proposing a new policy (Maritime Strategy Blue Book) and environmental legislation (Marine Strategy Directive), both currently close to adoption. These instruments rely on the Ecosystem Approach, a management paradigm that encompasses humans and the supporting ecosystem. But the science base for this approach needs strengthening and practical tools must be developed and tested for policy implementation. In particular, criteria for assessing costs and benefits of management actions are poorly developed, particularly in the complex marine environment where multiple uses and management conflicts are common. The KnowSeas consortium will strengthen the science base for managing Europe\u2019s seas through the practical application of systems thinking. It will work at the two scales envisaged for emergent EU policy: the Regional Sea Scale and Member State Economic Exclusive Zones (EEZs). We have developed a new approach of Decision Space Analysis to investigate mismatches of scale. Knowledge created through the FP6 European Lifestyles and Marine Ecosystems project, augmented with necessary new studies of climate effects, fisheries and maritime industries - in EEZ case studies - will provide a basis for assessing changes to natural systems and their human causes. New research will examine and model economic and social impacts of changes to ecosystem goods and services and costs and benefits of various management options available through existing and proposed policy instruments. Institutional and social analysis will determine conflicts of interest and examine governance as well as stakeholder values and perceptions.

A major task of highway owners and operators is to ensure a high availability of all important links. Even smaller disruptions due to traffic restrictions or failure of road network elements lead to severe traffic interferences resulting in high economic follow-up costs and negative environmental impacts. Such infrastructures also constitute attractive terrorist targets due to their accessibility and great potential impact on human lives and economic activity. Attacks may cause considerable damage, including structural damage or demolition, substantial human casualties, socio-economic losses (unemployment, relocation of firms, reconstruction costs) and socio-political damage (public uncertainty, confidence loss) and even environmental consequences, each being accompanied by the related costs. Particularly bridges and tunnels, key elements of the road network, are highly vulnerable to terrorist attacks due to their bottleneck function. The SeRoN project will undertake a holistic approach both at individual infrastructure object and at road network level. Its main objectives are to investigate the impacts of possible terrorist attacks on the transport network, in particular the resulting regional and supra-regional impacts on transport links and their economic impacts. SeRoN will focus on the development of a methodology which is to help owners and operators to analyse critical road transport networks or parts hereof with regard to possible terrorist attacks. It will evaluate planned protection measures for critical road transport infrastructures concerning their impact on security and cost-effectiveness.

Researchers in the 'Security of road transport networks' (SERON) project are keen to help authorities identify the risks and take appropriate steps to protect the road system in the event of an attack.\n\nSERON researchers studied the possible impacts of human attacks on the transport network, in particular the effects on regional and supra-regional transport links. From a detailed investigation using SERON's innovative hazard analysis and simulation methods, a set of recommendations was drafted.\n\nThe recommendations cover macroeconomic, institutional, organisational and technical considerations. This work supports public and private infrastructure owners and operators developing short-term and long-term strategies to improve the security of transport structures. It also provides guidance for putting in place counter measures and risk-mitigation strategies.\n\nA threat and hazard analysis revealed that threats based on fires and explosions are the most relevant to road networks. Through surveys and interviews, the team also identified and categorised critical infrastructure objects such as bridges and tunnels.\n\nBased on the types and classes of infrastructures defined, a risk assessment tool was developed which takes into account various assessment parameters and risks at object level.\n\nThe team also set up a knowledge repository to manage the data gathered on different infrastructure objects. This database has proved useful for handling data collected in the wider context of the SERON project and relevant findings from other research projects.\n\nSeveral test regions were defined to analyse individual objects (bridges, tunnels). National bodies in Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom were called on for input. This helped SERON develop risk assessment methodology for the relevant infrastructures based on defined scenarios.\n\nThanks to SERON project activities, the partners were able to identify those elements of the road network most in need of protection measures. They also determined appropriate and cost-effective responses that make optimum use of available finances.\n\nThe findings are also relevant to networks used by other traffic modes (e.g. railway links) and possibly in response to natural disasters.", "http://www.seron-project.eu/", "http://www.pbworld.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2013-01/53476.jpg", "fp7_92516_998006326"], ["6XD", "The FUture of FUlly integrated human exposure assessment of chemicals: Ensuring the long-term viability and technology transfer of the EU-FUNded 2-FUN tools as standardised solution", "Enviresearch Ltd", "The assessment of risks to human health from chemicals is of major concern for policy and industry and ultimately benefits all citizens.

The objective of the 4FUN project is to further improve and standardise the 2-FUN tool and guarantee its long term technical and economic viability.\nStakeholder requirements will be identified and an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of existing exposure assessment tools (including 2-FUN) will be conducted. The 2-FUN tool will be subject to a rigorous standardisation which includes verification, benchmarking, documentation and demonstration. To demonstrate the reliability of modelling estimations and the feasibility of building complex realistic scenarios, case studies based on actual datasets will be performed. Improved and standardised 2-FUN software will be delivered, together with supporting documentation and training courses. Finally, based on detailed market research a sustainable business model will be developed.\nImproved exposure assessment due to the project will\n(a) reinforce competitiveness by avoiding overregulation;\n(b) prevent excessive adverse human health effects due to underregulation;\n(c) contribute to the promotion of sustainable products/technologies;\n(d) lead to homogeneous integration of exposure health concerns across the policy spectrum at the Community level.", 59196.0, 2609542.0, "4FUN", "Modelling environmental and human health chemical exposure", "Advanced modelling software has been developed for the assessment of environmental and human exposure to chemicals.

With growing scientific insight on exposure pathways and how chemical substances affect humans, new tools are required to address increasingly complex exposure scenarios and to aid regulatory decision making.\n\nIn Human Health risk assessment exposure assessment is often the weakest point for the following reasons: a lack of integrated approaches for combined stressors (mixtures), widespread use of over-conservative \u2018worst-case\u2019 scenarios, an estimation of external exposures and not of internal exposures, and a lack of uncertainty/sensitivity tools for identification of key exposure drivers.\n\nIn response, advanced modelling software, called MERLIN-Expo, is now being developed under the 4FUN project. This software has numerous features, including the integration of multimedia and PBPK models - crucial considering the future development of \u2018Equivalent Biomonitoring Reference Doses\u2019 and the coverage of the total exposure assessment chain and estimates of internal exposures for different human populations. Another feature is that exposure through multiple pathways for multiple chemicals is able to give estimates for combined exposures. There is also the functionality for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis \u2013 an essential element in-line with risk assessment guidelines published by the WHO.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.4funproject.eu/ (4FUN) project builds on the previously developed  modelling software 2FUN to model and simulate human and environmental exposure to harmful chemicals.\n\nWhile 2FUN was a prototype tool containing various models for exposure assessment, 4FUN developers are testing, improving and standardising the software for market release. They aim to demonstrate the reliability of the modelling estimations, and the feasibility of building complex realistic scenarios using case studies based on actual datasets.\n\nThe 4FUN project will develop a business model to bring the software to market, and will provide support through training to ensure long-term technical and economic viability.\n\nUltimately, MERLIN-Expo software will benefit regulators and industries as well as researchers interested in the environmental or health impacts of chemicals.", "http://www.4funproject.eu/", "http://www.enviresearch.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/153493.jpg", "fp7_105614_959176353"], ["7YB", "Global Entrepreneurial Talent Management 3", "Eliesha Training Limited", "GETM3 \u2013 Global Entrepreneurial Talent Management 3  - focuses on young talent as a key driver of future development, developed through co-operation of 3 stakeholders: employers (inc MNC & SME\u2019s), universities and students/graduates. Despite a widely recognized importance of young talent (e.g. Europe 2020), its potential remains largely untapped.  They are educated and entrepreneurial and yet experience instability in employment. At the same time, employers report skills mismatch and difficulties with attracting, managing and retaining young talent. To tackle this paradoxical situation, an innovative, multi-perspective approach is needed, reinforced by our 15 partner consortium; comprising of a transnational, inter-disciplinary, inter-generational, gender balanced and inter-sectorial research team. \nThe main objective of GETM3 is to improve employability and future global talent management to support economic development by capitalizing on entrepreneurialism as a key characteristic of the young. To achieve this objective, the project is divided into six work packages. Three WPs focus on in-depth research of specific issues from each of the stakeholder perspectives. The Integration and Innovation WP, essential for impact, aims to integrate research outputs and develop GETM3 across dimensions: generations, genders, disciplines, countries, sectors and stakeholders. These are supported by a project management & administration WP and by the Researcher development, knowledge transfer & dissemination WP. In total, 292 mobility months are planned, 232 of those are for EU partners. Matched funding specially dedicated to H2020 will be claimed from the Korean Research Foundation.
