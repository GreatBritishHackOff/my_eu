Ligand-stabilised inorganic nanocrystals (~2-30 nm core diameters) and functional organic molecules are attractive building blocks due to their size dependent opto-electronic properties, the availability of low-cost synthesis processes and the potential for formation of ordered structures via (bio) molecular recognition and self-assembly. Harnessing the complementary properties of both nanocrystals and functional molecules thus represents a unique opportunity for generation of new knowledge and development of new classes of high knowledge-content materials with specific functionality tailored for key applications, e.g., printable electronics, biosensing or energy conversion in the medium term, and radically new information and signal processing paradigms in the long term. Self-assembly and self-organisation processes offer the potential to achieve dimensional control of novel multifunctional materials at length scales not accessible to conventional \u201ctop-down\u201d technologies based on lithography. It is critical for European industry to develop new knowledge and low-cost, scaleable processes for assembly and electrical interfacing of these multifunctional materials with conventional contact electrodes in order to produce into tailored devices and products, in particular on low-cost substrates. The FUNMOL consortium will deliver substantial innovation to European industry via development of cost-effective, scaleable processes for directed assembly of high-knowledge content nanocrystal-molecule materials into electrically-interfaced devices at silicon oxide, glass and plastic substrates.", 27018.0, 4341847.0, "FUNMOL", "Nano-crystal research to revolutionise electronics", "EU-funded researchers are exploring the potential for nano-crystal molecules to be employed in European industries such as healthcare, printable electronics and security.", "Recent developments in the design and synthesis of nano-scale building blocks as active elements in opto- or bio-electronic devices with tailored electronic functionality have huge potential.

It is a simple and practical approach to multi-professional structured feedback and debriefing, to be used after unplanned learning events in clinical environments. \nDebriefing is the process of an individual or team formally reflecting on their performance after a particular task, a shift or a critical event (World Health Organisation 2009). TALK proposes an easy way to guide a constructive conversation between team members whenever new insights might be learnt from clinical experience. This includes cases or sessions in which things went well but also near misses and untoward events. Patient safety is far too often threatened by unidentified system flaws, poor practices, weaknesses in team communication and lack of appropriate action after critical events. The relevance of a culture of safety and communication is emphasized by WHO advocating debriefing in its Human Factors review, 2009.\nThis RISE project will consist of three phases; firstly secondees will contribute to parallel implementation processes in specified units across the 3 participating countries and will undertake research to better understand the benefits of structured debriefing, communication and organisational culture. Secondly, using the data generated from the research study, further training materials will be developed and translated to support the wider deployment of the TALK tool.

Modern world is offering endless possibilities for self-actualisation. Opportunities for education, mobility, social capacity building and intercultural experiences are better than ever.  Paradoxically, European countries are also facing equally big problems - demographic ageing, unemployment, migration and immigration, poverty, xenophobia, fight against poverty and factors of social exclusion in general. A major issue concerning youth is the high rate of youth unemployment, although there are various European level initiatives to tackle the issue (i.e Youth on the move, Agenda for new skills and jobs, etc), there is still a lack of competent people, who are capable of informing and developing youngsters about the necessary skills to find a job.\r\n \r\n7-days training program Gaming for Surviving: Sills for the Future will take place between 6th and 12th of November 2014 and is designed for youth workers to learn about future skills needed at the work market to decrease the rate of youth unemployment. The course is based on gamification methodology, where the participants will experience the future skills through tailor made games. Later on gamification is easily adapted to the participants own need to use in their everyday work with young people. Main goal of the training course is to raise the competences of youth workers who can develop the skills of youngsters to help them enter the labor market.\r\n \r\nLearning objectives:\r\n-   to gain more knowledge about youth unemployment\r\n-   to gain more knowledge about  future skills and key competencies \r\n-   to promote good exchanges between youth workers about helping to develop the skills of young job seekers\r\n-   to get the theoretical knowledge on how to use games and gamification and how to put it into practise\r\n-   to raise the quality of youth work\r\n\r\nParticipants:\r\nProject will gather 24 participants and 3 trainers from 8 countries.\r\nTarget group: youth workers, social workers, teachers, trainers, group leaders and whoever works with young people and is interested in the topic of youth unemployment, developing basic skills of young people  or is working with the target group of unemployed youth.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nIncreased knowledge about needed competencies at the labor market not just now but also in the future.
