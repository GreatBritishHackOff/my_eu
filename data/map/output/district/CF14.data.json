Ligand-stabilised inorganic nanocrystals (~2-30 nm core diameters) and functional organic molecules are attractive building blocks due to their size dependent opto-electronic properties, the availability of low-cost synthesis processes and the potential for formation of ordered structures via (bio) molecular recognition and self-assembly. Harnessing the complementary properties of both nanocrystals and functional molecules thus represents a unique opportunity for generation of new knowledge and development of new classes of high knowledge-content materials with specific functionality tailored for key applications, e.g., printable electronics, biosensing or energy conversion in the medium term, and radically new information and signal processing paradigms in the long term. Self-assembly and self-organisation processes offer the potential to achieve dimensional control of novel multifunctional materials at length scales not accessible to conventional \u201ctop-down\u201d technologies based on lithography. It is critical for European industry to develop new knowledge and low-cost, scaleable processes for assembly and electrical interfacing of these multifunctional materials with conventional contact electrodes in order to produce into tailored devices and products, in particular on low-cost substrates. The FUNMOL consortium will deliver substantial innovation to European industry via development of cost-effective, scaleable processes for directed assembly of high-knowledge content nanocrystal-molecule materials into electrically-interfaced devices at silicon oxide, glass and plastic substrates.", 27018.0, 4341847.0, "FUNMOL", "Nano-crystal research to revolutionise electronics", "EU-funded researchers are exploring the potential for nano-crystal molecules to be employed in European industries such as healthcare, printable electronics and security.", "Recent developments in the design and synthesis of nano-scale building blocks as active elements in opto- or bio-electronic devices with tailored electronic functionality have huge potential. Indeed, scientists believe they could revolutionise multi-billion-dollar markets across many technology sectors, including healthcare, printable electronics and security.\n\nLigand-stabilised inorganic nano-crystals and functional organic molecules are attractive building blocks because of their size-dependent opto-electronic properties, the availability of low-cost synthesis processes, and the potential to form ordered structures via (bio)-molecular recognition and self-assembly.

They claim this is a unique opportunity to generate new knowledge and develop new classes of high-knowledge-content materials that have been tailored specifically for key applications, such as printable electronics, bio-sensing or energy conversion.\n\nDuring the first 18 months of the 'Multi-scale formation of functional nano-crystal molecule assemblies and architectures' (Funmol) project, researchers designed, synthesised and characterised a number of novel linker molecular systems with novel (opto)-electrical functionalities in isolation and within nano-crystal-based assemblies.

It is a simple and practical approach to multi-professional structured feedback and debriefing, to be used after unplanned learning events in clinical environments. \nDebriefing is the process of an individual or team formally reflecting on their performance after a particular task, a shift or a critical event (World Health Organisation 2009). TALK proposes an easy way to guide a constructive conversation between team members whenever new insights might be learnt from clinical experience. This includes cases or sessions in which things went well but also near misses and untoward events. Patient safety is far too often threatened by unidentified system flaws, poor practices, weaknesses in team communication and lack of appropriate action after critical events. The relevance of a culture of safety and communication is emphasized by WHO advocating debriefing in its Human Factors review, 2009.\nThis RISE project will consist of three phases; firstly secondees will contribute to parallel implementation processes in specified units across the 3 participating countries and will undertake research to better understand the benefits of structured debriefing, communication and organisational culture. Secondly, using the data generated from the research study, further training materials will be developed and translated to support the wider deployment of the TALK tool. Thirdly, the TALK tool will be widely disseminated as a structured debriefing tool and implemented across and beyond all participating partners and its impact will be assessed.", 82732.0, 240318.0, "TALK", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_207459_919121367"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["5GG", "LEARNING DISABILITY WALES - ANABLEDD DYSGU CYMRU LBG*", 530.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_19717", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "CF14"}
