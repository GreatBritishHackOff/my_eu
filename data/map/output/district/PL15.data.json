In particular, the project will stimulate collaboration in research activities leading towards innovative, cost efficient and environmentally benign offshore RE conversion platforms for wind, wave and other ocean energy resources, for their combined use as well as for the complementary use such as aquaculture and monitoring of the sea environment. The use of the offshore resources for RE generation is a relatively new field of interest. ORECCA will overcome the knowledge fragmentation existing in Europe and stimulate the key experts to provide useful inputs to industries, research organizations and policy makers (stakeholders) on the necessary next steps to foster the development of the ocean energy sector in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way. A focus will be given to respect the strategies developed towards an integrated European maritime policy. The project will define the technological state of the art, describe the existing economical and legislative framework and identify barriers, constraints and needs within. ORECCA will enable collaboration of the stakeholders and will define the framework for future exploitation of offshore RE sources by defining 2 approaches: pilot testing of technologies at an initial stage and large scale deployment of offshore RE farms at a mature stage. ORECCA will finally develop a vision including different technical options for deployment of offshore energy conversion platforms for different target areas in the European seas and deliver integrated roadmaps for the stakeholders. These will define the strategic investment opportunities, the R&amp;D priorities and the regulatory and socio-economics aspects that need to be addressed in the short to the medium term to achieve a vision and a strategy for a European policy towards the development of the offshore RE sector", 24958.0, 1549794.0, "ORECCA", "A roadmap for sustainable ocean energy", "An EU-funded project has drawn up a roadmap for offshore renewable energy using knowledge from around the world. The roadmap will lead the EU towards innovative, economical and environmentally friendly policies for wind, wave and other ocean energies.", "Multinational companies, research institutions, consultancies, utilities and project developers were all part of the ?Off-shore renewable energy conversion platforms ? Coordination Action? (Orecca) consortium. The team established the state of available technologies, reduced fragmentation in the industry, and identified priorities for offshore wind, wave, and tidal stream energies. They also devised ways of integrating these energy resources for use in aquaculture and to monitor marine mammals, birds and fish.\n\nThe project results are available on the website as policy, technology, scenario and roadmap documents. The web portal also provides the network and other interested parties with an events calendar for internal and external meetings.\n\nThe roadmap will advise decision makers, scientists and industries on how to grow the offshore renewable energy sector in a sustainable, eco-friendly manner. The results will also support other related Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) initiatives.", "http://www.orecca.eu", "http://www.owel.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2012-12/54046.jpg", "fp7_94058_991960025"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PL15"}
