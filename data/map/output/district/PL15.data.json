In particular, the project will stimulate collaboration in research activities leading towards innovative, cost efficient and environmentally benign offshore RE conversion platforms for wind, wave and other ocean energy resources, for their combined use as well as for the complementary use such as aquaculture and monitoring of the sea environment. The use of the offshore resources for RE generation is a relatively new field of interest. ORECCA will overcome the knowledge fragmentation existing in Europe and stimulate the key experts to provide useful inputs to industries, research organizations and policy makers (stakeholders) on the necessary next steps to foster the development of the ocean energy sector in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way. A focus will be given to respect the strategies developed towards an integrated European maritime policy. The project will define the technological state of the art, describe the existing economical and legislative framework and identify barriers, constraints and needs within. ORECCA will enable collaboration of the stakeholders and will define the framework for future exploitation of offshore RE sources by defining 2 approaches: pilot testing of technologies at an initial stage and large scale deployment of offshore RE farms at a mature stage. ORECCA will finally develop a vision including different technical options for deployment of offshore energy conversion platforms for different target areas in the European seas and deliver integrated roadmaps for the stakeholders. These will define the strategic investment opportunities, the R&amp;D priorities and the regulatory and socio-economics aspects that need to be addressed in the short to the medium term to achieve a vision and a strategy for a European policy towards the development of the offshore RE sector", 24958.0, 1549794.0, "ORECCA", "A roadmap for sustainable ocean energy", "An EU-funded project has drawn up a roadmap for offshore renewable energy using knowledge from around the world.

Bento\u201d in collaboration with European partners. It emerges as a response to fragilities identified at school level, particularly with issues related to early school leaving and the need for teachers and non-teachers to participate in formative updating activities to promote collaborative work. With this project, with the contact with European realities, it is hoped to be able to stimulate the students to the importance of technical training as a way to improve the competences for the labor market and give them a broader view of their knowledge and professional skills.\r\nSpecific project objectives, relatively to the students, are: reduce early school leaving; improving the employability of students in the area of formation; give students a modern and European view of the activities in their area of formation; and improve their language skills. With the involvement of teachers and operational assistants, they are expected to acquire new skills, particularly in collaborative work that will allow them to improve their interdisciplinary abilities and work capacity and integrate the activities of the technical sector of the school. It is also expected that teachers and operational assistants will develop a network of sharing with colleagues of the others schools counterparts and partner companies.\r\nThe participants directly involved at the School level will be:\r\n- twenty-four students, from the Professional courses, twelve students from the Professional Course of Agricultural Production Technician, four students from the Professional Course of Environmental and Rural Tourism Technician, four students from the Professional Course of Restaurant - Bar Technician and four students from the Professional Course in Kitchen and Pastry Technician.\r\n- ten teachers, two being teachers who teach subjects of the socio-cultural component of the courses; two professors who teach subjects of the scientific component of the courses and six teachers who teach the subjects of the Technical, Technological and Practical component of the courses.\r\n- two operational assistants related to the farm and technology facilities.\r\n\r\nThe activities foreseen in the project are:\r\n- mobility of students to carry out two weeks of training in the context of work in entities of their area of formation, in coordination with the partner schools.\r\n- mobility of teachers for one week to carry out jobshadowing with teachers from the partner schools and / or entities hosting the students in training in the context of work.\r\n- mobility of the operational assistants during a week, for job shadowing with partner school technicians.\r\nIn addition to the mobilities, a working group will be set up at School level, consisting of the teachers enrolled in the project, the project coordinator and an element of the School's management. This group will be in charge of the planning of the trips and the integration in the partners\u2019 schools, as well as the articulation with the students' parents.\r\nThis group will create and maintain a facebook page and a website for project dissemination and sharing of experiences\r\nThe project will end with a seminar open to the community, in particular to the national companies, partners of the school, in the formation in the Work Context of the students, in order to discuss and share the essential aspects worked on the mobilities, namely new work methodologies and new technological solutions.\r\nWith this project the expectation of the School is to reduce school drop-out, improve students' academic performance, improve their employability in their area of formation and provide students with a work experience at an international level. In addition, it is hoped that the teaching and non-teaching staff of the School will be able to develop more actual and effective working methodologies, in order to promote in the students professional competences more adapted to the challenges of the 21st century.", "http://www.launcestoncollege.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PT01-KA102-035523_4"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PL15"}
