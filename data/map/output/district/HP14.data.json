The European PUR foam sector has 50.000 companies that employ over 1.6 million people.\nPolyurethane foam technology consists on foam building by reacting two chemicals, isocyanate and polyol, in the presence of other additives such as blowing agents, catalysts, and fire retardants. Manufacture of PUR foam requires certain amount of free isocyanate in order to fully react the polyurethane mixture. Isocyanate component represents a potential risk to workers during manufacture of the PUR foams. Isocyanate is included in the 2003 European schedule of occupational diseases, and it has been established that ten to twenty percent of asthma cases recorded in EU are due to isocyanates.\nThe aim of FREEFOAM is to reduce health risk of workers during foam manufacturing by lowering the concentration of free isocyanate and reducing the emission of the same to the atmosphere. We propose a unique, homogeneous reactive mixture for PUR foaming purposes where reactants are physically separated by using functionalised microcapsules of isocyanate conveniently dispersed on polyol mixture component. The reactive system will allow increasing the mixture reactivity due to the performed compatibility and hence, homogeneity between isocyanate and polyol components while decreasing the exposure of workers to harmful emissions by lowering the residual monomer content on the foam, avoiding the emissions and migration of such components from foams. In addition, the used solution will allow decreasing the generated waste due to bad cell homogeneity and product density as consequence of bad mixing process.", 277730.0, 1660943.0, "FREEFOAM", null, null, null, null, "http://www.bfm.org.uk", null, "fp7_108384_953544339"], ["4BF", "CROWD sensing and ride sharing FOR ROAD Sustainability", "Buckinghamshire Advantage", "Road networks are the largest publicly owned assets and they play a fundamental role in socio-economic development and competitiveness. At the same time, roads have huge environmental impacts and maintenance costs. Passenger cars account for 73.7% of total intra-EU passenger transport, with an average car occupancy rate well below 2 passengers per car. The resulting traffic accounts for about 12% of CO2 emissions. Delayed maintenance impairs road safety and increases cost of intervention, vehicle operating costs, and emissions.\nThe CROWD4ROADS project combines trip sharing and crowd sensing initiatives to harness collective intelligence to contribute to the solution of the sustainability issues of road passenger transport, by increasing the car occupancy rate and by engaging drivers and passengers in road monitoring.\nBlaBlaCar (http://blablacar.com/) is the largest trusted ride sharing community worldwide, with more than 10.000.000 members in 14 countries, while SmartRoadSense (http://smartroadsense.it/) is a crowd sensing system which makes use of the accelerometers of car-mounted smartphones to estimate the roughness of the road surface.\nThe CROWD4ROADS platform establishes a synergistic relationship between BlaBlaCar and SmartRoadSense, exploiting the network effect which is inherent in both the initiatives, to provide a sizeable impact in terms of car occupancy rate, road monitoring, and end-user engagement in road maintenance and transport sustainability.\nScalability issues will be addressed during the project both from a technical and from a social point of view. The approach will be validated on representative large scale pilots, involving more than 1 million people and covering more than 1 million km of roads.
