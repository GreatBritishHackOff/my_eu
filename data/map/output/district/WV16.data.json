(Transnational) Limited", "There are over three thousand spot welds in a typical car. When a car is repaired the spot welding parameters can be different as the mass production machinery used in manufacture can no longer be used. The repairer often is not an expert at inspecting spot welds. Assured reliability of the spot weld is paramount, since the integrity of the spot welds is vital to the crash performance of a car and the safety of its passengers. Therefore, there is a need for a rapid non-destructive inspection device that can be operated by somebody without specialist skills. SpotTrack proposal is for creating the first automatic spot weld tracking device that can be applied non-destructively in the automotive repair industry.\n\nThe only inspection option available to body repair shops today is to create a spot weld on an off-cut and carry out a \u2018peel test\u2019 on it, which is destructive. However, the assumption that the test spot weld is identical to the one on the car can be unsatisfactory. In some cases the spot weld may not be tested at all. The new SpotTrack device will allow the user to quickly and reliably tell whether a spot weld is acceptable by giving a simple pass or fail indication. The proposed SpotTrack system will have the advantage of testing the actual weld made within a matter of seconds and without the need for interpretation. Most importantly it will ensure that the actual spot welds going into service are safe.", 163513.0, 1207323.0, "SpotTrack", "New tool to expose welding defects", "An EU-funded project developed an easy-to-use, affordable and non-destructive testing tool using ultrasound to detect flaws in spot welds in vehicles.", "When considering the thousands of spot welds present in the make-up of a car, it is inevitable that some will need to be remade when the vehicle undergoes repair.\nClearly, it is not possible to destructively test repair welds.\nMatching test samples could be made for some reassurance; however, there is currently no suitable method to ensure the integrity of welds going into service.The EU-funded project http://www.spottrack.eu/ (SPOTTRACK) sought to meet this need and developed an automated spot weld inspection device.\nWith a consortium of nine partners, the project first focused on assessing the market needs and then designed the device using a numerical model.\nThe ultimate aim was to develop a lightweight and low-cost device as well as a probe that can access difficult regions and be used by a non-expert.Project partners pioneered the finite element modelling methods for ultrasound prediction.\nThe models make it possible to study a large set of samples relatively inexpensively and provide more detailed insight.\nThe modelling results provide visualisation of the sound field throughout the whole volume at any point in time during the weld test.\nThis results in deeper understanding of the effects of the variables on the reliability of test results.To allow greater inspection resolution, SPOTTRACK uses an array probe and a multiplexer with a single pulser-receiver.\nThe multiplexer allows signals to be collected, eliminating the need for expensive phased-array equipment.\nThe project team also created a set of samples to ensure that the SPOTTRACK could reliably determine the quality of spot welds.\nSamples included good welds and a range of defective welds.\nThe team used the data from these tests to develop novel signal processing algorithms for the inspection system.Novel algorithms that automatically identify the main reflections (from the backwall of the weld), intermediate reflections (in case of an undersized weld or defects in the weld), and certain parameters of the reflections such as arrival time and amplitude were developed.\nUsing this information, the team could determine the thickness and the approximate size of the weld and decide whether the weld is defect free or not.Two prototype devices were developed, and field trials were conducted on cars that are under repair.\nMeeting a false call rate under 1\u00a0%, the SPOTTRACK device ensures safe vehicle repair.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112547.jpg", "fp7_100886_964620478"], ["4RN", "Systemic large scale eco-innovation to advance circular economy and mineral recovery from organic waste in Europe", "Rika Biofuel Developments Ltd", "SYSTEMIC will reach a break-through to re-enter recovered nutrients from organic waste into the production cycle. Consequently, this will offer solutions for pressing environmental issues and to reduce the import of P as finite irreplaceable resource in mines.\n\nThe SYSTEMIC project aims to shift the European Biomass treatment practice to the next level. Departing from existing business cases and a new ground-breaking large scale demonstration plant, the future of anaerobic digestion (AD) value chains will be investigated and demonstrated. The result will help existing and future AD-operators to maximise their performance: produce and sell more quality products, generate more energy and be independent on subsidies. By the market driven leadership, the SYSTEMIC-project will finally turn biomass waste into valuable products while reducing water pollution, greenhouse gas emission and creating quality jobs in rural areas.\n\nThe planned demonstration plant will allow innovative combinations of modules to elaborate possible optimizations for increasing the production quantity and quality of new mineral products, and the integration of these products into a circular economy. Reflecting the experiences from the demonstration plant with a set of 4 mirror cases in different members states allow systemic innovation including end-user driven (a) specific technical development and (b) the cost efficient investigation of real world circular economy business cases and (c) operational, regulatory, institutional and contextual barriers to overcome.\n\nUsing partial funding from the EC, the SYSTEMIC industry-driven consortium will validate for the first time the technical and economic viability of a fully integrated, multistep approach in an operational environment.
