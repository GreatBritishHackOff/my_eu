With humour and irony the film explores the conflict between Sami reindeer herders, Norwegian adventure snowmobilers and tourist development through the eyes of Ing\u00e1-M\u00e1ret, a young Sami woman.Ing\u00e1-M\u00e1ret has to fight not only against the arriving foreigners to protect her reindeer but also against the stereotypes of her own people to prove she can manage her family's reindeer herd. The film explores how different cultures clash over the power of this poor vast land.  Snowmobiles have replaced the horses and the sheriff is always very far away. The Finnish national state has retreated and human civilization is re-defining itself. The power of the clans is taking over.   Rich and powerful Norwegian colonial intruders and tourists threaten the survival of the reindeer herds, meanwhile environmentalists are fighting for a National Park to protect the area from commercial development.  These conflicts frequently erupt in Anni's \"saloon\" bar.  Many of the Norwegians are \u201crednecks\u201d who see themselves as political refugees, fleeing the rule of the authoritarian politicians in the south of Norway, who deny them their human right to free snowmobile use. The snowmobiles frighten the reindeer herds from their grazing grounds.  In spring when the reindeer calves are born, the tension escalates as happy Norwegians celebrate their National Day on May 17th on their snowmobiles.  The reindeer mothers are stressed by the constant sound of the snowmobile engines.  They abandon their newborn calves in panic.  The calves then become easy prey for predators like the Golden Eagle and the Wolverine.  The last two weeks of May are a struggle for life and death for Ing\u00e1-M\u00e1ret.  If she manages to keep the Norwegian snowmobilers away from the herd, then she will survive one more year. If the barrier is broken and the herd stampedes, the reindeer calves will die..", null, null, "creative_572282-CREA-1-2016-1-FI-MED-TV_1"]]}}}}
