The EU toilet hire market is worth \u00a33bn/year and serves 2bn people annually, but relies on inefficient 1970s technologies. Loowatt has developed a toilet system that is waterless, chemical free and generates energy, and has been demonstrated at UK events. The patented Loowatt toilet uses biodegradable polymer film and a sealing system to contain waste. The polymer film and waste are then transported to energy-generating Anaerobic Digestion systems in existing Wastewater Treatment utility infrastructure or small-scale onsite systems.\n\nThe events industry unlocks a business opportunity for Loowatt that could be worth ~\u20ac2m in revenue p.a. by 2017 and ~\u20ac20m revenue p.a. by 2020. Loowatt hopes to expand into Continental European Markets through joint venture models with European toilet service providers, reaching 5.2 million EU customers by 2020.  \nHaving achieved traction in Events market, Loowatt will build traction in the Construction and Humanitarian Response sectors.  \n\nLoowatt\u2019s goals align with the European need for innovative technologies to assure environmental sustainability, maintain people\u2019s well-being, and remain competitive in a changing world.", 41995.0, 59993.0, "LOOWATT", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_204361_927120084"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SW2"}
