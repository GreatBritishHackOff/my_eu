We serve an area which is within the 20th most deprived in the country. The Borough of Lambeth and particularly Tulse Hill is one of the most densely populated places in the country, with over 100 people living in each hectare, more than twice the London population density.  Our school serves a complex social and ethnic mix, with large African and Portuguese populations, and is an important focus for the black Caribbean population. Nowadays it also has a growing Spanish speaking community. \r\n\r\nIn spite of the many cultural and social challenges we face, we are a school aiming for academic excellence and we want to be recognised as a place where language expertise and language learning are a central part of our school ethos. We have an ambitious and energetic MFL Department whose aim is to serve our students and community well by teaching languages, and specifically Spanish which is our specialism, way beyond the demands of the National Curriculum.  That is why we see the promotion and teaching of bilingualism not only as clear manifestation of our ethos but as an urgent necessity to educate and offer all our students those much needed skills for an even more competitive, interconnected and globalised world. Bilingual education is already a reality in many non-Anglo speaking European countries whereas in the UK it remains the privilege of just a few institutions and students. As stated before, there are many teachers and academics who by now consider monolingual education as second class.  We already have in place two very important components for the promotion of bilingualism in our school: the provision of language education for our non-MFL teachers, plus CALP (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency) which exposes our students to academic vocabulary, in Spanish, connected to other school subjects.  The main objective of this project is the introduction of a third, final and vital component to secure the success of teaching our students bilingually: Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL).\r\n\r\nTo turn CLIL into reality, our MFL Department last summer hired a CLIL expert, Dr Nina Lancaster, who in turn has put us in contact with Dr Mar\u00eda Luisa Perez Ca\u00f1ado, an international researcher on CLIL at The University of Ja\u00e9n. This Erasmus + project  can provide us the opportunity of becoming one of the very few comprehensive schools in England to offer bilingual education to its students. The methodology to follow will be that of intensive language training combining MFL and non-MFL teachers with a specific focus of how to plan lessons to be able to deliver content that is aligned with the language in which it is taught, i.e. Spanish.  This already implies a much wider and internationalised curriculum.   \r\n\r\nThe school has the fortune of having a linguist head teacher, Jim Henderson, and a very dynamic and ambitious Director of Languages, Gustavo Garc\u00eda, supported by a team of very talented MFL teachers who have manged to integrate many aspects of MFL teaching into other departments.  There are numerous publications and articles stating the long term benefits of a bilingual education. From the students' point of view we can point out: better career prospects, more self confidence, independent learning, higher academic proficiency, without forgetting the always mentioned truly integrated citizens of the world.  For the staff we can also talk of better job prospects and greater job satisfaction and a better prepared work force to help and support students and families.  Equally, since we are a school already collaborating and sharing resources not only with schools within the E-Act family but also with the Windmill Cluster and a handful of primary schools in Lambeth, we envisage that the experience and know-how knowledge gained with this project can be widely beneficial to a large number of stake holders and academic partners.", "http://www.cityheightse-actacademy.org", "City Heights E-ACT Academy", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036158_coordinator"], ["1BZ", "Refugees welcome - Willkommenskultur und Integrationsalltag im europ\u00e4ischen Austausch", "Embrace Cooperation Ltd", 52295.0, "Refugees welcome is a Mobiliy project, that focuses experiences and competences of Europe in the field of integration of refugees.

The \"Compagnons du Devoir\" are the source of inspiration and the Agency Leonardo da Vinci (EU) helped to transfer this model to continuing education in all types of trades.\r\nThe tradition of learning of artisans can be adapted and transferred to the ongoing training of all professionals. Learning excellence requires not only of new theoretical knowledge, but especially the acquisition of new practical skills based on experimentation and observation of good models of Knowledge in the field... The transfer of companionship to the PD model assumes certain adaptations to meet the needs of adult professionals who occupy a function and have private or family commitments. Even though they speak different languages, the common occupation is a factor of communication and a strong link between professionals.\r\n10  Staff from Janus Therapeutic Community will travel to their  host- partner organizations in Belgium, Caech Republic, Italy, Spain and Greece  to participate in the Mobility  project  in grouped mini-internships to discover other organizations and Ecett internships.\r\nThis enable  Janus T.C  to establish contacts with host- partner institutions that have developed some good practices in the Therapeutic Community \" Community as method model\" in  Addiction Treatment  / Rehabilitation thus improve quality outcomes for clients.
