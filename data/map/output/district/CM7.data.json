The innovative point is the extended consortium which includes sending partners from the educational and economic sector  in the field of hospitality and tourism on the national level (6 Slovenian secondary vocational schools for catering and tourism and  Tourism and Hospitality Chamber of Slovenia- Association of Hoteliers of Slovenia) in order to reinforce the cooperation between both sectors and ensure a synergic effect of the mobility experience gained by all key target groups involved: students, teachers and staff in enterprises-mentors of internships.\r\n\r\nThe main goals of the project are:\r\n\r\n- to enhance internationalization  of the consortium partners and thus contribute to the promotion and increase of mobility\r\n\r\n- to raise the attractiveness and quality of teaching/learning  of foreign languages focused on multilingualism, intercultural competencies and the use if ICT\r\n\r\n- to contribute to more transparent and unified evaluation ,acknowledgement and certification of the learning outcomes  acquired during the mobility by using the national and European tools\r\n\r\n- to increase the competitiveness and employability of the mobility participants by providing them with specific knowledge and international experience  \r\n\r\n-to promote the shortage occupations cook and waiter\r\n\r\n- to get insight into new trends and needs of the hospitality sector on the European labour market (\u00abNew skills for new jobs\u00ab) by exchanging examples of good practice\r\n\r\nThe target groups of mobility participants are:\r\n\r\n- Students in secondary VET (gastronomy and tourism programmes): 38 students plus 6 accompanying persons\r\n\r\n- Teachers of foreign languages, professional subjects and practical classes: 23\r\n\r\n- Mentors of internships in enterprises/hotels: 12\r\n\r\nThe project activities will differ according to the target group and will include:\r\n\r\n- internship in host hotels, language course , cultural activities and excursions (students)\r\n\r\n- presentations of new teaching methods and workshops , sightseeing, cultural activities, socializing (teachers of foreign languages)\r\n\r\n- participation in the Euroskills course and workshops,sightseeing, cultural activities, socializing (teachers of professional subjects, practical classes)\r\n\r\n- exchange of good practices, visits of hotels and  discussions with mentors of internship on organization, implementation and evaluation/certification of internships , sightseeing and cultural activities (mentors from Slovenian hotels)\r\n\r\nThe main expected result of the project for all participants are new and improved  competencies in  their professional field of work, communication skills in foreign languages  and  intercultural awareness as well as their increased motivation for further education and training based on the positive mobility experience. Another important result  is the unified and transparent  acknowledgement and certification of the mobility learning outcomes within the consortium . New ideas and suggestions for joint future projects are expected to emerge from this project, too. \r\n\r\nThe most important long-term impact of the project is the establishment of a good basis for the future cooperation between the educational and economic  sector in the field of hospitality  and for enhancing the  internationalization process of the partners involved. \r\n\r\nAnd, last but not least the project can serve as an example how to take the advantages of the new features of Erasmus + to give the national and sectorial dimension to mobility experience within one single project.", "http://www.2clix.net", null, "erasmus_2014-1-SI01-KA102-000257_12"], ["3NR", "QUAL.IS.BAS: Qualit\u00e0 dell'Istruzione in Basilicata", "Alec Hunter Academy", 177947.0, "The project QUAL.IS.BAS is co-ordinated by the Regional Education Authority  for the Basilicata region (USR). The USR has promoted the internationalization of Basilicata schools by organizing informational seminars on the European programmes, disseminating best practices, opening a \u201cEuropean Desk\u201d, setting up an ESABAC course, running English language courses for primary school and non-linguage subject teachers. The USR, through this consortium, involves three secondary schools located in Potenza: IIS \u201cNitti\u201d, IIS \u201cDa Vinci\u201d and Liceo Scientifico \u201cGalilei\u201d that have often cooperated with the USR and have distinguished themselves for the quality of their initiatives over the course of years, and two partner schools in Sweden, one in France and another one in Great Britain.\r\nThe three member schools of the consortium share a strong interest in internationalization that is expressed by the headmistresses  and teachers\u2019 tireless commitment to the promotion of innovative practices and a more open outlook on different cultures. Moreover, a large number of teachers who are attending CLIL language courses organized by the USR work in these schools.\r\nThe objectives of the project are to encourage: a) the CLIL methodology training of a large number of teachers who have been involved mainly in English language courses so far, since the teaching of CLIL modules is compulsory in the final year of Secondary school; b) foreign language teachers\u2019 refresher courses in the field of language teaching; c) the linguistic methodological competence improvement of the teachers working in ESABAC French courses; d) the ATA personnel and curricular teachers\u2019 knowledge of English and French. In all, we are involving 90 people working in the  three schools, both teaching and non-teaching staff, in activities that refer to the three typologies of Key Action 1- School Education Staff Mobility, that is courses, teaching assignments and job shadowing. The results of this project, which will develop in the course of 24 months, include the increase in European and intercultural training experiences, the improvement of the formative offer of Secondary schools, the acquisition of new teaching methodological strategies, greater motivation and flexibility of teachers, and the enhancement of the language competences of all those who are responsible for both the reception and the administration and accounts of incoming and outgoing mobility.\r\nThe long term results concern the improvement of  the quality of teaching so that it may become more involving and motivating and more Europe oriented, giving the right opportunities to expand the teaching content through an intercultural approach, transnational cooperation and the collaboration on teaching material. Furthermore, thanks to this project, the USR wants to favour the internationalization of Basilicata schools increasing the development of the school system with the aim of making the consortium an excellence hub the other schools of the region may consult about professional development programmes of the same profile.", "http://www.alechunter.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IT02-KA101-014337_3"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["4AG", "EXACTEARTH EUROPE LIMITED", 13084.0, "Horizon 2020 \u2014 Customer-driven scientific and technical support to Union policies (10.02.01)", "fts_2017_69334", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "CM7"}
