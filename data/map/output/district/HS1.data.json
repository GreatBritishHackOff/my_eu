We create a meeting place where local experiences and stories blend with international works. We believe art to be a generator of dreams and actions. Therefore we propose Reclaim the future as the creation of a common ground where stories of Europe can be voiced and shared. Together with local communities we create carnivals celebrating the local perspectives and join them together to share the experience of contemporary Europe.The carnivals form parallel realities where we can see our lives on a second level, giving us tools to reflect on ourselves and the world we live in. In this, we invite the audience to be participants in the creation based on each one\u00b4s needs and perspectives. We promote artistic mobility as we share performances with each other and invite artists to work in our partners\u00b4 local context. This builds places where cultures and voices meet in a common and diverse narrative of this Europe NOW in which we all co-exist. We want to advocate this as citizens wanting to be part in the building of our future, based on co-creation, co-operation and participation. A film and research team is invited to collect and formulate our experiences. We want to develop practical tools to spread methodology and outcomes. Our long-term goal is to promote collaboration through an international network joining artists, civil society, researchers, stakeholders. And specifically those whose voices are seldom or ever heard. We want to build a sustainable future together. Therefore the carnival. As we say in our mission statement: Carnivals are the celebration of diversity as well as a space where you can escape reality for a while and build your own narrative. This is creative carthasis and metamorphosis in a simple context.
