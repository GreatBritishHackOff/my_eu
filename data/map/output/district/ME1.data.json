To reach the project goals the AMERICAS workplan builds upon the following well-targeted support activities and capacity-building events:<br/>- Organising an annual ICT Forum synchronised with S&T and ICT dialogue meetings to support sustainable policy dialogues and to foster collaborative research on ICT- Organising interactive Master Classes to stimulate, encourage and facilitate proactive participation of world-class researchers from LA in ICT projects- Organising Summer Schools for existing and future Project Angels to deepen their knowledge about EU ICT projects, supported by on-line knowledge exchange and information tools- Performing a feasibility study to provide recommendations on potential joint strategies and ICT priorities for future bi-regional cooperation initiatives in the ICT arena- Fostering pro-active collaboration between AMERICAS and e-Infrastructure projects to enhance R&D collaboration and share e-Infrastructures for research in common ICT domains<br/>The above activities will be carried out by an experienced partnership with a proven track record in successful international cooperation projects, supported by its multipliers networks.
