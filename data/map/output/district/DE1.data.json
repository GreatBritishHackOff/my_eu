While ultrasonic flow measurement offer numerous advantages, there remain many challenges that need to be overcome while making ultrasonic flow measurement both accurate & reliable, especially for applications in gas medium. In order to tackle these issues, complex yet cost effective flow measurement instrumentation development is fundamental.\n\nSpecifically, this SACUT MC-IAPP project involves design, construction and testing of novel ultrasound measurement system for air-coupled ultrasonics, primarily for flow measurement but also for generic Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) applications. This will be achieved through effective knowledge transfer and collaboration between the four principal partners; Prof. Steve Dixon (University of Warwick: Lead Academic Partner and program coordinator, based in the UK), Dr. Nishal Ramadas (Elster NV/SA: Lead commercial partner, based in Belgium), Mr. Andy Whittle (PeakNDT: SME, based in the UK) and Prof. Mario Kupnik (BTU-Cottbus: Academic partner, based in Germany).\n\nProf. Steve Dixon (Program coordinator) and Prof. Mario Kupnik (the other academic partner from BTU-Cottbus) are leading experts in the ultrasound field, and their respective departments have a wide range of excellent facilities and expertise that is directly relevant for carrying out this research work successfully.

Nozzle sections made from austenitic steel can be susceptible to rapid crack growth due to thermal fatigue and stress corrosion. Early detection of cracks is therefore essential to ensure the continued safe operation of the facility in question.  In order to reduce the time and cost of such inspections there is an urgent need to develop a system capable of performing a full inspection of nozzles without the need to change probes. The aim of NozzleInspect project is to design an autonomous robot system that able to: reduce the inspection times, Improve defect delectability and sizing, Reduce human intervention which will reduce workforce radiation uptake and Reduce requirement for robotic manipulation and consequently reduce size and cost of robotic deployment system.  The goal of NozzleInspect project is to improve the reliability of the inspection of the welded nozzle sections in nuclear and other safety critical facilities. The robot will carry out a new and novel flexible phased array probe to allow a full inspection of nozzle weld areas and an advanced navigation system that follow the weld in nozzle.

The nozzles form a critical part of the nuclear reactor and therefore detection of cracks is necessary to ensure safe operation of the facility. However, the nozzles are located in an area subject to high levels of ionising radiation and inspection personnel have a very limited amount of time to enter the reactor and set up and calibrate the inspection equipment.\n\nThe 'Autonomous robot for an automatic inspection of nozzle welds in nuclear environment' (http://www.nozzleinspect.eu/ (NOZZLEINSPECT)) project designed a robot for carrying out this vital work. The overall goal was to automate the procedures for calibration and inspection by developing an integrated system that could be carried to the inspection area and easily installed.\n\nProject partners produced a working prototype of the inspection system to help them overcome any technical issues related to the hardware, thereby enabling them to develop the necessary software control and inspection algorithms. The prototype needed to be large, but light enough to be portable and mounted on wheels. In addition, it had to be stable so that it would not topple over when manoeuvring, and rigid enough to resist clamping and other forces.\n\nResearchers developed a new flexible phased-array probe that enabled a full inspection of nozzle weld areas without the need to frequently change ultrasonic probes. In addition, an advanced navigation system was built that used its 3D steering capability to follow the weld around the nozzle, allowing it to be inspected in a single operation. An ultrasonic technique was also developed for inspecting the nozzle weld, as were analytical tools for interpreting large amounts of 3D data.\n\nThe robot will dramatically reduce inspection time and human intervention, thereby saving time and money, increasing reliability and further protecting personnel from radiation uptake. The NOZZLEINSPECT consortium will market the system to potential end users such as operators of nuclear facilities and inspection service companies. The system will therefore help support the nuclear industry and the wider European economy.", "http://www.nozzleinspect.eu", "http://www.peakndt.com", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58297.jpg", "fp7_93485_994625973"], ["2SA", "DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL INSPECTION TECHNIQUES FOR TRAIN AXLES", "Balfour Beatty Rail Technologies Limited", "The structural integrity of wheel sets used in rolling stock is of great importance to the rail industry and its customers. A number of rail accidents have been directly related to the failure of train axles, leading to increased demands for their inspection and maintenance. Visual inspection and Magnetic Particle Inspection are the current standard practices used for manual non-destructive testing of axles. However, these processes require removal of the wheelset from the wagon/locomotive bogie and full disassembly in order to facilitate access.  Inspection is also carried out by some wagon providers using ultrasonic testing (UT) but its application is also limited to disassembled wheelsets.\n\nAn axle on a wheelset can be connected to a number of ancillary components including breaks and bearings. The disassembly (and reassembly) of axles from the wheelsets/wagon bogey is therefore very time consuming and expensive. There is evidence that even partial disassembly and reassembly could introduce future axle reliability problems. To minimise disruption to their train services but ensure continued safety, train operators require frequent and regular inspection methods that allow quick inspection at the depot with the minimum of wheelset and bogie disassembly.\n\nThe AxleInspect project aims to develop new inspection techniques based on phased array ultrasonic and electromagnetic techniques suitable for the inspection of both solid and hollow axles. For solid axles, inspection techniques are to be developed that inspect from the end face of the axles using new and novel phased array ultrasonic inspection technology. For hollow axles, probes based on UT and electromagnetic inspection techniques are to be developed, enabling detection of surface breaking cracks that cannot be found by ultrasonic inspection. These new techniques will allow inspection of axles whilst they are still attached to their supporting bogey, allowing minimal wheelset disassembly from the train.", 22976.0, 1127834.0, "AxleInspect", "Enhancing train axle safety", "New high-tech inspection methods for train axles, which can be employed without removing the axles from wagons, promise to facilitate rail maintenance and enhance safety.", "European trains are becoming faster than ever as rail technology improves \u2014 a trend that is expected to continue over the next 10 years. However, the increased demand on existing rail infrastructure requires increased safety checks and standards, particularly with respect to the structural integrity of wheel sets and axles. Against this backdrop, the EU-funded project 'Development of novel inspection techniques for train axles' (http://www.axleinspect.eu (AXLEINSPECT)) worked on new inspection techniques to improve the safety and security of rail cars.\n\nIn particular, the project team worked on new techniques for solid axles based on phased array inspection technology. It also developed inspection techniques for hollow axles involving probes that exploit ultrasonic and electromagnetic technology. Importantly, the techniques enable axle inspection while the axles are attached to the supporting bogie, saving precious time and resources.\n\nTo achieve its aims, the project team developed sophisticated probes for inspecting inner and outer surface breaking cracks, as well as automated scanners to deploy the probes. It also conceived a scanning jig to conduct the inspection and developed a bespoke data analysis software. The project then designed an innovated phased array probe based on ultrasonic modelling to enhance crack detection capabilities.\n\nOverall, the powerful inspection technology is intended for verifying the structural integrity of train axles in order to improve safety levels. It promises to give Europe a more competitive edge in the field of train inspection, encouraging train use and cost efficiency.

Their utilization can result in early and specific treatment, contribute to better patient outcomes and reduce length of hospital stay.

Even in central laboratories, timely diagnosis may be undermined by delays during sample transport to the setting and batching practices oriented to save consumables. There is a need for a fast, cost-effective, user-friendly molecular diagnostic point-of-care (POC) instrument for near-patient use at small to medium size hospitals, and decentralized clinical laboratories.
