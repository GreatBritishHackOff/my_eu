From its new vision for a resource-efficient Europe, the project will propose new policy mixes, business models and mechanisms of global governance through which resource-efficient economies may be promoted.\n\nThis will lead in turn to intensive work on creating, modelling and visualising scenarios for the emergence of resource-efficient economies, through linking quantitative economic and ecological models, and simulating the policies and policy mixes derived in the earlier work, supplemented with appropriate LCA analysis for selected products and sectors, to ensure that the policies and business models in the scenarios lead to adequate absolute decoupling of economic activity from resource use and environmental degradation. The scenarios and associated policy analysis will be given an integrated interpretation across economic, ecological and social dimensions.\n\nThe project will be explicitly geared to support policy efforts and initiatives on resource efficiency in the European Commission, and will involve a wide range of stakeholders from business, the policy world, and NGOs.

Three detailed pathways towards a resource efficient Europe are described.", "Efficient resource usage is a key element of sustainability, and thus a key priority for Europe. The 'Policy options for a resource-efficient economy' (http://www.polfree.eu (POLFREE)) project addresses four key questions: 'Why are resources often used inefficiently?', 'What new concepts and paradigm would support more efficient usage?', 'What would a resource-efficient Europe look like?', and 'What steps must be taken to achieve resource efficiency?' The eight-member-consortium project runs between October 2012 and March 2016.\n\nThe research starts by constructing a theoretical framework for understanding the barriers to an efficient use of resources. The framework develops the notion of web of constraints, moving beyond the notion of a \u2018barrier\u2019 to efficient resource use. The project explores different concepts and paradigms that could provide the basis for a resource-efficient economy. Specific policy mixes are then proposed that might be expected to lead to resource-efficient economies. Three scenarios were constructed envisaging the development of resource efficiency in Europe and exploring the implications of policy interventions, under different global conditions, in respect of resource use, CO2 emissions and economic growth, through the linkage of two macroeconomic models and a bio-physical model.\n\nWork during the first 18 months focused on developing the required theoretical framework and understanding of the web of constraints that explains inefficient use of resources. To date, 13 deliverables have been submitted and are available on the http://www.polfree.eu (project's website).\n\nThe framework identifies a complex pattern of constraints on resource efficiency. From the legislative perspective, the analysis points to a current focus on the output or environmental side of resource usage, yet gaps exist on the input or material side. The work also suggests a need for more coherence and guidance at the EU level, combined with better stakeholder coordination at national levels. Looking at behavioural constraints, the study suggests that consumption practices are largely influenced by people\u2019s participation in social practices and settings and are not just the outcome of personal attitudes, values and individual decisions.\n\nAnalysis of over 150 cases showed that successful new business models include intermediate companies seeking efficient paradigms. The study also points to a number of areas with greatest potential for businesses: green (business) services, cradle-to-cradle approaches, and industrial symbiosis. It is suggested that changes in the framework conditions in which companies operate are required to scale up the uptake of resource efficiency and new business models. Hence, resource efficiency must be tackled at the international and corporate levels.", null, "http://www.international-synergies.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/155658.jpg", "fp7_104291_983118475"], ["3JN", "MIRROR - Reflective Learning at Work", "Registered Nursing Home Association Limited", "Due to the dynamics in business environments and the large number of changes in job roles and tasks for employees, a time-consuming development of formal learning offers and the organisational-wide provision of vocational training are barriers for the wide adoption and use of learning technologies.
