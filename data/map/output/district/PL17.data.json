Self evaluation processes have shown that science department staff would benefit from training to enhance levels of student engagement, creativity in lesson planning and to develop sequences of lessons which promote higher levels of challenge for students of all abilities. We have worked with Sintermeerten College since 2010 in a variety of contexts including Comenius school partnerships and a Leonardo TOI project. Their science department teach some classes in English, so we plan to focus on this area to enable Callington Community College science teachers to observe, co-plan and, possibly, co-teach at Sintermeerten College to develop their skills and reflect on their own practice and co-reflect on their own and the other participant's practice in a different context. The nature of the context will promote greater reflection.\r\nParticipants will be selected following application and interview with priority given to colleagues who demonstrate motivation and have the capacity to develop their practice and that of the department along with the ability to reflect on their own development. The underlying aim of the project is to move the science department from good to outstanding. Three five day visits for pairs of teachers are planned preceded by pre-visit briefing and preparation including Skype conversation with Sintermeerten College colleagues. During each visit, the two teachers will undertake focussed lesson observations relevant to their specialism and personal targets, co-planning, possible co-teaching and co-reflection. \r\nAfter the visit, participants will be required to demonstrate impact on their own teaching and wider impact on the department. They will also be supported to disseminate their findings and progress towards agreed targets. Initial impact envisaged is an improvement in student attitudes and engagement in science lessons, along with evidence of increased challenge for students of all abilities measured through lesson observations and work with student focus groups as part of college self-evaluation/performance management systems. Longer term, an improvement in science GCSE results is envisaged. There is a real commitment to raising student outcomes as measured by GCSE results (%A* to C) to be in line with and exceed national performance measures.", "http://www.callingtoncc.net", "Callington Community College", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002026_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["8PH", "Blackburn's Rivers Important to Lancashire Landscape Investment And Natural Capital Economy (BRILLIaNCE)", "The Rivers Trust", "Improving the biodiversity of two rivers in Lancashire through the creation of a natural river bed and introdution of fish passes to allow fish to access the river upstream", "ERDF", 626515.0, 1044192.0, "erdf_england_420"], ["8PH", "Water for Growth", "Westcountry Rivers Trust", "Aligns 2010 Lawton report Making Space for Nature, 2011 Nat Env paper \u2018Natural Choice\u2019,one of four drivers identified by Ecosystems Task Force (2013).Aligns England Biodiversity Strategy 2020& Defra appraisal scored the vfm as satisfactory.", "ERDF", 1588288.0, 2188235.0, "erdf_england_519"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PL17"}
