This is essential to ensure the pupils in Scotland are provided with an education that will allow them to be equipped for jobs in the future. Language learning has vast benefits to our brains and can even prevent the onset of diseases such as dementia. The Scottish Government is forward thinking in understanding the need to introduce a norm for language learning in schools based on the European Union 1+2 model.  It is the job of teachers, like us, to ensure the Government policy is met and we provide the conditions in which every child is  learning two languages in addition to their own mother tongue.  In our local authority the first modern language the pupils will engage in is French.  To meet this target, the staff in schools need to develop their own French language skills.  Each school in our authority was given the opportunity to attend and Immersion course in France. Three teachers from Borrowfield have volunteered to attend an immersion course in France (giving up a week of their school holidays) to train and develop our ability to read, write, speak and understand the French language.  These three teachers are enthusiastic and have a basic understanding of the French language.  We can not only educate children in the spoken language, it is imperative that we also develop an understanding of French culture, something that can not be taught through the use of online resources or textbooks. Attending the LFEE immersion course will allow us to:\r\n\r\n- improve methodological expertise in teaching French\r\n- provide us with materials suitable for teaching French\r\n- develop cultural awareness, understanding of contemporary France and develop knowledge of the Education system in France\r\n- improve our own competency in French\r\n- understand how to use ICT resources\r\n\r\nWe will take part in daily lessons whilst on the immersion course and we will engage in cultural trips where we can practice using the French language with native speakers.  However, our overall aim is to embed the French language and culture in our school(s) with staff being confident in their own abilities.  In turn, we will then be able to meet the new 1plus2 Government initiative.\r\n\r\nOnce we have engaged with new resources and have a better understanding of the French culture, we will disseminate the learning to staff in Borrowfield and Natalie will share learning in all schools in Angus and with the Staff Tutors in PanTayside. This collaborative approach will ensure our new skills and knowledge will be cascaded to hundreds of teachers in authorities other than our own. One class teacher in Borrowfield has linked with a school in France and we all hope to support this teacher by sharing our learning of what school is like in France.  Natalie is in the process of linking other schools and again will share school culture with colleagues who are involved in using eTwinning. Pupils will also have the opportunity to communicate using ICT.  It is important our learning is shared not only in school but also in the wider community so parents, carers and the general public are aware of 1+2 and the need for learning languages. Therefore, we will share our learning with the wider community so everyone understands the importance of maintaining our European links.  By attending the immersion courses, we would also all hope to develop a network of colleagues who would be able to support each other on our learning journey. When in France, we will make links with other schools and businesses with whom we could use ICT to communicate with once we have returned to Scotland. We even hope to hold an Immersion CPD.  This would involve inviting all teachers in Angus (including Rebecca Crabb and Carole Lyons) to a training session where Natalie and others who have attended an Immersion Course, share what they learned i.e. cascading our knowledge and resources with all teachers in Angus.  The impact this LFEE Europe Immersion course could have on our professional learning and personal learning is vast.  However, this same impact will then be felt by teachers who attend our twilights this year and in the future. \r\n\r\nOverall, we hope to pass on our enthusiasm for learning other languages to the pupils in our class and school.  We would relish the opportunity to update our professional capabilities through attending the LFEE Europe Immersion Course.  However, we require the funding to do so.  Without the funding all of the possibilities that are shared in this application will not be possible.", null, "Borrowfield Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035760_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DD10"}
