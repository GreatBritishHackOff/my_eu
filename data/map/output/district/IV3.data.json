The project revolves around the concept of turning the UHI Faculty of Science, Health and Engineering  into a reference research and innovation hub for all of Europe on the theme of marine energy. The region is endowed with a unique environment that enables research \u201cwhere the resource is\u201d for ocean wave, tidal and offshore wind power. Marine energy has the potential to meet a growing share of Europe\u2019s energy demands in the years to come.  Research is needed to improve predictability, forecast techniques and to provide equipment and instruments\u2019 interactions to better manage development  processes within a well preserved environment. UHI  already has a consolidated position within the international research community and MERIKA represents the opportunity for a leap forward to acquire and reinforce its status of \u201creference centre\u201d in Europe. The project relies on cooperation with 7 high profile scientific institutions in Europe and is centered on two main blocks of activities. One  intervenes on capital (human and physical) and one  builds capacity, especially in areas related to innovation and protection or exploitation of knowledge. The first block consists of: a comprehensive mobility programme with  partnering organisations, a recruitment plan responding to precise needs for multidisciplinary competences to efficiently link different research strands, and a crucial upgrade in infrastructure, to enable UHI to function as the reference European hub for marine energy research. The capacity building component is geared towards a better use of complementary funds, the reinforcement of international collaboration and the definition of a coherent innovation policy to enhance UHI\u2019s potential in its cooperation with industry and other stakeholders of the marine energy arena.", 3133503.0, 3495258.0, "MERIKA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.uhi.ac.uk", null, "fp7_111362_991015633"], ["5SQ", "Development of regional and Pan-European guidelines for more efficient integration of renewable energy into future infrastructures", "University of the Highlands and Islands Lbg", "The overall impact from SUSPLAN is contribution to a substantially increased share of renewable energy sources (RES) in Europe at an acceptable level of cost, thereby increasing security of supply and competitiveness of RES industry.

Much of Europe depends on water from rivers for drinking, food production, and the generation of hydropower, which is essential for meeting the EU renewable energy target. Yet only half the EU surface waters have met the WFD\u2019s 2015 target of good ecological status, due in part to the fragmentation of habitats caused by tens of thousands of dams and weirs which also pose a flood hazard. Some barriers are old and out of use, but may have historical value, while the life span of others will soon come to an end and may need to be removed. But barriers also provide energy, water, fishing and leisure opportunities, and may also help to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species. Improving stream connectivity has been flagged as one of the priorities for more efficient stream restoration but effective rehabilitation of ecosystem functioning in European rivers needs to take the complexity and trade-offs imposed by barriers into account. \n\nAMBER will deliver innovative solutions to river fragmentation in Europe by developing more efficient methods of restoring stream connectivity through adaptive barrier management.
