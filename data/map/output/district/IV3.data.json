However, there are many major scientific, technological and social obstacles to overcome. This European Joint Master proposes specialised training in this field. The consortium is composed of three universities: University of the Highlands and Islands - Scottish Association for Marine Science (Scotland, UK), University of Crete (Greece) and the University of Nantes (France). The first semester (SAMS/UHI, UK) is devoted to gaining an overview of the global aquaculture industry, the interactions of this industry with the environment, and the new technologies and systems designed to address the various challenges and opportunities associated with this industry. In addition, there will be an opportunity to attend a 10 day optional overseas fieldtrip at the end of semester 1. Whereas the two following trimesters are devoted to acquiring more specialist knowledge in the finfish and shellfish industries, the fourth semester is targeted to an industry-based research project, resulting in the writing of a dissertation (30 ECTS credits). The first 3 semesters comprise 9 modules (including two core modules and one optional) from a choice of two modules in each country. Each module includes up to 250 hours and is worth 10 ECTS credits.Career prospectsThe objectives and format of the course mean that ACES graduates will be equipped to work in senior management roles in a wide range of settings, including fin and shell-fish farms, environmental and regulatory organisations, international trade organisations, and nongovernmental organisations. Close links with the aquaculture industry and legislators are central to this course. Course objectives explicitly promote the interests of the industry and cooperation with other professionals. Expected career paths include company manager tasks, policy and strategy, aquaculture-related project development, applied research and jobs related to stakeholder partnership creation and promotion.An international experienceThe course runs over four semesters and involves study periods in three different European countries. This movement allows students to benefit from different welfare models, teaching strengths and the experience of living in different cultures and societies. ACES students have the opportunity to be taught by a team of international experts and gain the skills required to address food security \u2013an issue of global importance. More than 16 international partners cooperate with the programme hosting fieldtrips, providing international guest lecturers, organising placements and supporting research projects. Despite the courses being taught in English, language classes are also provided to ensure that students integrate as well as possible in socio-cultural terms in the host country.DiplomaSuccessful graduates will receive a Joint Master degree from the University of the Highlands and Islands and the University of Crete and a Single Degree from the University of Nantes in line with national legislation. In addition to these degree certificates, graduates will also receive a diploma supplement that outlines the nature of the course, curriculum and marking scheme.Websitehttp://www.sams.ac.uk/erasmus-master-aquaculture", "http://www.uhi.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF THE HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS LBG", "erasmus_553648-EPP-1-2014-1-UK-EPPKA1-JMD-MOB_coordinator"], ["5NX", "Language Training", "The Highland Council", 31468.0, "Highland is the largest and one of the most remote local authorities in Scotland and from August 2015, 1+2 will figure on the improvement plans of all its primary schools.

Their learning would also be shared with the community and staff through local papers and blogs and with the rest of their Highland colleagues through postings on our Highland Primary Languages Newsfeed or resource upload in the immersion folder.On their return teachers will be able to embed the target language in school and help further define their school's improvement plan and modern languages policy. They will follow up on their search for school and /or class partners abroad and as a class they will try out various technologies to communicate with them.Unable to attend workshops and courses which usually take place hours away from Highland, practitioners find themselves lacking in the interaction and the human aspect of language learning and immersion courses seem to be the answer.

For this reason, providing highly skilled and mobile graduates with in-depth knowledge and practical expertise of how to enable a major food producing industry - 'aquaculture' - develop sustainably, is essential to the development of individuals and society. The aquaculture industry in Europe is stagnating and the sustainable development of this industry has become essential for improving the competitiveness of this business internationally. There are many major scientific, technological and social obstacles, however to overcome. This Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree (EMJMD) in AquaCulture, Environment and Society PLUS (ACES+) proposes specialised training in this field. The consortium is composed of four universities, all centres of excellence with international reputations in aquaculture-related research and teaching: Greece (University of Crete), Scotland (University of the Highlands and Islands), France (University of Nantes) and the Netherlands (Radboud University), plus over 21international Associate Partners. The 2 year EMJMD ACES+ is aimed at students from all over the world. Candidates must have a Bachelor\u2019s degree (or equivalent) in one of the fields of environmental or social sciences, as well as a good level of English (at least IELTS 6.5). Admission is granted on the basis of a competitive selection procedure. Classes are taught in English and the course is composed of 9 modules of approx. 250 hours each (=30 ECTS). The course runs over 4 semesters. The first semester provides the foundation courses, which are devoted to gaining an overview of the global aquaculture industry, the interactions of this industry with the environment, new technologies and systems and how it is governed, managed and knowledge is exchanged with industry etc. Whereas, the two following ones are more advanced, enabling the students to acquiring more specialist knowledge in the finfish and shellfish industries, particularly looking at welfare, product quality and product refinement, etc., the fourth semester is targeted to an industry-based research project, resulting in the writing of a dissertation (=30 ECTS). Language classes in French, Greek and Dutch will also be provided to ensure that students integrate as well as possible in socio-cultural terms in the host country. Each student must spend at least one semester in each of the three (or four) countries, depending on choice of dissertation project. Students that have obtained 120 ECTS will automatically obtain a Joint Master Degree from the University of the Highlands and Islands, the University of Crete and the University of Nantes, plus a Diploma Supplement from Radboud University, if this has been their host institution for their dissertation.
