Our target is to make students, teachers, staff, schools and working life more international. We need to keep the amount of students\u2019 exchange at least on same level as earlier. Every participant will develop their language skills, social skills, professional skills, attitude, tolerance, general knowledge and entrepreneurship. The project affects students\u2019 employment and the internationality of our organisation and the region. Main issue in our international work based learning  is quality and continuous improving. We must keep our good level also in the future with our partners.\r\nIn CUBE 2017- project we send 74 students and 3 staff members to work based learning periods abroad.  This means real work in real work places. Additionally we send 7 staff members to visit partner schools abroad and receive three experts to teach our students and get to know our education, teaching methods and companies. We try to offer possibilities also to students with fewer opportunities, which means we have to accommodate accompanying persons with their periods. We try also achieve more periods to adult students and  even apprentices. In CUBE 2017 \u2013project we have about 80 partners in16 different countries. We try to expand our network during the project. \r\n\r\nDuring the work based learning periods both students and staff collect cultural differences at work places, free time and everyday life.  This information will help next travelers to meet the differences in other countries. They also describe in they travel report how internationalism and technology \u2013 specially digitality -   is seen in the working place. We also try to find new digital solutions with our domestic partners how to administer our Erasmus+ projects.", "http://www.westsuffolkcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA116-034389_26"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["3RL", "PLACE 21 C", "West Suffolk College", "This is a pilot initiative and breaks new ground.
