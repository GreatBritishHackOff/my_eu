Water filtering, water disinfection and online monitoring systems have been installed and will be tested to bring the site's water quality to desired levels.\n\nThe technology for advanced filtration and disinfection of drinking water supplies from ponds and tube wells is expected to be 100 times more efficient than chlorine bleach. It will also enhance the properties of drinking water by eliminating 30\u00a0% more waste. The online model will enable remote early warning detection and monitoring of water quality.\n\nThis integrated system for water filtration, disinfection and online monitoring will be based on solar power.

It emphasises the importance of working closely with the international community and related organisations to share practice and build the capacity of practitioners.\u201d\r\nThe 1+2 Languages Approach is an essential part of this international strategy. It will only succeed if practitioners are given the opportunities they need to achieve the highest level of professional practice. \r\n\r\nIn line with this approach, modern languages are and will continue to be a priority in our School Development plan. This application is for ten Primary teachers (including the school\u2019s 1+2 Lead Learner) from Lasswade Primary to participate in immersion courses in France and Spain over the next two years. These courses aim to improve and develop conversational language skills, to deepen cultural knowledge and to give practitioners a chance to explore new language teaching methods.  Although we have begun our journey towards implementing effective language programmes in Lasswade Primary, our goal is to develop our skills and knowledge so that all teachers feel confident about leading modern language learning and providing exciting and engaging experiences for our pupils.  \r\n\r\nA number of the staff in this application are either new to this school or new to teaching. Both this group of teachers and more established or experienced staff have identified the need to develop their language skills in order to provide the best possible learning opportunities for the children in our classes. With such a range of staff, we naturally have very different experiences and levels of French or Spanish, but the immersion courses seem to all of us to be the best way of boosting our skills and confidence: visiting France or Spain, being fully immersed in a  programme of study with native speakers and experiencing the culture first-hand would be the most invaluable way of inspiring our learners back in the classroom.  Furthermore, we intend to share our experiences with our colleagues both at Lasswade and across the whole authority, in order to instil a real enthusiasm for teaching and learning modern languages.\r\n\r\nIn its publication \"Modern Languages: Principles and Practice\", the Scottish Government recognises that young people learning a modern language is an important factor in our nation\u2019s prosperity. We therefore have a duty as teachers to enable children to develop the skills they will need in the new Europe and in the global marketplace by planning a wide and rich range of learning activities in modern languages. We see our participation in this project as an essential step towards the young people we teach becoming successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens.", "http://lasswade.mgfl.net/", "Lasswade Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036001_coordinator"], ["2NZ", "Language Training", "Hawthornden Primary", 7553.0, "The application is for 4 primary teachers to take part in one of the immersion courses taking place in France in Summer 2017/ Easter 2018. The application is for two early years teacher and two teachers from middle / upper school.  Our four teachers in this application have varying levels and experiences of the French language.   Therefore, we consider that our participation in the course will allow all four teachers to increase their French language capacity, knowledge, skills and confidence in a native environment.  The immersion course will support our teachers to achieve the Scottish Government's 1+2 Initiative: to provide children with an opportunity to learn a European language from P1.  The hands on experience in an authentic environment will provide the teachers with the confidence and ability to embed the French language in their everyday teaching.  We know from teacher's previous experience that the immersion course is a very relevant, meaningful and valuable CLPL experience.  Their enthusiasm and experience on return to school will greatly benefit our children.\r\n\r\nTeachers on the immersion course will have the opportunity to learn the French language with native speakers, experience the French culture first hand and develop new teaching ideas and materials. The course will allow our pupils to use ICT to communicate with other schools in Europe.  During the course the teachers will be able to experience and observe teaching of the French language from native experts.  The course will provide all teaching staff and pupils with an insight into the French lifestyle and culture which will hopefully inspire and encourage them to seek opportunities to explore and experience other countries in Europe.  The course provides the opportunity to network with other professionals from the UK and France to share resources, ideas and good practice. \r\n\r\nAll of this will have a positive impact for our ongoing development plan for 1+2 Languages in our school and for our development plan within our cluster schools.  This in turn will help to raise attainment in the French language and encourage our pupils to select European languages at secondary school.", null, "Hawthornden Primary", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036014_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EH19"}
