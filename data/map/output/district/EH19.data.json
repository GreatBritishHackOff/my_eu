An EU initiative is developing cutting-edge water treatment technology that will supply clean and safe drinking water.", "The lack of efficient and reliable water supply systems leads to bacteria in surface water and widespread heavy metal contaminants such as arsenic in groundwater. These major health concerns affect nearly the entire rural population and about one third of urban homes in India.\n\nThanks to the EU-funded 'Energy-efficient, community-based water- and wastewater-treatment systems for deployment in India' (http://www.eco-india.eu (ECO-INDIA)) project, European and Indian researchers are seeking sustainable, innovative, environmentally friendly and cost-effective solutions for India's water-scarce and contaminated regions.\n\nProject efforts are focused on supplying clean, safe drinking water and treating wastewater at a rural community pilot site with no treatment method in place.\n\nResearchers found high concentrations of arsenic when they tested the site's surface water ponds and groundwater tube wells. Water filtering, water disinfection and online monitoring systems have been installed and will be tested to bring the site's water quality to desired levels.\n\nThe technology for advanced filtration and disinfection of drinking water supplies from ponds and tube wells is expected to be 100 times more efficient than chlorine bleach. It will also enhance the properties of drinking water by eliminating 30\u00a0% more waste. The online model will enable remote early warning detection and monitoring of water quality.\n\nThis integrated system for water filtration, disinfection and online monitoring will be based on solar power. A feasibility study has been carried out to assess energy harvesting through biogas from wastewater.\n\nECO-INDIA is poised to deliver cost- and energy-efficient drinking water. The health and well-being of entire community and village populations throughout India stand to benefit.", null, "http://www.drydenaqua.com/", "/docs/results/images/2015/153603.jpg", "fp7_104293_954250305"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EH19"}
