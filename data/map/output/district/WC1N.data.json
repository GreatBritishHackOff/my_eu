Large-scale disaster situations causing mass casualty incidents are characterised by large numbers of same-type injuries which require immediate and simultaneous medical intervention and means of support such as ambulances, surgeries, specialists, diagnostic equipment and others.\nThese characteristics underline the need for enhanced communication between medical institutions and other organisations involved in disaster management. At the same time, the surge of demand for services to patients points to the need for better organisation within hospitals concerning the deployment of specialists and the availability of medical supplies, transportation, rooms and equipment.\n\nWhile a variety of incidents may necessitate an emergency response, different types of such incidents (natural disasters, explosions, humanitarian crises and others) mean a different framework for responders. While health responders are ubiquitous in their involvement with the response to an emergency situation, the parameters regarding how they are involved greatly differ with the type of threat represented.\n\nThe COncORDE project will develop a Decision Support System (DSS) to improve preparedness and interoperability of medical services during an emergency which affects the health of the population at local, regional or cross-border level.

The lack of uniform requirements for defining, detecting and recording suicidality and the presence of disease related confounders create major problems. It is possible that Medication-Related Suicidality (MRS) differs from Psychopathology-Related Suicidality (PRS) in terms of phenomenology, clinical expression and time course, and may vary between children and adults. Unlike PRS, the time-course of MRS may be associated with possible differences in drug pharmacokinetics; abrupt onset; absence of suicidality prior to start of medication; and emergence of suicidality related co-morbidities after treatment.\nThis proposal will focus on developing a web-based comprehensive methodology for the assessment and monitoring of suicidality and its mediators in children and adolescents using the HealthTrackerTM (a paediatric web-based health outcome monitoring system), with the aim of developing a Suicidality Assessment and Monitoring Module, a Bio-psycho-social Mediators of Suicidality Assessment Module, and a Suicidality-Related Psychiatric and Physical Illness Module. The information obtained will be used to computer-generate classification of suicidality using the Classification of Suicide-Related Thoughts and Behaviour (Silverman et al, 2007) and the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicidal Assessment (C-CASA) (Posner et al, 2007). The existing Medication Characteristics Module will be expanded to allow documentation of pharmacological characteristics of medication, to explore whether they mediate MRS. The methodology will then be tested in 3 paediatric observational trials (risperidone in conduct disorder; fluoxetine in depression, and montelukast in bronchial asthma) and standardized, which can be used pharmacovigilance and in epidemiological, observational, and registration trials.", 70533.0, 3110783.0, "STOP", "Title: Finding the link between drugs and suicidal thinking", "Detecting suicidal tendencies in children and adolescents on medications can be challenging.

The recommended treatment consists in regular blood transfusions combined with chelating therapy to remove harmful iron accumulation in the body. The use of deferoxamine, the first chelating agent only available for subcutaneous administration  is limited due to toxicity and the lack of compliance, despite its satisfactory therapeutic effects. An oral iron chelating agent, deferiprone, was authorised in Europe in August 1999 and recommended for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassaemia major when deferoxamine is contraindicated or inadequate. Despite a wide experience of the administration of deferiprone for thalassaemic patients, limited data are available on its use in children below 10 years and the need for additional data in this age subset was clearly indicated  in the 2009 priority list approved by the Paediatric Committee at the European Medicines Agency (PDCO). In addition, according to the recent scientific advancements and in consideration of the anticipated benefit of this chelator in controlling cardiac iron overload, studies  evaluating the effects of the deferiprone in all the paediatric ages and in all transfusion-dependent chronic congenital anaemia (including Sickle Cell Diseases)  were also considered a critical therapeutic need.\nThe DEEP project, in line with these premises, has been funded with the specific aim to produce a new oral liquid formulation of deferiprone suitable for the paediatric use and to provide evidences for the use of this chelator as first line therapy in the whole paediatric population  (from 1 month to 18 years) affected by transfusion-dependent chronic anaemia.\nThe condition under study  in the DEEP project is rare.

Loss of dystrophin leads to inflammation and replacement of muscle with fibrous tissue.\n\nDespite prenatal diagnosis, the incidence of DMD is 1 in 5 000 births due to novel mutations that arise in the dystrophin gene. The dystrophin gene is one of the largest known, with 79 different protein-coding regions referred to as exons. Mutations in one of these exons interfere with the rest of the gene being put together and producing a functional protein.\n\nIn Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), DMD mutations still produce a shortened but functional dystrophin protein, and most patients are able to walk and have a normal lifespan. This occurs because although some exons are missing, the remaining can join together.\n\nBased on this observation, scientists have developed a method known as exon skipping, which essentially encourages the cellular machinery to skip the mutated exon. For this purpose, they are using oligonucleotides as molecular patches to produce the shorter version of the dystrophin protein.\n\nPrior work by the members of the EU-funded http://www.skip-nmd.eu/ (SKIP-NMD) consortium successfully demonstrated the therapeutic outcome of skipping exon 51 in clinical trials with boys with DMD.

It implies the exchange of concrete techniques and formats for arts-based workshops that have been proven relevant and effective in our work. These formats of adult education include screen printing, theater, costume performance and music workshops, which are especially apt for creating a sense of one-self and experiences of expressing ones personality in public. These techniques are designed to represent low-barrier learning experiences, suitable also for\u00a0 learners with limited formal education experience. \r\nThese workshop formats represent low-cost, \"DIY\" forms of social work that grass-root organizations, with limited economic resources, can apply. SATB Internal and public meetings with invited target group specialists, seek to promote the discussion on the issues of homelessness, migration, gender and LGBTI rights and how to design projects that address the intersectionality of such experiences of marginalization, creating safe spaces whilst maintaining the open character of our initiatives. \r\nProject results will include: transfer of knowledge and capacities across the organizations, as well as concrete activities in which our target groups will be engaged in new workshop formats aimed at self empowerment, a sense of self and self worth; production of educational media in the forms of\u00a0 3 online audiovideo tutorials and finally, 4 x public art expositions\u00a0produced together with the target groups in Berlin, London and Marseille.\u00a0\r\nSATB comprises of 3 initiatives with distinct yet overlapping target groups.The Berlin collective Czentrifuga employs art and specifically screen printing, as a form of learning experience geared towards homeless and socially marginalised people, many of whom are wide removed from any formal educational context.
