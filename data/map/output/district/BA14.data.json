Development of Europass certificates and review of CV for students and staff.\r\n- Dissemination, project evaluation and impact by developing a survey to gather feedback from students and the participating staff mobility to be used to reprogram and center more accurately other mobility initiatives\r\nThere is no change of purpose than envisaged in the strategy of internationalization. Primary goal is to improve the professional skills, language and key to all the participants. Secondary objective is to improve the practices and the educational offer of the school.\r\nIt confirms both the learning objectives for individuals and for the Institute strategies and its international partners. The numbers of participants in mobility have been expanded: 80 students and 7 staff.\r\nIt was predicted 5 leaders (1 for flow) for 10 days to facilitate the insertion of the students in the company and especially to facilitate their first contact with the international environment and intercultural aspects, according with new styles and customs.", "http://www.interneurope.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005744_6"], ["8EA", "E +  = DRUMUL CTERR SPRE VIITOR", "Intern Europe Ltd", 70069.0, "Remus Radulet Vocational College carries out vocational training in Romanian, Hungarian and German mother tongues, (technological high school and vocational school) in the field of automation, electrical engineering and mechatronics. The mobilities of Erasmus +, using European instruments for professional skills recognition,ECVET and Europass will change the perception towards education and professional training, will draw students to CTERR. The mobilities  increased the prestige of the school in the area, on a national and international level. Through students\u2019 and VET specialists\u2019 mobilities, the education and professional training will aquire a bigger opening towards studying results, it will be more attractive and relevant. Moreover, the opportunity for social insertion will increase, both on a national and European level. Considering these objectives for 2017 round, according to Charta VET, we target three types of activities (VET learners traineeships in vocational institutes abroad, in companies abroad and Staff training abroad) in four flows: \r\nFor students:\r\n1. Internship training  at Kossuth Lajos Technical College in Gyor, Hungary with a practice period in the company (10 students - 60 hours). The objective is acquiring new practical competences in carrying out electronic circuits, using an electronic platform NI ELVIS II, according to the curriculum for the XI-th grade, Technician in automation, electrical engineering and mecatronics.  The practical activities will last 60 hours and focus on module\u2019Electronic circuits\u2019. In those 60 hours which will be evaluated and validated as a period of initial training, the participants will develop main competence units: the identification of electronic circuit types, evaluating the performance of the electronic circuits, connecting electronic circuits in equipments and installations (according to SPP, Annex 4, OMENCS, 4121/13.06.2016, Automation and electrical power installation technician level 4. ). The students will obtain marks for module IX.\r\n2. Training internship in a company having as main objective to facilitate students\u2019 transfer from school to active life through work experience in National Instruments company from Debrecen (10 students \u2013 90 hours). The work experience will be achieved according to the curriculum for the XI-th grade, Technician in automation, electrical engineering and mecatronics. The 90 hours of training will comprise: \u2018Electronic circuits\u2019 (66 hours), \u2018Electric circuits\u2019 (9 hours), \u2018Measuring techniques in the field\u2019 (15 hours).  The main training activities will be connected to  the electronic manufacturing process in electronics and automation. The participants will develop the following main relevant skills: identification of electronic circuit types, evaluating the performance of the electronic circuits, connecting electronic circuits in equipments and installations,  carrying out DC and AC circuits, using measurement techniques for determining and monitoring the technical data specific in industry  (according to SPP, Annex 4, OMENCS, 4121/13.06.2016, Automation and electrical power installation technician level 4.).The training will be evaluated and validated  as a vocational training period. The students will obtain marks for this module.\r\n3. Work placements at small and medium-sized entreprises coordinated by AVANTAGES  organization, Portsmuth, UK. The objective is  the reinforcement of the vocational competences acquired in the initial training, through work experience. The 120 hour internship of the 10 graduates will familiarize them with the requirements of the British companies and labour market, acquiring new linguistic and intercultural competences.  AVANTAGES( partner in previous CTERR  projects) will create a bond between CTERR and the British employers, ensuring the mutual trust for both parties. The identified companies interested in receiving trainees would be: COUNTY ELECTRICIANS LTD , DEMARCO ELECTRICAL, AVON ELECTRICAL, INFONET MEDIA, NORDIKO TECHNICAL, K-ELECTRONICS, NETSERVE LTD, ELMDENE, EBM, BENHAMS.  \r\nFor staff:\r\n1. Staff training abroad  through work two weeks, placement for 3 engineers teaching VET. The objective is learning innovative teaching approaches in VET subjects by acquiring work competences with NI equipment during 80 hours(two weeks) for 3 engineers at NI Debrecen, Hungary.\r\n The skills and competences acquired will be found in Europass Mobility for all the participants in the above mentioned mobilities.\r\nCTERR  will continue the dissemination strategy and the efforts to attract graduates.  If the graduates will not be present at the selections , we will send students from the XI and XII grade. We presume that the majority of the  XIth graders from the target group will be underage. In two flows two accompanying persons will be necessary.
