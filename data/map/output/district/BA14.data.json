The economic sectors most represented within the province are agriculture, construction and services. The industry is centered mostly in the forest wealth of the province (wood and resin). In addition, Cuenca has 1 Business Park and 3 Industrial Estates.\r\n\r\nThe reason that the City Council decided to promote this initiative is due to the worrying situation which the city finds itself in, due to unemployment which is currently made more urgent due the economic crisis which we are experiencing. Cuenca is facing a stage in which the migration rate has reached 28.8% since the crisis began. This has meant that the town council of Cuenca is ready to do everything in its power to help alleviate the discontented situation which the city is experiencing. One of these initiatives is through the CUENCA PLUS project, which supports the economic and social development of the municipality through quality education and training.\r\n\r\nAccording to studies conducted by their own City Council, the causes of unemployment and the subsequent migration of young people from the town are due to many factors including: the failure of the education system with a high dropout rate, inadequate employment policies, the existing widespread discontent in the town and the lack of expertise of young people. That is why the City Council has decided to give a boost to the educational system of the municipality, by reinforcing and supplementing it with periods of practical training in companies in other EU countries, which mean further improvement upon the current intermediate level training and training employment.\r\n\r\nThe town council of Cuenca has suggested to 3 local institutions the creation of a Consortium formed by the City Council of Cuenca, IES Pedro Mercedes, IES San Jos\u00e9 and CEOE CEPYME Cuenca to assist in the development of the CUENCA PLUS project.\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed at 25 young people at intermediate level who are pursuing their final year or who are undertaking a course of preparation for employment leading to a Certificate of Competence.

The participants will receive online linguistic support, except those who go to Portugal who have an assigned quantity of money for an intensive course, 1 week in duration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPLEAMOS has focused on a group on young people in which it has detected some particular shortcomings which make getting a job difficult for them and which could however be supplemented with a program like that which is proposed from EMPESA. This group is characterised by having hardly any work experience, by having a lack of practical training which gives them a certain specialisation after the theoretical training received, by not having mobility experience, national or abroad, which provides them with a greater overview of the labour market, by not possessing a sufficient language level in a market which is demanding at least the knowledge of a language as a prerequisite sine qua non, by having a lack of initiative spirit, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will give out the bursaries in a balanced way between the sending partners, which will have 2 participants per institution, including EMPESA and IMEPE.

In spite of this, nationally the area receives only 22% of investment and employment is in decline. Thus we can see that agriculture remains a sector characterized by light and shade, the lack of people specialized in agriculture and the cultivation of high quality food products as well as the widespread reluctance to approach and develop the agricutlural sector due to the lack of knowledge regarding the employment potential of this sector. In recent decades these issues this have contributed to people abandonning agricultural land and a reduction of the area of utilized land. Moreover only 5% of the land in the South is currently being used to cultivate high quality products. \r\nItaly has always distinguished itself for its agricultural richness, variety and quality. Today there are 268 products with regional and geographic protection which puts Italy at the forefront of the EU in terms of agriculture. This agricultural wealth creates value from a cultural, economic and social perspective esepcially when one considers gastrotourism which contributes to awareness and enthusiasm for Italian products abroad and assists in developing disadvantaged areas which produce high quality products. The DOP, IGP and STG labels which indicate geographic protection of agricultural products also make up a significant part of Italian food production and also encourage competition in local agricultural contexts. \r\nFrom this analysis, the dea for the project High Quality was born, a project which primarily offers the opportunity to new graduates in agricultural subjects to complete training in the agricultural sector in a European context. This opportunity will develop and foster the competitiveness of the agricultural producers of the future and better prepare them for the commerical challenges which lay ahead in their career. Indeed the most powerful weapon available to farmers in the EU is the quality of their products and for that reason the hosting organizations are producers of top quality products, allowing graduates to learn from the best. \r\nThe overall objective of the project is to create qualified professionals able to import and contextualize best practices in food production to their territory and furthermore spread these good practices in the cultivation of DOP, IGP and STG products thereby promoting a sense of initiative and entrepreneurship in the sector.\r\nSpecific Objectives:\r\n- Provide work experience that allows participants to learn the techniques and dynamics of crop production;\r\n- Stimulate the creation of new farms which produce quality products from the central and southern regions;\r\n- Introduce into the world of farming 100 new operators/people with a clear professional profile in agri-food sector.\r\nThe project High Quality has been promoted and proposed by the Technical training school M. Buonarroti which is situated in the territory of Caserta as a training centre for people in the agricultural sector and has been supported by the Department of Industrial Engineering and I.T. at the Second University of Naples.

The project is important for the college, staff and student development in that it- increases the interest in European languages other than English at the colleges, such as Spanish and Polish in the areas of hospitality and catering and pre-school education- provides childcare students and trainees from the Hospitality and Catering Dept. with the opportunity to practise and improve their English in the UK- enables teaching staff to participate in job-shadowing visits which expands the network of contacts to other EU colleges which promotes the European dimension in the college and its curricula- places a strong focus on the professional development of the language and subject tutors in that they gain experience through job shadowing and training courses in their respective subjects such as Spanish, ICT, childcare and diversity education- motivates teachers and other college departments that are not yet active in EU projects to support the EU Project Management Team in organising and carrying out projects inside and outside the classroom.Six students from an A-level course ending with a vocational qualification in childcare and education (Berufliches Gymnasium) will complete a two-week work placement at a childcare centre in Leeds. A further six students will complete a two-week work placement in a nursery school in Glasgow, while three students will have the opportunity to work for a fortnight at a school for pupils with disabilities in the same city. Six apprentices from the department of hospitality and catering will complete a two-week work placement in a hotel or restaurantin Pembroke, Wales or Glasgow, Scotland, while six trainees from the same department will have the opportunity to  expand their existing professional competences while working at the Alexander the Great Beach Hotel in Greece. Both groups of learners will have the opportunity to improve, adapt or attain knowledge, attitudes and skills in each of the followingareas:- reflect upon vocational training/working conditions of early learning practitioners, teaching staff at schools for disabled pupils or hotel/restaurant staff in another country- gain insight into the professional mentality of practitioners and hotel/restaurant staff in another country- re-evaluate their own opinions about the relevance of the European Union on a personal and vocational level- learn to adapt to a new hierarchy in the hosting childcare centre in the UK or hotel/restaurant in the UK or Greece- expand their knowledge of methodology and pedagogics in early learning or in diversity education in the UK or of hotel and restaurant management in the UK or Greece- act as ambassadors for Germany and the German language.Thirteen members of KKBKHA staff will participate in job shadowing visits to England, Wales, Scotland, Greece, Poland and Spain.

Our main intention is to provide Erasmus exchanges  with high quality and high outcome for the participants.  \r\n\r\nIn vocational education we apply for both EUX students and students in ordinary vocational education, basic course and main course.  In some of the educations we apply for a 2-week mobility - and in others for a 3-week mobility.

It's a highly prioritated effort in the future years, as we want more young students to experience a stay in another European country during their education.

During their mobility they will develop important personal and social competencies, but they will also be challenged in professional skills and benefit from inspiration for future education and worklife.\r\nFor students and teachers it is a good opportunity to obtain insight and knowledge according to management, learning and professional competencies.
