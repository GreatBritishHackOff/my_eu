The riblets reduce significantly the drag characteristics under turbulent air flow. Each riblet is spaced 96\u00b5m apart and will achieve a sharp angular tip angle of 45 degrees. The depth of the riblet will be set at 48\u00b5m. A single riblet geometry seamless master mould (giant master). The consortium partners have joined together to create a combined level of unique expertise capable of manufacturing the precision quality essential for master mould manufacture.\nThe project will engineer and produce CAD-CAM designs for large format master mould or flat shim origination. These will be used to program a state of the art Excimer laser that will write a continuous negative riblet structure onto a polymer sheet. This large format polymer master will be silvered and placed into electroforming tanks to grow a nickel master shim. A series of sub masters and production shims will be grown from the metal master, to deliver metal master mould with dimensions of 1250 x 1250mm.\nIn addition a feasibility study to include sample welds will be undertaken to demonstrate how shims can be welded together to create nominally joinless and seamless shims.", 23370.0, 279639.0, "Riblet", null, null, null, null, "http://www.axesstechnologies.com", null, "fp7_108808_953135775"], ["6PH", "European Bus System of the Future 2", "Trapeze Its Uk Ltd", "'The objective of the EBSF_2 project is to validate different innovative solutions that combine efficiency of the bus system with more attractiveness. \nSuch solutions are meant to represent the most innovative in the areas indicated by the Call: the project will proceed to their final validation before their introduction in the market, avoiding pure simulations or large use of prototypes. \nFollowing the System Approach, and with the participation of representatives of all key stakeholders categories, these activities will be introduced by the identification of innovation requirements (that will drive the impact assessment), the update of the Bus System Definition (as defined in EBSF). \nIn addition to the impact analysis of the single solutions, the effect of combining key introduction will be evaluated. \nThe 'European Bus System of the Future' Roadmap will be updated with areas for further research and priorities linked to the project topics.", 61997.0, 10159073.0, "EBSF_2", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_193395_937030574"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["8JN", "ERDF Technical Assistance \u2013 Wiltshire and Swindon", "Wiltshire Council", "The project is the formation of a small technical assistance team to ensure publicity and promotion of EU SIF opportunities is undertaken across the LEP area  and to advise and support under-represented sectors to apply to the programme.", "ERDF", 168000.0, 336000.0, "erdf_england_454"], ["8JN", "Porton Science Incubator", "Wiltshire Council", "The project comprises the first phase of development at Porton Science Park.
