During and after the trilateral exchange in Poland, communication has been maintained and resulted in this proposal.  An advanced planning visit will be arranged in June 2015 when all parties will discuss and take the plans forward.  It is intended that the format of the exchange will be finalised then.  Open dialogue about the programme has been an ongoing process.\r\n\r\nThe theme for the exchange is European Citizenship and Social Inclusion, and the changes that affect young people within each country.

They will be introduced gradually to games and exercises designed to stimulate discussion about national identity, European citizenship and integration and they will be given increased responsibility for peer leading within workshop sessions. Youth workers will support the group to draw out and analyse points that they raise naturally through their group discussions. During the planned discussion workshops in the Youth Exchange, participants will discuss their knowledge and perception about their counterpart and also compare and contrast their ideas about Europe as a multicultural continent. These sessions will develop their understanding of National and European identity and challenge their ideas about society and culture. They will learn tolerance and respect for other cultures and identify ways of overcoming barriers to living together. During the workshop sessions they will develop their creativity, communication and presentation skills, abstract thinking and their ability to present their ideas through live discussions. During the cultural visits and traditional activities they will learn about cultures within and outside Europe and improve their understanding  of cultural diversity. Outdoor and indoor activities such as frisky-golf, swimming, football, basketball, skating, and fishing are traditional Finnish activities which will support the young people to work as a team and build confidence and trust within the group. \r\n\r\nIntended Outcomes\r\n\u2022 The minority young people will develop an awareness of different cultures and that they are European citizens.\r\n\u2022 The participants will share a common understanding of youth issues through collaborative working.\r\n\u2022 The participants will learn new skills including: employability skills, social media skills, different langauges\r\nThe project will help to raise the self-esteem of participants by illustrating that their ccontributions are valued not only at home but also in a European Arena", null, null, "erasmus_2015-2-FI01-KA105-009156_3"], ["4AU", "Citizenship for All: no one is left behind", "Integrated Services for Displaced Population UK", 19954.0, "The theme for the exchange is European Citizenship and Social Inclusion, and the changes that affect young people within each country.
