Other non-wood plant waste, used nowadays in the pulp production, will be also considered as alternative sugar source in this project.\nIn comparison with previous projects to obtain biopolymers from different sources, the main innovation in BRIGIT is the use of an existing sugar-rich waste stream and the process integration with the existing industrial operation, that will permit an overall reduction in resource consumption and in greenhouse gas emissions and a dramatic reduction of operational costs due to the use of non-sterile steps, without the need of intermediate discontinuous bioreactors and avoiding waste transport.\nBRIGIT aims to develop bio-based composites for high-tech fire-resistant applications. The use of these biopolymers in combination with natural fabrics (flax, hemp,...) will be mainly in the passenger and goods transport sector (aeronautics, train, buses, shipping, trucks,..) as an alternative to 3D sandwich panels made from thermoset resins reinforced with continuous glass fibres with high fire resistance.

Distraction and technology are having a fundamental impact on our lives, creating a deep disconnection from our internal intelligence. The film explores how people are looking to ancient cultures, the arts and nature to reconnect within. The filmmakers find examples from the present and stories from the past, a variety of options for the viewer to reconnect with themselves and the world around them. The evolution of our brain over thousands of years, combined with the distractions of modern life, show how we might be developing an alarmingly narrow-minded view of the world today. Ironically, we are at once outwardly focused and yet lacking in deep connection to the world around us. How does that adversely affect individuals and society?  In what ways can we reconnect to access our own humanity and use our full potential? Searching for this missing link, the film follows Shylo, the main protagonist an eight-year-old boy, and Lori, vice president of a global media company, in her early 40s.
