Forestry and sea power became inextricably linked, creating new geopolitical tensions, alliances and forest regulations. Key questions in this context are: could Iberian forest resources sustain the increasing demand of sound timber, or was the wood imported from elsewhere? If so, how were the trade networks organized? And did the lack of raw material force the technological changes occurred in shipbuilding in the 16th century, or were they a result of exchange between Mediterranean and Atlantic shipbuilding traditions?

As a unique specialized art school with a long tradition we realize the necessity to respond to the ever-changing job market  demands and to our position in the society\u2022Our school\u2019s success depends on our teachers\u2019 capacities, their chance to learn and share during active exchanges and their ability to pass their expertise to their students. It is not sufficient any more to have school full of students excelling in theory. To achieve high level of expertise we must teach theory by maximum amount of practiceAny practice in the field of study is priceless, and to get practical experience abroad is a bonus as it extends language skills, personal independence, and the ability to break through which is especially important for art schools. Besides the practical skills the students also get many impulses which boost their natural creativity, they learn to apply the latest ICT tools, for their personal need and their specialization.During all the activities key competencies and interdisciplinary themes are supported to link up the skills, competencies and attitudes\u2022As our school specializes in art and as we want to create conditions to support individuality and personal qualities of each student we sent only small groups of 2\u20134 people abroadActivity A1: 26 students (major /minor, girls/boys)+4 accompanying adults. Secondary school of clothing - technical branch and two clothing design branches and its presentation (11+4 participants)College of Fashion Design (15 participants)Activity A2:3 experienced teachers of Secondary School and College who will present their specialized subjects in the language of receiving organization and in English. We expect distinct increase of international awareness of our school\u2019s competence.We focus on teamwork and increasing of cultural awareness by means of international collaboration of schoolsActivity A3: 5 teachers of Secondary School and College (both starting and experienced) who will increase their specialized competencies at the receiving organization by observing education of special subjects of our partner schools abroad. This should result in implementation of new educational methods, innovation of the existing ones, new study materials, new impulses for teaching.The teachers will learn the ECVET evaluation and the partner\u2019s knowhow and they will use it for the purposes of our school. \u2022For the A1 activity we plan 14 days residency at schools with similar syllabusThe fundamental activities for A1\u2013specific for each destination, according to the specifications of the participants (based on the questionnaire,CV,a letter of motivation) are: - completed fashion outfit by the selected inspiration (practical realization in real conditions of a practice) - professional designer\u2019s book of inspiration (artistic presentation using ICT) - fulfillment of a given assignment evaluated by the ECVET- learning about the specialized education abroad, its course, evaluation and prospects at the job market - individual web presentation of the project. Exhibition of works inspired and realized in connection with the residency, school work - individual and group presentation of the outfit at fashion show (public presentation of the residency impact on the professional development) We\u2019ve agreed with all the partners on realization of European certification and validation of the mobility results by means of the ECVET system, Europass mobility and individual Certification of each organization. In all the activities the development of language skills and competencies will be accounted for\u2022To fulfill all the tasks of the project, strong focus will lie on the selection and systematic preparation of the participants in all the activities to achieve quality output which would enable easy but valuable dissemination of the project\u2019s results both at our school and among our international partners.

The main aim of the club's Academy is to scout and develop players who will potentially reach professional status. However, regardless of the level of success achieved in football, Apprentices receive advice and education that provide a solid platform from which they can move forward and make sound decisions in life. The framework for this education is the Advanced Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (AASE) programme, a unique sporting vocational qualification for young people with the realistic potential to achieve excellence in sport. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this project is to enhance and improve the vocational training and development of Apprentices at SFC. Working with host partner Hotel Touring in Italy, the project will also aim to provide greater exit and progression opportunities for Apprentices upon completion of the programme. The project will have 3 overarching strategic objectives: \r\n\r\n1. Facilitating the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into both the SFC Academy programme and Apprentices.\r\n\r\n2. Exposing the Apprentices to the European opportunities in both sport and other careers so these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.\r\n\r\n3. Embedding Lifelong Learning Principles into the training and development programme and working cultures in order to equip Apprentices with the aptitude and skills to pursue employment, either within sport or outside of it, throughout their career.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nParticipants will be the circa 24 (male) Apprentices undertaking the SFC AASE programme in the 2018/19 football season (i.e. the 2017 and 2018 cohorts). These Apprentices are selected primarily on the basis of their football ability and therefore incorporate a wide range of academic abilities, socioeconomic circumstances and ethnic backgrounds.\r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe majority of the project activities will take place at the Hotel Touring facility, including:\r\n- Regular training sessions to address the defined sports performance targets. \r\n- Games versus high quality Italian youth teams.\r\n- Daily feedback and evaluation sessions to confirm goal setting/reflection.\r\n\r\nHotel Touring will use its links at a local, regional and national level to enable SFC to enhance the project activities.

Successful introduction of this standard into the training programs is the primary aim of any organisation related to adult education in the field of Offshore water industry regardless the location thereof. Therefore successful elaboration and introduction of OPITO adult non-formal education standards in the educational process is connected not only with fulfilment of technical and legal requirements, but primarily with personal professional abilities of Novikontas training centre teaching personnel to implement innovations in their work and in the process of education. Furthermore, the opportunities of Erasmus+, staff self-implementation ambitions of Novikontas training centre, capacity and vision on European maritime adult education training centre cooperation have determined the new Novikontas training centre development stage.
