This is not the case for Electromagnetic Compatibility between rail vehicle and installed track circuits, which represents one of the major cost drivers in the authorisation process. Indeed each country has developed its own requirements and assessment process \u2013 in many cases on an empirical basis and/or not even written down.\nThe EUREMCO objective is to harmonise and reduce the certification process of rail vehicle against Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC). The main concept of the project is to specify the conditions for cross-accepted certification all around Europe, through sound scientific methodologies allowing for the identification of the \u201ctransfer functions\u201d to be applied to results obtained on different test tracks in different countries, for the same power supply system. For this purpose, a common understanding of transients \u2013 very short and very high interference currents \u2013and a harmonized test procedure will be also developed. By addressing also non electrified lines, the EUREMCO project will cover the whole European railway network.\nBy closing the corresponding \u201copen points\u201d in the TSIs, the EUREMCO project will lead to a time and cost reduction of the certification process of rail vehicle against Electromagnetic Compatibility issues, which correspond to an estimated saving of \u20ac60m for the next 15 years.", 147707.0, 3057274.0, "EUREMCO", null, null, null, null, "http://www.bombardier.com", null, "fp7_100605_998543512"], ["8AD", "INtegrated European Signalling System", "Bombardier Transportation Uk Ltd", "Due to the seamless guidance by rails, the railway system requires a dedicated signalling sub-system, whereby a major part of the functionality must be ensured and controlled on the infrastructure side.

Also the implementation of systems utilising centralised and automated route-setting of trains will be economically constrained.Railways are aiming for significantly reduced life-cycle costs of future interlocking and associated outdoor equipment. Standardisation, increased competitive tendering and significant reduction of implementation time are considered to be key requirements for the future.Without an approach, similar to that underway for ERTMS-ETCS, many suppliers will run into resource constraints, making it difficult for them to keep up with the many new concurrent developments.Therefore, railways and the signalling supply industry agree that the scope of INESS should be the interlocking up to the point of interfaces with the surrounding other signalling and train control systems like centralised traffic control, neighbouring interlocking, ETCS Radio-block centres and possibly object controllers for out-door devices.INESS will adopt the CENELEC norm with the underlying system engineering principles.

Together, key railway actors worked on articulating specifications for new interlocking systems and reducing the life-cycle cost (LCC) of signalling systems. The EU-funded project 'Integrated European signalling system' (INESS) took up the challenge to streamline railway operation, enhance safety and contribute to implementing the ERTMS.\n\nBuilding on the research of a similar previous project, EuroInterLocking, the project team mapped the value chain of interlocking systems and defined a new data model, including needed adaptations and applicability. It completed reports on a life-cycle\u2013based cost model for interlocking systems, market-specific cost drivers, and cost-saving potential within the interlocking life-cycle.\n\nIn terms of generic needs for new generation interlocking systems, the team mapped necessary requirements and interfaces to produce a strategy for verification and validation. It then studied safety constraints related to the interfaces and proposed one of several harmonised structures, outlining viable migration strategies to the new system.\n\nAmong the project's greatest achievements was defining how the system should be implemented. The new strategy was based on transferring relevant railway data to industry stakeholders in order to configure an INESS interlocking-specific application, a model dubbed European Unified Description of Railway Infrastructure (EUDRI). INESS also published a handbook on best practices for testing the interlocking system and developed an open source software support tool to reduce time and money in signalling while enhancing safety.\n\nAll these valuable initiatives and efforts have been detailed in around 100 deliverables that can be accessed on the project's website. In parallel, the International Union of Railways (UIC) produced a final technical report on the project's results and made it available to the public, paving the way for harmonised signalling and interlocking systems.

Engines are run with safety margin in order to safeguard components against mechanical failure. Consequently, they are not run at their most optimal, which impacts overall efficiency. For example, a 10C uncertainty on turbine entry temperature changes the specific fuel consumption by 0.2%. Also a 0.2mm change in turbine tip clearance changes the specific fuel consumption by 0.4%. It is believed that with better sensing techniques, in excess of 500,000 tonnes of kerosene could be saved per annum, which equates to a CO2 saving of over 1.5 millions tonnes.

Their low weight, along with their inherent resistance to corrosion and fatigue, enables more fuel efficient and sustainable transport structures. However, for many applications, the biggest factor currently preventing the more widespread use of light high-performance polymer matrix composites is their poor fire performance. This is due to the organic matrices, which first soften on heating, causing a loss of mechanical properties and then, at higher temperatures, decompose. Decomposition results in the production of smoke and toxic or flammable decomposition products. These products are not only hazardous in terms of lack of visibility and toxicity; they can also burn, releasing heat, which can lead to flame spread and exacerbate the fire. Furthermore, loaded composite structures often collapse in a fire within a period of minutes, depending on the magnitude of the load and heat flux. The overall aim of the project is to develop novel, cost-effective, high-performance, lightweight polymer matrix composites with a step-change improvement in fire behaviour. FIRE-RESIST will achieve this by carefully targeted research in five key areas: 1. Micro-layered structural materials that are designed to delaminate extensively when exposed to heat, thereby generating a multiplicity of internal interfaces that provide a fire barrier of exceptionally low thermal conductivity. 2.

Two promising epoxy resins were selected, manufactured and distributed to partners for the benchmarking process. The modelling was effective for both simple single-layer material and multi-layer laminates.\n\nPolymer matrix composites derived from natural cork core materials were studied and used to manufacture sandwich constructions.
