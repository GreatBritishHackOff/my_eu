There are currently 210 pupils on roll and 32 staff. The school is currently in its first year of introducing French as part of the requirements of the new National Curriculum. The capacity of staff is low and there is a great need for training to improve ability, understanding and confidence. \r\n\r\nWe have highlighted key areas of development:\r\n\r\n* Increase staff competency and confidence in their personal levels of French \r\n* Understand how to teach a foreign language to young learners\r\n* Link language learning to other areas of the curriculum\r\n* Develop the Europe Dimension and an understanding of what it means to be a European citizen;\r\n* Deepen cultural understanding of staff and children\r\n\r\nThe Senior Leadership Team (SLT) and the Board of Governors are fully supportive of the need to improve language learning throughout the school. They recognise the opportunity these immersion courses provide in terms of high quality CPD (Continuous Professional Development).\r\n\r\nWe plan to set up an Erasmus+ project giving staff the opportunity to develop their linguistic and teaching methodology skills through short immersion courses in France. Our project will take place over a period of 2 years and will involve 6 participants.\r\n\r\nEach team of participants will be tasked to develop an area of school development:\r\nTeam 1: Subject leadership and classroom activities\r\nTeam 2: Cross-curricular resources and activities\r\nTeam 3: Building sustainable links to ensure development of European Dimension\r\n\r\nThe impact of the project will be seen through the changed approach and visual of languages throughout the school. There will be an increased amount of enjoyment of languages from children and staff. Staff will have obtained new language skills which as a result will increase their job prospects. \r\n\r\nThe long term aim is to ignite a love of languages and culture in our children. They will long to continue to learn languages and they will possess a motivation to travel the world.", "http://www.stlukesoldham.co.uk", "St Lukes CE Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013015_coordinator"], ["6AA", "Mobility Coach ll", "The Oldham College", 166728.0, "\u201cMobiCoach II\u201c continually aims at enhancing the quality and quantity of mobility of our learners in Europe.  We would like to improve the international vocational competence of both \u2013 learners (IVT and dual system) and teachers. Due to the installation of so-called \u201cEuropean Classes\u201d in our IT and Design departments we itensify the integration of work placements abroad within the curricula of these IVT full time training courses. Therefore we offer unique educational opportunities at our vocational college und strengthen our profil in St\u00e4dteRegion Aachen.\r\n\r\nThe project is subdivided in three phases: during phase one we intensify the contact to our partner organisations. Ideally we can carry on organizing two responsible teachers for each partner organization who travel into the countries to develop the contacts. We plan a length of four days for these mobilities. Participating teachers heighten their knowledge about Initial Vocational Training, training courses, qualifications and curricular. In cooperation with their partners abroad they develop the Memorandum of understanding which serves as a basis for learning agreements. This process includes an ongoing comparison to our curricular with their learning objectives and competences. Thus we enhance the quality of work and learning phases and develop strong cooperating partnerships. The involved staffs increase the international vocational competence (language, intercultural competence) as well as organisational skills and qualify therefore as \u201cMobiCoaches\u201d. \r\n\r\nPhase two concentrates on organising and carrying out the placements. \r\nThe target groups are (in % the percentage of all applied mobilities): \r\n\r\n1. Apprentices/ learners in a company abroad with a duration of 14+2 = 16 days (16/ 10.4%)\r\n2. Apprentices/ learners in a company abroad with a duration of 21+2 =23 days (16/ 10.4 %)\r\n3. Apprentices/ learners in a company abroad with a duration of 30+2 = 32 days (4/ 2.6%)\r\n\r\n4. Apprentices/ learners in a school abroad with a duration of 21+2 =23 days (74/ 48%)\r\n5. Apprentices/ learners in a school abroad with a duration of 14+2 =16 days (4/ 2.6%)\r\n\r\n6. Teacher mobilities with a duration of 2+2=4 days (34/ 22%)\r\n7. Teacher mobilities with a duration of 6+2=8 days (2/ 1.3%)\r\n8. Teacher mobilities with a duration of 12+2=14 Tage (4/ 2.6%)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the IVT \"european classes\" in ICT and Graphic Design the mobilities will take place in their second year.  Having had good experiences we are planning three weeks. \u201cMobiCoaches\u201d support learners  to organize the working / learning period abroad beforehand and to stimulate learning agreements on the basis of the Memorandum of  understanding.  Again they accompany learners and take part at subject-matter specific classes of the partner institution (Job Shadowing) and/or visit the companies of their learners. They get to know teaching methods and participate actively in the didactic process. Learning agreements can be supervised and learners are supported to start their work / learning experience to enhance their international vocational compentence.\r\n\r\nPhase three includes comprehensive presentations (testimonials, videos) of the placement experiences and publishing the results. We present to staffs, learners and, very important, to the chambers of commerce and craft as the representatives of employers. This has been an excellent method to advertise our project and to enhance its acceptance. Subsequently we will increase the number of learners and trainees (dual system) participating in \u201cMobiCoach\u201d.  Moreover we will evaluate the placement experiences and assess the fulfilment of learning agreements to find out the need for development. The results of the evaluation serve as a basis for developing the Memorandum of understanding and future learning agreements.", "http://www.oldham.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003719_8"], ["7SE", "Nature is for all", "Oscar Nyoni", 14296.0, "This project arises from the need to break with several barriers. On the Canarian side, the barrier of insularity (to which is added the rural character of Artenara) that we have the young people of the interior of the island. On the Polish and British side, the barrier to live in the shadow of a large city without having enough economic resources to enjoy its advantages and opportunities. On the Swedish side, living the barrier of xenophobia suffered by immigrants and refugees and even their children.\r\n\r\nWe want to do activities with young people from other countries and we have found in the Canary Islands, UK, Poland and in Sweden groups of people who are already friends.
