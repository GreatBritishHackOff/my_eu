It is part of The Dunham Trust which consists of two academies, Acre Hall and Elmridge Primary School. The executive head teacher is a national leader of education and provides leadership to both academies.\r\n\r\nOur school\u2019s mission statement is: \u201cThey come this way only once so we should litter their pathways with quality experiences.\"\r\n\r\nWe are a growing school, we used to be one-form entry, now one and a half form entry and looking like we will be two form entry before long. We want to make sure that whatever ability our children are, and whatever their needs, the children are given a good quality, exciting education and we believe that having interesting and effective Spanish lessons and direct links with Spanish schools will make us stand out from other schools.\r\n\r\nWe plan to make the teaching of Spanish in our school a quality experience and use it as a way of broadening our pupils\u2019 experience and introducing them to different cultures and developing a lifelong love of language learning.\r\n\r\nWe intend to send 4 members of staff on an immersion course in Spain over a two year period, and our subject leader on two progressive  courses to further her development in order to become a more effective leader.\r\n\r\nThe training will mean that we are able to offer interesting and effective Spanish lessons, with more up to date language, resources and cultural references that will be more appropriate to our pupils\u2019 interests and mean that they are more engaged in language learning, enjoy Spanish and become more aware of other languages and cultures.\r\n\r\nThrough the course, we will create links with another Spanish school, increasing our internationalism and giving pupils more opportunities to practice their Spanish with native speakers and gain insights into a different culture. Participants will have the opportunity to visit the school in person which will offer them a unique insight into different approaches to teaching, allowing them to then look at their own practice from a different perspective. They will actively work towards developing good relationships and professional networks with the Spanish teachers to continue to share good practice.\r\n\r\nThrough increasing our linguistic and cultural activities, making best use of authentic resources and links with Spanish school, we will encourage positive attitudes towards language learning and other cultures. We will encourage pupils to view themselves as citizens of Europe and understand the opportunities potentially available to them within Europe and the wider world. \r\n\r\nThe international activities developed through the project will help us to achieve the higher level of the ISA.\r\n\r\nThrough this project we will focus on increasing the skills and capacity of our teaching staff to play a more active role in the teaching of Spanish thereby increasing our pupils\u2019 exposure to the language and improving their learning experience. Spanish will no longer be solely the area of the FLA. Our teachers know their own pupils and will be able to be more responsive to the individual needs of pupils. We want them to be much more actively involved in teaching Spanish, creating links with other curriculum subjects and drawing parallels with English to increase general understanding of languages and how they work, and show that foreign languages are not mysterious and difficult but rather follow patterns and have clear parallels with what they already know.\r\n\r\nWe want to begin to embed Spanish language and culture in our school and make it much a more visible part of our everyday life.\r\n\r\nWe will involve staff from almost all of the Key Stages within our school and from one of our small specialist classes. This means that each key stage will have someone who has experienced the training course in Spain and will be able to report back to their Key Stages and discuss what they have learned that is most relevant to them.\r\n\r\nThe key impacts of our project are expected to be an increase in the general interest in language within the school, improvement in participants personal language ability, teaching confidence and ability to make  the subject engaging, greater empathy with students ,  improvement in pupils enjoyment of lessons, increased pupil  attainment, development of a larger resource base, and greater contact with pupils from other countries.", "http://www.acrehall.trafford.sch.uk/", "Acre Hall Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035894_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["5SL", "RM3", "TRAFFORD GENERAL HOSPITAL"], ["5SL", "RY2", "TRAFFORD GENERAL HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "M41"}
