We are driven to provide our staff with the best opportunities, so as to ensure that our students have every tool at their disposal to achieve that success. As a forward thinking and outward looking school, we see ourselves at the heart of the local, as well as the global, community. This is highlighted not only in our outstanding curriculum, but also our existing partnerships with different schools in Europe and Africa. International activity is firmly embedded throughout the school; our Creative Curriculum provides cross curricular and relevant links between subjects and recognises the importance we place on global awareness and 'Global Citizenship'; we have international evenings each year that help to celebrate the rich cultural diversity of our local area with performances and food from around the world; the children thoroughly enjoy school days that are dedicated to appreciating different countries and languages such as our regular French day and European languages day; French is taught throughout the school from Nursery to Year 6 with children having French and Portuguese pen pals whom they communicate with. In addition, we provide extra-curricular Portuguese lessons through the Portuguese embassy to those children who speak Portuguese at home. \r\nTo promote awareness of different cultures, languages and countries we ensure that the school environment reflects our school ethos and global outlook, through commissioned artworks, children's own creations and signs and notice boards in different languages. Given the local international demographic, language learning and internationalism have played an important role in our school ethos for a long time with French, Portuguese, Polish and other community languages and cultures being celebrated and appreciated.  We have previously arranged staff visits to Paris, Tanzania, Finland, Lisbon, Nice and Bordeaux and look on this project as the next logical step and challenge in our continuing desire to push the school in new and exciting directions. \r\nIn short, the objectives of the project are twofold. We would like to provide our school with new and interesting leadership ideas, in addition to providing staff and children with relevant and inspiring reasons to feel confident about language learning and interested in other cultures.  After previous successes with international partners, we are particularly interested in forging strong links with our new Polish partner school. \r\nTwo members of the leadership team will be taking part in the \u2018Leadership\u2019 aspects of the project and will be traveling to Poland to meet members of our partner school,  to share ideas and outlooks and to observe the day to day management and teaching within the school; different members of teaching and support staff will be involved in the \u2018MFL curriculum delivery\u2019 aspect and will be taking part in language lessons and cultural exchanges in France; as well as over five hundred children who we aim to stimulate and engage through our improved French curriculum delivery and increasing links with our Polish partners. All aspects of the project will be monitored, evaluated and reported on, so as to increase the potential benefits to all stakeholders, as well as those who are interested in what we have experienced and discovered. \r\nWe expect that the project will enrich our management structure; increase awareness of community languages and cultures such as Polish; provide interesting, relevant and authentic curriculum links with Geography, History and Citizenship; engage staff and pupils, and improve our delivery of French in conjunction with our teaching standards. Staff members will continue to increase their knowledge of French language and culture as well as the pedagogy employed in France. We also expect the staff to develop and increase their confidence when speaking, listening, writing and reading in French as well their awareness of the Languages curriculum in our school.  Longer term benefits include an increase in knowledge and appreciation of French and Polish culture as well as developing staff and pupil\u2019s awareness of what it means to be a Global Citizen. We also expect that the project will increase pupils attainment in numerous subjects, such as Geography, History, Literacy, Numeracy and Citizenship through providing genuine examples and real life experiences and connections.", "http://www.grantonprimary.org.uk", "Granton Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035983_coordinator"], ["5AN", "Edukacja - reAktywacja, w stron\u0119 edukacji skutecznej, przyjaznej i nowoczesnej.", "Granton Primary School", 33063.0, "Our junior high school wants to be a part of the project: Education - reActivation, in the direction of effective, friendly, modern education because we want to be institution with high qualified teachers which develope and improve not only their skills but mostly the students.

Each centre will select 2 former students (technicians) and 6 students.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that relations with the European partners fostered reciprocity, as all the participating transnational centres has also submitted a mobility project in which Spanish consortium will receive their students. The reciprocity will enhance the promotion of the European active citizenship.\r\nThe 1 year project will last from the 1st of July 2017 to the 30th of June 2018. The internship will be carried out from the 15th of March to the  30th of May 2018.  \r\nThe following activities will be structured in 5 phases:\r\nE1- Activities for communicating and spreading information to promote the students\u2019 participation, planning tasks (including participants\u2019 selection), establishing Learning Agreements, reviewing of ECVET documents, logistics and organization (insurance, lights and accommodation), determining contract-related issues, selecting hosting companies, tutors and accompanying teachers, setting up a common dissemination plan.\r\nE2-Preparation of the mobilities. Information Meeting, signing contracts, linguistic, cultural and professional preparation, OLS registration for students.\r\nE3- Implementation of mobilities. Follow-up, evaluation and certification of participants. Competences will be determined in the Learning Agreement and will be evaluated, using the ECVET instruments and will be certifies by Europass. \r\nE4- Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the overall project\u2019s results.\r\nE5- Dissemination. The dissemination activities will be carried out throughout the project\u2019s duration. An extraordinary staff meeting will be held in all the consortium centres. A Final Conference will be also organized.\r\nIn addition to the impact on the participants, the project will also benefit all the partners, by fostering  European cooperation and the relationships between companies and educational centres. \r\nBoth dissemination activities and the mobility experience itself will produce an impact at local, regional and national level. \r\nOther local, regional and national entities will be able to to benefit from the project\u2019s results (even though they are not partners of the project):\r\n- Creation of a quality network that include educational centres and companies\r\n- Decrease in youth unemployment rate\r\n- Improvement of youth qualifications\r\n- Increase in VET enrolment \r\n- Creation of new collaborative networks at regional level\r\n- Widening the possibility of internationalization for other centres, and their chance to be part to other European projects\r\n- Better knowledge of the Erasmus+ programme and EU values (tolerance, equity, equality and inclusion).\r\n- Fostering the sense of European active citizenship and respect of other cultures\r\n- Possibility to create new companies and new business models \r\n- Promotion of social inclusion\r\nThe project is in accordance with the Strategy 2020, the New Skills Agenda for Europe 2016 and the Erasmus+ objectives, improving the professional development of the students, their participation as active citizens in society and and their employability inside and outside the European Labour market", "http://www.wellfieldeducation.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037021_16"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SW16"}
