We are driven to provide our staff with the best opportunities, so as to ensure that our students have every tool at their disposal to achieve that success. Given the local international demographic, MFL and internationalism have played an important role in our school ethos for a long time. However, with the inclusion of \u2018Languages\u2019 into the new National Curriculum, MFL has moved even more centre stage. As a result, the leadership team have expressed the belief that everything should be done to make our school as \u2018international\u2019 as possible. We have previously received funding for visits to 2 of our partner schools in Paris and Tanzania, and look on this project as the next logical step and challenge in our continuing desire to push the school in new and exciting directions. \r\n\r\nIn short, the objectives of the project are to provide our school with new and interesting leadership ideas, in addition to providing staff and children with relevant and inspiring reasons to feel confident about language learning and interested in other cultures. \r\nTwo members of the leadership team will be taking part in the \u2018Leadership\u2019 aspects of the project, fifteen members of teaching staff will be involved in the \u2018MFL curriculum delivery\u2019 aspect, as well as several hundred children who we aim to stimulate and engage through our improved MFL curriculum delivery.\r\n\r\nThe leadership team will visit various schools in different European countries to share ideas.  Teaching staff will take language lessons in France and cultural exchanges with French schools. All aspects of the project will be monitored, evaluated and reported on, so as to increase the potential benefits to all stakeholders, as well as those who are interested in what we have experienced and discovered. \r\n\r\nWe expect that the projects will enrich our management structure, our curriculum content, increase our European links, engage staff and pupils, and improve our delivery of MFL in conjunction with our teaching standards. Staff members will increase their knowledge of French language and culture as well as the pedagogy employed in France. We also expect the staff to develop their speaking, listening, writing and reading skills in French as well their awareness of the MFL curriculum in our school. We expect participants to increase their confidence while  communicating in French. Longer term benefits include an increase in knowledge and appreciation of French and European culture as well as developing staff and pupil\u2019s awareness of what it means to be a European citizen.

As such the aim of the project is to enable our staff to deliver high quality Spanish lessons  ensuring good progression from year group to year group. We would like Spanish language and culture to become embedded in the school culture. The curriculum will be delivered more effectively when the teachers have the subject knowledge, confidence and experience of Spanish culture. Immersion courses allow a fully encompassing experience whereby the teachers are exposed to the language and culture over a five day intense period which allows greater progress and deeper understanding of the language and social aspects. There will be 20-24 participants, some participants will attend more than one language course. As the project will run over 2 years any new members of staff will have an opportunity to take part as well. All participants are teachers who have the responsibility of delivering Spanish language lessons to a class in KS1 and 2. The language courses will run Monday-Friday, the mornings will be focussed on developing their speaking, listening, reading and writing skills including grammar. In the afternoons they will attend cultural lessons on food, monuments, museums, schools, art, dance and history of Spain. A certificate will be provided at the end of each course. In the second year the language courses will also include methodology to teach Spanish using stories, songs and games. The expected impact will be teachers who are  more passionate, confident, motivated to deliver creative and outstanding language lessons. The profile of language learning will be raised in the school and this will create more whole school occasions where Spanish language and culture is celebrated.  After the two years we would aim for teachers in our cluster schools to come to our school to learn about language teaching and aspects of Spanish culture. We would  aim to set up after school clubs and holiday programmes where others schools can join us to develop their language learning. Long term we expect to have a school that is well equipped with Spanish resources, outstanding teacher who are proud to teach Spanish and are willing to set up sustainable partnerships with schools in Spain.

The Institutes, supported by the stakeholders of the various areas involved, have built a Consortium with the primary purpose of creating a permanent placement service within schools, to accompany the students in the labour market through an international internship and certification of skills acquired. The context in which is born the project proposal consists of territories linked by a territorial continuity, with a shared history that refers to the ancient Etruria, as well as a touristic vocation. VET-TEEN aims to achieve the following objectives:1) increase the human capital of students and create more opportunities for employment, allowing continuous learning experience2) create a real placement service with the intention to reduce the time of entry into the world of work and increase the chances of finding a job in line with the studies carried out, affecting the containment of job mismatch3) spread the use of Europass and the use of EQARF indicators, to promote the development of mobility in the EU and ensure the legibility and visibility of qualifications and skills acquired, by increasing quality and transparency.The target group of beneficiaries is represented by the students of class III and IV of the three institutions, with the following broad professional specialization:Technical for TourismCAT - Construction Environment and TerritoryMaintenance and Technical SupportCommercial Services / Administration, Finance and MarketingHealth and Social ServicesTextile production- fashionall united by a personal background similar in age and degree of maturity reached and a background of professional training, in accordance with the characteristics of areas of specialization.VET-TEEN is structured into three general stages:1.

This is highlighted not only in our outstanding curriculum, but also our existing partnerships with different schools in Europe and Africa. International activity is firmly embedded throughout the school; our Creative Curriculum provides cross curricular and relevant links between subjects and recognises the importance we place on global awareness and 'Global Citizenship'; we have international evenings each year that help to celebrate the rich cultural diversity of our local area with performances and food from around the world; the children thoroughly enjoy school days that are dedicated to appreciating different countries and languages such as our regular French day and European languages day; French is taught throughout the school from Nursery to Year 6 with children having French and Portuguese pen pals whom they communicate with. In addition, we provide extra-curricular Portuguese lessons through the Portuguese embassy to those children who speak Portuguese at home. \r\nTo promote awareness of different cultures, languages and countries we ensure that the school environment reflects our school ethos and global outlook, through commissioned artworks, children's own creations and signs and notice boards in different languages.

This plus the fact that we are situated in one of the most racially and culturally diversed neighbourhoods in the world create for us a real and tangible need to work with and integrate our very diverse school community. As mentioned before, the school has already been the recipient of a first Erasmus + grant which has had a hugely beneficial impact on us and on our day to day run of the school. This second application is mainly as a result from the need to consolidate what has been achieved so far in terms of the foreign language training for our staff and the closer relationship we are forging with many of parents and students.\r\n\r\nHaving to teach a larger than the national average EAL students present both a challenge and a major opportunity. A challenge because we need to ensure that those student make their expected academic progress or above it during their KS1 & KS2 education; and an opportunity because it is widely documented that in the long run bilingual students over perform those pupils who only speak one language. In other words we are educating some students who in the future could have brilliant academic and professional careers because of their perceived ability to access some of the best universities in the world.  That is why the sustained promotion of bilingualism in our school is vital ingredient for the level of academic and pastoral care we must offer to our young students and their families.\r\n\r\nAnother long term objective, as a result in the promotion of staff language training and bilingualism in our school, is a more cohesive and integrated school community, something that can never be underestimated in terms of its emotional, social and academic impact. This project will allows not only to deliver better cross-curricular lessons and language tuition but also will help us set up the tone for a much more successful relationship with parents and students. Similarly, it will allows to increase our community outreach using the celebration of Spanish Days and EAL lessons for parents as a valid and much needed platform. \r\n\r\nThe methodology will be based around the new proficiency that 14 members of our staff will have in terms of  Spanish. The group represents a very varied section of our school -from our head teacher to NQTs, supporting staff associated with MFL and a Parents Champion teacher whose responsibility is ensuring the quality and development of the parents-school working relationship.
