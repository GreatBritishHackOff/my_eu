This ideal human being has the right to think, believe, and express itself freely about all matters without fearing retribution, and to be treated as an autonomous and dignified individual. But such a conception is not shared by all \u2013 and never was. Its long history has been formed through a continuous battle between two theological and philosophical traditions going back to Origen from Alexandria and Augustine of Hippo respectively. Origen saw humans as free, valuable and dignified beings, while Augustine saw them as predestined, sinful and bound to servitude. The network will investigate the reception and use of Origen\u2019s ideas in order to provide a comprehensive and historically based understanding of these fundamental values, their origins, development and the fights they have gone through.

Practical training of the learners and trainees, as well as the professional development and growth of the staff are the priorities set by IVVEC.  We have set the task to be trainee-focused and we wish to study the best practices. The HR policy at IVVEC supports learning both in Estonia and abroad. Our staff members analyze their work at the end of a school-year and plan their learning activities according to their needs. Traditionally individual meetings are held by the school administration with each of the staff, where they discuss the plans and needs for retraining and advancement. A training program is made up at IVVEC every school-year. The participation of the staff in EU mobilities is vastly supported by the school administration.
