For this, e-Maritime must ameliorate complexities that hinder networking of different stakeholders, help to increase automation of operational processes particularly compliance management and facilitate the streaming of synthesised information from disparate sources to assist decision making.\nThe eMar approach will facilitate extensive participation of the European maritime public, business and research community in a knowledge development process leading to  the specification of the  e-Maritime Strategic Framework. The emphasis will be in multiple iterations across different stages and with different stakeholders.\nThe development of the e-Maritime Strategic Framework will include the following key aspects:\na.\tA number of market surveys to be conducted by a leading company in this field to identify business drivers and requirement priorities of different stakeholder groups\nb.\tStakeholder needs analysis, using knowledge of technology and architectural capabilities from projects such as MarNIS, Freightwise, EFFORTS, Flagship, SKEMA etc to identify new processes and functionalities.\nc.\tIdentification of implications for standardization and standardisation strategies for areas that cannot be relied upon being developed in other places.\nd.\tMeasures to address legal and organisational inconsistencies at national and regional levels, human factors and change management issues.\ne.\tInterfaces with SafeSeaNet, e-Freight and e-Customs, National Single Windows, Galileo and e-Navigation developments.\nf.\tCost-benefit analysis for new business models (and corresponding legal changes) relying on e-Maritime services.", null, 4662567.0, "EMAR", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_103633_956416315"], ["2TU", "Assessing the effectiveness of community-based management strategies for biocultural diversity conservation", "The Global Diversity Foundation", "The COMBIOSERVE consortium aims to identify the conditions and principles of successful community-based conservation in selected locations in Mexico, Brazil and Bolivia, working in partnership with local Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and indigenous communities. Many Latin American and Caribbean rural and indigenous communities have historically developed strategies to regulate land use and conserve biodiversity whilst enhancing livelihoods and reducing  conflicts. This has occurred while new panaceas for conservation and development, such as ecotourism, payments for environmental services, and biodiversity derivatives, have emerged and impacted community dynamics in ways that require urgent analysis.  Our analysis will rely on the assessment of past and present trajectories and future scenarios of environmental change; an examination of individual and collective dependence on natural resources and ecosystem services, and analysis of people\u2019s capacity to adapt and be resilient to multiple stressors. We will also assess the cultural traditions, knowledge systems, and institutional arrangements that have allowed communities to devise collective conservation strategies, address social tensions, and resolve resource conflicts. The development of a co-enquiry/advocacy approach will provide significant benefits to local communities and CSOs.

This ideal human being has the right to think, believe, and express itself freely about all matters without fearing retribution, and to be treated as an autonomous and dignified individual. But such a conception is not shared by all \u2013 and never was. Its long history has been formed through a continuous battle between two theological and philosophical traditions going back to Origen from Alexandria and Augustine of Hippo respectively. Origen saw humans as free, valuable and dignified beings, while Augustine saw them as predestined, sinful and bound to servitude. The network will investigate the reception and use of Origen\u2019s ideas in order to provide a comprehensive and historically based understanding of these fundamental values, their origins, development and the fights they have gone through. Only then can we argue for their continued place in modern society.\nSuch a project is highly relevant today, since the modern conception of humans is a fundamental pillar of Western democracies which is under pressure from both political and fundamentalist religious groups that question the societal structures building on ideas of humans\u2019 freedom and dignity, and by global crises and structures that limit the individual\u2019s autonomy.", null, 3131464.0, "HHFDWC", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_198325_933918329"], ["1UT", "Digital Local Public Sphere and Local Communication Online: A Comparative Study of Four European countries", "Canterbury Christ Church University", "The study of local communication in the digital age is an important subject area, as a thriving public dialogue and deliberation online enhances local democracies and engagement in local matters. However, our understanding of local communication online and how practices of different local communities vary is limited, as most research in the field explores online communication at national or international level. The aim of this project is to conduct a comparative study on the democratic potentials and challenges of local communication online and on the key features of digital local public spheres in four European countries. The objectives of the project are to: 1) develop a framework for the study of digital local public sphere; 2) analyse and compare online communication of local communities in Italy, Norway, Poland and the UK; 3) analyse and compare key features of digital local public spheres of local communities in Italy, Norway, Poland and the UK; 4) develop policy recommendations to foster strong and inclusive digital local public spheres in local communities. With these objectives the study will not only provide a theoretical contribution but also inform policy debates and have the potential to influence communicative practices. A mixed method approach will be applied for the empirical research, which will involve case study analysis of local communities in the four countries. The methods will include content analysis, interviews and social media network analysis.
