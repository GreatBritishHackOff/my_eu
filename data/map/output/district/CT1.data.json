This ideal human being has the right to think, believe, and express itself freely about all matters without fearing retribution, and to be treated as an autonomous and dignified individual. But such a conception is not shared by all \u2013 and never was. Its long history has been formed through a continuous battle between two theological and philosophical traditions going back to Origen from Alexandria and Augustine of Hippo respectively. Origen saw humans as free, valuable and dignified beings, while Augustine saw them as predestined, sinful and bound to servitude. The network will investigate the reception and use of Origen\u2019s ideas in order to provide a comprehensive and historically based understanding of these fundamental values, their origins, development and the fights they have gone through.

We are aware that this is a very large application, but at the same time, we believe that the application is extremely realistic. Tradium is one of the largest combination schools, and internationalization is very integrated into our organization. This was also the reason why, Tradium got the Danish award as being the International School of the year 2012.\r\n\r\nSince 2012, we enhanced the international work by sending out even more students and employees, while we have participated in several international projects. In previous mobility projects we have send out whole classes with approximately half grants, so everybody had the opportunity to receive a grant. In the 2014-project  we have given a full grant for all participants, with the result that we don't have more than 26 student mobilities left.\r\n\r\nWith this project we apply primarily for grants for mobility in the year 2015/2016, but we have also added some elected classes for 2016/2017. This application is the result of an internal application process, where the departments of Tradium have fulfilled an internal application based on their needs for future mobilities in their department.\r\n\r\nThe mobilities for the year 2016/2017 are for the classes that have integrated the mobilities as a mandatory part of their training and the mobility project to Glasgow (which has been completed the last many years). This type of mobilities we are 100% certain will be realized, and that is why it would be right to inform all the relevant stakeholders about the economic conditions earlier on. For this reason we have applyed for 2016/2017 mobilities for these special classes as well, a total of 101 mobility grants for students + 3 accompanying persons.\r\n\r\nThe project is implemented in continuation of Tradiums strategy of having a global vision, and thus to the desire to integrate internationalization into all of the programs offered by Tradium. The Mobility project is a very important element in this strategy.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we wish to send out 188 VET students, 92 HHX students and 35 employees. VET students are primarily basic course students at either GF1 or GF2, but there are also individual students from the main program (school training students). We are applying for grants to accompanying persons to our basic course students, as these students are relatively young (some are under 18), and many times they are not strong linguistically / culturally. HHX students are all first-year students from the school's two international study programs. Staff members come from all parts of the school: Managers, teachers and administrative staff.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the mobility project will be in extension of the enclosed MoU / LOI. There will be an increased focus on getting participants' learning outcomes described in a better way (ECVET), partly by using Learning Agreements for the description of the individual's learning outcomes, and assessed by the host partner. At the same time we will maintain the Europass Mobility as a recognition of the skills that the participant has achieved during the mobility.\r\n\r\nExpected effect for students:\r\nThe project will help to increase students' linguistic, international and intercultural competencies. Particularly VET students often have a limited global vision, which makes it difficult for them to operate in an international environment. With this project, they will be better to compete with other groups of students on internships and jobs. Regarding HHX / HTX participants, they also need a practical approach to their theoretical education. The work placements for these students will add this dimension. It is expected that most students will have a better chance of employment in the global labor market. They can also act as a pioneer and inspire other students to study abroad.\r\n\r\nExpected effect for employees / organization:\r\n\u2022 Employees / managers achieve linguistic, international and intercultural skills so that the organization will be able to support the students mobility.\r\n\u2022 Employees are provided with relevant professional qualification in their field, as well as greater power to integrate the international aspect in their training\r\n\u2022 Teachers get new inspiration for teaching and new pedagogical methods and tools\r\n\u2022 Management and administration gain new skills and inspiration (management, organization, planning, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe results of the mobility project will be evaluated and disseminated, internally as well as externally.

In these economic hard times,  foreign companies find it more and more difficult to give students an allowance for their internship. This is the reason not every student can go abroad. To enable an internship abroad for all students, this application is done. \r\nThis application consists of a total of 6 partial projects, in which the focus lies on the work experience the students achieve in this internship and for teachers to gain more English language proficiency. This is mainly for the teaching methods. \r\n\r\nThe projects offer the 92 students (VET, Commerce, Trade, Hospitality, Marketing & Events, Tourism and recreation) an orientation on the international labourmarket and intensive training oriented language learning. The student acquires a better vision of his future labour, knows where his occupation stands on the international labour market and enhances his English/Spanish language skills.\r\nThe practical work experience offers  the possibility of gaining an impression at various compagnies. The students become prepared for their definitive entrance in the business comminity, because they run fewer risks of shortly drowning in the multitude of new information and impressions. The fear of 'the jump at the deep end' that the students inevitably need to make will be removed. \r\nThe practical work experience, in a foreign county, will give the training a completely new dimension. Student will learn the role of an employee. They need to conquer their own place during their work experience. \r\n\r\nThe students experience the culture of the European country and way of working in a European organization. Students go through a personal development, because they live in an unknown situation for some weeks, without their familiar social network. \r\nAssignments students have to do during their internship are part of a formal ending of their training and are in line with the qualification files of the education.\r\nOften there is a direct reference to work processes and competences. The assignments are signed off by the internship supervisor and judged by the teacher at school. \r\nStudents who have followed a traineeship provide information to students one year lower, in order to have these students better prepared for their internship the following year.

Today, the initiatives to meet  the educational needs of communities and individuals have become so prevalent in public education that it is extremely important  not only social, economically but also  culturally to provide adult population  with public education services which are organized at national level and well supported. In the future  with the developments in science and technology , non formal education programs must  meet the needs of individuals with services  which compatible with thought systems integrated with technology.Therefore, the revision of  non formal education programs in conjunction with the changing educational models, it seems to be a necessity to design new goals and contents. However, formal education which is given in schools  can not be limited to those taught in schools since  education is a lifelong process.

Internationalization is a beacon for Tradium, and it is included in the strategic, tactical and operational levels. In 2012, Tradium was recognized with the international prize for our international engagement.  After the changes following OK13 and EUD reform in 2015, we have been concerned about the development within international activities, for example, mobility projects (timewise, resources as well as structural). Luckily, our experience is that many of our departments have made a priority to implement mobility projects. Within our vocational education, it is now typical that our EUX students in the beginning of their education and training, as well as our school internship students have had the opportunity to use the mobility grants to travel to one of our partner schools. After the restructuring of the vocational educations, it has been assessed that the options of mobility projects has been more constricted. With the agreement of OK13 the costs have been more considerably higher than before. Our upper secondary education continues to make mobility grants a priority.

We are applying for accompanying persons because a great part of our students are relatively young (under 18 yrs. old), and for many of these students this is the first time meeting professionals from the business community. The staff comes from all parts of the school, and the people in charge of education in the businesses. Implementation of mobility grants will happen in connection with the attached MoU/LoI.

Affects for students:This project will help increase the student\u2019s language, international and intercultural competences.

Practical skills to organize the preparation of students, teachers, parents in the vocational school before the start of the integration.3. Practical skills in working with socially excluded and people from other cultures  in a vocational school; curriculum improvement.4. The ability to solve problems, to provide assistance and emergency management.5. The ability to cooperate.The target group of the participants in the project consists of teachers in various fields: social workers, psychologists, teachers. 24 project participants from three different Lithuanian vocational training institutions from different regions: Vilnius Vocational Education Centre of Technology and Business, Visaginas Technology and Business Vocational Training Centre and Kaunas Applied Arts school -  will go to a one week internship in the United Kingdom and Germany. 12 people will participate in each internship, including three representatives from each vocational training institution.Germany and England as directions for professional internships were chosen for the following reasons: they are one of the biggest centres of different ethnic cultures in Europe, the educational vocational training system of these countries has adapted to solving the problems associated with people other cultures and socially excluded inclusion in training, labor market and country's culture. During the professional internships in these countries project participants will get acquainted with the integration models into vocational training, educational, pedagogical and psychological support institutions of above-mentioned groups and relevant methodologies.Experience gained from the internship will definitely provide project participants with self-confidence in working with socially excluded persons and other students from different cultures. It is expected to reach a methodical and psychological preparation of the project participants, which could easily be transformed at Lithuanian vocational training institutions in organizing a successful integration of groups, which are socially vulnerable and from other cultures. This competence of the teaching staff is essential to good learning outcomes, easy adaptation in the labor market - is a precondition for successful self-realization for students who, because of their social status and cultural alienation have fewer opportunities. In addition to that, the expected results of the project represent a unique project participants' knowledge and experience, improved intercultural communication and cooperation skills, higher professional motivation and wider horizons.

Our school has always made every effort to ensure our students progression and success. We believe that fostering internationalization will contribute to this, and that is why our staff have agreed to start a European mobility project for 2016-2018.

They are part of the European Section class that was launched in September 2014 and are preparing for a BTEC in sales, retail and customer services.Taking a placement abroad will be a unique opportunity for our students to:- observe and apply working methods and professional techniques through real world of work activities (in real estate agencies, tourist offices, schools, shops, department stores, supermarkets\u2026);- improve their language skills and hence their fluency in English;- build on social and international relationships within a working and daily environment, fully appreciate its cultural wealth, become more tolerant and open minded European citizens;- develop autonomy, adaptability and initiative.They will acquire new skills specific to their trades, which will encourage them to continue studying at third level. It will also provide a better integration into the labour market (locally, nationally and internationally).The staff involved in the project will be given the chance to:- get a better understanding of the British working methods and of the British vocational training system by comparing them to the French ones;- develop European cooperation with their partner and the English tutors;- reinforce interdisciplinary work and maximize teaching methods.As far as we are concerned, our school will try hard to:- develop its international dimension;- promote its vocational subjects inside and outside school;- mobilise students towards a long-term project;- make them aware of the importance of learning English;- fuel all students\u2019 desire and interest in a mobility project.The voluntary participants, mainly coming from varied ethnic groups and low-income families, benefit from 2 extra hours of English a week throughout their three years at school. They can develop both language and professional competencies thus preparing them for their placement abroad. Every student will be equipped with language, cultural, professional and pedagogical preparation, from learning vocabulary and expressions essential in everyday life, keeping the Euro Section blog up to date and liaising regularly with the tutors.Our students will then spend three weeks in host families and local companies selected carefully from our partner College\u2019s database. Paul-Emile Victor\u2019s staff will exchange with their partner at Canterbury College on a regular basis so as to set up contracts and communicate on the needs, aims and priorities of each participant. They will work in tandem with their local representative to divide missions and tasks and produce mobility material. The documents such as the students\u2019 CVs, diaries, assessment grids, attendance grids\u2026 will allow students to prepare for their exams and certifications in the most efficient way (Europass, Europro, the Euro Section Distinction\u2026).

Furthermore, within this project, students will be given the chance to get to know a country which they might not know at all or only from a short holiday. Another important aim is to improve their language skills by making use of what they already know, internalizing it and expanding their vocabulary, etc. The latter will be supported by the OLS, Online Linguistic Support.\r\nWhich skills are to be focused on, will be put down in the Learning Agreements in accordance with teachers, employers and students.

Three teachers will do a job shadowing abroad, two at a school in Cuxhaven, Germany and one English/Spanish teacher at a school in Avila, Spain. The aims are to find out more about the school systems in the two countries and, of course, how classes work. What\u00b4s more, the two teachers who will spend a week at the German school want to find out more about the implementation of COOL (Cooperative Open Learning) in the classroom. This is something they are familiar with as well. Another thing they are interested in is the Theatre Company which they have had in Cuxhaven for year and is something we are aspiring to have as well.\r\nThe other teacher who is going to spend a week in Spain wants to form the basis for a future cooperation with the Spanish school, most likely in form of a School Exchange. By the way, this contact has its roots at Comenius training in Southampton where the Erasmus+ coordinator met a teacher from the Spanish school. A third visit is planned for Stockholm where two colleagues do a job-shadowing. HLW Wolfsberg, in return, is very much looking forward to welcoming representatives of the new partner schools in Wolfsberg.\r\nAnd finally, the coordinator of this project wants to pay GB a final visit, also to find out if and how a cooperation between the two countries will be possible after BREXIT.", "http://www.abbotsbartonhotel.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-AT01-KA116-039082_6"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1UT", "CANTERBURY CHRIST CHURCH UNIVERSITYLTD*CCCU", 29574.0, "Erasmus+ \u2014 Contribution from the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) (22.04.20)", "fts_2016_21043", 2016], ["1UT", "CANTERBURY CHRIST CHURCH UNIVERSITYLTD*CCCU", 30774.0, "Developing the European dimension in sport (15.02.03)", "fts_2017_32882", 2017], ["1UT", "CANTERBURY CHRIST CHURCH UNIVERSITYLTD*CCCU", 43613.0, "Promoting excellence in teaching and research activities in European integration through the Jean Monnet activities worldwide (15.02.02)", "fts_2017_57460", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "CT1"}
