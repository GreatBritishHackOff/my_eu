Across Europe traditional youth work arenas and practices are changing due to a variety of economic and political circumstances. \r\nThe main aim of Acting UP! is to explore theatre as an opportunity for youth participation and a vehicle for political change, while building a platform for networking, exchange of practice and identifying and understanding the opportunities for political theatre in working with young people. It will be realised through the implementation of two distinct activities. \r\nObjectives - CMS/Study Visit, for total 30 participants, duration 7 days (including travel) in The Netherlands:\r\nTo network locally, nationally and internationally with other practitioners working with young people through theatre and performance.\r\nTo experience a range of theatre and performance and collaboratively explore the opportunities for youth participation.\r\nA greater understanding of the cultural differences of youth participation and theatre approaches when working with young people. \r\nBegin to understand the political context and opportunities for using theatre as a tool for participation. \r\nObjectives - Training Course, for total 30 participants, duration 7 days (including travel) in The Netherlands: \r\nTo better understand political theatre and performance, techniques and practice.\r\nTo experience political theatre and performance methodologies and tools.\r\nTo share political theatre and performance practice and experiences with each other.\r\nTo better understand the benefits of youth theatre and performance as an opportunity for political education and awareness.\r\nTo identify collaborative opportunities within the framework of Erasmus+\r\nTo identify opportunities for practice development of political theatre and youth participation.\r\nThirty participants from six different countries with each partner organisation sending five participants. \r\nFor the Contact Making Seminar/Study Visit we will be looking to engage theatre group coordinators and project managers and for the training we see it being more focussed and beneficial to those working directly with young people. Methodologies will include group work, practical experiences, action research, team building, experiential learning and reflection and partner building approaches through getting to know each other and all based on the principles of non-formal education. \r\nA variety of results and impacts are expected and these range from the direct benefits for the participants gaining an increased knowledge and awareness of theatre practice to the local and international networks expected to grow from this project. We want to strengthen the opportunities young people have to be engaged in the political landscape and to be active and responsible citizens. We want to empower theatre workers to realise the potential of youth work, raise the quality of their practice and to value more the work and the impact their work is having.", "http://www.auntysocial.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL02-KA105-001612_2"], ["3LQ", "EVS Q.U.E.S.T - Quality, Understanding, Evaluation, Support, Trust in EVS", "The Streetlife Trust Ltd", 59811.0, "EVS Q.U.E.S.T. is a new long term project that aims to support an emerging EVS network, one that has grown following an EVS project realised in the Netherlands 2016. In preparing the final report and analysing the evaluation, interest and a commitment emerged for this network to continue, for us to build on the activities and learning that had started. Themes like quality, trust between partners, mutual support, shared values, working on concrete opportunities together and evaluating impact featured regularly. Partners confirmed the intention to continue to grow together, to strengthen the network and for existing and new collaborations to flourish.  Q.U.E.S.T. stands for Quality, Understanding, Evaluation, Support, Trust in E.V.S. Our partnership has considered the purpose of EVS and needs, aspirations and interests of young people and agree that this approach should be supported wherever possible, and so the network would not restrict or reduce the possibilities but focus on the network being a resource working towards improving quality and the EVS experience.\r\nThe Partners involved are actors in the EVS arena as Sending Hosting or Coordinating Organistions, as well as Supervisors, Mentors, Trainers and Facilitators.  The countries represented in this project are: Ireland, UK, Netherlands, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Cyprus, Latvia, Romania, Croatia and Turkey.\r\n\r\nEVS Q.U.E.S.T. will be realised through the implementation of three distinct activities -\r\n1 Partnership Building Activity for EVS coordinators so we can set the rules, roles and responsibilities of the EVS network. Furthermore to understand the application process for EVS projects and to identify and overcome the possible blocks. September 2017 in Ireland \r\n2 Training Course \"Quality Project Management of EVS projects\" from sending to arriving to departing and follow up. Exploring the roles and responsibilities of the EVS Supervisor. March 2018 in The Netherlands\r\n3 Evaluation Seminar to consolidate and evaluate the overall project, the network and to identify and plan next steps together.  June 2018 in Greece.\r\n\r\nIt is projected to have 26 participants and 4 key staff (in a training / facilitator role) throughout each activity, representing the countries in the network established.  Given the experienced gained from the previous Youth in Action and current Erasmus+ programmes, the trainers represent active organisations in the field of EVS and bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the project. \r\nThe specific objectives for this project are:\r\n\u2022 To provide a meeting point for exchanging information, to support contact, cooperation and partnerships\r\n\u2022 To raise awareness and confirm the concept of EVS and the learning dimension of EVS service. \r\n\u2022 To promote implementation of EVS projects and create an inspiring learning environment for for sharing good practice\r\n\u2022 To strengthen competences of EVS coordinators, supervisors and volunteers (personally and professionally) \r\n\u2022 To improve capacity of practical realisation of EVS projects in the frames of Erasmus+ and to provide up-to-date information about the Erasmus+ \r\n\r\nAll activities are planned in such a way that they will increase and ensure the quality of EVS projects, to create a strong partnership between the partner organisations and to ensure as maximum the support that all stakeholders can provide to volunteers. A safe and creative environment will be created in order the participants (in each phase of the project and each activity) will exchange information, will contact and cooperate.  From building a strong partnership, understanding the EVS concept and its importance and to improve the capacity of practical realisation of EVS projects in the frames of Erasmus+, until the support that mentors can provide to volunteers, is long process and with the activities planned we are sure that we can make it as safe as possible for the participants learning.  In between activities, partners will be encouraged and supported to practice their learning from the activity undertaken.  Upon next meeting, both learning and practical experience will be evaluated and reflected on.\r\n\r\nAll partners will be involved and represented at each activity and be involved throughout the project process and this includes identifying conclusions and preparing the final report.  Methodology used during the project will be based on the principles of non-formal education (e.g. experiential learning, cooperative learning, shared responsibility, etc.). These will be enriched with numerous practical examples of projects that have brought about change and success in the subject areas covered by the project activities and in this way activities will meet the objectives of the whole project. \r\n\r\nAll partners\u2019 communities have their own networks and through engagement we hope to also spread word through word of mouth, local people talking and sharing with other locals.
