Success in creating synergies is largely determined by decisions made at local and regional levels. Well-designed governance arrangements can be conducive to decisions that strengthen beneficial relations between rural and urban areas. Central to ROBUST is a place-based case study approach in which the case studies focus on thematic functional linkages cutting across rural-urban areas. The content and governance of these functional linkages are analyzed in diverse case study areas that represent the main types of rural \u2013 peri-urban \u2013 urban settings across Europe. ROBUST will identify and strengthen policies, governance systems and practices that can contribute more effectively to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Particular attention will be paid to the capacities of municipal and regional governments, the related administrations and other stakeholders to deliver and enhance mutually beneficial relations. ROBUST aims to provide practice-oriented information about successful governance models applicable to different settings as well as related communication and training material. In ROBUST, the questions and research needs of practice partners will guide the research process. Researchers will support the related multi-actor consultations through data collection and analysis, by providing suitable platforms and through facilitation. The insights co-generated by research and practice partners and stakeholders will be translated into tools, including scenario development, as well as training materials and capacity building measures. ROBUST will in this way contribute to a better understanding of rural-urban interactions, and it will at the same time enhance the capacity of relevant actors and institutions to foster mutually beneficial relations along rural \u2013 peri-urban \u2013 urban trajectories.", 134354.0, 5245081.0, "ROBUST", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_210506_915703184"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2EA", "ERASMOB 3 : La Mobilit\u00e9, une exp\u00e9rience pour tous en Nouvelle-Aquitaine !", "GLIC", 789349.0, "During the request of accreditation in March, 2015, the FRMFR reaffirmed its incentive politics, organized since 2006 for the realization of actions leading the young people in vocational training to realize an European mobility. To date, more than 2800 young people and 320 Pro EFP have already made a mobility. \r\nThis application comes to confirm our strategy of internationalization 2016/2020. Indeed 17 MFR mobilized to build their next micro-projects the beneficiaries of which are (See A. n\u00b03):\r\n- 1030 FPI (mob from 2 to 4 sem)\r\n- 60 apprentices (mob from 3 to 4 sem)\r\n- 285 Pro EFP guides or in total immersion (of 7 days in 4 sem)\r\n- 80 post-diplomas for durations\r\n- 4 entering mobilities\r\nThis ERASMOB project n\u00b03 will rest on the requirements described in our strategy which aims at maintaining with rigor a plan and actions having showed their ability as on the conclusions of the Audit System led by the Agency Erasmus + :\r\n- Micro-projects registered in a collective project offering all the educational guarantees, of follow-up, management, control, evaluation and valuation,\r\n- Experimented MFR with solid partnerships\r\n- A constant number of mobilities in connection with the recruitment to assure the equality of opportunity of the young people in front of the opportunity to live a unique experiment,\r\n- An organization defined and structured (See A.n\u00b04) with rules of functioning, bonds and shared responsibilities,\r\n- A will perms to innovate, to progress. \r\nAs expected in our strategy, we shall be all eyes during this ambitious 3rd project to pursue works in progress on:\r\n- The quality of the European training course. Indeed, according to the classes, the partners, the changes in reference tables, expectations of the young people we permanently have to adjust certain parameters. The support of the educational delegate is planned so that this mobility becomes an alternation with equal value of a said alternation \"classic\".\r\n- The accreditation of prior learning of apprenticeship for the learners but also for the trainers\r\n- The support of the learners and the parents  BEFORE, HANGING and AFTER the Mobility \r\n- The institutionalization of partnerships \r\n- The learning of differentes languages in alternation\r\n- The raising sensitization of companies to the European Mobility to raise opposition in the Mobility of our apprentices\r\n- And the Mobility Post-awards a diploma in connection with the stakes which our movement wishes to find within the framework of the Education in Worlds and in the Others who are the ones of the Year Otherwise, from the Education to the World Citizenship (See A. n\u00b05)\r\nThis project confirms the increase in the duration of mobilities impelled by a political will to build projects of 3 weeks mobility min to widen and look further into the impacts of this European immersion. Indeed more than 2 thirds of the MFR chose \u201cyoung\u201d mobilities over one 3 weeks duration or more.\r\nThe FRMFR positions as master of work of the mobilities Pro Efp with the will to organize thematic groups and so to exploit completely experience feedback:\r\n\u00b7 On the learning LV\r\n\u00b7 On the management of the interculturalit\u00e9 in the classes and the approach of the citizenship\r\n\u00b7 On the accompaniment of the young towards insertion \r\n\u00b7 On the use of the digital technology\r\n\u00b7 On the question of the wellness at work\r\n\u00b7 On the jobs related to agriculture and early childhood\r\nWe ask for guides because our young people are in + 80 % of the minors(miners) of 1st VOCATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA Year or CAPA(POSTGRADUATE LEGAL QUALIFICATIONS), very distant from the Mobility (Rural life, school and socioeconomic difficulties). In view of the international climate, our Boards of directors and Supervisory ministry wish that the MFR secures even more the mobilities of the learners and recommend strongly the presence of 1 guide permanently on-the-spot. The latter are so capable as we oblige it to install the young people in their company and family, to mesure the progress of activity and actions and to proceed to the final evaluations.\r\nAt the end of this project, the expected results are:\r\n- 100 %:\r\n\u00b7 consume all the mobilities.\r\n\u00b7 Agreements and completed certificates and corresponding to the quality criteria defined by the European Quality charter and the FRMFR\r\n\u00b7 reports of realized placements\r\n\u00b7 Europass (or similar version adapted to the expectations of companies) handed to the beneficiaries\r\n- Organized of 10 days of improvement for the referents Mobility with a rate of participation of more than 80 %.\r\n- 1 Commission \u00ab Education in Worlds and in the Others \u00bb/year, 2 Committees of Piloting / year, 5 Techniques Commitees/ year \r\n- Implementation of a regional demonstration of valuation of the mobilities a year \r\n- Publication of 4 \" Europe Otherwise\", our biannual publishing, in 2 years, information on the Facebook FRMFR, 2 publications of articles in external magazines.\r\n- Evaluation of the impact of the Mobility and the inquiries on needs and infringe structures", "http://www.glic.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA116-035962_27"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2TG", "GLOUCESTERSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL*", 133506.0, "Securing sufficient supplies of safe and high quality food and other bio-based products (05.09.03.01)", "fts_2017_5705", 2017]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["3NN", "R1J", "GLOUCESTERSHIRE ROYAL HOSPITAL"], ["3NN", "RHM", "GLOUCESTERSHIRE ROYAL HOSPITAL (PERIPHERAL CLINIC)"], ["3NN", "RTE", "GLOUCESTERSHIRE ROYAL HOSPITAL"], ["3HZ", "RTQ", "DENMARK ROAD DAY HOSPITAL"], ["3NN", "RTQ", "GLOUCESTERSHIRE ROYAL HOSPITAL"], ["3PX", "RTQ", "WOTTON LAWN HOSPITAL"], ["3NN", "RYF", "GLOUCESTERSHIRE ROYAL HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "GL1"}
