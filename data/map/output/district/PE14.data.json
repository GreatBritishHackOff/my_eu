We are a rural setting in Norfolk with high disadvantage. We work with complex families and increasing numbers of children on the Child Protection register and with SEND. \r\nOur project aims are primarily to raise standards of teaching and learning across the school and improve staff competency and pedagogy that will bring in other new perspectives influenced heavily by practice outside of the UK. \r\nTo address our objectives we have selected attendance at 2 structured training courses in Italy  and Sweden. These being:\r\n1) ITALY- Creative Teaching approaches in Early Years and Pre-School settings (4 staff) Organised by LEAP- 2 staff to visit in October 2017 and 2 staff to visit in November 2017; Delivered by experienced teachers and advisors. Includes\r\n* Visits to educational establishments\r\n* Visit to Reggio Children's Centres\r\n* Observations on teaching staff in Italy\r\n* Engagement with colleagues across EU\r\n* Development of teaching plans to use back in school \r\n* Reflection and dialogue with professionals\r\n\r\n2) Forest Learning: The Swedish Perspective-SWEDEN- May 2018: (2 staff) Organised by LEAP. Includes;\r\n* Observation of teaching\r\n* Principles of Swedish education system\r\n* Outdoor learning practical tasks\r\n* Future links for partnership working\r\n* Promotion of personalised learning environments for children\r\n* Developing emotional, social and well-being in children through Forest Schools approach\r\n\r\nIn total, 6 staff will benefit from funding directly, however the impact will be far greater as they return and lead projects and pedagogy for other staff members and the local community. \r\n\r\nThe 6 staff participating in the project will be our Deputy Head Teacher and 5 Educators who work directly with children aged birth to five. Our aim from the project is to sustain longer term relationships and partnerships with other schools in the UK and EU and work together professionally way beyond the end of the projects. \r\n\r\nStaff will engage in reflective impactful practices in collaboration with others, learning together with others also participating in the chosen projects. As a result the staff will plan creative learning experiences for children that will develop wide ranging skills that will remain the foundations for all future learning experiences into Primary, secondary and Post 16 Education. \r\n\r\nWe envisage the project to have many outcomes:\r\n\r\nEnhanced knowledge of methodologies overseas\r\nIncreased understanding of education systems in Europe \r\nIncreased knowledge of national and local educational policies\r\nImproved quality of staff members work with children, application of new teaching methods\r\nIncreased staff motivation and satisfaction in the field of Early Years\r\nBetter partnerships locally, nationally and across Europe\r\nRaising attainment of all children irrespective of gender, background or socio-economic factors\r\nEnhanced Leadership and Management knowledge of pedagogy and European Policy\r\nInnovation in the creative curriculum \r\nCascading knowledge to stakeholders such as parents, governors and other local schools and Children's Centres\r\n\r\nThe attendance at training will enable Emneth to incorporate international perspectives into current practices, effectively learning from all of the best teaching methods from the UK and EU. This will significantly raise our own teaching standards, resulting in narrowing the gap for our most vulnerable families and children and impacting on social mobility. \r\n\r\nWe hope that staff will gain greater confidences and insight into international practices that will give them the aspiration to develop and potentially train beyond their existing qualification levels e.g.. to degree/Masters level.", "http://www.emneth-nur.norfolk.sch.uk/", "Emneth Nursery School & Children's Centre", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035514_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PE14"}
