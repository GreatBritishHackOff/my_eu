An individual professional technique will also be studied during the 14-day course. The foreign host companies will nominate a tutor for the apprentices: this person will provide guidance, advice and training and will follow the progress of the young people during their mobility period. The above-mentioned Chambers of Trades and Crafts (CMA) will be in charge of implementing the call for applications and selecting the successful candidates amongst those apprentices interested in a period of mobility. They will furthermore be responsible for organising every aspect of the trip - logistics, travel, accommodation as well as producing written feedback on the experience that will, in particular, analyse the positive aspects and identify areas for improvement (impact assessment, giving out results, methods to improve future mobility periods).
