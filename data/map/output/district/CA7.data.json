On the other hand, the project aims the operational integration of different intelligent technologies or smart devices to provide to the packaging value chain more information about the products and the processes, increase safety and quality of products through supply chain and improve the shelf-life of the packaged products. In both cases, the application of more flexible alternative processes and more environmentally sustainable and efficient technologies will be considered. The project includes the design, development, optimization and manufacturing of multifunctional smart packages, assuring compliance of environmental requirements through LCA and LCC analysis, managing nanotechnology risk through the whole packaging value chain, and finally, end user evaluation in different sectors as cosmetic, pharmaceutic and food industry. The project results and the high impact reached through a wide range of technologies utilized will boost the European Packaging Industry to a higher level.", 135927.0, 6159955.0, "DIBBIOPACK", "Bio-based smart packaging materials", "New multifunctional bio-based containers with inherent monitoring capabilities promise to revolutionise food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry. Recyclability and biodegradability are added benefits for the environment.", "EU-funded scientists representing 19 partner institutions in 10 countries have joined forces to develop new nano-based bioplastic packaging with enhanced properties and smart monitoring capabilities within the scope of the project http://www.dibbiopack.eu/ (DIBBIOPACK) . Target industries are currently the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food sectors but applications are virtually limitless.\n\nDevelopment work is focused on polylactic acid (PLA), a 100 % bio-originated material made primarily from fermentation of the sugars in corn. Combining PLA with nano-additives could break new ground in a huge market, including films made by extrusion laminating, trays and lids created by injection moulding, and bottles produced by extrusion blow moulding.\n\nThe biodegradable packaging materials will exhibit improved thermal, mechanical and barrier properties, and be produced with sustainability and process safety in mind. Furthermore, they will incorporate intelligent technologies or smart devices to monitor oxygen levels, impart anti-microbial activity and enable traceability throughout the value chain.\n\nDuring the first project period, scientists produced the first formulations employing PLA together with plasticisers and nano-additives and tested them in trial moulds. In addition, the team evaluated current state-of-the-art organically modified ceramic (Ormocer\u00ae)-based antimicrobial coatings for future comparison with the new bio-based antimicrobial coating materials. Scientists also developed an ultra-sensitive oxygen sensor that will aid in increasing the shelf life of packaged products and ensuring their safety and quality throughout their life cycle.\n\nPartners are already focusing on the technology's future after the end of the project. They developed a questionnaire that will enable data collection for the life-cycle assessment, carried out a preliminary market analysis and held a seminar on exploitation strategy that resulted in the preparation of a commercialisation plan.\n\nWith its new bio-nanocomposite packaging materials and processing technologies, DIBBIOPACK is poised for major impact on the safety and quality of products in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food sectors. The sustainable materials will be a very attractive alternative to current petroleum-based ones for producers and consumers alike. The antimicrobial and oxygen-sensing capabilities should find extensive application in numerous other fields. Taken together, DIBBIOPACK promises impressive returns on the EU's investment.", "http://www.dibbiopack.eu/", "http://www.innoviafilms.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20141119135927.jpg", "fp7_102486_998385887"], ["9PD", "Surface functionalisation of cellulose matrices using cellulose embedded nano-particles", "Innovia Films Limited", "The projects main R&amp;T objective is to create new, smart and bio-based surface nanostructured polymer composites showing exceptional surface functionality (mechanical, chemical, selective interaction properties).
