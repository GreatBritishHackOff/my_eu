Target industries are currently the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food sectors but applications are virtually limitless.\n\nDevelopment work is focused on polylactic acid (PLA), a 100 % bio-originated material made primarily from fermentation of the sugars in corn. Combining PLA with nano-additives could break new ground in a huge market, including films made by extrusion laminating, trays and lids created by injection moulding, and bottles produced by extrusion blow moulding.\n\nThe biodegradable packaging materials will exhibit improved thermal, mechanical and barrier properties, and be produced with sustainability and process safety in mind. Furthermore, they will incorporate intelligent technologies or smart devices to monitor oxygen levels, impart anti-microbial activity and enable traceability throughout the value chain.\n\nDuring the first project period, scientists produced the first formulations employing PLA together with plasticisers and nano-additives and tested them in trial moulds. In addition, the team evaluated current state-of-the-art organically modified ceramic (Ormocer\u00ae)-based antimicrobial coatings for future comparison with the new bio-based antimicrobial coating materials. Scientists also developed an ultra-sensitive oxygen sensor that will aid in increasing the shelf life of packaged products and ensuring their safety and quality throughout their life cycle.\n\nPartners are already focusing on the technology's future after the end of the project. They developed a questionnaire that will enable data collection for the life-cycle assessment, carried out a preliminary market analysis and held a seminar on exploitation strategy that resulted in the preparation of a commercialisation plan.\n\nWith its new bio-nanocomposite packaging materials and processing technologies, DIBBIOPACK is poised for major impact on the safety and quality of products in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food sectors. The sustainable materials will be a very attractive alternative to current petroleum-based ones for producers and consumers alike.

Also, house service gastronomy, social services and crafts provides employment opportunities. These professions have some needed skills in common. Parts of the training you can provided for all of them in the same way and to learn about different subjects help to improve the employment opportunities for the trainees. Young people are looking for job opportunities mostly in large cities this already starts with the training. They are missing in the rural regions as an apprentice & to keep the rural economy and the social live. Farms and enterprises in the rural economy have problems finding stuff for the training and the jobs. It is necessary to actively develop concepts and trainings that which is attractive and innovative. The trainees are to be enabled to be flexible in their profession. They must have craft skills, to provide services & respond flexibly to structural changes in the regions & enterprises. People from rural regions are supported and qualified by their travel experience. They will be able to acquire knowledge from other countries and use it in their field of profession.\r\nThe attractiveness of the training must be strengthened with good training models and interesting job opportunities. Similar tasks are existing in the regions in which our participants travel. How do they deal with the problems, what do they do, what solutions do they offer & how is this connected with the training? The trip helps to learn about different ways of vocational education and training. The participants should use this knowledge to further develop the training in their own company. With the project, we are working on one element to stop young people leaving the rural regions. It is our goal to enable apprentices and trainers to look beyond their own chances, to promote the internationalization of professional qualifications & to incorporate good practice skills into vocational education and training.\r\nThere are a total of 84 trainees, who are traveling. They come from the background of forestry and agriculture, horticulture, housekeeping, gastronomy, social and health care. Trainees in the second and third year of apprenticeships travel, then they have already gained some professional knowledge. In the fields of house care & social assistance, many trainees are involved with limited opportunities. They travel mainly to Spain and Cyprus. The traveling trainers are employees of HVHS, trainers of the companies in our networks & teachers of our regional vocational schools. Topics for the professions are agriculture and forestry are renewable energy, use of natural materials & land use. They are engaged in the use & processing of regional products & health careers in the field of nutrition & home care. The participants will learn about the educational structures provided in the partner countries. The training of the participants is based on solutions for how the rural economy must react to structural and climate change, demographic changes and how to make use of synergy effects between the professional groups. The work of the Partners is surveyed and applicable possibilities for the Training are transferred. The partner institutions and their network partners have interesting solutions, many of which can also be used in the German rural regions. Trainees & trainers are involved in the theoretical and practical activities of our partner institutions. The aim of the project is to test modules of training and to develop concepts for the use of renewable resources. The use of local products for foodstuffs and the provision of services is one other task to survey. The trainers are from defendant backgrounds   and different training institutions. They will visit different training organizations and study the contents of the provided training. The aim is to examine the similarities of professions and the possibilities to work on comparable professional qualifications in Europe. This gives us new training and education opportunities. The involved instructors and trainees are to be taught to pass on and apply knowledge acquired by the partners. They will get to know & understand concepts of the partner regions. They pass it on to other apprentices & employees in their home region. Some of the education modules shown were developed in the TOI projects GreenVillage & VastView. One result of the project will be the extension of contacts with partners in other countries and the extension of the Network in Germany. This helps a further development of the cooperation.

Good paid jobs for young people in rural areas short. On the other hand, companies have increasing problems of finding suitable candidates for the training and must respond by teaching job switchers and the preparation of low performance Trainees. Therefore, it is necessary that the education and training is actively working on concepts to apprentices and workers craft skills to serve the rural economy. This is why it is essential that the education and training system actively works on concepts to provide trainees and workers with skills and services that serve the rural economy. Companies should be supplied with suitable workers. Due to the exodus of the past 2 decades, well-qualified people are often not found to replace older workers. Persons in the region must be supported and qualified. The program looks for opportunities and solutions from the partners, to effectively promoted the profession of food processing. For this purpose, appropriate content and training forms have to be developed. Similar problems are in the region where the participants travel to. This is why the stay is so valuebil to deal with the forms of vocational training offered to use this knowledge for the training in Germany.\r\nThe small enterprises are an important part of the rural economy. By returning to high-quality products ans slow food concept, there is a growing opportunity to offer new products and services. In this project, trainers and trainees from the food prosessing sector  will look et the forms of production of the partner and countries. They get to know the training offered in the partner countries. In addition, the production and processing of foodstuffs and delicacies unusual in Germany plays an important role in this project. The forms of education are based on concepts that adapt the rural economy to structural and demographic changes. To achieve this, new variants, ideas and possibilities must often be introduced, and a visit to the partner institutions is an important source of informations. Many trainees and workers are hardly able to meet the high demands placed on quality by the German economy. The aim here is to find ways to reconcile the trainees' abilities and the demands of the companies with suitable training opportunities. The partners have interesting solutions and some different approaches. There are similar problems in the regions visited and the partners have interesting solutions, many of this also can by used in the rural regions of eastern Germany. The aim of the project is to investigate solutions for the use of regional products and to examine the educational modules specifically offered by the partners for the extent to which they can be used for training in Germany. This provides an offer for training and further education in Germany. In addition, the instructors and trainees involved will be given the courage and confidence to pass on and apply the acquired knowledge to the partners. Through the stay et the partners the traveling persons acquire knowledge of niche products and will get to know and understand special knowledge about the production and marketing concepts of the partner regions. In their home region, they pass these on to other trainees & employees of the participating companies, thereby supporting the participating educational networks. The training modules shown were developed partly in the TOI projects Green Village & Vast View & are coordinated with ECVET. One result of the project will be the expansion of contacts with domestic and foreign co-operation partners. This results in a strengthening of the cooperation and a dissemination of the developed training programs. Networking is encouraged. Participants are instructors and staff responsible for the training of trainees, teaching pictures of the handicraft food processing from rural areas. For the trainees, the stay is usually the first working contact with people from another European country. It is especially important that they learn that you can achieve something with other concepts, tools and working methods.

New technologies like remote sensing, forest fire monitoring and GIS (Geographic information systems) are adapted in modern forestry.  Public awareness has been raised towards forest protection, recognizing forest's important role towards offering wood and non-wood products and services as well as mitigating the adverse impacts of accelerating climate change.\r\n\r\nOur past experience since 1998 has showed that the co- operation with other European partners,  the sharing of experiences and skills and  knowledge of European policies, are ways to achieve improvements both in the field of sustainable forest management and forest education in Cyprus. \r\n\r\nAccording to the European Forest Strategy and the new Forest Policy for Cyprus forests, the main objectives of forest management are:  The Environmental Social and Protective functions of the forests, the conservation of flora, fauna and ecosystems, the protection of forests from fires, the expansion of the forest cover through reforestation and afforestation works, the  preservation of biodiversity and natural heritage, the forest recreation and amenity, the conservation of water and soil erosion control, the protection and the sustainable development of areas adjacent to forest and particularly the development of areas near various communities to encourage eco tourism.  All these objectives require a well educated and widely experienced forest personnel able to carry out effectively dedicated mission.\r\n \r\nFor this proposed project our main objective is to \"provide an up- skilling\" for forest trainers in fields of sustainable forest management operating vocational education and training for the Cyprus Forest Sector and downstream improvement of skills in the workforce.

Participating staff will benefit from placing their own training in a wider European context. Travelling tutors will not only explore new skills, methods, approaches and techniques but will also share their own experiences with host organisations. This experience will give staff access to new ideas and approaches to training which will have a positive impact on their own training delivery. This will ultimately benefit vocational students of the tutor and enable the tutor to pass on new skills and information with a broader European scope.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs outlined in our VMC application and internationalisation strategy, all participants will be undertaking ECVET units within the Grampus Green Village curriculum, whilst we continue to work closely with our network of UK partner colleges. In addition, archaeology students will complete the relevant modules of the Archaeology Skills Passport qualification with complimentary learning outcomes recorded and accredited through the Green Village ECVET curriculum.\r\n\r\nWe are including one new receiving partner in this project. The Hellenic Cultural Centre were visited by Grampus staff in 2016 after expressing enthusiasm for cooperation. They have good experience of hosting international groups, professional language tutors and well established accommodation facilities with dedicated and experienced mentoring staff. They work in close cooperation with archaeological research projects on the island of Santorini (Akrotiri and ancient Thera) and also have good links with craft practitioners on the island. In line with our internationalisation strategy, the addition of this new partner has been carefully considered but deemed to be strategically beneficial in the skills, training and experience they bring to the partnership. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the VET learners and staff, the project will also fund 29 accompanying persons. Each flow of VET learners will benefit from the presence of an accompanying person for some, or all, of the placement duration depending upon the age and experience of the participants. In line with our safeguarding policy and guidance issued by the European Commission, accompanying persons are included at a ratio of one to every 10 participants.  The main role will be to provide pastoral care and support to our participants and to monitor the structure of the placement and ensure safe working practice and effective support is in place.\r\n\r\nIn all of our project development and mobility actions we agree to abide by the 10 principles outlined in the 2006 European Quality Charter for Mobility.
