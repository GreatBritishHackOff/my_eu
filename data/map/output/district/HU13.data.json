The total world trade of seafood has reached in 2004 a record export value of almost \u20ac54 billion, representing a 23% growth relative to 2000. Analysis of trends in the seafood industry shows new business opportunities in new innovative value added products in terms of convenience and health. Ready-to cook or ready-to-eat products, coated products and other value-added items constitue a fast-growing industry. The European stockfish industry - producing matured and dried gutted whole fish (round fish) from lean fish, mainly cod, but also ling, tusk, haddock and saithe - is facing several problems to follow the new market trend and to be competitive. Today, the stockfish production is still performed outdoors, where the fish is hanging unprotected on wooden rack using the sun and wind to dry. The stockfish product quality varies greatly with varying weather conditions. Today, up to 40% of the stockfish product is lost due to poor process quality. Our idea is to develop an innovative indoor process line for the maturing and drying of stockfish equipped with an Automated Bioprocess Control System to assure seafood safety and quality and will be of use for quality drying of gutted and de-headed round fish in general. We propose to use innovative Microsystem Technology (MST) and developing a miniaturised low-cost sensing platform. An automated bioprocess control system will be developed to monitor and control the maturing and drying processes. This allows reducing the production time by a factor of 4, from 4 months down to 30 days by accelerating the maturing and drying process through optimising production parameters.", 251106.0, 1203366.0, "SAFETRACKFOOD", "Indoor fish-drying system developed", "In a bid to keep the air-dried fish market competitive, researchers are developing a controlled industrial process for drying fish.", "Although a major industry, air-dried cod, haddock and other stockfish productions experience losses of up to 40\u00a0% because the drying process is uncontrolled.\nThe losses are mostly due to bacterial and fungal spoiling, but freezing damage, insect larvae and unreliable weather conditions also play a role.The EU-funded http://www.safetrackfood.eu (SAFETRACKFOOD) project aims to develop and test an environment-controlled indoor process for stockfish production.\nThis will reduce losses due to environmental exposure and bacterial infections, and it will reduce production time by a factor of four.Researchers already investigated product specifications and legal requirements for stockfish production, using this information to define a safe and hygienic process.\nIn addition, weather data was compared to fish weight loss and water content to identify the optimal environmental conditions for stockfish production.SAFETRACKFOOD has furthermore identified the most common contaminating bacteria, as well as the volatile compounds associated with them.\nThis information will be used to design a sensor system to quickly identify stockfish contamination.Based on project outcomes thus far, a prototype drying unit has been designed and installed at a research institute for testing.\nIt includes a quality control unit where several sensors will be housed, as well as an automated data collection and storage system.", "http://www.safetrackfood.eu/", "http://www.afosgroup.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112431.jpg", "fp7_105663_953616895"], ["9PB", "Commercialisation of Ventura Habitat - a novel wind turbine blade maintenance enclosure tomaximize downtime productivity", "Gev Wind Power Limited", "GEV Wind Power is one of Europe's leading wind-turbine maintenance companies with teams working on more than 40 wind farms both on and offshore every year. With a presence throughout Europe and North America, GEV Wind Power is a truly global service provider. We understand that it is important to wind energy maintenance companies to find new ways of delivering core services to reduce the cost of energy provision. To realise this vision, we commit significant financial resources to in-house R&D and are constantly looking at technologies that fit well for Wind Energy. We have now developed a patented habitat solution that retrofits to market available access platforms. This creates the perfect protective working environment for blade maintenance and repairs to be completed. Maintenance productivity is increased and, with the added benefit of 24 hour working, GEV Wind Power are able to eliminate the cost uncertainty of weather downtime and will help wind farm owners reduce maintenance costs, improve Annual Energy Production (AEP) and the competitiveness of wind generated energy.\nTrials completed onshore with our Ventura Habitat prototype using two different access platforms (Power Climber and Kaeufer) in varying weather conditions and ranging between 30 metres and 100 metres high, with successful deployment demonstrating the flexibility and operability of the Habitat in a real-life environment. The overall objective of this development project is to create a commercially ready Ventura Habitat system, with validated results through field trials. This will enable us to achieve our overall commercial objective to become the leading blade maintenance services provider in Europe and North America. We forecast a total revenue of \u20ac20 million and a profit of \u20ac5 million 5 years post-commercialisation, with a breakeven on investment after 3.43 years and an ROI of 150%.", 43994.0, 62849.0, "Ventura Habitat", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_215883_911118964"]]}}, "outwardCode": "HU13"}
