Gibson & Co Limited", "Natural stone industry has a crucial importance at European level, and the overall worldwide demand for natural stone products is experiencing a steady growth; however, in the last years globalization is transforming the competitive scenario at a fast pace, with high technology available to most of worldwide players, who are able to offer good alternatives at extremely affordable prices; quality alone is therefore not able to keep up with the price gap, and the result is that the traditional European sculpturing and artistic stone processing is becoming an endangered art.\nIt\u2019s mandatory that the processes of artistic stone processing urgently evolves technologically to remain competitive in the international market, maintaining the inimitable artistic touch, at the same time keeping up with the new industrial requirements in terms of productivity and lean manufacturing.\nThe main goal of the AROSU project is to advance and facilitate traditional artisan and art-work with new technologies, helping the European stone industry to lower their production costs by automating various production steps through a new flexible production concept. AROSU will implement a novel production concept able to extend industrial robot usage as an active assistant during the complex and demanding artistic work of hard natural stone carving. This will be achieved through the implementation of a novel robot cell able to produce artistic looking surfaces by implementing the following core components. 1) new robot mounted pneumatic chisel tool; 2)automated path generation from geometry data provided by a design interface for architects and artists. With AROSU it will be possible to improve the competitiveness of the stone processing industry, by drastically increasing the production efficiency through a novel co-operative workspace, in which sculptors and the robotic work-cell can jointly work on the natural product, with a vast range of different products with different sizes.", 205408.0, 1193212.0, "AROSU", "Ancient artistic stone processing meets modern technology", "Europe accounts for one third of global natural stone production and has the highest per capita consumption in the world. An EU initiative is tackling technological challenges that threaten the stone industry's competitiveness.", "A major strength of the EU's natural stone sector is the considerable amount of historic monuments, buildings and pavements in need of renovation or restoration. The industry is undergoing rapid change due to technological advances that endanger time-honoured European sculpturing and artistic stone processing. There is a need to integrate new and enabling technologies while preserving the art of stone processing.\n\nTo help achieve this, the EU-funded http://www.arosu.eu/ (AROSU) (Artistic robotic surface processing for stone) project is implementing an innovative robotic fabrication process that will construct artistic stone surfaces through conventional techniques. By automating different production steps, artists, artisans, sculptors and designers can then focus on intricate and demanding methods such as chiselling.\n\nDuring the first reporting period, work began on the robot-aided processing and accompanying tools and peripherals. Project partners defined end-user and system requirements and identified technical specifications. They also analysed manual stone processing techniques in use today.\n\nChiselling tools for the robot were designed and a hammering tool was defined. The project team designed a programme that takes data from an image and turns it into code. This code then instructs the robot to cut a complex surface structure into stone.\n\nWith a novel solution that processes stone quickly and safely, AROSU intends to reduce production costs by more than 50\u00a0% while maintaining the superior quality of European products. The industry stands to benefit with a reduced target price, making natural stones more affordable to a greater number of customers.", "http://www.arosu.eu/", "http://www.shop.g-gibson.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-07/159154.jpg", "fp7_111176_951893981"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LS25"}
