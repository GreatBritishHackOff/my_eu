Gibson & Co Limited", "Natural stone industry has a crucial importance at European level, and the overall worldwide demand for natural stone products is experiencing a steady growth; however, in the last years globalization is transforming the competitive scenario at a fast pace, with high technology available to most of worldwide players, who are able to offer good alternatives at extremely affordable prices; quality alone is therefore not able to keep up with the price gap, and the result is that the traditional European sculpturing and artistic stone processing is becoming an endangered art.\nIt\u2019s mandatory that the processes of artistic stone processing urgently evolves technologically to remain competitive in the international market, maintaining the inimitable artistic touch, at the same time keeping up with the new industrial requirements in terms of productivity and lean manufacturing.\nThe main goal of the AROSU project is to advance and facilitate traditional artisan and art-work with new technologies, helping the European stone industry to lower their production costs by automating various production steps through a new flexible production concept. AROSU will implement a novel production concept able to extend industrial robot usage as an active assistant during the complex and demanding artistic work of hard natural stone carving. This will be achieved through the implementation of a novel robot cell able to produce artistic looking surfaces by implementing the following core components. 1) new robot mounted pneumatic chisel tool; 2)automated path generation from geometry data provided by a design interface for architects and artists. With AROSU it will be possible to improve the competitiveness of the stone processing industry, by drastically increasing the production efficiency through a novel co-operative workspace, in which sculptors and the robotic work-cell can jointly work on the natural product, with a vast range of different products with different sizes.", 205408.0, 1193212.0, "AROSU", "Ancient artistic stone processing meets modern technology", "Europe accounts for one third of global natural stone production and has the highest per capita consumption in the world. An EU initiative is tackling technological challenges that threaten the stone industry's competitiveness.", "A major strength of the EU's natural stone sector is the considerable amount of historic monuments, buildings and pavements in need of renovation or restoration. The industry is undergoing rapid change due to technological advances that endanger time-honoured European sculpturing and artistic stone processing. There is a need to integrate new and enabling technologies while preserving the art of stone processing.\n\nTo help achieve this, the EU-funded http://www.arosu.eu/ (AROSU) (Artistic robotic surface processing for stone) project is implementing an innovative robotic fabrication process that will construct artistic stone surfaces through conventional techniques. By automating different production steps, artists, artisans, sculptors and designers can then focus on intricate and demanding methods such as chiselling.\n\nDuring the first reporting period, work began on the robot-aided processing and accompanying tools and peripherals. Project partners defined end-user and system requirements and identified technical specifications. They also analysed manual stone processing techniques in use today.\n\nChiselling tools for the robot were designed and a hammering tool was defined. The project team designed a programme that takes data from an image and turns it into code. This code then instructs the robot to cut a complex surface structure into stone.\n\nWith a novel solution that processes stone quickly and safely, AROSU intends to reduce production costs by more than 50\u00a0% while maintaining the superior quality of European products. The industry stands to benefit with a reduced target price, making natural stones more affordable to a greater number of customers.", "http://www.arosu.eu/", "http://www.shop.g-gibson.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-07/159154.jpg", "fp7_111176_951893981"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5PN", "Sukces dziecka w naszych r\u0119kach", "Monk Fryston Voluntary Controlled Church of England Primary School", 57459.0, "Modern eduction for every student, disabled too, has been our kidergarten's aim for many years. We believe that strong basis which they get in kindergarten will help them to achieve good results at school and to live in a present world. They will become confident and aware of their self - esteem and it will prevent from exclusion from our educational system. It concerns also disabled children, we treat them in the same way as every child. Our educational offer includes a participation of them, too. Such intentions are possible thanks to open staff of our institition: teaching and admistrative - service. That is why our staff is willing to upskill within Action 1 in Erasmus+ program. We wish to realize eTwinning projects and Action 2 in Erasmus+ program.\r\nThe main goal of the project is improving the quality of education in our kindergarten by creating conditions for acquiring professional and linguistic competencies connected with specificity of the institution. It contributes to achiving the best results of work with a child, including disabled children and their families.\r\nDetailed objectives include participants' needs which were indicated in carried out diagnosis and analysis of needs. Implementation of a project will completely fulfil these needs, which concern mainly:\r\n- improving and enhancement of pedagogical - psychological qualifications related with work with a child, including disabled children and their families\r\n- using innovative methods of teching English language during work with a child\r\n- enhancement of using communicative English language in order to make it easier to implement bilingualism and innovation based on immersion method (2 teachers working with children: in mother tongue and English language) \r\n- getting ability of practical using ICT technolgy during work with a child\r\n- getting experience within institution's organization of work\r\nThe aim of our activity is implementing innovative, methodological - curricular and organizational, solutions at pre - school level. We believe that teaching certain competencies will benefit at further levels of education. \r\nAchieving these objectives will be realized by following activities within 67 mobilities for 31 person:\r\n1. Attending Intensive English courses by the headteacher of our institution which will correspond to her individul needs: director as a businessman, entrepreneur, leader.\r\n2. Attending English courses by teaching and administrative - service staff in order to gain the skill to communicate in English language.\r\n3. Attending methodological courses within teaching children English language in order to use creative methods of work and multimedia technologies\r\n4. Attending methodological courses for specialists within using various methods of work with children with disfunctions, especially for autistic children.\r\n5. Taking part in job shadowing by representatives of particular communities of kindergarten (headteacher, administration, teachers). Institutions invited for partnership completely belong to implementation of objectives and assumptions related to described needs. Both of them, Turkish - Erzurum and English, teach English. Getting experience in different areas is particularly valuable: English - speaking institution where mother tongue is English and institution which teaches Englsih using immersion (2 teachers working with children: English - speaking and Polish - speaking).\r\nMoreover, institution from Antalya, Turkey will increase our experience and skills in the range of work with a disabled child.\r\nAccording to objectives, participation in a project will contribute to better affecting on child and families. All the skills and experience acquired by teachers will basic abilities, new linguistic competencies and high quality of education. Implementation of a project will indicate to municipality particularly the importance of acquired experience in order to enhance workers' professional competencies and high standards of education. Moreover, it will indicate the importance of lifelong education. It will encourage parents to use new possibilities and methods of work with a child in order to achieve good effects and prepare them to live in constantly modifying reality. Participation in a project will encourage teaching staff from other institutions to acquire professional competencies and experience from different educational systems as a way to success during work with children and their families.
