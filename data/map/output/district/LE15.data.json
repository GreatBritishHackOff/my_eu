The aim is to use natural extracts from plant sources with the potential to be used as biocide adjuvants for the chemical sector. The study will focus on the inclusion of adjuvants of an antioxidant nature of synthetic and natural origin in commercially-available formulations of domestic insecticidal and/or fungicidal products, and industrial pesticide products. Natural adjuvants will be those deriving from plant, fruit and vegetable residues such as pine bark and grape seeds and from medicinal plant extracts. The inclusion of these adjuvants will enable the percentage of customarily-used biocide to be reduced in formulations so as to thus obtain pest-control substances of a more environmentally-friendly nature. The two areas of application will be against urban pest insects and for wood preservation against xylophagous insects and fungi. The main objective of this project involves studying the synergism between antioxidant bioactive molecules of different types and synthetic biocides included within the new European Biocide Directive 98/8/CE (BPD), for the development of new pesticide products whose performance features may clearly help to distinguish them from other products available on the market. Using this strategy, the aim is for the resulting anti-pest product to be competitive both economically and effectively with regard to those existing on the market whose biocidal characteristics are unquestionable, albeit problematical due to their high level of toxicity.", 178566.0, 1179088.0, "BIMOSYN", "Synergising eco-friendly pesticides", "Biocides are chemicals commonly used in pesticides and wood protectors to protect against flies, cockroaches, termites, wood-rotting fungi and other pests.

Scientists investigated the use of promising plant extracts from antioxidant-type and medicinal-type plants in certain insecticides and fungicides. Their aim was to reduce the toxic chemical concentration while increasing their efficacy against pests.\n\nScientists were highly successful in their endeavours and several breakthroughs were achieved. After screening several extracts, two compounds were shortlisted for use in wood protection and urban pesticide products. Tests were carried out to enhance synergy with selected chemicals and optimise the extract-to-biocide ratios.\n\nProject partners successfully increased wood resistance against fungal degradation and xylophagous insects such as termites and bark beetles by using these extracts with wood protectors. Several insecticides combined with extracts showed better house fly control than insecticides alone.\n\nProject partners developed water-based biocide prototype formulations for urban pests and wood protection that demonstrated good chemical stability and biological efficacy after optimising the extraction process. In accordance with European standards, their effectiveness and ecotoxicity against certain fungi, termites and Hylotrupes larvae were tested with promising results.\n\nBIMOSYN members then worked on industrial validation of their prototypes through real case scenarios such as testing timber impregnation with formulations in an autoclave. Fungicides showed wood penetration up to 20\u00a0mm and passed criteria for use in fences and doors not permanently exposed to fresh or salt water. Insecticides demonstrated effectiveness against cockroaches but were not commercially viable due to the plant extract extraction and addition process.\n\nSMEs are working on commercialising the wood protector and sprayable insecticide products after further optimisation and patenting.
