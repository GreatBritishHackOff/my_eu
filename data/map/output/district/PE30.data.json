Learning mobility, a means of openness, personal and professional enrichment, development of ambition and motivation, is at the heart of this priority. \r\nCIME_pro 17 project is an emblematic action of this policy.\r\nInter-academic consortium of European Mobility in vocational education and training, CIME_pro 17 engages 31 vocational high schools around the GIP FORINVAL in a project deployed on the territory of the \"academic region\" for a larger impact.\r\n\r\nThanks to the PIMEN projects on Lille side, MOPIC / MOPAAM on Amiens side, CALME_sco, the first inter-academic project, our teams have gradually developed a solid experience in the construction, management, implementation and dissemination of learning mobility projects. This project reflects a common, lasting and growing policy of the Academic Delegations to European and International Relations and Cooperation (DAREIC), working closely together for the entire regional educational community.\r\n\r\nThe CIME_pro 17 project:\r\n- complements the offer of mobility projects on our territory: MOBinov or PIMEN5 projects for vocational education and training, CALME_sco or MOPAAM16_perso for school staff, CALME_sup for higher education students.\r\n- fosters the common will of our academic teams to work together thanks to mobility projects implemented at the inter-academic level (Lille - Amiens): CALME_sco 2015-2017, CALME_sup 2017-2019, CIME_pro 17.\r\n- pursues the networking of our institutions providing vocational training at the local level (with local economic partners), at the inter-academic level (between institutions of our two academies), at European level (with foreign host partners) .\r\n\r\nCIME_pro 17 gives the opportunity to 535 young people from 31 of our vocational high schools to carry out a period of vocational training abroad, mainly young people from disadvantaged socio-professional categories, with little or no appetite for mobility, and for whom, professional and personal future is largely obscured by social problems.\r\n\r\nA steering committee, composed of representatives from each member institution and the inter-academic coordination team (DAREICs - GIP), will be the decision-making body of the project and will meet on a quarterly basis.\r\n\r\nThe dissemination activities will be numerous and will concern all the people involved, especially during the inter-academic days of learning mobility that will be organized on our territory.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the project will be significant:\r\n\r\nOn the school career of beneficiairy students:\r\n- development of their interest in mobility, transnational professional mobility becoming a reality for many of them\r\n- increased professional, entrepreneurial, interpersonal, intercultural, linguistic and social skills\r\n- reinforcement of their autonomy, ambition and motivation (increased rate of access to higher education)\r\n\r\nOn the 160 accompanying staff members or teachers who will carry out a training period abroad, and/or on members of the project teams within the beneficiary institutions\r\n- enriching career paths and developing their professional, intercultural and linguistic skills\r\n- professionalization of educational teams in project management\r\n\r\nOn the concerned structures:\r\n- contribution to achieving the objectives of school projects in terms of European and international openness\r\n- amplification of the local and inter-academic influence of the sending schools\r\n- qualitative and quantitative improvement in the school guidance of lower-secondary-school students to these high schools.\r\n- enrichment and sustainability of partnerships at European level (host partners abroad) and at the local level (reception of foreign students for institutions that implement reciprocal exchanges)\r\n\r\nWithin our inter-academic territory (Hauts-de-France region)\r\n- Networking of schools and enhanced cooperation between our two academies\r\n- Harmonization and pooling of practices\r\n\r\nCIME_pro 17 is an essential and ambitious project for a territory with major challenges.", "http://www.cwa.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036071_2"], ["2QW", "2015-1-FI01-KA109-009223", "THE COLLEGE OF WEST ANGLIA", 179988.0, "The main strategy for 2016 \u2013 2020 of Vocational Education Center Sedu has paid a special focus on an international vision: Sedu \u2013 pioneer in competence for us and the world. Vision remarks further with the statement: Sedu supports internationalization and works daringly in global networks; according to this mission, we develop international operations.  Sedu wishes to works as a pioneer of internationalization with collaboration between its regional and international partners.  International mobility numbers are used as measure for the development work and an indicator for the success of the strategy.\r\n\r\nSedu has invested in advancement of international mobility and aims for the controlled growth of both student and staff mobility. Mobilities are financed by Erasmus + programme, education centre\u2019s own funds and with the project funds from Finnish Board of Education. \r\n\r\nThe quality of the mobility periods of the students and staff that funded by the Mobility Charter have been the significant part of our school\u2019s international operations. Alongside the mobilities the home internationalization is the second key priority of the international operations. Vocational Education Center Sedu also accepts big amounts of students from our foreign educational partners, which also supports our home internationalization.\r\n\r\nAccording to the mobility statistics of the year 2016 the long term exchange periods of the students has been significantly grown since the previous year, and steady growth is expected in the future.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we seek to ensure the equal opportunity participation in mobility periods for students from all sectors and all ages. Boys have been less interested in the past for participating in exchange periods and so in the future we will give more attention to this fact in the recruitment process. We will also give more attention to the fields that have been participating less in exchanges in the past and additionally the VALMA \u2013 preparatory training students are guaranteed to participate in the mobilities equally with the assistance of supporting staff for the whole period.\r\n\r\nAdult education and apprenticeship-training students\u2019 interest towards international activities is increasing and Sedu is dedicated to increase the demand further. In the light of the vocational education reform, foreign exchange periods can be seen as one of the natural possibilities for personalization and implementation of the personal education pathway. The individual needs of the student is addressed by the wide variety of international partner networks, that helps us ensure for high quality foreign exchange periods.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, our education centre is active in Education Export and development of the staff\u2019s international skills. Sedu supports staff on their international work placement periods in partner institutions and companies to learn good practices and improve their cross-cultural skills. Besides the initiating immigrant training causes challenges for the staff\u2019s existing skills, the foreign exchange periods can increase staff skills in this point as well.", "http://www.cwa.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA116-034411_6"], ["2QW", "2015-1-FI01-KA109-009226", "THE COLLEGE OF WEST ANGLIA", 114542.0, "Kouvola Region Vocational college will implement mobilities of students and experts on the basis of  Erasmus + VET Mobility Charter 2015-1-FI01-KA109-009226 during 2017-2019. The number of mobilites of Kouvola Region Vocational College is 90-110 students and 30-40 experts/year. The number of students' mobilities depends on the timing of their workplacement periods and the length of the periods is growing.\r\n\r\nStudents are youngsters and adults studying their vocational qualifications in upper secondary level. Experts are teachers, trainers, managers, other personnel and tutors from working life. Students will carry out  workplacement periods of 4-8 weeks and experts job-shadowing-periods of 1-2 weeks in Germany, Spain, UK, Italy, France, Croatia, the Netherlands or Malta. Mobility periods of students and experts will be carried out simultaneously as often as possible. During this project the college will start a new vocational qualification of Sports and Training. It includes a module \"Personal Trainer\", which will be carried out together with our partner Future Focus in Malta. 14 students will carry out three moths training and workplacement period in Malta and one teacher and one tutor from working life will join the training for two weeks.\r\n\r\nThe partner group is old, reliable and includes partners for all of the study fields of college KSAO. It co-operates also in the frames of KA2-projects of their own study fields and developes further contents of the study programs, workplacements periods and experts' exchanges.
