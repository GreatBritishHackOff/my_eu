This will  be required for the investigation into human and physical Geography in Madrid, relating to diversity, city beginnings, buildings and rivers, for comparison with London, and for CLIL teaching.\r\nStaff will return home with improved skills in Geography and Spanish and enhanced CPD, creating a new Unit in Geography that will contain the new learning and accompanying resources, which they will  train other staff in.\r\nAs a result of the one year project, the status of Geography and Spanish at Brettenham will be high profile, and will broaden staff and pupils' European horizons.  Participants of the mobilities will have improved their CPD through having learnt new teaching skills and approaches, and having created new resources which will enliven their lessons and further motivate pupils.\r\nThe potential longer term benefits of broadening the European Dimension through an Erasmus+ KA2 project are that pupils' performance, motivation and understanding of the wider world increase.  For staff, their confidence is boosted, they have renewed enthusiasm for their teaching and more chances for promotion.", "http://www.brettenhamprimaryschool.co.uk", "Brettenham Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035980_coordinator"], ["1HB", "NEW SKILLS FOR EUROPEAN TRAINING SERVICES", "Global Learning & Skills Partnership", 32885.0, "The project aims at improving digital participation/inclusion/engagement activities of our organization within adult education.\r\nit is possible to boost all the international activities and relationship due to the training activities and job shadowing. In a wider way it is possible to know other experiences of teaching and assessing courses and to embed these experiences and  skills inside the organisational assets. Teachers and trainers can have a strong motivation in reporting their experiences to other teachers inside our organisation and especially to tighten stronger relations with stakeholders. These last ones have no possibilities to have experiences about training courses or job shadowing abroad and they can learn and know more only through the trained teachers and staff members.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nA) to empower the learners of our courses as audience developers,  aspiring entrepreneurs and managers of cultural and creative sector. The small and very small businesses, in fact, often does not work using cultural management. Both young business owners and young managers operate through or in cooperation with cultural companies.\r\n\r\nB) to boost competences in new digital way to teach cultural changement, audience development, engagement and inclusion for cultural managers and trainers who work with people who are usually excluded from cultural activities. \r\n\r\nC) to involve in the process some \"cultural entities\" in addition to the traditional arts sectors (performing arts, visual arts, cultural heritage), also including film, TV radio, games, new media, music, books companies, etc . The \"creative industries\" are those that use culture as an input and have a cultural dimension, although their outputs have a functional role (eg. architecture and design).\r\n\r\nD) the acquisition of new skills and new processes thanks to the transnational exchanges between partner's organizations. This can  support the growth of adult learners and managers, (by means of which to learn from others' mistakes or successes), refine their designs with more experienced partners, explore new technologies or expand their contacts, could prove a very useful tool to support the adaptation of our organisation. \r\n\r\nOne of the main objectives is  to improve cultural access within adult education focusing on the enhancement of the creativity and innovation based teaching instruments. We believe that it is possible to do that by simply focusing on our education methodology, thus answering both the educative and social needs that an adult public may have. \r\nThe achievement of a specific objective like that, will have as immediate consequence an overall optimisation of the Applicant\u00b4s performance, not only in the specific field related with education, but in the cultural business as well. So the main reason why the Applicant wants to carry out this project may be summarized with the statement that leading educative activities are a learning process itself, thanks to which the Applicant may learn constantly how to enhance, refine and enrich both the specific adult education actions and the ordinary activities of the association as well, the ones more related to environmental and business matters.\r\nThe focus on audience development and participation will be guarantee by the job shadowing at \"The Audience Agency\"  in Spain at \"Asimetrica\" and Auditorium of Tenerife, in netherlands in Kennisland company. Other further objectives of the projects are: \r\n\r\n- contribute to the promotion of sustainable development of best practices;\r\n- spread the value of local experience in teaching as a social product made by everyday process of qualification;\r\n- provide further learning opportunities for disadvantaged groups of people, improving their basic skills;\r\n- promote social cohesion and active citizenship.", "http://www.global-learning-skills-partnership.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT02-KA104-036083_4"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["1QX", "RAL", "NORTH MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL"], ["1QX", "RAP", "NORTH MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL"], ["1QX", "RP4", "NORTH MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL (GOSH SATELLITE)"], ["1QX", "RRP", "NORTH MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL (PSYCHIATRIC LINK LIASON NURSE SERVICE)"]]}}, "outwardCode": "N18"}
