It will achieve this through providing SME food-processing companies a new food packaging tray that will be lighter that the current marker leader. This prototype will facilitate high-speed stacking, packing and safe transportation of a whole range of food products, with significant carbon footprint reduction, environmental impact and cost savings in materials. The new prototype food tray will utilise 25% less material and will be made from 100% recyclable rPET. This project will facilitate greater cooperation between SMEs of different nations, research institutes and other enterprises, improving the SME\u2019s strategic partnerships and networking for innovation. These SMEs currently have limited research capacity; however, this project will enable better access to the knowledge economy, R&D institutes and exploitation of the latest technological advancements. By providing an efficient, ecologically friendly food tray and transportation system based on new state of the art technology that will need to be developed, which will contribute towards state of the art manufacturing, improved space utilisation, lower production and transportation costs, reduction in carbon footprint by the utilisation of recyclable materials.  Issues surrounding loss of state of the art and increasing production costs within the European plastics industry, highlight the need to be increasingly cost effective, as many areas around the globe, including Europe come under increasing pressure due to lack of raw materials or environmental pressures in terms of landfill waste combined with decreasing oil reserves and soaring prices. \u201cIt is no", null, 1272711.0, "RPET-FC", "Novel plastics technology significantly reduces fossil fuel use", "EU-funded scientists have developed innovative food packaging trays with dramatically enhanced performance, ease of use and decreased carbon footprint compared to the market leader.", "Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the food processing business are facing an increasingly competitive European and international market. For those without extensive technological expertise, developing improved food packaging trays with lower environmental impact and costs is a challenge that is difficult to meet. The EU-funded project http://www.rpet-fc.eu/ ('Environmentally-friendly food-packaging tray with lower carbon footprint') (RPET-FC) brought together five SMEs and three research organisations to address these issues.\n\nScientists developed a tray made from recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) improved in many ways compared to that of the market leader. Investigators developed three different formulations. One is 100\u00a0% post-consumer (PC) rPET. One is 85\u00a0% PC rPET co-extruded with other materials for improved sealing properties. The third is 85\u00a0% PC rPET co-extruded with other components for enhanced gas barrier properties (e.g. up to 70\u00a0% lower oxygen gas transmission and 50\u00a0% lower water vapour transmission). Further, researchers took the opportunity to assess deposition of a natural antibiotic/antioxidant (Citrox) on the packaging. Trials demonstrated successful antimicrobial activity against a wide range of both Gram (-) and Gram (+) bacteria, including Salmonella, Escherichia coli and Campylobacter.\n\nThrough the development of novel rPET thermoforming tools and rPET formulations, researchers achieved 75\u00a0% faster thermoforming speeds and an improvement in cutting accuracy by 90\u00a0%. The trays are also 30\u00a0% lighter due to better material distribution. In addition, the design facilitated high-speed stacking, packing and safe transportation of a variety of foods. Taken together, scientists delivered a superior product with significantly lower material usage, waste and energy consumption for a reduction in carbon footprint in excess of 80\u00a0%.\n\nConsiderable interest has already been generated among many leaders in the food industry. According to expressed needs, partners are planning additional investments to move from a niche market to a European market leader in the manufacture of innovative rPET food trays.

The plastics packaging thermoforming sector in Europe consists of over 1200 companies employing approx. 150,000 people. In excess of 70% of these jobs thermoforming companies are SMEs. This sector faces very significant competitiveness and environmental sustainability issues, which this project will address. The overall objective of the project is to make Europe the leader in low carbon footprint, high-recycled content and long shelf life polymer packaging.\n\nSpecifically the ECOPET project will demonstrate the innovative recycled Polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) technology developed in the RPET-FC FP7 project, which will significantly reduce the weight and carbon footprint of packaging. In conjunction with this lightweight material a high barrier polyester will be applied enabling full recyclability of the packaging. In order to further extend shelf life the performance of a natural antioxidant/anti-microbial sub-micron thick coating will be evaluated.

In order to increase the value of its side streams, PULP2VALUE developed multiple extraction techniques to isolate more valuable products from this large fraction of sugar beet pulp. Roughly 65% of the dry matter mass can be isolated as high value products being: microcellulose fibers (MCF) (33%), arabinose (16%) and galacturonic acid (16%).\n\nThe overall objective of this project is to  further establish the value chains based on MCF, arabinose (Ara) and galacturonic acid (GalA). By demonstrating an integrated and cost-effective cascading biorefinery system to refine sugar beet pulp, Cosun aims to significantly increase (20-50 times) the value of the sugar beet pulp by demonstrating applications for approximately 65% of its mass in high value markets. \n\nFor each of these products PULP2VALUE identified multiple product market combinations (PMC\u2019s). For the MCF fraction application supply chains towards detergents, personal care, oil & gas, paints & coatings and composites are developed. Throughout the years Cosun developed a pilot facility in which the state-of-the-art unit of operations were tested. Together with partners, Cosun is now planning to optimize, integrate and scale-up these processes to a demonstration scale to further supply product development in order to establish long lasting supply chains. \n\nThe PULP2VALUE will target 9 new value chains resulting in a market potential of at least 350.000 tons and a potential revenue of 200 million euro.
