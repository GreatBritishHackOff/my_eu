This prototype will facilitate high-speed stacking, packing and safe transportation of a whole range of food products, with significant carbon footprint reduction, environmental impact and cost savings in materials. The new prototype food tray will utilise 25% less material and will be made from 100% recyclable rPET.

Issues surrounding loss of state of the art and increasing production costs within the European plastics industry, highlight the need to be increasingly cost effective, as many areas around the globe, including Europe come under increasing pressure due to lack of raw materials or environmental pressures in terms of landfill waste combined with decreasing oil reserves and soaring prices. \u201cIt is no", null, 1272711.0, "RPET-FC", "Novel plastics technology significantly reduces fossil fuel use", "EU-funded scientists have developed innovative food packaging trays with dramatically enhanced performance, ease of use and decreased carbon footprint compared to the market leader.", "Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the food processing business are facing an increasingly competitive European and international market. For those without extensive technological expertise, developing improved food packaging trays with lower environmental impact and costs is a challenge that is difficult to meet. The EU-funded project http://www.rpet-fc.eu/ ('Environmentally-friendly food-packaging tray with lower carbon footprint') (RPET-FC) brought together five SMEs and three research organisations to address these issues.\n\nScientists developed a tray made from recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) improved in many ways compared to that of the market leader. Investigators developed three different formulations. One is 100\u00a0% post-consumer (PC) rPET. One is 85\u00a0% PC rPET co-extruded with other materials for improved sealing properties. The third is 85\u00a0% PC rPET co-extruded with other components for enhanced gas barrier properties (e.g. up to 70\u00a0% lower oxygen gas transmission and 50\u00a0% lower water vapour transmission). Further, researchers took the opportunity to assess deposition of a natural antibiotic/antioxidant (Citrox) on the packaging. Trials demonstrated successful antimicrobial activity against a wide range of both Gram (-) and Gram (+) bacteria, including Salmonella, Escherichia coli and Campylobacter.\n\nThrough the development of novel rPET thermoforming tools and rPET formulations, researchers achieved 75\u00a0% faster thermoforming speeds and an improvement in cutting accuracy by 90\u00a0%. The trays are also 30\u00a0% lighter due to better material distribution. In addition, the design facilitated high-speed stacking, packing and safe transportation of a variety of foods. Taken together, scientists delivered a superior product with significantly lower material usage, waste and energy consumption for a reduction in carbon footprint in excess of 80\u00a0%.\n\nConsiderable interest has already been generated among many leaders in the food industry.

The mobility periods have several positive effects: enhancement of students\u2019 autonomous and entrepreneurial attitude, wider perspective for work, extended networks and improved language skills. International experiences enhance students\u2019 self-confidence, improve their problem solving skills and help them to recognize their own strengths and weaknesses and thus, they will be better prepared to work in multicultural environments. These skills ensure also better employability. This project makes a significant contribution for the vision of our VET institution which addresses the focus point of training competent professionals for the Helsinki metropolitan region, in Business Administration as well as in Information and Communication Technologies.\r\n\r\nWe want to ensure the international experiences also for those students who need encouragement and support on their studies. The international mobility period can be a remarkable experience which opens new opportunities for the students. Apart from the BA students, we want to pay special attention for the students in ICT in order to improve both their study motivation and courage. The purpose is to enhance their employability and to encourage to continue further their studies. \r\n\r\nStudents have both short and long on-the-job-learning periods and few of them have prolonged on-the-job-learning program which means the length of the mobility periods varies, but is at least 8 weeks long. Student exchange periods are 6 weeks long which is suitable for the German VET institutions using the dual system.  The exact time will be negotiated with the intermediary organizations beforehand. The partner VET institutions offer support for the student if needed. An on-the-job-learning instructor keeps contact with the work place and with the student and a Finnish teacher undertakes a guidance and monitoring visit to the on-the-job-learning placement during the mobility. At the same time, the teacher can search for new on-the-job-learning placements.  \r\n\r\nIn this project we broaden our partner network so that we can provide even more opportunities for our students and personnel to get acquainted with different cultures, working cultures and education systems. We have new partner schools or organizations in Italy, Poland, Malta and Sweden.  We will be offering the possibility of participating in international mobility for a larger target group as well, as we include also students and staff of Adult learning and recently graduated students.\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of our international partners, we wish to learn new practices and teaching models. The project-based model is common in the current working life and therefore our objective is to develop the project-based learning model at teaching. \r\n\r\nStaff of our VET institution can participate in one week long job shadowing period at a partner VET institution. Teachers have also a possibility to participate in two weeks of teacher exchange. In this case, they will teach lessons in English at the partner VET institution according to their own competences at the same time as a partner teacher is respectively substituting their lessons in Finland. During the exchange period, teachers will follow, participate and discuss about the development of teaching, guidance, working life co-operation and teaching administration. The purpose of the teacher exchanges is to gain new ideas for teaching and development of other activities with mutual comparative analysis. If possible, teachers can combine the job shadowing period to the on-the-job-learning monitoring visits if there are students at the same destination. Students will benefit indirectly from the teachers\u2019 job shadowing periods and teacher exchanges because new teaching methods motivate and inspire students. In addition, teachers will gain a more positive attitude towards international affairs.\r\n\r\nThe objective of our VET institution is to increase the international activities according to our strategy.

This together with discussions on the different sectors has lead to the policy plan of the International office (annex 1). Here we describe a number of goals + activities we will work on the coming years.\r\n\r\nThe big objective is to work towards a curriculum that has an International context. This is a process that takes time. We will start with one course where lessons will be given in English, the teachers involved get the possibility to do a CLIL course or a language course abroad.\r\nTo reach the overall goal we have different smaller goals:\r\n- student mobility, we want to send each year more students to reach te 6% goal the Dutch minister of Education has set.

This year appr. 150 students went abroad for a work placement or a study visit. We hope to increase these numbers every year.\r\nIn the coming month also level 1 students go abroad, with staff to visit Berlin.\r\n\r\nWe are also open for incoming students, every year there are about 30 students coming in, we try to integrate them in the classes of students that have the same course here in Da Vinci Colllege.\r\nIncoming teachers are offered a program in combination with working life, we always expect them to give at least one masterclass on their own expertise.\r\n\r\nOrganizational structure:\r\nIn Da Vinci college there is a platform of contactpersons from the different sectors, they meet 10 times a year to discuss new policy, practical issues concerning mobility or projects. This platform is important because the participants have to translate the ideas to the teams and students. The participants in this platform support the students in all the steps that are needed to go abroad, information, preparation, practical issues, tutoring, validation and dissemination. Also they inform and help the colleagues.\r\nThere is also a strategic platform, herein participate the director of the sector of Bussiness, the coordinator of the international Office and a member of the Board.\r\n\r\nWe use our website and ELO for information and training purposes. We have developed a number of documents and there is a list to control (annex 7). Students are doing a number of tasks before going. Their tutor in the college is deciding which tasks have to be done. Every participant has to write a final report which can be published on the website. Also they have to give a presentation.\r\n\r\nWe work closely with our partners abroad.

This part of the course is now being further developed and embedded across the college. Another learning from the test course was that a 3 week mobility was too long for a large group of students to be able to pass the basic course. 3 out of 19 students did not pass the exam. We have decided to continue to run the optional course but reduce the mobility to two weeks.\r\n\r\nA total of 25 teachers and supporting staff is expected to benefit from this mobility project. The job shadowing will focus on: quality assurance and administration of international mobility, internationalisation at home, embedment of ECVET and of course specialised educational areas as advanced testing of materials (Lycee Monge), decorative painting (Bizkaia) and racing (Bridgwater&Taunton). Furthermore 3 teachers will have teaching assignments with partners on areas where we have expertise (accuracy in CNC), specialised welding.\r\n\r\nOur Charter application got a very positive feed back. There are 3 points we would like to reflect.\r\nImplementation of ECVET is improving rapidly. Being part of the strategic partnership EMEU has fuelled the process. The use of ECVET for international mobility is now a standard in the majority of educations involved in international cooperation and an increasing number of teachers are competent and can assist their peers in developing and describing ECVET modules. The transfer is both within each department and across department \u2013 for instance between ICT and painters who are now also included in the EMEU Network. \r\n\r\nThe Value of having both in-coming and out-going students is being strengthened. Using the Module concept across educations makes it realistic that all students at some point in their education will attend a module either abroad or together with international students at AARHUS TECH being taught in English.\r\n\r\nDissemination of project results needs continuous attention. This is definite an aspect which can still be improved. Therefore, the communication department is also involved in this project as active participants. It is the aim that the international strategy in the future also will include a dissemination strategy involving the communication department.", "http://www.bridgwater.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DK01-KA116-034032_7"], ["4PZ", "Mobility Makes Us Professional IV", "BRIDGWATER AND TAUNTON COLLEGE", 241665.0, "According to current mobility project, 107 students and 46 employees from P\u00e4rnumaa Kutsehariduskeskus will participate in mobilities abroad. Students will make an apprenticeship period at foreign companies or at school practice places and employees will practice or job-shadow the colleagues in partner organizations.\r\n\r\nThe main aims of the project (in accordance with the international strategy of P\u00e4rnumaa Kutehariduskeskus):\r\n\r\n1. Develop, deepen and determine the professional skills, competences and knowledge of the participants through the mobilities; ensure the accordance of the qualifications and knowledge with the labor market needs;\r\n2. Determine the theoretical knowledge and skills to practice through practical tasks and works;\r\n3. Support the development of 8 key competences, social skills and improvement on personal skills among the participants through the mobilities;\r\n4. Support the professional skills of the workers and teachers - so they are more motivated and can give education that meets the students and labor market needs. \r\n4. Grow the work- and learning motivation of the participants and improve their attractiveness at labor market.\r\n5. Ensure the high-quality of studies at hosting and sending partner through applying the mobility experience of the staff in practice.\r\n6. To promote the conformation of VET in European level\r\n\r\nThe aims of the project are directly linked with the development plans and priorities of P\u00e4rnumaa Kutsehariduskeskus and the present problems in vocational education.  As said before the aims are also linked with the international strategy of P\u00e4rnumaa Kutsehariduskeskus that says that by the year 2020 our mobilities should be 130 students and 50 teachers. So step by step we are moving towards our aim. \r\n\r\nThe participants of current project will be carefully chosen according to each one individual training needs. Activities of mobility project will grow the learning motivation of the students, enable the precious experience of gaining new professional skills and knowledge abroad, develop the social skills, team work and independent work skills, grow initiative and self-confident. The mobilities are efficient tool to enable the foreign language skills improvement. The apprenticeship period done at enterprises will recognized as practice, set in the school curricula by using ECVET principles. \r\nThe mobilities of the employees will be recognized as official employee practice outside the school. All mobility learning outcomes are set according to the individual training needs of the participants.\r\n\r\nThe project team includes professional teachers, leaders of the vocational fields and management members, the aim of their work is to ensure the high quality mobilities. Project managers and project coordinator searched for the most appropriate partner institutions according to the set learning outcomes and signed the co-operation agreements. The aims of the mobilities, learning outcomes and timing are agreed with all of the partners and documented with letters of intent and memorandum of understanding. The learning outcomes of each mobilities are set in the memorandum of understandings. The learning outcomes will be negotiated once again before the mobilities, including the receiving enterprise in order to ensure its fulfillment. \r\n\r\nThe project will give the measure of International co-operation and gives an opportunity to improve the International co-operation field. The school will be a part of International practice network. The internationalization is the priority of P\u00e4rnumaa Kutsehariduskeskus, set also in development plans and in the international strategy for 2020.", "http://www.bridgwater.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-EE01-KA116-034832_7"], ["4PZ", "Aurrerantz +", "BRIDGWATER AND TAUNTON COLLEGE", 164415.0, "Our project Aurrerantz + has evolved, grown and adapted to the new needs that our students have demanded. As an example of that we could point that this year we have decided to include a group of students with a new profile. Since 2016 we haven teaching \"professionalism certificates\" to students with intellectual disability who already are working in protected companies and they need to get their training accredited. We believe that doing their workplacement abroad will help them to improve their self-esteem and autonomy, both at a professional and personal level. Likewise, we have considered this is the right moment to add to this internationalization process a new dimension. We have included our teachers in our mobilities so that all this process does not finish with our students. To accomplish this task we will count with our european partners, who offer our students, and now, also our teachers, the chance to extend their academic training in other countries. \r\nWe want to offer to the participantes an European work experience that enables them to improve their professional competences and increases the opportunities to get a job. We have chosen different types of mobilities in each case:\r\n1.- VET students who will have their workplacement in companies abroad. The students will be divided according two different profiles:\r\n a.- Young people between 16 and 21 years old, mentally handicapped enrolled in a program that combines basic training with specific training carried out in workshops of different specialities.\r\nb.- Young people between 15 and 19 years old who have not reached the minimum goals in ESO (compulsory secondary education) in their centres of origin and attend the Centro San Viator. These students come to us with serious self-esteem issues and dragging problems (social, cognitive...) that have prevented them from getting their degree.\r\n2.-  VET students who will have a study period abroad, theoretical + practical. They are students who are studying VET Middle Degree(EQF3). Most of these students come from a VET education and therefore have already suffered school failure and have or have had risk of social exclusion. \r\nCHANGES regarding the participants' profiles:\r\n3. Students with intellectual disability who are already working in protected companies and are studying/have studied at our school to get the professional certificate  (in different areas) completelly accredited.  They will do part of their workplacement abroad and we are sure that it will help them to improve their self-esteem and autonomy.\r\n 4. One of our teachers (Ane Ruiloba) will spend a month in a Norwegian school that works with the Montessori methodology. She will improve her academic training spending a month there doing an observation/job shadowing period. The election of this teacher for the mobility has been made taking into account that she already has a officialy accredited B2 level in norwegian and this will allow her to interact with the students and take part in the academic school life with the rest of the staff, as well as having the same training the rest has, and therefore, make the most of the mobility.\r\n5. VET teachers who will get the chance during a week  to know, via job shadowing, the best educational methodologies in schools that have years developing them.\r\nThe long path this project has done, starting in 2007, has allowed us to know that the participants with special needs and the students  at risk of exclusion can not be alone during the mobilities; and we cannot forget that some of them will be minors. That's why we need that two teachers from the scholl travel with each group, so they can monitor and support the participants during the whole period. The number of carers has not been arbitrarily done, it has been analysed and carefully studied. Just a carer would not be enough,  if something happened with a participant and he/she had to  be accompanied ( to the hospital, doctor, etc.), the rest would be alone. But we also understand that more than two carers would be unreasonable. Experience also allows us to see that from an organisational point of view more people often cause a logistics problem, as for example, a minibus can only sit 9 people. We are aware that this project aims to allow the participants to acquire autonomy, but we cannot ignore that some of them need a planification and supervision of daily tasks as hygiene, feeding, means of transport...\r\nIn 2007 our project Aurrerantz started to ease the mobility of 8 intellectuallly handicapped students (and 2 carers) while they were doing their work placement. Through all these years the project has developed including participants from other different sections of Centro San Viator.  So in this new  call we apply for the mobiliby of 81 participants (with 12 carers) during two school years with different approaches:\r\n- Work placement\r\n- Training in VET schools + companies\r\n-Job shadowing for teachers.", "http://www.bridgwater.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA116-036938_3"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["4FJ", "Local Manufacturing Advisory Programme (LMAP)", "SWMAS Ltd", "The project will address  low productivity by targeting support at key priority sectors defined by the LEPs (primarily Advanced Manufacturing, Low Carbon and Food and Drink Manufacturing) where the greatest local benefit can be delivered.", "ERDF", 2476198.0, 4705261.0, "erdf_england_460"], ["4FJ", "Cornish High Value Manufacturing Investment Programme (HVMIP)", "SWMAS Ltd", "The project will work with existing manufacturers and start-ups to help them realise their growth potential.", "ERDF", 727900.0, 909874.0, "erdf_england_511"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["4PZ", "BRIDGWATER AND TAUNTON COLLEGE", 818.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_18459", 2016], ["4PZ", "BRIDGWATER AND TAUNTON COLLEGE", 46748.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_34940", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "TA6"}
