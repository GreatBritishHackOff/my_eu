The unnecessary use of antibiotics is a key driver in the development of antibiotic resistance. Cystic Fibrosis (CF) represents a unique disease model to study bacterial resistance and to explore therapeutic strategies for same, as chronic lung infection overlaps with acute lung exacerbations caused by a multitude of organisms that traditionally evolve various mechanisms of resistance. With time, chronic polymicrobial infection develops, with the most dominant infecting organism being Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is also important in other infections including wounds, burns and patients with medical devices, making it an important clinical target for the EU. In CF infections, empiric intravenous antibiotics are usually given for two weeks. Recurrent infections and treatments result in increasing antimicrobial resistance, and alterations in pathogen host interactions in the lung and gut flora. Next-generation DNA sequencing technology now offers DNA-based personalised diagnostics and treatment strategies. Enhancing our knowledge of the microbiome allows the use of stratified targeted antibacterial therapy that can be compared with standard empirical antibacterial therapy currently used. We believe this will reduce antibiotic usage, optimize dosage and duration startegies as the therapy will be tailored to the actual individual patient needs. Cystic Fibrosis Microbiome-determined Antimicrobial Therapy Trial in Exacerbations: Results Stratified (CF MATTERS) will provide a randomized multi-centre controlled trial of microbiome-derived antimicrobial treatments versus current empirical therapy. Simultaneously parallel human host-pathogen interaction studies in sputa, human gut microflora analysis and evaluation of murine exacerbation models will be performed. This will improve prescription practice and decrease antimicrobial usage and resistance.", 54569.0, 6302661.0, "CFMATTERS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.uhsm.nhs.uk", null, "fp7_109668_953554039"], ["9QR", "Biomaterials for Tracheal Replacement in Age-related Cancer via a Humanly Engineered Airway", "Intercytex Ltd", "Age-related cancers, especially of the trachea, are neoplastic lesions that significantly impact upon the lives of thousands of European patients each year. Unfortunately, most present with inoperable lesions for which median survival is less than 12 months. Based on our previous clinically successful experiences with in vivo completely tissue engineered tracheal replacement in benign tracheal diseases, we recently applied this technology in 2 patients with otherwise inoperable primary tracheal cancers. The successful observed outcome confirms the unique opportunity to scale-up an effective therapeutic approach into a widely accessible clinical technology, which could enhance not only the quality of life but even cure otherwise untreatable patients. However, a limitation of our current technology is the time it takes to re-populate the decellularized trachea. This may prove critical in the case of cancer patients. Further, the size of the transplant is currently limited due to the fact that the transplanted tissue needs to be efficiently and rapidly vascularised to prevent necrosis in vivo. To surmount these limitations, we aim to: i) improve our current technique of in vivo tissue engineering human tracheae in a small number of patients and subsequently begin a formal clinical trial, ii) develop pharmacological approaches to activate endogenous stem cells, stimulate tissue regeneration and vascularisation in situ, iii) develop a synthetic tracheal scaffold using a novel nanocomposite polymer as alternatives to natural human scaffolds and iv) develop good medical practice manufacturing process for safe, efficient and cost effective commercial production. This research project is aimed to define a robust airway implantation technique assuring a better outcome for thousands of patients each year. Moreover, we aim to use these results as a starting point to develop clinical approaches that could improve the treatment of age-related cancers of other hollow organs.", 153976.0, 4382538.0, "BIOtrachea", "Bioengineering for tracheal replacement", "The outcome for patients with tracheal cancer will be radically transformed with the development of tracheal replacements made from biosynthetic materials.", "Primary tracheal cancers have a high mortality rate, and adversely affect the lives of thousands of patients each year throughout Europe. In almost all cases, surgical removal with reconstruction is regarded as the gold standard of treatment. However, even for patients with operable tumours, the success rate of operations involving complete tumour resection is less than 60\u00a0% due to the difficulties of reconstructing the trachea.\n\nMaking a tissue-engineered trachea involves using a donor trachea that is subject to a process that removes all donor cells and antigens. An alternative approach is to make it from biosynthetic materials which mimic the properties of the native trachea.\n\nThe next step is to repopulate the tracheal scaffold with the patient\u2019s own cells. However, a major limitation is the time required for this recellularisation,  which may be critical for a cancer patient. \n\nThe EU-funded 'Biomaterials for tracheal replacement in age-related cancer via a humanly engineered airway' (http://www.biotrachea.eu (BIOTRACHEA)) project aims to both improve the approach used for decellularising biological tracheal scaffolds, and to develop approaches using synthetic scaffolds. One of the major goals of the consortium is to facilitate the rapid transfer from the results of research into commercial products for tissue engineering and cell-based therapy. \n\nDuring its first year, the consortium focused on platform technologies, developing a synthetic scaffold for in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo testing. In\u00a0vitro testing of the synthetic scaffold has been completed. The scaffold was shown to have suitable mechanical properties and is biocompatible with the patient.\n\nA hollow organ bath system has been developed to enable ex\u00a0vivo testing of entire organ scaffolds. The new bioreactor both removes donor cells and repopulates it with the patient\u2019s cells automatically. Cell adhesion, growth and cell proliferation takes place on the scaffold while it is inside the bioreactor. \n\nA platform for data and knowledge exchange has been established and the official BIOTRACHEA website is now online. \n\nThe end goal of the consortium is to perform 'first-time-in man' clinical trials. For this purpose, a bioethics committee has been established and work has started to develop an appropriate regulatory strategy to obtain approval for the trials. \n\nBIOTRACHEA project results will have significant long-term impact on health care, scientific research and business within the EU.

Examine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and otolith microchemistry and morphometrics in widely distributed populations of cod, hake, herring and sole. Outputs will comprise population-level signatures associated with fish origins in early life and representative spawning groups. 3. Undertake validation of traceability tools in relation to end-user technology. 4. Develop a population monitoring system based on genetic and otolith data that will assess population stability in a temporal and spatial framework. 5. Test the utility of additional novel traceability systems (fatty acid profiles, proteomics, gene expression, microarray platform for SNP genotyping). 6. Facilitate technology transfer in relation to enforcement and conservation policies of the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and associated socio-economic consequences.

Physiological angiogenesis is controlled by a complex interplay between cells and their environment: the extracellular matrix (ECM) provides signaling via numerous ECM adhesion molecules and growth factors bound to ECM polysaccharide components; and cells locally degrade and remodel the ECM to create pores into which angiogenic endothelial cells migrate. This observation, that physiological angiogenesis proceeds in response to solid-phase cues motivates our approach, namely creating bioactive resorbable materials as scaffolds that contain bound molecular signals to induce physiological angiogenesis in situations of tissue repair and regeneration. In some of our scaffold materials, porosity is inherent by virtue of fabrication, and in others porosity is created by cell-associated proteolysis as it is in physiological angiogenesis. All materials will be designed so as to be injectable or implantable into the human body. In some work, the final injectable/implantable material will comprise only materials and bioactive biomolecular signals, and in other cases it will also comprise cells. Thus, the concept of ANGIOSCAFF is to create materials that are bioresponsive (to environmental signals including pH and redox potential, and to cellular signals such as proteases), that are bioactive (by virtue of bound peptide or recombinant protein adhesion ligands and bound and releasable growth factors), and that are capable of carrying cellular therapeutics. To realize ANGIOSCAFF, we have assembled a team comprising both industrial and academic expert groups in biomaterials design and development, experts in the science and application of angiogenesis, in imaging in animal models, and in applications demanding biomaterials-based, angiogenesis-demanding tissue engineering therapies, including repair of bone, skin, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle and nerve.", 60620.0, 13316086.0, "ANGIOSCAFF", null, null, null, "http://www.angioscaff.eu", null, null, "fp7_88874_998751674"], ["9LT", "Autologous Stem Cell Seeded Tissue Engineered Trachea", "University Hospital of South Manchester Nhs Foundation Trust", "CLINICAL PROBLEM AND UNMET NEED\nThere are 11,827 patients with severe structural airway disease in Europe.
