These solvents can be organic solvents (halogena-ted and non-halogenated hydrocarbons) for a-polar soils or water with chemicals for polar soils. Each type of liquid has environmental and hygienic drawbacks. The cleaning and hygienic efficiency of these is not sufficient as small amounts of residual cleaning agents and/or soil impair the quality of the cleaned surface. The (non) halogenated hydrocarbon and aqueous systems can be replaced by liquid carbon dioxide (LCO2) as a clean, hygienic and environmentally sound solvent. LCO2 has shortcomings and needs improvement of its cleaning performance and quantification of its disinfecting/sterilisation potential. Project ACCEPT investigates the use of LCO2 with respect to cleaning effectiveness and hygiene ability on pliable and hard surfaces (textiles, leathers, medical devices, implants and fine metal parts). The research continues earlier laboratory and pilot research, but will expand this to full scale industrial sized LCO2 cleaning units. In order to remove surface residuals, a CO2-precision cleaning step is required for fine parts. The earlier research will be extended to other hygienically demanding materials to be cleaned. The project further improves LCO2 for cleaning and hygienic quality of these materials. This will lead to replacement of (non) halogenated hydrocarbon solvents such as hazardous perc and toxic trichloroethene. The LCO2 is non-toxic, non-flammable, has disinfecting/sterilising properties, is produced as an off-gas in almost pure form in the oil refining and ammonia production, causes no ground-water contamination, and is very sustainable and environmental friendly", 86403.0, 1538248.0, "ACCEPT", null, null, null, "http://www.kreussler.com/accept", null, null, "fp7_91989_999459095"], ["5EH", "Distributed Acoustic Sensing for Cable Monitoring and Surveying for Offshore Wind Farms providing movement, depth, surface disruption and free-span readings", "Electricity Distribution Services Limited", "Electricity Distribution Services Ltd (EDS) is a global leader in High Voltage (HV) asset management for offshore wind farms.  In the offshore wind industry, newly commissioned engineering projects often experience failures either in the initial years of operation or at the end of their lifecycle. Subsea cable damage most often arises from: anchor strikes, dragging fishing nets and erosion. Statistics show that a wind farm cable circuit of average length is likely to experience 1-2 faults per 20-year period. Insurance companies increasingly report on HV cable faults being a major issue for financial losses at offshore wind farms. They led to insurance claims totaling more than \u20ac60 million in 2015. On average, at least 10 subsea cable failures are declared to insurers each year in the offshore wind sector. The financial severity of these incidents continues to grow \u2013 such that they account for 77% of the total global cost of offshore wind farm losses. Our CableSENTRY is an innovative solution based on Digital Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology that detects subsea cable faults in real time. Acoustic signals from the HV cable create an optical response in a fibre optic line so faults and other events can be located accurately and immediately on a calibrated system. Applied in addition to existing fault location technology, our solution will be able to identify fault locations in land and subsea HV cables and save an average of 4 days\u2019 downtime per fault over current methods", 1212614.0, 1732307.0, "SENTRY", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_211147_926065985"], ["5EH", "Distributed Acoustic Sensing for Cable Monitoring and Surveying for Offshore Wind Farms providing movement, depth, surface disruption and free-span readings", "Electricity Distribution Services Limited", "The Cable Sentry project will provide sensitive, real-time subsea high voltage (HV) cable monitoring to the offshore wind farm industry. By coupling the fibre optic cable to the HV cable faults can be easily identified and pre-located from acoustic signals. With 90 wind farms in development across Europe with 20000 km of subsea cabling by 2020, a daily offline cost to the energy companies of \u20ac300,000 and an increasing fault occurrence rate of up to 5-8 faults per 1000 km per year in early wind farm lifetime Cable Sentry has great potential. Our prototype has been proven to provide a 50-60% time and cost saving on fault ID and location when trialled. In addition, our system does not require seabed installation and can cover cables up to 120 km in length meeting the trend for the increasing distance to shore. Cable Sentry provides value added functionality as it is able to locate and measure free-span, indicate burial depth and wave height useful for cable surveying and condition monitoring. We are seeking funding for formation of a detailed business plan to demonstrate our comprehensive strategy to move our product from TRL6 to TRL8 within a Phase 2 project. We will develop a strong sales and marketing plan that will allow us to meet the growth increase anticipated due to our holding sole European distribution rights for Cable Sentry. Phase 2 work will include large-scale pilot trials for data collection and analysis to tune our algorithms to cover all potential fault types and cable positioning possibilities. Cable Sentry will enable Electricity Distribution Services Ltd (EDS) to achieve our vision to become the leading HV asset management company for offshore wind farms in Europe. We are looking to provide real time cable fault location and maintenance, asset surveying and HV support throughout plant lifetime.
