These 3 features will represent the target areas in the DOREMI project. The project vision is aimed at developing a systemic solution for elderly, able to prolong the functional and cognitive capacity by empowering, stimulating and unobtrusively monitoring the daily activities according to well defined 'Active Ageing' lifestyle protocols. The project  joins  the concept of prevention centered on  the elderly, characterized by a unified vision of being elderly today, namely, a promotion of the health by a constructive interaction between mind, body and social engagement. To fulfill these goals, food intake measurements and personalized metabolic control, exergames associated to social interaction stimulation, and cognitive training programs will be proposed to an elderly population enrolled during a pilot study. The project combines multidisciplinary research areas in serious games, social networking, Wireless Sensor Network, activity recognition and contextualization, behavioral pattern analysis. By recording and monitoring information about the use of the adopted lifestyle protocols, it would be possible to track the users performance over long periods, providing a potential alert for signs of malnutrition, physical and cognitive deterioration.  The close collaboration between the healthcare representatives and experienced technological partners will drive the ICT development needed to release a set of prototypes to be validated in the pilot study. The effectiveness and impacts, on both users and on the healthcare system, will be proofed in the pilot study set up in Italy and UK, involving both elderly users and care providers.", 67010.0, 2954234.0, "DOREMI", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110829_951272793"], ["0AH", "Non-toxic and Cost-Effective Essential Oil-based Nematicide and Soil Delivery System", "Robinson Brothers Limited", "Nematodes or roundworms are one of the most common soil-borne parasites that feed on plant roots, stems, leaves, flowers and seeds - constituting a major contributor to agricultural crop losses.  Yield losses due to the parasitic affects of nematodes vary significantly for different crops, however, it is estimated that over \u20ac1 billion/year of crop yield is lost in the EU and the figure is speculated to between \u20ac10-20 billion/year world-wide.  There are a number of existing solutions to prevent the huge losses due to nematode infestations, including; chemical nematicides (soil fumigants), solar heating/steaming and robust crop rotation.  However, all of these solutions have significant problems such as very negative environmental impact, high-cost, geographically specific and they all kill nitrogen fixing bacteria.  Nemasys proposes to develop a unique blend of naturally occurring essential oils (EO) as an alternative, cost-effective, soil treatment, which will be delivered by a novel time-release capsule.  A unique EO formulation has been discovered by Plant Impact (SME Co-ordinator), which shows a unique synergistic behaviour, to give significantly improved (>30%) improvement in nematicide efficacy. Allowing lower quantities of EO to be used and overcoming their limiting factor of \u2018taint\u2019.

The result is safer crops, healthier soil and a cleaner environment.", "Nematodes or roundworms are one of the most common parasites found in soil. They feed on plant roots, stems, leaves, flowers and seeds and are a major contributor to agricultural crop losses. A vast number of crops in the EU are lost to nematode infestations, and current treatments have shown to be impractical, costly or toxic to the environment. Existing treatments include chemical nematicides (soil fumigants), solar heating/steaming and intense crop rotation.\n\nThe project ?Non-toxic and cost-effective essential oil-based nematicide and soil delivery system (Nemasys) is working on a radically different approach. It is developing an eco-friendly nematicide from a unique blend of naturally occurring essential oils that can combat nematode infestations without harming the soil and environment. These non-toxic oils have been tested positively in laboratory research on potato cyst nematodes.\n\nThe overall objectives of the project are to develop better essential oils that are more effective at eradicating or neutralising nematode activity. This requires the formulation of a suitable emulsifier to allow these oils to come into contact with the nematodes in soil. It also requires a new biodegradable soil delivery system, with plans for a time-release delivery system already under development. Once these have been achieved, minor issues such as treatment instructions, dosage and field trials must be established. Needless to say, the environmental impact must continuously be monitored to ensure it is safe. If all goes to plan, the Nemasys approach will yield a non-toxic nematicide that can be applied in a timely and cost-effective manner, removing the need for complete soil sterilisation which occurs with traditional methods such as toxic fumigation or steam.\n\nThere are several potential environmental and health benefits to this project. The acute neurotoxic effects of the highly toxic chemical nematicides have been linked with cancer and birth defects. The project is expected to reduce negative health effects on operators and others caused by wind drift, water pollution, etc. The project will also contribute to enhancing food quality and safety by providing consumers with fruit and crops free from pesticide residues. Important progress has been made here, and field testing and licensing are imminent.\n\nUltimately this eco-friendly approach to combating pests in agriculture may open the door to other similar ideas in the future, leading to better health, better food and better environments.", "http://www.bovinose.eu/", "http://www.robinsonbrothers.ltd.uk", "/docs/results/images/2011-02/45547.jpg", "fp7_92365_996487209"], ["0AH", "A Safer Alternative Replacement for Thiourea Based Accelerators in the Production Process of Chloroprene Rubber", "Robinson Brothers Limited", "In December 2007, the European Commission imposed a total of \u20ac 247 635 000 fines on the five largest manufacturers of chloroprene rubber for participating in a cartel. As a result of this price fixing and market abuse by large enterprises, the SME involvement in this sector has diminished and requires research investment to re-build its presence. Additionally there is increasing pressure to replace the vulcanisation accelerator, ethylene thiourea (ETU), due to its assessment as a Cat 2 rep carcinogen as per the EU classification, IARC and EPA. It is believed that under REACH it will be classified as a CMR substance (Carcinogenic/Mutagenic/toxic for Reproduction) which will lead to legislation prohibiting or banning its use. The \u2018SafeRubber\u2019 project aims to develop a safer alternative accelerator to replace the carcinogenic ethylene thiourea (ETU) based accelerators to be used in the manufacturing of rubbers such as polychloroprene (CR) and epichlorohydrin (ECO). This will be based around a new catalyst molecule that has tri-functionality, which offers the added benefit of reducing consumption of metal oxides during manufacturing, lowering manufacturing costs and giving SMEs another unique differentiator, allowing them to compete in the market.", 165358.0, 2222733.0, "SAFERUBBER", "Quickly and safely getting up to speed", "Vulcanisation is a chemical process that makes rubber more durable. A novel process accelerator developed with EU support is an eco-friendly alternative to the currently used carcinogen and will help put EU manufacturers ahead of the competition.", "Ethylene thiourea (ETU)-based accelerators have been the industry standard for speeding the vulcanisation process (acting as an accelerator). However, ETU has now been classified as a suspected human carcinogen by various EU bodies. Its use is expected to be restricted or prohibited by the EU in the near future.\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) working in the rubber sector will be particularly hard hit, particularly in the face of rising competition from Asian countries with less stringent health and safety requirements. A large consortium took advantage of EU investment to find a safe replacement for ETU. Scientists developed an eco-friendly and inexpensive alternative within the context of the project http://www.saferubber.eu (SAFERUBBER) .\n\nThe additive SRM102 demonstrated many important benefits. Chloroprene rubbers made with SRM102 have improved flow characteristics, much more easily filling the mould. This has potential to reduce both the mass of rubber used and the scrap generated. In addition, it is possible to reduce levels of zinc oxide, a vulcanisation activator.\n\nOptimisation of the SRM102 may also decrease the cure cycle for savings in time and energy consumption. Finally, results of studies of algae growth on samples produced with SRM102 suggest it is not toxic.\n\nFive factories in three countries tested processing of chloroprene rubber containing SMR102. Scientists found the additive to perform as well as or better than compounds containing ETU. In rubber manufacturing trials, SRM102 was shown to be a viable replacement for ETU.\n\nWhile technical viability is critical, commercialisation relies on the bottom line. Since the percentage of SRM102 required compared to rubber content is similar to that of ETU, the new additive is expected to have minimal effect on the final manufacturing cost.\n\nSAFERUBBER has delivered a safe and cost-effective alternative to the carcinogenic rubber vulcanisation accelerator additive ETU. The numerous European SMEs active in the sector stand to benefit tremendously.

Yet it still remains a challenge to develop and deploy such solutions in a large scale due to the lack of an easy-to-use technology infrastructure and application exemplars. This problem arises from the nature of the SH field: multidisciplinary, diverse in its applications, and with multiple stakeholders. Whilst a one-size-fits-all technology infrastructure seems unlikely, alternatives are still missing. In addition, an effective approach to cross-discipline, cross-sector understanding for best practices has so far not been seen. \nACROSSING addresses this problem by implementing a multidisciplinary cross-sector pan-European training network to knock down barriers between disciplines and sectors and providing the ESRs with a broad training experience. ACROSSING develops 15 topically complementary research projects covering four core research themes, and four main application categories. By multidisciplinary collaborations and cross-sector interactions, the ESRs will develop flexible, interoperable underlying technologies which are then applied to and evaluated in multiple real application scenarios, leading to four specialised technology infrastructures and four best-practice application demonstrators. ACROSSING also deliver comprehensive blended training by combining campus-based and industrial practice training, and perspectives on personal development and social issues by well-established researchers and practitioners from academic, industry and user organisations.
