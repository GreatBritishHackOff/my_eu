SHM is currently accomplished with a third system, embedded sensors. The focus is on coupling changes in conductivity to thermal and stress measurements and developing modelling tools for design of multifunctional layers. The combination of the three systems into one promises to reduce weight, simplify manufacturing and maintenance, and perhaps even increase safety.\n\nDuring the current reporting period, scientists optimised dispersion parameters and prepared or obtained all needed materials. These included nano-reinforcement dispersions, nano-doped resin films and buckypapers (thin sheets of carbon nanotubes). Scientists incorporated relationships between nano-scale structures and macro-scale properties into multi-scale models. They were used to predict electro-thermal behaviour, mechanical response and sensing performance of nano-reinforced polymer systems. Investigators also used the models to evaluate fire burn through a composite panel.\n\nBased on the above experimental and theoretical results, the most promising materials and processes were identified and manufacturing commenced. After comprehensive testing and optimisation, two demonstrators were manufactured and guidelines developed for optimal performance and future research. Finally, scientists conducted a technical and commercial evaluation of the products to assess potential for transfer to industrial applications.\n\nLAYSA expects to deliver high-performance multifunctional aircraft structures based on novel nanocomposites with exceptional thermal and electrical conductivity and sensing capacity.

This project will give the young participants an opportunity to organize informal peer led activities for their peers and local community, while accepting feedback on the chosen methodology and to be active citizens through volunteering.

Having dealt with such cases in regular street youth work our partner organisations from the UK, Portugal, Sweden, and Bulgaria have made its own research on the most common type of violence in their own region/country and it proved that interpersonal violence is taking the lead.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this Mobility Project was developed by the young people in the course of youth encounters in 2015-2016, where they met to discuss the issue of interpersonal violence and find solutions through community volunteering. With this mobility project our partnership is willing to empower young people to practive new and creative forms of violence prevention as a way to acquire skills on peace and non-violence, improving the community at the same time.\r\n\r\nTherefore, our project aims at promotion of community volunteering  an effective way to contribute to elimination of culture of violence among young people, reducing inter-ethnic tensions and providing participants with new practical life skills on peace and non-violence with the following objectives:\r\n\r\n- to promote innovative ways of volunteerism to acquire skills on peace and non-violence and improve the community at the same time;\r\n- to make participants aware of the topics of peace education and conflict management;\r\n- to gain particular and practical skills in conflict resolution;\r\n- to equip the participants with tools for action and to develop with them a pan-European network of like minded project promoters; \r\n- to develop competences of youth peer leaders for becoming multipliers of non-violent behaviour and peaceful conflict resolution; \r\n- to develop an understanding of Human Right Education and motivate young people to use it in their everyday life.\r\n\r\nThe exchange will bring together 64 young people and youth leaders from the UK, Portugal, Sweden, and Bulgaria in Santo Tirso, Portugal.

Sports volunteering is a kind of \"social fitness\" instruments, which promotes \u0441ommon European values: equal opportunities, fair play & integrity.\r\n\r\nThis mobility project was developed in response to feedback from youth representing the local communities of participating countries & youth coming from BAME communities. These youth showed a great interest to be involved in a project aimed at the promotion of sports volunteering as a way to enhance social inclusion & encourage community participation.\r\n\r\nInvolving young people from the very beginning, we have designed this project to focus on increasing a sense of social inclusion & community participation among youth representing the local communities of participating countries & youth coming from BAME communities using non-competitive games & sports. By focusing on non-competitive element we will avoid some of the drawbacks of competitive sports involvement such as violence, aggression, doping etc. This will help us focus on the positive aspects of games & sports as a way to \"pump up\" their feeling of community.\r\n\r\nThe project objectives are to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 create an atmosphere of understanding & tolerance between young people representing different cultures, ethnic groups, working styles etc.;\r\n\u2022 bring awareness & promote the positive values of non-competitive sports & games: increased self-esteem, healthy behaviors, community cohesion & intercultural sharing;\r\n\u2022 improve participants\u2019 key competencies for lifelong learning, learn how to recognise & apply these competencies in daily life;\r\n\u2022 interact & gain first-hand experience from the local organisations working with the issues of social inclusion & sports volunteering;\r\n\u2022 equip young people with the skills for social action (project management);\r\n\u2022 trigger innovative thinking through planning, developing & implementing own sports volunteering initiatives;\r\n\u2022 learn how to turn day-to-day challenges into a valuable experience & how to match this experience with the framework of Youthpass competencies;\r\n\u2022 raise participants\u2019 awareness about the potential of Erasmus+ programme to stimulate social inclusion & boost community participation via sports volunteering;\r\n\u2022 encourage participants to \"pay it forward\" by sharing project experience & creating own sports volunteering initiatives back home.\r\n\r\nOur objectives are also consistent with the overall objectives of Erasmus+ (Erasmus+ Programme Guide V.2/2017) & specific objectives pursued by KA1 \"Learning Mobility of Individuals\" (KA1 Guide for Applicants V.2/2017).\r\n\r\nParticipants:\r\n\r\n- For the Advance Planning Visit in Trakai, Lithuania: 2 representatives from each of the participating organisations (UK, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria) will present profiles, share experience & brainstorm on ideas on the project theme. \r\n- For the Youth Exchange in Trakai, Lithuania: 60 young people (youth representing the local communities of participating countries & youth coming from BAME communities with a 50:50 ratio) & 10 group leaders will go through a series of specific workshops, develop & implement their own sports volunteering initiatives around social inclusion & active community participation.\r\n\r\nMethodology: peer education techniques, simulation exercises, workshops on social inclusion & intercultural dialogue, role play games & exercises on inclusion techniques, inspirational visits to the local community centers, workshops on project management, sports volunteering initiatives designed & executed by young participants, Youthpass related workshops & activities, interactive sessions on Erasmus+ programme potential to motivate young activists to become project multipliers, SALTO evaluation workshops.\r\n\r\nBalanced set of the empowerment activities directed at young people will enhance the prospects of youth representing the local communities of participating countries & youth coming from BAME communities for active community engagement & intercultural acceptance. This will be achieved through the peer-to-peer approach & by implementing sports volunteering initiatives.\r\n\r\nThrough a strong network in which members can acquire new skills & strengthen their capacities, we will contribute, on a pan-European level, to a more widespread engagement of youth in sports volunteering leading to social cohesion, tolerance, inclusion & active community involvement.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the project we will have a European group of the experienced & motivated young people with the necessary skills & competences to promote social inclusion & sports volunteering in their home communities.
