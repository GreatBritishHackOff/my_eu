SHM is currently accomplished with a third system, embedded sensors. The focus is on coupling changes in conductivity to thermal and stress measurements and developing modelling tools for design of multifunctional layers. The combination of the three systems into one promises to reduce weight, simplify manufacturing and maintenance, and perhaps even increase safety.\n\nDuring the current reporting period, scientists optimised dispersion parameters and prepared or obtained all needed materials. These included nano-reinforcement dispersions, nano-doped resin films and buckypapers (thin sheets of carbon nanotubes). Scientists incorporated relationships between nano-scale structures and macro-scale properties into multi-scale models. They were used to predict electro-thermal behaviour, mechanical response and sensing performance of nano-reinforced polymer systems. Investigators also used the models to evaluate fire burn through a composite panel.\n\nBased on the above experimental and theoretical results, the most promising materials and processes were identified and manufacturing commenced. After comprehensive testing and optimisation, two demonstrators were manufactured and guidelines developed for optimal performance and future research. Finally, scientists conducted a technical and commercial evaluation of the products to assess potential for transfer to industrial applications.\n\nLAYSA expects to deliver high-performance multifunctional aircraft structures based on novel nanocomposites with exceptional thermal and electrical conductivity and sensing capacity. The structural elements will enable thermal protection and SHM in one system for safer, lighter planes with lower fuel and power consumption.", null, "http://www.advanced-composites.com", "/docs/results/images/2010-11/54176.jpg", "fp7_88417_999744372"], ["4JG", "ENgineering COMPASS", "Altair Engineering Limited", "The ENCOMPASS project principally aims to create a fully digital integrated design decision support (IDDS) system to cover the whole manufacturing chain for a laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) process encompassing all individual processes within in. The ENCOMPASS concept takes a comprehensive view of the L-PBF process chain through synergising and optimising the key stages. The integration at digital level enables numerous synergies between the steps in the process chain and in addition, the steps themselves are being optimised to improve the capability and efficiency of the overall manufacturing chain.\n\nENCOMPASS addresses the three key steps in the process chain: component design, build process, and post-build process steps (post-processing and inspection). The links between these stages are being addressed by the following five interrelations: \n1.\tBetween the design process and both the build and post-build processes in terms of manufacturing constraints / considerations to optimise overall component design \n2.\tBetween the design process and build process component-specific L-PBF scanning strategies and parameters to optimise processing and reduce downstream processing\n3.\tBetween the design process and the build and post-build processes in terms of adding targeted feature quality tracking to the continuous quality monitoring throughout the process chain \n4.\tBetween the build and post-build processes by using build specific processing strategies and adaptation based on actual quality monitoring data (for inspection and post-processing) \n5.\tBetween all stages and the data management system with the integrated design decision support (IDDS) system\n\nBy considering the entire AM process chain, rather than the AM machine in isolation, ENCOMPASS will integrate process decision making tools and produce substantial increases in AM productivity, with clear reductions in change over times and re-design, along with increased \u2018right-first time\u2019, leading to overall reductions in production costs, materials wastage, and over-processing.
