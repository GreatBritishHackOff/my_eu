This includes inpatient treatment cost, outpatient hospital visits and long-term rehabilitation and care. Analysis showed that costs of long-term care have increased from 13% to 49% of overall costs in average in recent years. Therefore there is an urgent need for devising an effective long-term care and rehabilitation strategy for Stroke patients, which will involve the patients actively in the process while minimising costly human intervention.The StrokeBack project intends to develop an automated remote rehabilitation system by blending advances of ICT and practical clinical knowledge that will empower the patients and their immediate carer for effective application of the rehabilitation protocol in home settings.StrokeBack will combine state-of-the-art monitoring devices forming a wireless Body Area Network  that enable simultaneous measurement of multiple vital parameters and currently executed movements that are particularly of interest from a Stroke rehabilitation point of view. The measured parameters will be fused using advanced feature extraction and classification algorithms processed on-body, which will denote the accuracy of the executed exercise. The training parameters along with vital data will be stored in a patient health record to which the responsible clinicians and therapists have access so that they can dynamically update the rehabilitation program.  By employing manual intervention only when actually necessary, it will eliminate costly human intervention and thereby significantly reduce the associated costs.

Highlighted within the key findings and directly relating to the reasons we are seeing a reduction in the participation of learners is the offering to the staff involved in this field of education. The report findings state \u2018Access to relevant continuing professional development (CPD) in art and design is limited, and for some teachers subject-specific training is non-existent. Significant numbers of art and design specialists in all phases \u2018rarely or never\u2019 receive CPD.\u2019.\r\n\r\nWe seek to address these issues through the support of the EC commitment to \u2018focus on modernising our Education and Training provision by providing opportunities for individuals and staff to improve their skills and knowledge\u2019.

We need to give them an outstanding experience of language learning, increasing their aspiration and future career choices.\r\n\r\nMany of our children arrive at our school with EAL.

Our school has bought into a languages scheme and the MFL leader is in the process of rewriting our school MFL policy, and is using  the  current scheme of work to produce a clear planning sequence for teachers and HLTA's to follow.\r\n\r\nOur previous participation in an Erasmus+ project has had a positive impact on our school, pupils and staff.

As for staff, we are applying for 15 mobilities for our own staff and 2 grants to receive an entrepreneur from abroad. There are 14 hosting partners from 10 different countries all in all.\r\n\r\nAll the 9 vocational schools and all the sectors provided by SASKY are involved in the project. The content of the student mobilities is mainly on-the-job learning, realised according to the field-specific objectives while doing the field-specific work. The students\u2019 objectives are to improve their professional, linguistic, entrepreneurial, social and cultural skills and to reinforce their self-confidence and independence, both at work and in life in general. Some of the longer placements may be realised at vocational schools if that is consistent with the students\u2019 objectives; the reciprocity is an important means to support our internationalisation at home measures.\r\n \r\nA particular case is the short group exchange. Sasky plans to realise one such exchange each year within a different field. This year, the plan is to assemble 8 students and two accompanying teachers from our two different agricultural schools and to send them to a partner school in the Netherlands. The accompanying persons are needed because this opportunity is offered also for students who are somehow disadvantaged or have special needs \u2013 and to students who would not dare to do a longer placement alone. We are also applying for exceptional costs funding to give additional support to students who could not afford to go abroad without it.\r\n\r\nAs for the staff, the goal of most exchanges is to scout the on-the-job learning opportunities for students in order to extend the mobility prospects to a new field and to do the ECVET work in practice, i.e. discuss the students\u2019 objectives, skills and assessment. As a result, the teachers will gain a clearer idea of the kind of learning outcomes the students will get, how those learning outcomes can be recognised and what kind of professional preparation the students need. At the same time, the teachers\u2019 own international skills are enhanced by means of peer learning, through the dialogue of vocational subjects teachers and international coordinators. While assembling the teacher groups, we always see that the group are equipped with skills related to student placements, knowledge of the field in question and sufficient linguistic skills.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the group exchanges for the staff, we are also applying for a few staff work placements. Their objective is staff development, both personal and professional, and both from the perspective of the organisation as well as that of the individual. Our objective with receiving entrepreneurs from abroad is to increase opportunities for internationalisation at home and to reinforce the labour market relevance of the teaching, which is in line with the Finnish VET reform.\r\n\r\nWe also want to contribute to the implementation of the VET reform by developing the identification and recognition process of the international skills. Earlier we have made some development work on this in another project, but because of the reformed curricula, some further development is needed. We aim to develop clear, OLS-compatible rules for the recognition of linguistic skills and a vocational module for international skills based on the regional requirements for vocational skills. To support its assessment by our partners, we are also applying for a KA2 project during the Call 2018.\r\n\r\nThe results of the project include first and foremost improved international skills and interaction, presentations and reports, and the development of shared ways of work and processes. As an impact, the students\u2019 improved skills improve their employability, whereas the staff mobilities and the development work contribute to the quality of Sasky\u2019s international activities and its attractivity while supporting Sasky with the implementation of the VET reform.\r\n\r\nThis project supports Sasky\u2019s internationalisation strategy in the following ways:\r\n- equal opportunities for internationalisation: common selection procedures, the group exchange for the disadvantaged, the exceptional costs for the financially impaired, internationalisation at home opportunities through reciprocity\r\n- the quality of mobility: the ECVET work and the development of the recognition of the international skills\r\n- Sasky is a genuinely international organisation: enhancing the international skills of the staff as well as their motivation for internationalisation.
