In addition to our focus on chemical probes, we will also generate a defined set of antibodies targeting extracellular and membrane bound proteins of relevance to disease. To accomplish the above, ULTRA-DD will create two scientific Cores and formalize a collaborative network of SMEs, academic scientists and clinicians. \n\nThe Protein Characterization and Tool-Generation Core will comprise four integrated laboratories: University of Oxford\u2019s Structural Genomics Consortium laboratory, led by Chas Bountra (OXF-SGC), ETH in Zurich (ETHZ), led by Ruedi Aebersold, Karolinska Institutet (KI-MBB), led by Susanne Gr\u00e4slund, and the University of Toronto\u2019s SGC laboratory (UTOR-SGC, will not receive IMI funds), led by Cheryl Arrowsmith, and chemical biology teams in Bayer (Bayer), Janssen (JPNV), Novartis (NOV) and Pfizer (Pfizer). The Clinical Immunology Core will generate high quality assays from patient-derived cells and tissues in selected inflammatory diseases, and test effects of the chemical and antibody probes. This Core comprises the Kennedy Institute (UOXF-KENN) in the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences at the University of Oxford (UOXF-NDORMS), led by Marc Feldmann, the Centre for Molecular Medicine (KI-CMM) at Karolinska Institutet, led by Lars Klareskog and Per-Johan Jakobsson, and DiscoveRx (DRX, Sanj Kumar), an SME based in Birmingham, UK (will not receive IMI funds). The activities within the Cores will be enhanced significantly and the impact of the output expanded dramatically through the involvement of a Collaborative Network of SMEs, IMI projects, academic scientists and Disease Foundations (Appendices 1-3; none of these networks will receive IMI funds). The network will include a Target Prioritization Network (TPN) of top genomicists and clinicians; a Science and Technology Network (STN) that contributes expertise across the ULTRA-DD \u201cgene to chemical probe\u201d pipeline; and an Inflammatory Disease Network (IDN) of clinicians and translational scientists that provides enhanced access to disease-relevant expertise and patient tissue, as well as an expanded array of innovative assays. Each member of the ULTRA-DD network will commit to the open access policy. ULTRA-DD will be managed by the SGC (London, UK), which is a charitable company that has an enviable track record in managing the scientific, legal and financial aspects of open access public-private partnerships. The vision of ULTRA-DD is to create an open access consortium that provides industry with a stream of high quality target-disease associations and tools to study them. Our aspiration is to provide the evidence that convinces industry to launch >10 novel proprietary drug discovery programs based on ULTRA-DD open access output during the course of the project and in the nearest years following completion (2020).\n\nULTRA-DD will meet the deliverables by integrating teams of tool-generating scientists with expert clinicians with access to patient tissue, under an open access, milestone-driven framework, and will expand its output through organized collaborations with innovative European scientists, leading non-European scientists", null, 41466871.0, "ULTRA-DD", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_203728_941573181"], ["4BB", "Graphene-Based Revolutions in ICT And Beyond", "Amalyst Limited", "This Flagship aims to take graphene and related layered materials from a state of raw potential to a point where they can revolutionize multiple industries \u2013 from flexible, wearable and transparent electronics, to new energy applications and novel functional composites.Our main scientific and technological objectives in the different tiers of the value chain are to develop material technologies for ICT and beyond, identify new device concepts enabled by graphene and other layered materials, and integrate them to systems that provide new functionalities and open new application areas.These objectives are supported by operative targets to bring together a large core consortium of European academic and industrial partners and to create a highly effective technology transfer highway, allowing industry to rapidly absorb and exploit new discoveries.The Flagship will be aligned with European and national priorities to guarantee its successful long term operation and maximal impact on the national industrial and research communities.Together, the scientific and technological objectives and operative targets will allow us to reach our societal goals: the Flagship will contribute to sustainable development by introducing new energy efficient and environmentally friendly products based on carbon and other abundant, safe and recyclable natural resources, and boost economic growth in Europe by creating new jobs and investment opportunities.", null, 58044703.0, "GRAPHENE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_109691_937401211"], ["4BN", "Cities and science communication: innovative approaches to engaging the public", "Advantage West Midlands", "Science cities are becoming increasingly important across Europe. Their central strategic aim appears to be boosting the knowledge economy nationally and to support the goals defined in the Lisbon strategy. In order to do this, it is important that the \u2018triple helix\u2019 of universities and research organisations, business and the public sector work together to ensure that research and development (R&D) and innovation is world-class. The premise of science cities is that the best place for this interaction to happen spatially is within cities; where all actors are present. However, to significantly improve quality of life in urban areas, it is also necessary to address the extra dimension of public engagement in science in the more recently termed quadruple helix. An engaged public can make informed choices about the way they live; they can participate in scientific debate; they are able to look critically at mediated information provision and they can contribute more effectively to the knowledge economy. The Science in Society work strand of FP7 will allow the CASC project to form a wide geographical network able to explore best practice and exchange different ideas on ways of working to improve the ways in which \u2018the public\u2019 might be engaged in science.

In addition, strong public engagement in science is pivotal for furthering the knowledge society and knowledge economy. The EU-funded project 'Cities and science communication: Innovative approaches to engaging the public' (CASC) fostered a scientific culture in cities and encouraged international exchanges on the topic. \n\nTo achieve its aims, the project brought together 17 European partners and 1 from China. They represented science centres, academia, government and outreach organisations, many with extensive experience in science communication. \n\nCASC looked at different ways of building a science-led culture and assessed its impact on different target groups. The project team also outlined three key priorities: celebrating science and scientists, strengthening science citizenship (i.e. public engagement in science) and promoting good science.\n\nAnother objective involved addressing the skills shortage in science and engineering \u2014 which hampers economic growth \u2014 by encouraging collaboration among the 'triple helix' of universities, business and the public sector. CASC therefore investigated barriers to engagement in science and elaborated policy recommendations to address these shortcomings. It shared best practices in science and society initiatives among key stakeholders in different cities, highlighting as well the European Commission's Science and Society Action Plan. \n\nRecommendations included more support for existing science centres to engage different groups, enhanced professional development to science communications stakeholders and better policymaking. Greater collaboration between different EU Directorates-General, new EU standards to promote trust in science and enhanced seed funding to communicate science were also recommended.\n\nOverall, the project achieved its objectives, from creating a new network of science communication practitioners to transferring policy know-how and best practices. It devised new tools to build a scientific culture, such as better online browsing for science news, influencing as well how future science centres will be developed.

The conversion software will automatically detect problematic language and replace it to make the text clearer. It will also simplify complex structure in the text and clarify ambiguity. Not relying purely on textual changes, the conversion software will add illustrative pictures to documents and will also offer navigation tools such as hyperlinked tables of contents and concise document summaries.
