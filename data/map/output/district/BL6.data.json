High School for the last four years. During this period, I am genuinely convinced that my projects with Comenius and Erasmus +  have genuinely underpinned my Teaching and Learning philosophy, as well as having given me an inspiring belief in the need for Lifelong Learning and the impact such projects can have.\r\nHaving started as an absolute beginner, I have worked hard to maintain, develop and practice language that I learnt during my time at Centro Fiorenza and have funded several trips myself, to the same institution, in order to establish a strong sense of continuity in my learning. \r\nThe opportunity to return again to Centro Fiorenza, motivates me enormously and in this way, I have been able to rapidly improve my language ability, due to the preparatory work that I complete throughout the year and the intensity of the programme and experience that I immerse myself in.\r\nI am now proud to say that I have taught French, Spanish and Italian to GCSE level. The Erasmus + experience alters my teaching. As well as studying various areas of teaching methodology, I find that my experience as the learner is absolutely invaluable. I frequently refer to my recent/current language learning experiences to demonstrate to my pupils that I am in tune with the frustrations, challenges and successes that they feel during their foreign language journey. I think that I am a positive role model and a live example to the pupils in my charge, that the desire to learn more, accomplish more and experience more, adds to the diversity of life and should be a life long objective.\r\nI would develop my teaching and learning skills even more by participating in a 1 week x 5 day course: \"Italian Language, Culture and Methodology Course\" in August 2016. Developmental ideas from my training would be developed and implemented in September 2017. As Head of Department I am responsible for designing and delivering departmental training. I have a reputation of consistently seeking improvement and enhancing strategies, practice and protocols that are in place. I\r\nRegarding long term benefits developed by such language projects, I would intend to develop pupils thirst for life through their interaction and language communication, as global citizens, along with an ongoing understanding on the issues of respect, diversity and tolerance.\r\nI am an enormously committed teacher, learner and leader and I am truly passionate about this project. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to be able to be able to aspire to my teaching, learning and leading goals and remain truly grateful that I am able to participate in Lifelong Learning experiences.\r\nMy Italian skills have been useful in cases where native Italian speakers at St. Monica's have communicated in the target language. I have been able to translate concerns and then we have been able to understand the needs of these pupils fully.\r\nI believe that it is crucial to keep the mind and memory challenged as one grows older, in order to maintain a fresh and healthy teaching and learning attitude to transfer to those in your charge. \r\nI hope to be on linguistic support to the Trip to Rome planned for 2017. This trip involves staff from RE and MFL and is an example of how staff self development is actively encouraged and my experience of trips abroad and languages enable me to be of ultimate help during the preparation stages and beyond.", "http://www.stmonicas.co.uk", "St. Monica's R.C.High School and Sixth Form Centre", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035380_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["4LA", "RMC", "BEAUMONT HOSPITAL"], ["4LA", "RRF", "THE BEAUMONT HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BL6"}
