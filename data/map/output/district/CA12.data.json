Volunteers will work across  generations, mentored by trained sports coaches and gaining their own sports coaching qualifications at the same time. They will work in schools coaching children in a multi- sport capacity, work with youth groups on low level sports coaching and with community organisations helping older generations get back to sport or to take up more active lifestyles. Momentum World is the co-ordinating organisation and Keswick Community Rugby Trust (Keswick Rugby) the receiving organisation.  The objectives of the project are: \r\n-To offer relevant work experience to build volunteers cv's and enhance future employability through confidence building measures.\r\n- To improve competences in sports coaching as a pathway to future employment by gaining recognised qualifications and hands on practice working with young people and older generations\r\n- To improve language skills by use of English on a daily basis with groups and colleagues\r\n- To give an opportunity to take leadership positions working with groups on games, fitness sessions, workshops, discussion and reflection sessions\r\n- To enhance intercultural awareness through working in an atypical English community that is at the same time international with a mixture of nationalities working in hospitality and tourism. \r\nThe profile for volunteers to be placed with Keswick Rugby will be young people with enthusiasm, who want to work with other people of all generations and who have confidence in speaking to and leading others. They will have an interest in sports and healthy lifestyle. They will be energetic and thirsty for new knowledge and intercultural experience.  \r\nThis volunteering opportunity offers the chance to experience interesting and rewarding work in a professional but fun environment. Volunteers would be part of the delivery of the Active Keswick concept working with others to deliver programmes to all ages, abilities and genders across a range of activity areas including sport and outdoor education. Working as a volunteer team member helping other people,will develop self confidence and esteem. Keswick Rugby is well established and well resourced. The level of learning experience will be high and the project offers many chances to improve English language skills . As the volunteer experience moves on in the year the individual volunteer will gain more leadership practice, communication skills and intercultural knowledge with exposure to UK people and the local population. All of this will provide evidence to enhance cv's and future job prospects. \r\nThe expected impact on participants is \r\n - Improved skills for employability \r\n - Improved language skills\r\n- Official coaching qualifications\r\n- New networks of professional friends\r\n- New organisational and leadership skills\r\n- Greater intercultural understanding\r\n- Possible opportunities to develop personal skills later by joining the Europeers network led in the UK by Momentum World but established as an EU wide network\r\nFor partner organisations ;\r\n- Widening scope of operations\r\n- Deepening successful relationships with partners\r\n- A broader offer to potential volunteers\r\n- Also organisational opportunities through the Europeers network\r\nFor target groups such as other young people involved with organisations or considering being involved, the dissemination by word of mouth and social media will encourage more to get involved with EVS and Erasmus+ programmes in general. Local stakeholders including local authorities, other organisations and family and friends will also realise the positive benefits of the project.
