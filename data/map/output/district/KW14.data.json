In particular, the project will stimulate collaboration in research activities leading towards innovative, cost efficient and environmentally benign offshore RE conversion platforms for wind, wave and other ocean energy resources, for their combined use as well as for the complementary use such as aquaculture and monitoring of the sea environment. The use of the offshore resources for RE generation is a relatively new field of interest. ORECCA will overcome the knowledge fragmentation existing in Europe and stimulate the key experts to provide useful inputs to industries, research organizations and policy makers (stakeholders) on the necessary next steps to foster the development of the ocean energy sector in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way. A focus will be given to respect the strategies developed towards an integrated European maritime policy. The project will define the technological state of the art, describe the existing economical and legislative framework and identify barriers, constraints and needs within. ORECCA will enable collaboration of the stakeholders and will define the framework for future exploitation of offshore RE sources by defining 2 approaches: pilot testing of technologies at an initial stage and large scale deployment of offshore RE farms at a mature stage. ORECCA will finally develop a vision including different technical options for deployment of offshore energy conversion platforms for different target areas in the European seas and deliver integrated roadmaps for the stakeholders. These will define the strategic investment opportunities, the R&amp;D priorities and the regulatory and socio-economics aspects that need to be addressed in the short to the medium term to achieve a vision and a strategy for a European policy towards the development of the offshore RE sector", 28593.0, 1549794.0, "ORECCA", "A roadmap for sustainable ocean energy", "An EU-funded project has drawn up a roadmap for offshore renewable energy using knowledge from around the world.

Furuhedsskolan have since 2010 had a exchange with Thurso in Scotland and have established a contakt.\r\n \r\nObjectives of your project;  \r\nThrough an exchange experiences will flow into and in some cases get implemented in the different organisations in purpuse to raise quality within school and Health Care.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants; \r\n3 students will attend in the exchange. This because it's easier to find placements to a few students. The students are in their final year at the Health and Care programme in secondary school and this is their final placement before they graduate.\r\n1 teacher from the Health and Care programme will accompany the students during their first week in Scotland to get them setteld. The teacher are one of the Healt Care teachers at the programme that the student attend in Kalix.\r\n\r\nDescription of activities; \r\nThe students will attend classes in the hostcollege during their first week\r\nThe duration of the placements within health care are 2,5 weeks.\r\nDuring evenings/weekends the students will attend activities to get a more profound knowledge of Scotlands culture and uniform standards.\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project;\r\nBefore the exchange: The teachers in Kalix will have continous contact with the teachers in Thurso. Wich preparation are needed before the students come \"over seas\" (bloodtests, insurances and so on).\r\nThurso tells Kalix wich placements that are possible, the students will then choose and the information are then forwarded to Thurso.\r\nDuring the exchange:\r\nThe teacher accompanies the students to Scotland to get them setteld and attend practical questions that has to be solved before the teacher goes back to Sweden.\r\nThe students attend activities and do their placement during a total of almost 4 weeks. \r\nAfter the exchange:\r\nAfter coming back home the students communicates their experiences to other students, concerned parties and future workplaces.\r\n\r\nA short description of the results and impact envisaged:\r\nThe importance of communiaktion, both be able to speek different languages, and the quality it gives in human contakt when you break down preconceptions.\r\nThat the students sees that it is the will and curage that matters in communication.\r\n\r\nFinally the potential longer term benefits:\r\nTeacher, students and other concerned parties will get a increasily understanding of the outside world and a bigger understanding for other people.", "http://www.northhighland.uhi.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA102-034308_1"], ["8AJ", "Efni og a\u00f0fer\u00f0ir og tenging vi\u00f0 evr\u00f3pskt menntakerfi og starfsumhverfi fyrir nemendur og kennara.", "Caithness Horizons", 53738.0, "The project is made up of 4 different projects: 1. Teaching exchange, 2. Staff training, 3. VET learners traineeships in companies  4. VET learners traineeships in vocational institutes. \r\nSeven teachers are going to Europe on teacher exchanges. Myndlistask\u00f3linn \u00ed Reykjav\u00edk (The Reykjavik School of Visual Arts) has made a Memorandum of Understanding with the Einar Granum Kunstfagskole in Oslo for four teachers from both schools over a two year period. Other teachers will be going on teacher exchanges to Scotland and France.\r\nOn the staff training project are a librarian and two teachers. The librarian will be visiting the Gerrit Rietveld Academie to learn more about how libraries that have an emphasis on art and design serve their students. One of the teachers is going for a month\u2018s staff training at Wagner & Apel Porzellan, a porcelain factory in Germany. This teacher graduated from the Ceramic Department at M\u00edR in 2015 and now teaches plaster mould making at the same school. The other teacher is the head of the Painting/Fine Art Department at M\u00edR and is taking 10 students from the department to Stichting 57 Poort in Holland. \r\nThree students who have completed their first year at the Textile Department are doing traineeship in companies. Their goal is to experience further specialization in the area of textile design, textile printing, pattern making, embroidery and the running of companies. With this work experience the students will get a greater understanding of various specializations, an understanding of professional practices and the experience of working abroad. They will gain new knowledge which they will bring back and strengthen their further studies at M\u00edR and will be able to share their experiences with fellow pupils and teachers. \r\nA student, who graduates from M\u00edR in 2017, will be doing a 12-month work experience at Studio Egill Saebj\u00f6rnsson UG in Berlin. Egill S\u00e6bj\u00f6rnsson is one of Iceland\u2018s leading arists and has been chosen to represent the country at the Venice Biennale in 2017. The object of the work experience is to see and understand a very differnt approach to ceramics than is taught at the school. The work involves making various object from clay and porcelain \u2013 everything from wall and floor tiles to tableware and vases to sculpture and everyday objects like toilet bowls and sinks. The student will take part in a large project that Egill will be working on in Sweden which will be in cooperation with around 2000 immigrants. \r\nOn the school trip 10 students will travel to Holland in their third semester at the Painting/Fine Art Department. One teacher from the department will accompany them. He will prepare the students culturally and professionally for the trip. The experiences and project work accumulated during the trip will be used to further enhance the students\u2018 education when they return as well as being a basis for an exhibition for the whole school. The trip is planned as part of the students\u2018 curriculum and will award each student 5 ECTS credits. Stichting 57 Poort, the partner institution for the trip, provides studios for practising artists in Amsterdam. Twenty-five artists work in various fields of art: graphic arts, painting and scultpture. The students will be able to interact and in some cases assist these artists and by doing so will learn about different art techniques and practices.\r\nMyndlistask\u00f3linn \u00ed Reykjav\u00edk (The Reykjavik School of Visual Arts) ecourages all its teachers and students to increase their knowledge and experience by doing work experience, staff training and by visiting other institutions as guest teachers. It is of great importance that they are given the opportunity to be aware of what is happening within their disciplines in Europe, to strengthen their connections with others in Europe and to grow and be inspired within their work and studies. Teachers and students can apply every year in December for the possibility to take part in work experience, staff training or to become guest teachers. The quality of the applications is carefully scrutinized and successful applicants chosen. During the project all successful applicants keep journals which are a combination of text and visuals: illustrations, photographs and even films. On their return a detailed report is submitted  in which the project is described and what was learned discussed. That  knowledge and experience is then further shared with the school. So as not to be isolated in such a small community and small country, it is vitally important for continual interaction not only within the school but also with students and teachers in other countries. It is important that the participants in these projects impart their experiences and the knowledge they gain not only with their colleagues but also outside the school in the form of lectures and conferences.", "http://www.caithnesshorizons.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IS01-KA116-026470_8"]]}}, "outwardCode": "KW14"}
