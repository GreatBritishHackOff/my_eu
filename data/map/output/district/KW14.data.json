In particular, the project will stimulate collaboration in research activities leading towards innovative, cost efficient and environmentally benign offshore RE conversion platforms for wind, wave and other ocean energy resources, for their combined use as well as for the complementary use such as aquaculture and monitoring of the sea environment. The use of the offshore resources for RE generation is a relatively new field of interest. ORECCA will overcome the knowledge fragmentation existing in Europe and stimulate the key experts to provide useful inputs to industries, research organizations and policy makers (stakeholders) on the necessary next steps to foster the development of the ocean energy sector in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way. A focus will be given to respect the strategies developed towards an integrated European maritime policy. The project will define the technological state of the art, describe the existing economical and legislative framework and identify barriers, constraints and needs within. ORECCA will enable collaboration of the stakeholders and will define the framework for future exploitation of offshore RE sources by defining 2 approaches: pilot testing of technologies at an initial stage and large scale deployment of offshore RE farms at a mature stage. ORECCA will finally develop a vision including different technical options for deployment of offshore energy conversion platforms for different target areas in the European seas and deliver integrated roadmaps for the stakeholders. These will define the strategic investment opportunities, the R&amp;D priorities and the regulatory and socio-economics aspects that need to be addressed in the short to the medium term to achieve a vision and a strategy for a European policy towards the development of the offshore RE sector", 28593.0, 1549794.0, "ORECCA", "A roadmap for sustainable ocean energy", "An EU-funded project has drawn up a roadmap for offshore renewable energy using knowledge from around the world.

ARCH programmes have seen over 1,000 learners from a wide range of government and non-governmental organisations within Scotland visit a variety countries within Europe to learn about the different ways in which new skills and competencies in nature conservation and cultural heritage interpretation can be delivered.  \r\nNature Exchange Two (NET) aims to provide adult learner participants with a focused, ready-made opportunity to take time out from their every-day work to learn about how conservation, education and interpretation work is undertaken elsewhere in Europe and give them an opportunity to consider new ways of working.  \r\nNET  will collaborate with partners throughout Europe from Iceland and Norway in the north to Cyprus and Bulgaria in the south. The aim is to develop knowledge exchange trips (typically of 8-10 days) that focus on the management of our natural and cultural heritage.  NET is developed around the priority areas of work within natural and cultural heritage, conservation interpretation and education in Scotland today.  Each training visit will be associated with a broad theme, which will provide a focus for activities through the week.  Emphasis will be placed on exchange of knowledge, ideas, issues and solutions between the participants and hosts. Informal talks by participants on their work in Scotland and challenges they face, as well as talks from the hosts, encouraging focused discussion on how both participants and hosts can benefit from each other\u2019s knowledge and experiences and how they can  build this into ongoing adult education courses.  \r\nAs in previous years, we will work with our partners to develop adult education training placements, which focus on new skills and knowledge and have the capacity for the exchange of best practice that fits with participants needs. For example in Germany the programme will focus on the wildcat and on preserving and managing its habitat, In Iceland the focus will be interpretive techniques for understanding and conserving the cultural landscape, including the traditional skills of turf building. In Finland and Slovakia the programme theme is forest schools and environmental education.  In Norway the themes are large mammal management, fishery management, predator control and balancing hunting and conservation interests.\r\nOur partners all  share our aim of providing high quality and innovative vocational training.  Receiving partners have been chosen because they are recognised by the UK consortium as being able to provide examples of best practice in the key areas identified as most important for our Scottish practitioners to learn. What they offer has the potential to be built into adult education, both formal and informal. \r\nNET participants will be drawn from the 14 member organisations in the ARCH mobility consortium which includes Scottish Natural Heritage, RSPB, National Trust for Scotland, Forestry Commision Scotland  and John Muir Trust all of whom have a remit to manage and protect Scotland\u2019s natural and cultural heritage through conservation, interpretation and education.

The workshops consists of teaching students to draw visual narratives which can be transfered to a tapestry. One task is to teach the students to present strong female characters in the storytelling as is done in the Icelandic Sagas. The teacher, Krist\u00edn Ragna Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir, an artist and literary scholar, has a strong background in designing and drawing visual narratives and she designed the pictures printed on the Njal\u00b4s saga tapestry for sewing (njalurefill.is).

The School of Design will also be visited and it\u00b4s graduation exhibition. The Ceramics Department is already in cooperation with the School of Design Bornholm.

The tasks of the vocational training will be to learn how to run a workshop and to take part and get experienced in many of the routines in a studio like: glazing, kiln packing, running workshops for children, grinding after glaze, firing, Facebook communication, making production for Christmas decoration, cleaning, packing big pots for sending and so on. One to two days a week (+ most weekends) the student will have time to work for herself in a other workshop which is used for wheel throwing classes. The student will get tasks and practice how to throw porcelain. The student will be responsible for this studio work: kiln packing, cleaning, glaze making but most of the time is used for throwing porcelain. In springtime the student will take part in and learn how to fire a wood fire kiln in Sk\u00e6lsk\u00f8r. The vocational training starts in August 2016 where the student takes part in the big craft fair Fruepladsmarked in Copenhagen.

Their goal is to experience further specialization in the area of textile design, textile printing, pattern making, embroidery and the running of companies. With this work experience the students will get a greater understanding of various specializations, an understanding of professional practices and the experience of working abroad.

The work involves making various object from clay and porcelain \u2013 everything from wall and floor tiles to tableware and vases to sculpture and everyday objects like toilet bowls and sinks. The student will take part in a large project that Egill will be working on in Sweden which will be in cooperation with around 2000 immigrants. \r\nOn the school trip 10 students will travel to Holland in their third semester at the Painting/Fine Art Department. One teacher from the department will accompany them. He will prepare the students culturally and professionally for the trip. The experiences and project work accumulated during the trip will be used to further enhance the students\u2018 education when they return as well as being a basis for an exhibition for the whole school. The trip is planned as part of the students\u2018 curriculum and will award each student 5 ECTS credits.
