Furthermore, these animals also were resistant to diet-induced obesity, suggesting that one secret to long life may be a more adaptable response to food intake by the hypothalamus.\n\nOther findings point to the role of stress in ageing. In rodents researchers were able to identify the early-stress response region in the promoter for the glucocorticoid receptor and how hypermethylation improved this region's response to stress. In human studies of psychological stress this was found to have a negative impact on immunity both young and older adult caregivers but was more pronounced in older adults.
