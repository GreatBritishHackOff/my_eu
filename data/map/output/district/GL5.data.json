It is the development a novel low cost, high efficiency linear generator for marine wave energy extraction, (Snapper). Initially embedded within \u2018Point Absorbers\u2019 and then transferable to other marine energy type capture devices, both wave and tidal, with energy efficiency of the generator of between 75%-80%. The primary advantage of the Snapper technology extending it beyond the state of the art is its ability to act as a magnetic gearing system. This leads to a significant reduction of the mass of the materials needed within the electrical generator, especially rare earth magnets. This will result in a cost saving, based on the raw materials from over \u20ac40k to under \u20ac7k for a 175KW electrical machine. This will enable a step change in the economic potential for the conversion of wave energy into electricity. To achieve this our technological objectives are: 1) To provide a low friction interface; a coefficient of friction (of not greater than 0.2\u03bc) between the translator and the stator with a design lifetime of 20 years operation, 2) To achieve a robustness of design according to six sigma criteria, 3) To achieve environmental protection of the development against marine environments; up to a depth of 60m (6 BAR), wave loading (25 year storm event),salinity (3.5%), anticorrosion (5 year) and biofouling (5 year); and, 4) ensuring that the development is intrinsically environmentally benign. We will also ensure that the system is grid compatible i.e.can be connected to an electrical distribution grid.", 160953.0, 1211024.0, "SNAPPER", null, null, null, "http://www.snapperfp7.eu", "http://www.ecotricity.co.uk", null, "fp7_91915_998173748"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["4AH", "Elite sport Apprenticeships  (preparing for the work)", "South Gloucestershire and Stroud College", 179929.0, "Back ground - The Advanced Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (AASE) as is a unique Level 3 qualification that prepares athletes who have a realistic potential of achieving excellence by either becoming a professional athlete or for a role in sport and health. It is  The Sporting National Governing Bodies (NGB's)  \"own\" AASE and select appropriate athletes from their England talent pathway  and select the delivery coaches to assess the programme. NGB's  chose an educational institution to manage AASE for them. This is the only apprenticeship in the UK where apprentices are given an exemption from the 30 hours a week in the work place (such as a plumbing apprentice) to concentrate on excellence in their sport. This is essential to become an elite athlete. As an education institution that enrolls over 300 AASE apprentices a year and runs AASE  for 7 different sports  nationally, SGS also recognises the importance for any young person to experience the world of work to learn the skills required to enhance employability and career opportunities and feels that AASE apprentices are disadvantaged by not having this experience. An overseas work placement  is specifically relevant to these apprentices as any successful athlete will be required to travel, live, train and work abroad. This experience will prepare them for this life change and make the transition easier, more effective, enjoyable and successful. \r\nObjectives  - In addition to employability skills, apprentices will also benefit from improving other essential skills such as communication, linguistic acquisition, improving cultural awareness, values and respect for others and enhancing social and soft skills, increasing motivation and keeping young people engaged in the sport industry and a healthy lifestyle, enhancing retention, achievement and ultimate success on AASE, accelerating the depth of learning and knowledge on AASE and preventing withdrawals from education running the risk of being unqualified and potentially unemployable. All are detailed in section E.\r\nParticipants - We aim to send  80 apprentices to Tenerife, over 18 months, in 6 flows lasting from 2 weeks to 4 weeks.  It is difficult to be exact with numbers, timings and flows at application stage. We have planned around the known essentials such academic holidays, major sporting events and specific sporting seasons however there could be minor circumstantial changes. Golf apprentices attend for 4 weeks  at the request of the golf clubs that we have worked with on mobility projects for the last 7 years. They like apprentices to work in each club and each department on a rotation to get a realistic experience of the industry and different management styles. The rest of the sports go for 2 weeks and coach local children in schools or summer camps, this is sufficient time to gain a depth of knowledge and understanding.\r\nActivities and Methodology - The whole mobility project has been meticulously designed  with daily activities to capture evidence required to competently complete units of AASE. This is evidenced through practical observations, written statements, witness testimonies, Q&A, video analysis and by completing daily AASE workbooks that are marked every evening. Assessment is carried out by  22 accompanying staff who are qualified and experienced AASE deliverers/coaches/assessors and attend work placement and all other activities with the apprentices to ensure there are no missed assessment opportunities. This allows  \"on the job\" experience and training where evidence can be captured immediately by assessors.\r\nAn examples of an assessment:  Apprentices prepare, manage, deliver and evaluate coaching sessions for young local children in schools often introducing them to new sports not readily available on the island such as boxing, fencing and female rugby or improving their skills in popular sports such as basketball. The children are delighted to be coached by some of the UK's most elite young athletes and learning something new. We now have awaiting list of new schools requesting us to work with them. In the golf clubs accompanying golf PGA assessors attend daily to assess the golfers \"on the job\" such as observing them managing the pro shop or golf lessons. This is not always possible in the UK as much of the evidence is \"off the job\" and simulated through classroom or practical sessions. Athletes also attend salsa and flamenco lessons where they are expected to communicate with locals in Spanish and complete a run up Mount Teide with a local altitude specialist which they must analyse the technical, tactical, physical and mental effects.\r\nResults and impact are easily evaluated through AASE unit completion during the project but also through apprentice evaluation interviews on completion and a video that each flow are expected to produce as a team to play to other College and NGB staff on return to the UK and is used to promote mobility projects to future AASE students.\r\n.", "http://www.sgscol.ac.uk", "South Gloucestershire and Stroud College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036361_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["2HY", "R1J", "STROUD GENERAL HOSPITAL"], ["2HY", "RTE", "STROUD GENERAL HOSPITAL"], ["2JB", "RTE", "STROUD MATERNITY HOSPITAL"], ["2HY", "RTQ", "STROUD GENERAL HOSPITAL"], ["2HY", "RYF", "STROUD GENERAL HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "GL5"}
