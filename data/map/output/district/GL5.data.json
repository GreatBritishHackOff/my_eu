It is the development a novel low cost, high efficiency linear generator for marine wave energy extraction, (Snapper). Initially embedded within \u2018Point Absorbers\u2019 and then transferable to other marine energy type capture devices, both wave and tidal, with energy efficiency of the generator of between 75%-80%. The primary advantage of the Snapper technology extending it beyond the state of the art is its ability to act as a magnetic gearing system. This leads to a significant reduction of the mass of the materials needed within the electrical generator, especially rare earth magnets. This will result in a cost saving, based on the raw materials from over \u20ac40k to under \u20ac7k for a 175KW electrical machine. This will enable a step change in the economic potential for the conversion of wave energy into electricity. To achieve this our technological objectives are: 1) To provide a low friction interface; a coefficient of friction (of not greater than 0.2\u03bc) between the translator and the stator with a design lifetime of 20 years operation, 2) To achieve a robustness of design according to six sigma criteria, 3) To achieve environmental protection of the development against marine environments; up to a depth of 60m (6 BAR), wave loading (25 year storm event),salinity (3.5%), anticorrosion (5 year) and biofouling (5 year); and, 4) ensuring that the development is intrinsically environmentally benign.

In order to maximise our teaching and consequently the learning of our pupils we need supporting with the development and expertise of staff.\r\n\r\nWe strongly believe that raising the standards of our teaching of French language and culture, by providing high quality immersion training courses for our staff, will have an enormously positive impact on our children.  Initially we plan to focus on the professional development of our MFL coordinator. She will then disseminate her new knowledge and skills to  colleagues and motivate and encourage two other members of staff to participate in training to suit their skills and needs.  Raising standards of teaching throughout KS2 will enable us to fulfill our ambition of cross curricular language teaching. \r\n\r\nCommunication within the school is crucial so as to maximise the positive effect of high quality training and we have in place a very productive system of peer support and lesson observations which we will utilise to ensure good practice permeates out to all classes. \r\n\r\nThis project is fully supported by the Headteacher and Governing Body and our School Improvement Plan shows the commitment that we have to drive this project forward.\r\n\r\nBy having increased expertise upon our staff our children will benefit from high quality lessons.

In 2011 it was a new, exciting, large scale, and truly innovative proposal that proved ground breaking in what it offered. It was the first project of its kind and required an open mindedness and flexibility from all partners and the national funding agency.\r\nAASE is an advanced level 3 national apprenticeship programme funded by the national apprenticeship service, established by the sector skills council for sport and owned by national governing bodies (NGB's) SGS manage the quality and delivery of the apprenticeship for the NGB's and currently work with 6 sports, and 600 AASE learners based all around England.\r\nAASE is the only apprenticeship that has been given a government exemption of the 30 hours a week work based placement requirement. This was given in recognition of the time elite athletes need to dedicate to sport training. The exemption is necessary for sporting success, however it does mean young people with exceptional sporting talent hoping to represent their country do not have the opportunity to experience a realistic work environment and learn the life skills required to succeed in the work place. This is essential for any young person to enhance future employment opportunities and career longevity. Traditionally talented young sports people have ignored their education to focus on their sporting goal. AASE has been designed to prepare athletes for sporting success but also for employment outside of their sport. \r\nThe main objectives of the mobility project are to give 150 AASE participants a year the opportunity to learn from European experts in their field, gain valuable life skills, train in a different environment at altitude and on different terrain, experience a different culture, learn a new language, build European relationships, share good practice with European peers, and collect valuable evidence towards units of the AASE qualification that will accelerate learning and improve success rates. The ultimate aim is to prepare the apprentices for the world of work. \r\nThe participants are from a variety of ethnic, cultural, social and economic backgrounds. Many will not have travelled outside of the UK or experienced flying, however their elite level of sporting success may require them to move away from home to Europe and further afield for extended periods of time at the end of their course!\r\nThe main work based activity for AASE participants is coaching local Spanish children in schools, camps and club environments. Participants are required to plan, manage, deliver and evaluate engaging, inclusive, fun and informative coaching sessions for all ages and abilities ensuring aims and objectives of each session are met. This helps local participation in sport, introduces new sports to the limited Spanish curriculum and allows sharing of high level expertise and techniques with those local children who are already participating but wish to further their skills.  \r\nCoaching young children of different ages, gender, backgrounds, cultures, learning needs, interests and communication levels hits a tremendous amount of the learning outcomes for AASE coaching and communication units. Learning is accelerated in this environment beyond anything that could be offered in the UK or within a simulated environment. It is life changing for our AASE participants in the experience, confidence and joy it gives them. Accompanying AASE staff observe and assess participant\u2019s performance against the specific AASE qualification criteria so no learning or assessment opportunities are missed. This is included in the Learning agreement.\r\nA meticulously detailed timetable includes; An AASE specific education programme delivered by the FU, Spanish lessons, local cultural activities, sport training, altitude training and some free time. It has to be structured to ensure high level sport training with coaches and AASE study continue throughout. The timetable is planned in consultation with participants, coaches, parents, NGB's, placement providers, the FU and SGS to ensure all activities are directly relevant to achieving the project objectives and the AASE units. Each project is continually evaluated.\r\nThe main impact is to enhance participant\u2019s education and giving them a European placement which will empower them to actively participate in society, teach important life and social skills to open their eyes to a life outside of sport and the UK, strengthen their employability and help facilitate their transition to the labour market.", "http://www.sgscol.ac.uk", "South Gloucestershire and Stroud College", "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA102-012222_coordinator"], ["1DF", "It`s time for Time Bank", "Time Banks UK", 12233.0, "The project \u201cIt`s time for Time Bank\u201d comes as a follow up of close partnership between coordinating (KURO) and hosting (SFERA) organizations  and willingness to make a step forward  strengthening the role and positive influence of Time Bank Programme  to the local, national and international issues such as youth participation, involvement of young people  with fewer opportunities in social services and development of  youth entrepreneurship.  \r\nThe main objectives of the project are:\r\n1.To share the best practices of work with young people in the frame of Time Bank program in different  Programme and Parner countries.\r\n2.To develop common strategy on inclusion of young people to the Time Bank projects.\r\n3.To develop skills of youth workers involved in Time Bank program.\r\n4.To develop common Time Bank projects, activities and tools for work with young people.\r\n5.

Increasing customer expectations are driving the need for improved customer service skills and a capable, confident and experienced workforce must be developed to respond to this demand. The learners will work in tourist businesses undertaking activities which will correspond to the mandatory units of their NVQ, so that they can continue to gain course credits whilst on placement.Participants will be based in a tourist businesses, in a range of customer facing roles. They will be involved in activities such as working on reception, arranging excursions and marketing tourist activities in established businesses including a tour company, 5* hotel and a museum. Through structured overseas work placements in a range of established tourist businesses, participants will gain a vital insight into international work in the sector. They will have the opportunity to develop their practical skills, increase their vocational knowledge and acquire industry specific competencies. They will be supported to develop soft skills, such as communication, team work, cultural awareness and customer service ethic. In addition to their professional and personal development, the project will offer language training to increase participants' competency in Spanish. We will work with host organisations to identify suitable Learning Outcomes that are realistic and attainable for the participants and relevant to both the host partner and the NVQ that participants are studying. \r\n\r\nWe plan to target participants who have not previously had opportunities to work or study abroad.

It is  The Sporting National Governing Bodies (NGB's)  \"own\" AASE and select appropriate athletes from their England talent pathway  and select the delivery coaches to assess the programme. NGB's  chose an educational institution to manage AASE for them. This is the only apprenticeship in the UK where apprentices are given an exemption from the 30 hours a week in the work place (such as a plumbing apprentice) to concentrate on excellence in their sport. This is essential to become an elite athlete. As an education institution that enrolls over 300 AASE apprentices a year and runs AASE  for 7 different sports  nationally, SGS also recognises the importance for any young person to experience the world of work to learn the skills required to enhance employability and career opportunities and feels that AASE apprentices are disadvantaged by not having this experience. An overseas work placement  is specifically relevant to these apprentices as any successful athlete will be required to travel, live, train and work abroad. This experience will prepare them for this life change and make the transition easier, more effective, enjoyable and successful. \r\nObjectives  - In addition to employability skills, apprentices will also benefit from improving other essential skills such as communication, linguistic acquisition, improving cultural awareness, values and respect for others and enhancing social and soft skills, increasing motivation and keeping young people engaged in the sport industry and a healthy lifestyle, enhancing retention, achievement and ultimate success on AASE, accelerating the depth of learning and knowledge on AASE and preventing withdrawals from education running the risk of being unqualified and potentially unemployable. All are detailed in section E.\r\nParticipants - We aim to send  80 apprentices to Tenerife, over 18 months, in 6 flows lasting from 2 weeks to 4 weeks.  It is difficult to be exact with numbers, timings and flows at application stage. We have planned around the known essentials such academic holidays, major sporting events and specific sporting seasons however there could be minor circumstantial changes. Golf apprentices attend for 4 weeks  at the request of the golf clubs that we have worked with on mobility projects for the last 7 years. They like apprentices to work in each club and each department on a rotation to get a realistic experience of the industry and different management styles. The rest of the sports go for 2 weeks and coach local children in schools or summer camps, this is sufficient time to gain a depth of knowledge and understanding.\r\nActivities and Methodology - The whole mobility project has been meticulously designed  with daily activities to capture evidence required to competently complete units of AASE. This is evidenced through practical observations, written statements, witness testimonies, Q&A, video analysis and by completing daily AASE workbooks that are marked every evening. Assessment is carried out by  22 accompanying staff who are qualified and experienced AASE deliverers/coaches/assessors and attend work placement and all other activities with the apprentices to ensure there are no missed assessment opportunities. This allows  \"on the job\" experience and training where evidence can be captured immediately by assessors.\r\nAn examples of an assessment:  Apprentices prepare, manage, deliver and evaluate coaching sessions for young local children in schools often introducing them to new sports not readily available on the island such as boxing, fencing and female rugby or improving their skills in popular sports such as basketball. The children are delighted to be coached by some of the UK's most elite young athletes and learning something new. We now have awaiting list of new schools requesting us to work with them. In the golf clubs accompanying golf PGA assessors attend daily to assess the golfers \"on the job\" such as observing them managing the pro shop or golf lessons. This is not always possible in the UK as much of the evidence is \"off the job\" and simulated through classroom or practical sessions. Athletes also attend salsa and flamenco lessons where they are expected to communicate with locals in Spanish and complete a run up Mount Teide with a local altitude specialist which they must analyse the technical, tactical, physical and mental effects.\r\nResults and impact are easily evaluated through AASE unit completion during the project but also through apprentice evaluation interviews on completion and a video that each flow are expected to produce as a team to play to other College and NGB staff on return to the UK and is used to promote mobility projects to future AASE students.\r\n.", "http://www.sgscol.ac.uk", "South Gloucestershire and Stroud College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036361_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "GL5"}
