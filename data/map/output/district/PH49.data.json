These range from Caledonian forests, raised and active blanket bogs, to species rich Nardus grassland, alpine and subalpine heaths and sub Arctic willow scrub. Their nature conservation importance has been reflected in the large number of upland sites proposed as candidate SACs for Scotland. However, the majority of these sites are threatened by overgrazing from domestic sheep and wild herbivores. While both domestic stock and wild deer are acknowledged as being of vital importance to the local economy in these upland areas, the impact of overgrazing and of grazing abandonment has serious consequences for the conservation of these important areas. Considerable research on upland grazing ecology has already highlighted this problem but, until now, little attempt has been made to develop grazing management plans for sites of conservation importance in order to promote balanced and ecologically sustainable use of such upland areas in Scotland. .", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=66", null, "life_317"]]}}}}
