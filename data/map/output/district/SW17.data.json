There is a growing concern that the loss of therapeutic options will present us with a post-antibiotic era where present and future medical advances are negated.  Resistant bacteria dramatically reduce the possibilities of treating infections effectively, and drastically increase the risk of complications with a fatal outcome.  Antimicrobial resistance, however, is an unavoidable consequence of antibiotic use and therefore new, effective antibacterials will always be needed and once developed should be used carefully, avoiding the overuse which can drive resistance.  Despite the recognized need for new antimicrobials for clinical use, the reality is that only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to market in the last 30 years and many drug developers have left the field.  This urgency is especially true when considering resistant Gram-negative infections where carbapenem-resistance is rising and use of drugs of last resort, such as colistin, is increasing. The New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs (ND4BB) initiative is a series of programmes designed to directly address some of the scientific challenges associated with antibacterial drug discovery and development.  The ND4BB ENABLE consortium will meet the challenges ahead by creating and optimising a portfolio of new antibiotics ranging from Hits through Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe overarching goals of the ENABLE consortium are to: 1) create a drug discovery platform with the expertise and resource base to prosecute multiple antibacterial programmes in parallel; and 2) increase the overall pipeline in the antibacterial area by applying this platform to optimise a variety of antibacterial programmes.  More specifically the key objectives of the consortium are designed to increase the overall pipeline of high quality, novel mode of action medicines to treat serious systemic Gram-negative infections by identifying three antibacterial Leads, two antibacterial Candidates and progressing at least one compound into preclinical and Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe platform group is made up of academics and SMEs from across Europe with the diverse expertise including from clinical microbiology, in vivo pharmacology, computational and medicinal chemistry, ADME profiling, PKPD modelling, pharmaceutics, assay development and screening all needed to undertake this programme.  This group, coupled with additional expertise and advice from within the EFPIA partners, will bring an unrivalled focus and breadth of judgment to this important area of research.  \n\nThe programmes are coming from institutions across Europe, initially with seven efforts from public partners, and arising from a novel discovery stage alliance between GSK and Sanofi.  These initial programmes to be considered for ENABLE cover a diverse landscape of targets and approaches including natural products, PNA-peptides, synthetic small molecules, and follow ups / improvements to medicines already available.  In addition, soon after initiation, ENABLE will launch an open call for additional efforts to create a sustainable portfolio of antibacterial discovery programmes moving forward. \n\nThe ENABLE consortium will provide a unique opportunity for a productive collaboration between leading European academic researchers, SMEs and the pharmaceutical industry. We believe these interactions will be synergistic for everyone concerned. Bringing together different disciplines for the common goals outlined in this proposal will make Europe the world-leader in antimicrobial drug discovery.

In a very recent report the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) represent an immediate public health threat that requires urgent and aggressive action (CDC: Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States 2013).\n\nThe epidemiology of MDR-GNB, and especially of CRE, is characterized by large heterogeneity in genotypes (with >20 reported resistance genes, such as NDM, KPC, VIM, OXA-48) and even larger heterogeneity of phenotypes, seriously hampering rapid detection of resistant types when using routine susceptibility testing. Treatment of infections caused by CRE relies on combinations of \u201colder\u201d antibiotics, lacking a strong evidence base of effectiveness and safety. New treatments for these infections are, therefore, urgently needed.\n\nThe COMBACTE-CARE consortium is building on the recently funded Topic 1a/b/c consortium: COMBACTE, and contains three networks: CLIN-Net, LAB-Net and STAT-Net. To fulfil the specific objectives of Topic 5 the consortium has focussed on capacity building in clinical sites in some of the new member states in south-eastern Europe, where infection rates with MDR-GNB are expected to be high. Together with high-quality study sites in countries with endemic levels of MDR-GNB (such as Israel and Greece) CLIN-Net and LAB-Net will maximize capacity to provide a highly efficient resource for the conduct of the proposed studies on ATM-AVI.

Our platform combines the power of full text search with text analytics and semantic web technologies for a hybrid semantic full-text search.

Recruitment delay currently causes up to $8 million per day in loss of revenue for the biopharmaceutical industry.

However, most computational and algorithmic efforts have been directed at mining data from each of these molecular levels (genomic, transcriptomic, etc.) separately and combining the results in order to explore the biology of a system. An important output of such analyses is the identification of networks of interactions, between molecules. However, at the molecular level, the networks of interactions that can be observed from such datasets are interconnected and thus separate analysis of omic data can result in important information being lost.

To achieve these aims we propose a collaboration between three institutes (from Denmark, Italy, UK and China), with complementary experience in collection and analysis of omic data. The collaboration will produce results that are attractive to all institutes and researchers dealing with high-throughput technology and will therefore promote the EU as an attractive research base.

Using a combination of biochemical assays, cellular imaging and animal models, researchers found that mycolactone interferes with the cell structure by altering its cytoskeleton. Upon infection, this damages the integrity of the epidermis and is responsible for BUD pathogenesis.\n\nCharacterisation of patient immune responses indicated that infected individuals have an overall suppressed immune system with reduced levels of multiple chemokines, cytokines and immunoglobulins. This profile was associated with an infection-associated drop of glycolytic and oxidative metabolism.\n\nWith respect to therapy, BURULIVAC performed extensive work towards the development of prophylactic vaccines. Live bacteria lacking the mycolactone toxin proved very effective at generating protective immunity against virulent strains of M.ulcerans. Partners also generated monoclonal antibodies against mycolactone, following a careful screening and pre-selection process of candidates for their protective capacity in a mouse model.\n\nOverall, the BURULIVAC study has increased awareness about BUD and raised the infrastructure and technological capacity in affected countries.
