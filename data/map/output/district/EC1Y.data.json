Specifically, EYE focuses on (a) S&T ideas of higher risk nature that can be generated through ideation and brainstorming and (b) collaboration between YRs across various disciplines and from different parts of Europe, and (c) on the YRs themselves, by developing their leadership potential through networking and training in the specific methods used in European collaborative projects.EYE will achieve its goal by implementing an integrated programme of complementary regional and European events:(a) 'Lab Surfing' workshops in 6 regions of Europe that inform YRs about the most advanced FET research across various disciplines, brainstorm future paradigms and enhance YRs' scientific administration skills;(b) Europe-wide 'Blue Sky' Conferences for YRs in 38 countries in Europe (EU members states and selected countries associated with FP7) to enable further consolidation of ideas at a European level and wider networking with academia, industry and policy makers;(c) 'Science Incubator' Summer Schools to assist selected YRs in bringing their ideas to a position where they might form the basis of future FET project proposals.EYE will conduct two rounds of these events over 2 years in order to reach a wider group of YRs in Europe and to ensure the sustainability of the EYE action after the end of the project. The EYE activities are supported with an online platform (NOVA-Networking for Outstanding Visionaries & Academics) which serves as an operational tool to prepare the events and as a professional platform for ideation, networking, collaboration and discussion amongst YRs.The project's thematic scope is broadly defined by 9 multidisciplinary research areas identified in the recent public consultation on future FET, as well as Horizon 2020 societal challenges. In particular, EYE will seek areas where Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can bring new interdisciplinary research opportunities and will support both curiosity- and agenda-driven research.

The business flexibility implies flexibility in the underlying ICT infrastructure and business processes. Moreover, in the current climate, midsize organizations also need to achieve flexibility in an affordable way, since in the current economic climate, organizations are under pressure to freeze expenditure and wring ever more return from existing assets.\nBusiness process management (BPM) is a class of software which directly contribute to enterprise performance by driving operational excellence and business flexibility. However, current solutions for BPM are tailored to the need of big companies, are quite expensive and drive mainly technology flexibility and not necessarily business flexibility.\nReFLEX aims at strengthening the competitiveness of the SME participants by developing a new BPM model tailored to the need of SMEs for being continuously aware of the changes in the environment and to change/adapt themselves accordingly in order to keep the business process running well. Indeed, in that way SMEs will increase their responsiveness on the new business opportunities (or threats) which is a crucial feature for the business development (even survival) for small fishes in big oceans of the globalized economy.\nHowever, in order to realize the dynamic BPM, a substantial research on the new model for the description of (ad-hoc) dynamic business processes is needed. This includes the development of a novel workflow engine that will be able to execute such processes as well as the calculation of changes on the fly.

Several radical new Open Access Publishing (OAP) business models have already emerged. The SOAP consortium represents key stakeholders such as publishers, funding agencies and a broad spectrum of research disciplines. It was formed to fuel the debate about the future of scientific publishing elaborated in COMMUNICATION (2007) 56, on scientific information in the digital age: access, dissemination and preservation. We believe that a variety of forms of OAP will ultimately co-exist, balancing attributes such as the cultural identities of the various stakeholders, career development paths, the perceived value of refereed publications and wider societal demand for access to information. The interests of researchers in the European Research Area (ERA) and worldwide will only be addressed by genuinely sustainable forms of publishing and commitment to change will only come about as a result of rational business decisions based on concrete evidence which does not exist today. The wider open access debate often relies on extrapolations and assumptions. We plan to begin to deliver evidence by:  (1) Defining attributes that differentiate various business models for open access and identifying the drivers that motivate researchers in their desire for publication. OAP is unsustainable unless it makes sense for both publisher and researcher. (2) Providing the European Commission, publishers and funding agencies with the results of a comprehensive survey of the attitudes of researchers in the ERA. These will give real insight into the demand and importance of OAP for its ultimate users. (3) Applying the survey results to a range of specific publishing scenarios.

The popularity of OA has increased in recent years, speeding up the exchange of knowledge and increasing the availability of research outputs.\n\nThe European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) is spearheading an EU-funded project on the 'Study of open access publishing' (SOAP). The project is investigating sustainable business models to promote scholarly publishing, as publishers experiment and explore new opportunities.\n\nThe project consortium comprises key stakeholders in the field such as publishers, funding agencies and libraries. Important science publishers such as BioMed Central, Sage and Springer have come together with funding agencies, the Science and Technology Facilities Council and the Max Planck Digital Library. Together, they are analysing OA publishing to improve understanding of the marketplace as well as the opportunities and risks involved.\n\nThe project team has prepared a survey which is being deployed on a large scale among scholars in the European Research Area and beyond. They have outlined ways to measure the penetration of OA publishing and analysed what exactly lies out there in terms of research material.\n\nThe team scanned over 4 000 journals, recording their publication volume and other relevant information such as their business model and copyright policy. The analysis was launched first using the authoritative Directory of Open Access Journals before moving on to other important sources.\n\nA review of open source material and mechanisms online revealed that the 'hybrid open access' model was the most successful and viable one, particularly in the case of science and research. This means the material is not totally free and available to all, but requires some subscription.\n\nMany important findings have emerged from this project, although still preliminary. The project team found that about 8\\;% of the worldwide production of scientific papers is published OA, i.e. about 120\\;000 articles per annum out of the estimated industry figure of 1.5 million. Five publishers run most of the OA journals, and seven publishers publish most of the OA articles, effectively dominating the market. The hybrid model has a market penetration overall of a fraction of a percent, but a success of around 2\\;% in journals which offer this option. Also, around a third of OA publishers do not use Creative Common Licenses, but actually require a copyright transfer.\n\nThe largest publishers, measured by number of journals and articles, use an article-processing-fee business model. Other models dominate in fields such as the social sciences and humanities, benefiting from some form of sponsorship. Interestingly, there seem to be little correlation between size of OA publishers and whether their journals have a strong impact or not.\n\nIn the near future, the project will be working on the dissemination and analysis of the questionnaire responses to produce a clear view of the drivers and barriers for scientists to publish OA. It will also evaluate the current OA situation more closely and chart a way for a sustainable transition to OA publishing. By enhancing viable OA models, European researchers - and indeed the world - will gain from the exchange of knowledge and have access to vast material.

Paper cups are often lined or coated with plastic such as polyethylene (PE) or oil- based waxes to prevent the liquid from leaking out or soaking through the paper. These paper cups are almost impossible to recycle because of the difficulties of separating the paper from waterproof oil-based liners.
