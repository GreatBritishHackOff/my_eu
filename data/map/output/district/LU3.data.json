Thirty researchers from the fields of tribology, condition monitoring and rolling bearing technology from two industrial and two academic partners will be seconded from one sector to the other, to implement a common research programme covering all relevant aspects of integrated diagnostic and prognostic models for rolling element bearings. The project has a balanced mixture of secondments (108 months, 29 people) and new recruitments (92 months, 6 people), and of experience level of the personnel involved. The collaborative programme is designed to allow researchers to exchange skills, knowledge and experiences and mutually benefit from each other\u2019s expertise. In addition, the project partners will recruit 6 experienced reserachers specialised in numerical modelling, mechatronics,ferrography, statistics, and artifical intelligence to gain additional knowledge necessary for the research programme, and not currently present at the partners. The schedule of secondee visits and a special training and transfer of knowledge scheme were designed to match the work plan and to optimise synergies. Collectively, the consortium has the appropriate combination of analysis and process equipment to perform the work plan. Synergistic collaboration between sectors is crucial to achieve the objectives of iBETTER, which cannot be achieved on the basis of the knowledge present in each of the two sectors or at any one partner alone.

Wind power can make the most important contribution to these targets, if sufficient emphasis is established on technological R&amp;D and market development. Because of the current European scenario and its forecasted evolution towards 2020, offshore wind energy is called to play a key role. Offshore maintenance costs in the current situation are still too high, requiring higher feed-in tariffs for the private investor\u00b4s business case to reach the minimum profitability. This project aims is to offset this paradigm, allowing offshore wind power to be deployed in the same way onshore has. RELIAWIND consortium, for the first time in the European Wind Energy Sector, and based on successful experiences from other sectors (e.g. aeronautics) will jointly &amp; scientifically study the impact of reliability, changing the paradigm of how Wind Turbines are designed, operated and maintained. This will lead to a new generation of offshore (and onshore) Wind energy Systems that will hit the market in 2015.

While offshore wind has tremendous potential for power generation with stronger and more predictable winds, operation and maintenance can be challenging and costly. Ten partners joined forces on the EU-funded project RELIAWIND, aiming to reduce energy costs and increase availability through more reliable offshore WT systems with reduced maintenance requirements.\n\nScientists identified six critical sub-systems of modern WTs and five failure modes of each through an analysis of failures and repairs of operational WTs. Reliability models of failure modes and mechanisms of propagation enabled the specification of appropriate sensing devices and required inputs.\n\nPartners defined the logical architecture required for the detection and localisation of impending failures, definition of maintenance actions required, and scheduling of maintenance including decision support to managers and technicians in the form of a modern WT health-monitoring system. A virtual demonstrator consisting of a holistic wind farm software model was used to verify the effectiveness of the condition-based maintenance (CBM) tools.\n\nFollowing analysis of related training needs, scientists prepared training materials that were presented at 13 sessions to more than 240 professionals within and external to the consortium. In addition, partners prepared protocols for standardised collection and analysis of reliability data that they submitted to national and international organisations such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\n\nRELIAWIND expects to make a significant contribution to uptake of offshore WT technology with the potential to deliver cost-effective and reliable alternative energy.

It is clear that for marine renewable energy systems to be commercially viable they must demonstrate exceptionally high reliability and availability.
