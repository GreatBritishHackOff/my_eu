This in turn has a major impact on the safety of the entire animal based food chain. The concept of Q-SAFFE is to deliver better, faster and economically viable means of ensuring the quality and safety of animal feeds in Europe. The Q-SAFFE consortium is composed of academics and government scientists with substantial experience in animal feed research along with industrial companies, large and small, dedicated to supplying and producing higher quality and safer animal feeds. Together, their vision is an integrated approach to the reduction and management of chemical and microbiological contamination in animal feeds. This research project will provide better ways of preventing contamination and fraud, identifying and assessing new risks and providing scientific evidence of the risks of transfer of microbiological and chemical contaminants from feed to food.\nStrategies for early quality and safety assurance in the feed chain will be developed using existing testing methods and emerging technologies such as fingerprinting to deliver a comprehensive analytical strategy for monitoring at ports, feedmills and labs. The traceability and authenticity of feed materials will be improved by determining which tests, conventional and fingerprinting, will be most useful in tracing origins of feed materials including those derived from biofuel co-products. Emerging chemical and microbiological risks will be identified from new types and sources of animal feed materials and new production processes. These will direct the development of rapid, low cost screening tests to enable high quality and safety standards to be met. The transfer of chemical contaminants such as melamine and dioxins and micro-organisms (Salmonella spp, Listeria monocytogenes) from feed to food will be studied using pharmacokinetic models and animal studies to provide risk assessments for regulators.", 99622.0, 3320123.0, "QSAFFE", "Ensuring a safe and healthy food and feed chain", "EU researchers are working towards providing Europe with a framework for improving the quality and safety of animal feed.", "Safe animal feed is essential for the health of animals and the environment, as well as for the safety of foods of animal origin. However, if farmers are to rear healthy livestock they need to provide their animals with highquality and safe feed. This, in turn, has a major impact on the safety of the entire animal-based food chain.\n\nEnsuring the highest standards for producing and supplying animal feed in Europe is the underlying concept of the 'Quality and safety of feeds and food for Europe' (QSAFFE) project funded by the EU. The team has set out to provide such an assurance better, faster and more economically.\n\nFirst, the QSAFFE project team is developing and implementing cost-effective tests that can detect contamination incidents involving animal feed very early, before farm animals have consumed anytainted feed. Secondly, the project is aiming to ensure that there are no fraudulent practices taking placein the feed supply chain.\n\nThe project is also devoting significanteffort to predict emerging risks in the feed supply chain as a result of changes in global economics and climate change. Another important research topic is the development of a better understanding of how contaminants present in feed materials can transfer into consumerfoodstuffs.\n\nQSAFFE project members arealready delivering vital methods and information to a wide range of stakeholders. Ultimately, the project will improve the quality and safety of animal feed entering ports from outside theEU, as well as products produced within European countries.\n\nQSAFFE's results are expected to be immensely beneficial to Europe's animal welfare and food safety sectors. To extend the benefits globally, disseminationplans included a website, a stakeholder database, newsletters, workshops guidance documents and an international conference.", "http://www.qsaffe.eu", null, "/docs/results/images/2013-06/54793.jpg", "fp7_97821_986295807"], ["2GG", "Strengthening the Capabilities and Training Curricula for Conflict Prevention and Peace Building Personnel with ICT-based Collaboration and Knowledge Approaches", "Institute for Conflict Research", "Political conflicts have long since gone beyond national borders and peace building has become central to the self-conception of the European Union as a foreign policy actor. Current challenges in Conflict Prevention and Peace Building (CPPB) trainings are that many programmes on offer are both too general/narrow, they are not applicable enough, weak on concrete skills enlargement and moreover training alone is not sufficient. Overcoming these challenges requires novel CPPB training curricula and linked activities.\nPeaceTraining.eu aims to analyse these issues with strong involvement of all relevant stakeholders to take into account current practices and provide new training methods for CPPB personnel. In order to meet these challenges and to investigate this complex field of research a multidimensional modeling approach is used. The resulting, proprietary PeaceTraining.eu Cube Model describes curricula structures including stakeholders, new methods, course structures, techniques as well as further aspects, e-approaches, tools and entities.\nThe PeaceTraining.eu Web Platform (www.peacetraining.eu) features a knowledge base, stakeholder maps, expert navigators, infographics, best practice libraries, and digital guidebooks to strengthen the information transfer among all project developments and future implementations. Additional Training Curricula Setup Utilities and Search Tools four training centres and trainers are provided through the project. Thus, PeaceTraining.eu increases awareness on the topic and also attracts secondary target groups including training course provider, educational institutions and trainers because of its sustainable strategy with long-term mobilisation and engagement activities including an International PeaceTraining.eu Symposium.\nOn a European scale, PeaceTraining.eu will deliver new CPPB training methods and curricula and serve as a one-stop resource to increase efficiency and reduce costs.", 88407.0, 1309663.0, "PeaceTraining.eu", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_202700_968196480"], ["3GW", "PROTECTion against Endocrine Disruptors;Detection, mixtures, health effects, risk assessment and communication.", "John Thompson & Sons Ltd", "PROTECTED aims to develop expertise and protective capabilities against Endocrine Disruptors (EDs). EDs and their mixtures are a modern day health concern leading to failing ecological systems, poor agricultural production and health effects such as obesity, cancer and infertility.

A new generation of creative, entrepreneurial and innovative early-stage researchers equipped with skills to assess and understand the real-life risk of complex mixtures of EDs and trained to convert resulting knowledge and ideas into accessible tools and services for the long-term control of potential ED risk is urgently needed. The PROTECTED Innovative Training Network [ITN] proposes a holistic approach by providing 15 individual, personalised research projects with exposure to scientific, innovative and entrepreneurial training mobility across the ITN. The intersectorial network is comprised of 12 training sites at academia, research centres, a bioassay technology SME, a QSAR technology SME, water provider, and animal feed supplier. Together they cover multiple disciplines including analytical science of food, feed, and environment, epidemiology, risk assessment, social science and toxicology. This combined expertise enables a highly focused program for developing novel tools and concepts and training for the detection, analysis and improved risk assessment of EDs, especially mixture effects. Methodology will include emerging technologies; multiplexed analysis, mixture modelling, mechanistic and exposure studies, explants and cell or whole organism bioassays.
