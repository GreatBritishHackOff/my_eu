The Q-SAFFE consortium is composed of academics and government scientists with substantial experience in animal feed research along with industrial companies, large and small, dedicated to supplying and producing higher quality and safer animal feeds. Together, their vision is an integrated approach to the reduction and management of chemical and microbiological contamination in animal feeds. This research project will provide better ways of preventing contamination and fraud, identifying and assessing new risks and providing scientific evidence of the risks of transfer of microbiological and chemical contaminants from feed to food.\nStrategies for early quality and safety assurance in the feed chain will be developed using existing testing methods and emerging technologies such as fingerprinting to deliver a comprehensive analytical strategy for monitoring at ports, feedmills and labs. The traceability and authenticity of feed materials will be improved by determining which tests, conventional and fingerprinting, will be most useful in tracing origins of feed materials including those derived from biofuel co-products. Emerging chemical and microbiological risks will be identified from new types and sources of animal feed materials and new production processes. These will direct the development of rapid, low cost screening tests to enable high quality and safety standards to be met.

First we should recognize, that our own languages are different, but influenced by other cultures for centuries. So in all languages we can find words which are in origin from another country in Europe or even another continent. For example, in German language we can discover the origin of words from Arabian countries, from France, Italy, Malaysia, Greece etc. But most people don\u2019t recognize how multicultural languages actually are. Interesting will be to \u201csee\u201d the European history behind the words or languages and also to discover common European traditions, heritage and the reciprocally influence from European countries and to recognize that we are much more united, much more that we are aware. Prosperous trade, for example around the Baltic Sea (with the Hanse) or along the \u201cSilk road\u201d brought exotic goods to Europe. But this brought not only Merchants but also Scholars and with them ideas, religion and Cultures from the East to the West and the other way around, producing an exchange of experiences and knowledge. Migration of people, for example that of Germanic and Slavic people into Europe from the 2nd to the 11th centuries, the Crusades in the middle Ages or military conflicts in Europe or other regions in the world clearly left its mark. During this process which never ends, all languages where influenced and this means new words were created or words from other countries started being used in everyday life. Of course big influence of Greece was felt in all our cultures and languages so we decided to meet in Thessaloniki. \r\n  \r\nSecondly we will see and discuss, that language also show the values and thinking pattern of people and societies. We can recognize that language shows how we see the world and also that the same word could have different meanings from different point of views. How we use our language, which words we use for example to describe situations and show our values which are characterized personal, cultural and social. Our language is a part of our Identity and gives us a sense of belonging to a group of persons, nationality or culture. \r\nThis seminar will tackle issues such as: solidarity, intercultural dialogue, languages and barriers, history, anti-discrimination, conflict management, European citizenship, peace and conflict and Non-formal Education.

In the framework of this project, our rural NGOs cooperate on European level to act for peaceful rural societies.\r\n\r\nTheme\r\nEuropean rural youth NGO cooperation for peaceful societies\r\n\r\nAim\r\nThe aim of Compass is to set direction for rural youth NGOs to promote peaceful rural societies through meeting young peoples' needs in a changing Europe.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe objectives are that the participants, which are top leaders and staff of rural youth organisations:\r\na) get increased understanding of how rural young people experience the recent changes in Europe and how they choose to act on them to defend human rights and promote peace,\r\nb) share best NGO practices about their work on intercultural dialogue, reducing prejudices, preventing hate speech, including refugees, protecting human rights and strengthening the sense of European belonging,\r\nc) develop skills of brave and effective NGO leadership to meet new needs and challenges, and\r\nd) agree on a common direction for rural NGOs, based on young people\u00b4s initiatives, to contribute towards peaceful rural societies by policy making, campaign development and educational activities.\r\n\r\nFormat\r\nThe activity itself is short, three days, but the preparation process and dissemination add the impact of the project.\r\n\r\nApproach\r\nThe interesting approach of the Compass project is that we have turned the power pyramids upside down, compared to how the organisations normally works.  The main activity, A2, is strongly youth led by the organisations\u00b4 regular youth members or medium level young leaders.\r\n\r\nActivity\r\nThe project consists of the seminar A1, and its preparation and reporting/ dissemination/ follow-up. A1 will be held in J\u00e4neda, Estonia 7-9 September 2017 (+ travel days) and all the 11 partner organisations in this application are involved. They are from: Estonia, United Kingdom, Sweden, Slovenia, Austria, Latvia, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Finland, and Norway. There will be two participants from each country plus six team members, so 28 persons in total. \r\n\r\nMethods\r\nThe methods planned are:\r\n- Speed dating to get to know each other\r\n- Hopes, fears and contribution \r\n- Sharing of youth interviews and discussion\r\n- Theoretical input\r\n- Discussion in pair and groups of various sizes\r\n- Open space for sharing of praxis\r\n- Formulation of common policies\r\n- Reflection, feedback and evaluation in writing and as group discussion\r\n\r\nImpact\r\n- The impact on the participants is that they gain skills of brave leadership, policy making and knowledge about European institutions and programmes, as well as get increased awareness of the current European changes and their impact on rural societies and rural youth.\r\n- The main impact on the partner organisations is strengthened cooperation on the rural youth field, spreading of good praxis and common policies for peaceful rural societies.\r\n- The impact on communities on local, national and European level is promotion for peaceful societies as a result of participants\u00b4 attitude change and common policies.\r\n \r\nDissemination\r\nThe dissemination of Compass is actually larger than the seminar, but the seminar is needed to get the dissemination activities started. The dissemination activities are:\r\nA) A campaign for human rights and peace building, including a week 27/11 - 03/12 2017 when campaign actions will be done in rural areas at the project partners all over Europe\r\nB) Policy making for human rights and peace building\r\nC) Follow-up activities in form of seminars, trainings and youth exchanges\r\nD) An online platform with material gathered from the seminar, which can be used for educational purposes at the partner organisations, their communities and on European level.", "http://www.yfcu.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-EE01-KA105-034758_6"], ["2BP", "International Peace Camp", "Ashton Community Trust", 23629.0, "Context/background of project; \r\nThis International Peace Camp is the first to be hosted in Northern Ireland and is completely original and innovative due to the partner counties who will be involved. All of the partner counties involved have at some stage been involved in some element of conflict both in the past and also presently. This project will act as an advocate for promoting and strengthening positive international relations by bringing groups together in this way gives them the opportunity to reflect on their differences. With Northern Ireland emerging from its own 'Troubles' we feel we are best placed to host this a camp.  To our knowledge no such camp has ever taken place in the North of Ireland.\r\n\r\nObjectives of your project; \r\nMany objectives of this project are based on building positive international relations while promoting personal and transnational citizenship. The exchanging of values and cultures will help to address myths and prejudices that others may have gained through social media or other outlets.\r\n\r\nThe counties involved in this at some stage in their history have been involved directly or non directly in political or areas of social conflict. This International Peace camp is specific to those countries with the aim that this can be used as an educational experience and act as a tool for sharing and discussing cultural and personal similarities and differences. \r\n\r\nThe project will draw on their life experiences engaging them in conversations about their identity, cultural expression, life experiences and future motivations. \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants; \r\nThe young people involved will range in age from 14-17 years and will be both male and female.  \r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project; \r\n\r\nA short description of the results and impact envisaged and finally the potential longer term benefits.\r\nYoung people involved in the programme will benefit from an increased levels of self confidence, new knowledge of different of culture traditions, sharing of good practice between organizations, rest-bite for young people who come from violent and conflicting counties \r\n\r\nThe project fosters young people's sense of global Citizenship in particular.  The project encourages learning on a global dimension through learning about each other's history and culture and that of their countries of origin.  The project will enable young people to explore and contrast the different approaches to cultural identity within partner countries.  The project will hopefully help challenge young people's perspectives of other cultures and therefore begin to see the impact of racism and xenophobia.  The project will enable the young people to see common concerns they have coming from each of their backgrounds and experiences as young people.  The project will instill in the young people the needs of other small ethnic communities who are alienated within their countries and the EU and how learning about each other and building friendships can address this.\r\n \r\nThe young people throughout the camp will be challenged both mentally and physically through activities and workshops that have been designed to be fun but thought provoking. They will explore different traditions, foods and other cultures ways of life through culture nights hosted by each country which will include traditional music, dance, food, song, history and musical instruments.", "http://www.ashtoncentre.com", "Ashton Community Trust", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-036378_coordinator"], ["3BJ", "Depaul Northern Ireland Homelessness Projects", "Depaul Northern Ireland", 31972.0, "Depaul Ireland is a charity supporting people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Depaul believes that homelessness has no place. We are a cross border organisation established in the Republic of Ireland in 2002 and Northern Ireland in 2005.   Depaul Ireland is part of Depaul International, a group of charities working to support people who are homeless and marginalised around the world. Our services are \u2018low threshold\u2019 making them easier to access by those who can be excluded from other services that they often need most.  Our services span:  vulnerable families services, homelessness prevention services, addiction services and criminal justice and mental health services. Depaul Ireland supported 4,169 people in our services in 2015.  We hold the Investing in Volunteers award.   \r\n\r\nWithin the values of the work of Depaul lies a holistic approach to each individual with whom we work. This involves providing emotional support in addition to physical and practical services. It is within this structure of support that the work of our volunteer programme is vital.  In particular, EVS / Erasmus + Priorities cover themes and issues that our volunteers and service users have been involved in.   For example promoting awareness of exclusion and homelessness issues to the public, promoting healthier lifestyles, encouraging service users to develop skills and knowledge (through training or volunteering) for future employment and study and exploring and celebrating culture through art, food and dialogue.  \r\n\r\nObjectives of your project:\r\nThe volunteer programme was established to enable both local individuals and young people from other countries via Erasmus + to become involved with the work of the organisation. The programme aims to develop the skills and experience of volunteer, provide our service users with wider opportunities whilst simultaneously enabling Depaul Ireland to offer a more multifaceted approach to our service.\r\n\r\nWe aim to:\r\n\u2022 Develop new ideas and skills from a diverse range of volunteers.  \r\n\u2022 Involve volunteers in mutually beneficial activities that can also be shared with our Partners and stakeholders. \r\n\u2022 Support social dialogue and cultural awareness\r\n\u2022 Highlight Social Exclusion Issues - homelessness, poverty, barriers to education & employment etc.\r\n\u2022 Share Depaul Ireland working practices such as Harm Reduction, Low Threshold approaches and Holistic practice.\r\n\u2022 Quip volunteers and service users with skills and confidence to be active citizens \r\n Number & profile of participants:\r\n\r\nFour EVS volunteers from programme countries.

Two volunteers are of fewer opportunities due to economic barriers and cultural & social barriers.\r\n \r\nDescription of activities:\r\nOur EVS volunteers will be based in (2) Stella Maris Harm Reduction accommodation service and the (2) Mater Dei and Cloverhill services for vulnerable homeless families.  The EVS volunteers will develop and facilitate over the 11 months varied programme of diversionary and worthwhile activities to encourage our service users to develop new skills and interests, support harm reduction to tackle unhealthy behaviours, explore cultural identity and support participation in the project and the local community they will return to.  \r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nThe Host and Co-ordinating organisation will develop a learning plan and project activities with the individual volunteers.  The following would be used to plan, monitor and evaluate the activities:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Training and Induction\r\n\u2022 Link/include in each service's key performance indicators (KPI\u2019s) and measure quarterly \r\n\u2022 Impact on SU\u2019s measured in Keyworking sessions\r\n\u2022 Feedback & evaluation sessions (eg.
