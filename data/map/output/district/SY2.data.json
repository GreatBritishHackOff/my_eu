The students are 17-18 years old.The following teachers are reponsible for the project planning, execution and evaluation in Austria:\r\nMag. Bettina Gr\u00fcnbart, (English teacher and contact person for project),  Mag. Sabine Panker (English and  German teacher).\r\nThe pupils stay on their own with selected host families and spend ten days working in a business organisation. On the middle weekend, the pupils take part in cultural activities organised by their teachers and the host families.\r\nObjectives:\r\na) to improve the skills and key competences of our pupils in VET\r\n - to gain insights into the world of work in the United Kingdom.\r\n - active participation in work processes\r\n - application and improvement of language skills through immersion in work place and host family,\r\n - strengthening of the pupils' social and intercultural competences and their personal development.\r\nb) The project is intended to enhance the language and business skills acquired  by the participating students while attending the HAK Neumarkt / International Business Class.\r\n     The project also serves to reduce the pupils' - i.e. the future workforce's - reluctance to work abroad, to increase their willingness to be mobile as well as to considerably improve their chances on the labour market.\r\nc) The project aims to improve the abilities and skills of the students on manifold levels. Staying with a host family as the only German speaking guest develops their self-reliance and self-responsibility and offers pupils the opportunity to immerse themselves totally in both everyday life and work life in the host country and to try out and consolidate their English skills.\r\nUnlike a pure language project the students gain experience in the world of work through personal contact with their employers, colleagues or customers. Regardless of how dedicated their teachers might be, such an invaluable element of real life can never be achieved in the classroom situation.\r\nThe culture and characteristics of a foreign county  can also be introduced at school, but only immersion in the respective country's everyday life  can bring real understanding.\r\nDue to the fact that the students will have worked on the project \"Exploring the British world of work - working in an intercultural context\" in advance, the WEX project is not an isolated, single event but is embedded in a long-term project that aims to awaken and develop the students willingness to work and act beyond national borders throughout Europe.", "http://www.englishinshropshire.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA102-034698_1"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["6ND", "The Marches Technical Assistance Project", "Shropshire County Council", "There is significant ERDF funding allocated within the Marches ESIF Strategy (\u00a312,469,269 More Developed and \u00a343,446,842 Transition as at January 2014 exchange rate).
