Adjuvant staff, many of whom are ex-Scottish FA education and mobility employees, are now involved in the delivery, assessment and management of circa 250 Modern Apprentices employed by the Scottish professional football clubs who are undertaking the SVQ Level 3 qualification, Achieving Excellence in Sports Performance.\r\n\r\nFor those intent on a career in professional football, the path starts at the age of 16, when clubs offer apprenticeships to their most promising young players. Although aspects of the two-year training programme have changed significantly, the goal remains the same: a professional contract.\r\n\r\nHowever, the statistics are damning. The Premier League and Football League advise that between 60% and 65% of the 700 or so apprentices taken on each year are rejected at 18. Even half of those who do win a full-time contract will not be playing at a professional level by 21 years of age (source: PFA). Effectively, this means that five out of every six players who start an apprenticeship will not be playing football for a living five years later.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation reports published by a number of organisations (Scottish FA, Celtic FC, Aberdeen FC) have unequivocally shown that participation by young apprentice players in a European mobility programme can boost their chances of being offered a professional contract. Celtic and Aberdeen FC have reported that almost 30% of mobility participants subsequently went on to play first team football \u2013 an unprecedented success rate. This recent (2015) club data confirms that European mobility undertaken by apprentice players can profoundly affect their chances of becoming professional footballers. Both of these clubs went on to report that mobility also had a marked effect in boosting employment rates in other industries for those mobility participants who were not offered a professional contract. Consequently, the anticipated  impact of this mobility project will be to significantly increase the skill sets of the mobility participants which will improve their prospects of being offered employment as a professional player on completion of their apprenticeship. Those participants who are not offered a professional contract will benefit from increased employability in alternative career pathways due to the transferable and interpersonal skills acquired as a direct result of their mobility experience.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this mobility project will be to provide a work experience abroad that not only enriches apprentices\u2018 professional and academic lives, but will also promote openness, adaptability and flexibility, and enhance language learning, intercultural skills, self-reliance and self-awareness.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal objectives of this project is to use the competencies and life skills acquired through mobility to enhance the future employability of participants, whether that be as a professional football player or an alternative career path. Evaluation will include the collection of employment data (post apprenticeship) for mobility participants and comparing this to their peers. This data will collected in co-operation with Skills Development Scotland and published as part of the dissemination process.", "http://www.saintmirren.net", "Adjuvant Limited", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036123_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PA3"}
