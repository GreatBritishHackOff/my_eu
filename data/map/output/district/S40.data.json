Calcium is ideal, but current methods of adding it to the melt result in evaporation and inefficient  reactions, representing high costs.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.injectionhotwire.com (HOT-WIRE) project aims to find ways of slowing calcium melting, thereby lessening evaporation, during the injection process. The method will involve a calcium wire clad in steel, which can be fed into the melt. The seven-member consortium will run through the entirety of 2013 and 2014.\n\nWork during the first reporting period involved research into controlling the evaporation of calcium, first via literature review and then experiment. Testing determined whether evaporation time can be extended, and explored techniques for retarding melting of the calcium wire. Additional experiments determined optimum methods of injecting the wire into liquid steel.\n\nAs a result, the best techniques have been selected. Outcomes included documentation of the most effective combinations of wire-coating materials, and methods for applying the system industrially. Preliminary designs are nearly complete. The project also developed detailed designs for injection mechanisms.\n\nThe legacy of the HOT-WIRE project will be methods for reducing loss of calcium during the steelmaking process.

Salt cake is a mixture of aluminum oxides and aluminum nitrides, metal and salts (mainly NaCl and KCl, with small amounts of MgCl2 and CaCl2).\nThe salt cake is a growing environmental problem.  It is proving very difficult to dispose in the Europe and is regarded as hazardous waste. The reason is that when saltcake gets wet it gives of gases, e.g. hydrogen, methane, ammonia. Also water leaching out of the land fill would contain chlorides.\nThe alternative is to try and recycle the saltcake and reclaim the aluminium, aluminium oxide and salt. This is done by grinding up the saltcake and separating out the free aluminium. The residue if then mixed with water, which dissolves out the salts, which are later re crystallised and sold back to the secondary aluminium smelters and aluminium oxide, which may be used in abrasive industry or in the manufacturing of cement.\nThe current technology has high initial and operating cost and not economical in small volume and that is why there are only few aluminium salt cake recycling facilities exist in the Europe. All the salt cake generated by the aluminium recycling plants have to transport the salt cakes to these facilities, which results a large amount of cost due to transportation and associated CO2 emission.\nThe project aims to develop an in situ salt cake recycling technology that will utilize the excess of heat from the flue gas from the rotary furnace and able to reprocess salt cake more efficiently and more economically also in small volume.\nThe process will allow recycling salt cakes in situ at the aluminium recycling plant, without the need for transporting the salt cakes to the salt cake recyclers.

Typically, the salt cake steam contains metallic aluminium, salts (mainly potassium chloride (KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl)), and aluminium oxides. These are some of its recoverable components that are non-toxic.\n\nThe EU-funded project ALUSALT (Efficient aluminium salt cake recycling technology) aimed to develop a recycling system that is smaller than existing technologies, making salt cake recycling more accessible and cost effective.\n\nTo achieve its goal, ALUSALT set out to develop a flue gas transfer system that takes the heat and pressure of the flue gas from the rotary furnace. The flue gas is then used as a source of heat for the evaporator. The new process reuses all available energy that is lost during the aluminium recycling process, eliminating the need for additional energy for the salt cake recycling. Proper nozzles will inject the hot flue gas from the rotary furnace.\n\nOne of the main tasks over the first project period was to characterise the flue gases of the aluminium processing. Project partners collected the flue gas particles through magnetic metal separation units and used chemical analysis methods and spectroscopy techniques to determine their composition.\n\nValidating multiphysics models for flue gas injection in the evaporator and gas combustion in the combined heat and power system were also an important part of project work. Significant effort was devoted to determining and testing the suitability of the evaporation technology for the drying brine solution consisting of NaCl and KCl.\n\nOther tasks were to determine the composition and volume of different salt cake gases stemming from the evaporation tanks and to design can combustors to minimise emissions.\n\nThe ALUSALT system should allow in\u00a0situ recycling of salt cakes at the aluminium recycling plant, avoiding their transportation to salt cake recyclers.

Secondary aluminium recycling and ceramic processing were identified as key examples with economically recoverable waste heat.

The Smartrec system meets these challenges by development of a standard, modular solution for integration of heat recovery with thermal storage that valorises medium to high grade waste heat, adaptable to different temperatures and industries. Following end-user analysis and characterisation of exhaust streams and waste products, full life cycle costing and assessment will be carried out with candidate molten salts selected for thermal storage and heat transfer fluid, validated by corrosion testing. A custom heat pipe heat exchanger will be modelled and designed around the requirements of heat transport capacity wick structure and capable of heat exchange with a molten salt pumping loop. This loop will include dual media thermocline thermal storage system with cost/system modelling, validation and instrumentation incorporated. A pilot Smartrec system will be constructed and deployed in a secondary aluminium recycler and/or ceramic processor valorising high grade heat for continuous energy-intensive salt-cake recycling.
