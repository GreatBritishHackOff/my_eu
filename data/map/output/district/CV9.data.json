We are proposing a project which will combine (i) technological development to enable high through-put array-based screening of samples from a wide variety of wild animals with (ii) surveillance of terrestrial, aerial and marine wild animal species within Europe and from countries which act as portals of disease entry into the EU, (iii) epidemiological analysis and risk assessment using data generated during the project and from other sources, and (iv) development and proposal of a model framework for disease surveillance within Europe developed in parallel with the burgeoning systems in North America. The proposal will place the EU at the centre of wildlife disease surveillance and also enable the translation of high throughput array-based technologies into human and veterinary medicine.", 127786.0, 7634250.0, "WILDTECH", "Stopping the spread of wildlife diseases", "A recently completed research project has developed a surveillance system to monitor diseases of wild animals in Europe that could affect human or livestock populations.", "Seventy-five per cent of all human diseases from the last two decades are of wildlife origin. The spread of wildlife diseases is often caused by viruses evolving in response to changes in the human population, host-pathogen relationship or environmental pollution.\n\nUntil now, there has been no coordinated effort to monitor the spread of infection within and between different countries in the EU. To address this problem, the 'Novel technologies for surveillance of emerging and re-emerging infections of wildlife' (http://www.wildtechproject.com/ (WILDTECH)) project devised a technology platform for high-throughput disease diagnosis in wild animals.\n\nWILDTECH research members designed high-throughput diagnostic tests to identify more than 200 pathogens in wildlife populations, and more in-depth methods for 20 priority diseases. This technology allows the EU to continuously monitor the spread of wildlife diseases and evaluate potential risks to the human population.\n\nInvestigators established a pathogen database to store all the information about samples tested in the project. Part of the data that related to pathogen characterisation was forwarded to the http://wildpro.twycrosszoo.org/List_Vols/Wildpro_Gen_Cont.htm (Wildpro electronic encyclopaedia).\n\nWILDTECH also developed statistical tests to predict disease outbreaks in the EU and surrounding countries. This has been incorporated into a multi-host disease model essential for epidemiologists across the EU.\n\nUltimately, this work will help prevent the spread of disease, thereby reducing the mortality rate and improving welfare for both human and animal populations.", null, "http://www.twycrosszoo.org", "/docs/results/images/2015-07/159413.jpg", "fp7_91087_996719621"], ["1LH", "iPURXL: Scale-Up of Liquid Nano-reactor for the Destruction of Contaminants in Turbid Fluids", "Biotec Ltd", "The iPURtech Nanoreactor effluent fluid treatment system recycles metal working fluids in an almost closed loop.  iPURXL builds on 2 years successful sales and a growing list of enquiries to transfer the technology to other sectors, particularly for the treatment of water and other aqueous liquids.  This will required scale up from our current >20-50 Litres per hour systems to those capable of processing >1000 in line with customer demand.  This will enable us to sell into both single line and  full site effluent treatment, ranging from small meat rendering plants up to full scale municipal waste water treatment.\nThe original system treats fluid in quartz tubes supplied with sufficient UV-C light to operate.  A TiO2 photo-catalyst coated auger causes oscillation and scrubs tube walls clean.  Conventional systems immerse single lamps in fluid; we use multiple high powered UV-C lamps around tubes to achieve higher volume kill ratios making iPURtech uniquely suitable for scale up.\nTiO2 reactors are well researched yet little large scale commercial delivery has resulted.  To succeed commercially this must be practical.  Direct linear scale up is not possible, issues such as coating light weight auger materials over greater surface areas, UV dose, system size and weight and must be addressed.    Over summer of 2014, testing was carried out with a range of meat renderers and with the input of a range of technical and commercial specialists.  This has resulted in the development of a very strong research, development, supply and sales team and we are confident of our combined abilities to deliver at commercial scale immediately post this demonstration.", null, 1501245.0, "iPURXL", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_198239_934380146"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CV9"}
