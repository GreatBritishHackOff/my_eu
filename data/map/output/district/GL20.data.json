But E\\\\ will add another unique dimension: not only will we encourage ReIO and RoM to work together, but robot system customers and users will be involved \u2013 connecting the suppliers directly with the market. To this end, there are two innovative new pillars: the Pre-Commercial-Procurement Pilots (PCPP) and the Knowledge and Innovation Centers (KIC). The PCPP will enable public procurers to become demanding buyers of new R&D. The complete PCP process will encompass robotics R&D for the first time, resulting in, demonstrable prototypes that can be evaluated together with the process at the end. The KICs are open experimental facilities that will that allow new robot customers and users to interact with roboticists with no entrance barrier and at very low cost so that new communities can form \u2013 and radically new ideas can take shape. E\\\\'s scientific work is structured in scenarios and research foci, directly derived from the SRA.

Therefore, the ICARUS project will concentrate on developing components or building blocks that can be directly used by the crisis managers when arriving on the field. The ICARUS tools consist of assistive unmanned air, ground and sea vehicles, equipped with human detection sensors.  The ICARUS unmanned vehicles are intended as the first explorers of the area, as well as in-situ supporters to act as safeguards to human personnel.

Our approach is based on understanding 3D space and how it changes over time, from milliseconds to months. We will develop novel approaches to extract spatio-temporal structure from sensor data gathered during months of autonomous operation. Extracted structure will include reoccurring 3D shapes, objects, people, and models of activity. We will also develop control mechanisms which exploit these structures to yield adaptive behaviour in highly demanding, real-world security and care scenarios.<br/>The spatio-temporal dynamics presented by such scenarios (e.g. humans moving, furniture changing position, objects (re-)appearing) are largely treated as anomalous readings by state-of-the-art robots. Errors introduced by these readings accumulate over the lifetime of such systems, preventing many of them from running for more than a few hours. By autonomously modelling spatio-temporal dynamics, our robots will be able run for significantly longer than current systems (at least 120 days by the end of the project). Long runtimes provide previously unattainable opportunities for a robot to learn about its world. Our systems will take these opportunities, advancing long-term mapping, life-long learning about objects, person tracking, human activity recognition and self-motivated behaviour generation. The extraction of structure is key to this, as it both captures potential meaning, and also compresses a robot's sensor data into representations capable of storing months of experience in a manageable form.<br/>We will integrate our advances into complete cognitive systems to be deployed and evaluated at two end-user sites: a care home for the elderly in Austria, and an office environment patrolled by a security firm in the UK. The tasks these systems will perform are impossible without long-term adaptation to spatio-temporal dynamics, yet they are tasks demanded by early adopters of cognitive robots.
