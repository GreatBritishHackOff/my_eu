Society also expects from agriculture to be more environment-friendly in several issues such as climatic change, declining biodiversity, fossil energy depletion, and water shortage.\nTo overcome these limitations, CANTOGETHER will design innovative sustainable mixed farming systems (MFS). A design-assessment-adjustment iterative cycle will be adopted to ensure continuous validation and improvement of the innovative investigated MFS through a participative approach involving stakeholders and researchers across Europe. It will bring together a European network of 24 existing experimental and commercial farms covering a wide diversity of natural and socio-economic conditions in which the most promising MFS will be implemented in order to verify their practicability and to perform an in-depth integrated assessment (economic and environmental).\nThe MFS will be designed for individual farm level or collective implementation at the territorial level. At the same time, CANTOGETHER will define recommendations for a common agricultural policy promoting the development of these MFS.\nThe innovative analysed MFS will be based on the simultaneous utilization of crops (cash, feed and energetic) and various rearing animals with full recycling practices of animal wastes in view to ensure high resource-use efficiency (notably of nutrients), reduction in dependence on external inputs (fertilisers, pesticides, concentrated feeds), and acceptable environmental and economic performances.\nCANTOGETHER will produce a complete picture of their effects and will facilitate their adoption by jointly involving researchers and the key actors of the agricultural sector (farmers, advisors, policy makers, and actors of the food supply chain).", 62000.0, 3360217.0, "CANTOGETHER", "Testing new approaches to agriculture", "A recent study has shown that mixed crop and animal farming is a feasible approach to help European agriculture become more sustainable and productive.", "Agriculture faces numerous challenges when it comes to conserving natural resources such as water and phosphorus and maintaining soil fertility and biodiversity. One way to address these challenges is by using mixed farming systems (MFSs), where animal and crop farming is combined at farm or territory level.\n\nThe aim of the http://www.fp7cantogether.eu/index.php (CANTOGETHER) (Crops and animals together) project is to design and test prototype MFSs. These systems combine animal and crop production and are based on a European network of existing experimental and commercial farms. The farms or groups of farms act as case studies and cover a wide range of natural and socioeconomic conditions.\n\nProject members started by developing a number of MFS prototypes, both at farm level and at territory level (based on natural or governance-defined territories). A major focus of this process was on designing tools and methods to accurately measure the success of the MFSs.\n\nThe most promising MFSs were applied in case studies, where CANTOGETHER collected environmental, scientific and economic data for each case. This data was then used to complete detailed economic and environmental assessments.\n\nCommon innovations included collective biogas plants and other waste management practices, and diversification of crops under rotation to include forage or protein crops. Overall, the researchers found economic, agronomic, environmental and social benefits in MFSs, but found that farmers' workloads increased.\n\nPrototype MFSs developed by CANTOGETHER will help mitigate the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. Project outcomes will enable European agriculture to become more environment friendly, but also more productive and less reliant on external inputs.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2015-09/163458.jpg", "fp7_101746_962920456"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SA14"}
