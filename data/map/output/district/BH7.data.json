After their return,  such documentation will be shared with other members of staff during workshops they will conduct, both within our school and in other schools belonging to the area network. The staff attending training couses abroad will also play the role of coordinators and tutors for colleagues in experimenting the new  practices.\r\nThe long term result of international mobility will be the implementation of the project  \"The Digital CLIL School.\"  in the third, fourth and fifth year classes\r\nThe project will deal with Art , Physics and Science, and will use a collaborative teaching-learning approach which will involve  analysis of authentic English texts and of interactive material from the Web,  cooperative writing of multimedia texts in the subjects and sharing lessons in English with students of eTwinning partner classes abroad.\r\nCLIL modules will be designed through an action-research aimed at finding out new techniques and at devising new relevant and motivating \"texts\". Interdisciplinary work will be promoted.\r\nThe multimedia lessons carried out by students in the CLIL project will provide a school data bank which will be published in the school te-learning platform and will be used as an e-book for other classes in the following school years.\r\nDissemination will take place as one to one and group training, workshops, peer-teaching, organisation of the \"e-CLIL week\", counseling forum on the school website and a final conference open to schools of the area.", "http://www.shadows.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT02-KA101-035375_2"], ["6AQ", "Huelva Experiencias Basadas en el Empleo: Mobility", "LITTLE PICKLE DELI LIMITED", 85691.0, "The County Council of Huelva with 7 Vocational Training Centers in the province of Huelva apply the  current HEBE Mobility project as a Consortium.
