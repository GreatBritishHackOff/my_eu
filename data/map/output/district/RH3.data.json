Numerous attempts have been made, some very recent, but all have been sub optimal and most have failed completely. These failures are due to a lack of underpinning research and of certain key components. The project has the following objectives: Zero emissions to air and zero external noise and vibration in port Reduction of overall fuel consumption by 30%, tending to &gt;90% on applications such as long distance sailing boats using regenerative techniques CO2 reduction of &gt;30% in all \u201coff design point\u201d applications (e.g.fishing boats and small commercial ferries) 50% reduction in HC &amp; NOx The market for small hybrid drive systems is tens of thousands of units and the aggregate social and environmental benefits are substantial. A holistic approach will be taken to total energy consumption and production on board. At the centre of the new system will be a comprehensive energy management module which will supervise and control energy flows in and out of a specially designed battery bank. The NMEA 2000 standard will be developed as necessary for the new data formats. Safety issues will be addressed by developing new ISO standards. The following research, development and validation will be carried out: High efficiency, low speed, torque following propeller Rim drive propulsor using an embedded permanent magnet DC (PMDC) motor and contra rotating blades Load following, dynamic PMDC motor and generator controllers High efficiency DC to DC converters High efficiency AC to high voltage DC multi output battery charger Control algorithms for key components The final deliverables will be a validated hybrid drive system for small craft, a design tool, critical new components including a new propeller, and contributions to NMEA and ISO standards.", 321110.0, 2600768.0, "HYMAR", "More power to small boats", "EU researchers have developed a marine propulsion system for small craft. The market for such small hybrid drive systems is large, and the social and environmental benefits are substantial.", "Marine diesel electric and hybrid drive systems, where the power is generated by more than one source, have been used in large ships and submarines for many years. However, until now it has not been possible to transfer such systems successfully to smaller craft.\n\nAchieving this was the goal of the 'High efficiency hybrid drive trains for small and medium sized marine craft' (HYMAR) project funded by the EU. The project set out to develop an optimised hybrid system that would be close to being market ready.\n\nAt the end of its third year, the HYMAR project carried out a major re-evaluation of all the data it had collected. The conclusion drawn from this analysis was that the initial focus on serial hybrid systems had been misplaced, and that the project's objectives would be better met by parallel hybrid systems.\n\nThus, the project team was granted a project extension in order to explore other options. This enabled HYMAR to develop a parallel hybrid system that has since been installed, tested and validated on marine craft. The project has also developed modified lead-acid batteries that demonstrate enhanced performance in hybrid applications. Furthermore, HYMAR has built a comprehensive energy management module and graphical user interface able to control the energy flows of an entire craft.\n\nThe optimised hybrid system developed during the project offers three major advantages: no detectable emissions, no discernible noise and a substantial reduction in fuel consumption. Although the project is now complete, some relatively minor work remains to be done to make the system a market-ready solution for both commercial and recreational craft.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2013-06/57677.jpg", "fp7_92079_996572375"]]}}, "outwardCode": "RH3"}
