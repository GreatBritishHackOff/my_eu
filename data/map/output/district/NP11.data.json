It is the outcome of a joint vision by the two major European engine manufacturer Groups MAN & WARTSILA, which together hold 90% of the world\u2019s marine engine market.\nThe present proposed HERCULES-C project is the Phase III of the HERCULES Programme. In order to take marine engine technology a step further towards improved sustainability in energy production and total energy economy, an extensive integration of the multitude of the new technologies developed in Phases I and II is required. HERCULES-C addresses this challenge by adopting a combinatory approach for engine thermal processes optimization, system integration, as well as engine reliability and lifetime.\nThe first Objective of HERCULES-C is to achieve further substantial reductions in fuel consumption, while optimizing power production and usage. This will be achieved through advanced engine developments in combustion and fuel injection, as well as through the optimization of ship energy management and engine technologies supporting transport mission management.\nThe second Objective of HERCULES-C is to achieve near-zero emissions by integrating the various technologies developed in the previous research Projects, in Phases I and II.\nThe third Objective is to maintain the technical performance of engines throughout their operational lifetime. This requires advanced materials and tribology developments to improve efficiency and reliability, as well as sensors, monitoring and measurement technologies to improve the controllability and availability of marine power plants.\nThe project HERCULES-C structure of RTD work comprises 47 Subprojects, grouped into 10 Work Packages and 5 Work Package Groups, spanning the complete spectrum of marine diesel engine technology.\nThe HERCULES-C Project has duration of 36 months, a Consortium with 22 participants. and a total budget of EUR 17 million.'", 53629.0, 14002959.0, "HERCULES-C", "More efficient ship engines", "International shipping is the most energy efficient mode of mass transport and only a modest contributor to overall greenhouse emissions, An EU-funded project is set to further improve ship engine efficiency to ensure sea transport will grow apace with world trade.", "HERCULES has been a long-running research and development programme aimed at to develop the future generation of efficient and clean ship engines.\n\nThe project began in 2004 and is now in its third incarnation.\n\nThe latest phase of the programme is 'Higher efficiency, reduced emissions, increased reliability and lifetime, engines for ships' (http://www.hercules-c.com (HERCULES-C)) .\n\nThe 22-member project builds on developments achieved by its predecessors, and will run from 2012 to 2015.\n\nThrough simulations, analysis and design, HERCULES-C aims to reduce fuel consumption of marine diesel engines by 3\u00a0% by 2015.\n\nFurthermore, the project aims to reduce ship engine exhaust emissions by 80\u00a0% over the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Tier\u00a01 limits, which would be almost zero.\n\nLastly, the project aims to maintain at most a 5\u00a0% divergence from as-new performance of ship engines throughout their 20-year lifespans.\n\nWork began with computational fluid dynamics modelling of gas direct injection and combustion on two- and four-stroke engines.\n\nNext, the project selected optimisation methods, used these for design and manufacture of improved components for both engine types.\n\nThe project conducted fuel-spray simulations using several nozzle geometries, leading to a new design for optical investigation of spray properties.\n\nSuch investigations were conducted on three test rigs.\n\nCombinations of two-stage turbochargers with emission-reduction systems were tested, achieving IMO Tier\u00a0III nitrogen oxides (NOx) compliance for a four-stroke engine.\n\nThe project manufactured an advanced exhaust gas re-circulation system for that engine, and designed a system for improved intake-valve control.\n\nFurthermore, sensors and analysis tools were developed, while the project also investigated lubrication oil transportation mechanisms in two-stroke engines.\n\nLastly, the consortium developed a tool for cutting specimens from honing cylinder liners.New designs will result from HERCULES-C's technical work that improve ship engine efficiencies and reduce fuel consumption.\n\nThe project will also have exceeded the current standard by reducing greenhouse gas and other emissions to almost zero.\n\nAnother outcome will be preservation of nearly-new engine performance throughout the life of the engine.\n\nThese developments represent considerable commercial opportunities for European businesses to supply the world market.", "http://www.hercules-c.com", "http://www.ep-coatings.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112127.jpg", "fp7_102006_952785702"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3EH", "Interkulturelle Kompetenzen in europ\u00e4ischen Industriebetrieben", "Klockner Pentaplast Limited", 28189.0, "Industrial clerks\r\n\r\nOur school offers a special education program for apprentices who train to become industrial clerks.
