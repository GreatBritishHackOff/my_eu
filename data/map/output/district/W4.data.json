Combining this force with world-renowned expertise in the biochemistry of Dunaliella (Ben-Amotz) we will tailor the productivities of strains sourced by the Marine Biological Association for biorefinery requirements and add to the mix, experience in constructing and using the two most advanced systems for cultivating microalgae: a series of photobioreactors developed by A4F Portugal - currently scaled-up to the largest size in the world, 1.100 m3, and open raceways by NBT Israel - 10 ha in operation for \\ 30 years.

A secure supply of sustainable mineral products is essential to maintaining the European mining, mineral and manufacturing industries.\n\nThe main objective of STOCISM is to enhance the competitiveness of the European industrial minerals industry by developing cleaner, more energy efficient extraction and processing technologies.  STOICISM is an industry-led project with a specific focus on calcined industrial minerals which are presently energy intensive to produce.  Most calcining uses the direct combustion of fossil fuels, contributing to up to 85% of their carbon emissions.\n\nTo meet the overall aim, three key calcined industrial minerals have been identified: diatomaceous earth; perlite and kaolin.  The processes implemented can also then be directly transferable to many other industrial minerals. In global terms, the EU produces one third of the world\u2019s production of perlite, 20% of calcined kaolin and 20% of diatomite.  Key markets for these minerals are beverage filtration, coatings, plastic, rubber, cosmetics, insulation and construction materials.
