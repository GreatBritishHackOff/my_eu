Photonics has the potential to play a critical role in space missions and Europe has the opportunity to lead. In this context, HIPPO aims to lead the \u201chigh power photonics\u201d trend and develop a new generation of high-power optical components and modules. HIPPO will do this guided by a leading satellite vendor: blending advanced InP fabrication, innovative packaging, photonic crystal fibres and advanced passive fibre-optics. HIPPO, under the continued guidance of the vendor, will demonstrate technology applicability into: 1) satellite laser communication terminals and 2) on-board optical processing for telecom satellites. Current state-of-the-art high-power commercial lasers are all manufactured in the USA, with some of them also falling under ITAR regulations prohibiting their use outside the US. HIPPO aims to end this restriction for the European supply chain by developing the necessary InP component expertise to equip Europe with the technological edge in high-power photonic components for space. HIPPO will develop the first space-qualified booster optical fibre amplifier and pave the way towards ultra-high power amplifiers through the introduction of photonic crystal, large mode area fibres and advanced passive fibre-optic components for space applications. HIPPO focuses on creating a powerful \u201cmade in Europe\u201d technology base covering the complete spectrum of \u201chigh-power photonics\u201d.

The careful management of air flow within a building forms part of this strategy through the control of inlet fresh air and exhaust air, maximising air re-circulation, and minimising the amount of fresh air which is often drawn in through a heat exchanger. However, there is a high risk that the air quality is reduced. Continued exposure to environments with poor air quality is a major public health concern in developed and developing countries. It is estimated that the pollutants responsible for poor air quality cause nearly 2.5 million premature deaths per year world-wide. Significantly, around 1.5 million of these deaths are due to polluted indoor air, and it is suggested that poor indoor air quality may pose a significant health risk to more than half of the world\u2019s population. Perhaps surprisingly, remedial action to improve air quality is often easy to implement. Relatively simple measures such as increased air flow through ventilation systems, or a greater proportion of fresh air to re-circulating air are sufficient to improve air quality. Low-energy air purification and detoxification technologies are available which will reduce the concentration of specific pollutants. Similarly, filtration systems (e.g. electrostatic filters) can be switched in to reduce the level of the particulate matter in the air (the principle pollutant responsible for poor health). The INTASENSE concept is to integrate a number of micro- and nano-sensing technologies onto a common detection platform with shared air-handling and pre-conditioning infrastructure to produce a low-cost miniaturised system that can comprehensively measure air quality, and identify the nature and form of pollutants.

An EU-funded initiative worked to ensure that energy-efficient air conditioning need not compromise the health and well-being of residents and workers.", "Space heating can account for half the energy consumed in public and residential buildings. Lowering this figure is an important strategy for achieving low-energy/low-carbon buildings. Reducing the amount of cold fresh air entering the heat exchanger while increasing the amount of recirculated air can reduce energy requirements. Unfortunately, this strategy can reduce air quality, resulting in health problems for building residents.\n\nAir quality in buildings can be improved through relatively simple measures, such as increasing the airflow through ventilation systems or using a greater proportion of fresh air in recirculated air. Low-energy air purification technologies are also available, as are filtration systems for reducing the amount of particulates in air.\n\nThe http://www.intasense.eu (INTASENSE) (Integrated air quality sensor for energy efficient environment control) project integrated micro- and nano-sensing technologies into a detection platform to produce a low-cost system for measuring air quality and identifying pollutants. The aim was to wirelessly link the air quality monitor to air handling and quality infrastructure to allow the efficient management of particulates in the air.\n\nProject partners developed a system based on volatile organic compound (VOC), particulate and combustion gas sensors, and integrated them into a low-cost high-performance unit. To achieve this, INTASENSE employed advanced fluidic gas-handling systems for controlled sampling and to develop a tailor-made wide-area wireless network platform.\n\nProtection against poor air quality exposure with implementation of the project's air quality sensor system represents a major positive economic impact. Therefore, technologies and experience gained through INTASENSE will help provide project partners with new opportunities in the air quality and sensors markets.\n\nThe application of INTASENSE will help improve public and worker health, resulting in reduced sick leave and increased productivity and business profitability. The combined economic benefits of increased worker productivity and reduced health care costs (due to a healthier population) could be over EUR\u00a0100 billion annually across the EU.\n\nThanks to the widespread adoption of air quality sensor systems linked to remedial ventilation and air purification systems INTASENSE will make a major contribution to Europe's health and economy.
