The requirements for sorting and segregation of polymer types within waste streams are intensifying - more stringent targets for recycling are forcing recyclers to segregate more difficult materials that they could formerly lose as scrap; increased volumes and high labour costs force the industry to reduce manual segregation and increase shredding; this requires more automation of sorting facilities; producer regulations increase the responsibility for the supply side to ensure identifiability of the materials they provide, through to the point of recycling.  Automated sorting operations are all based on Near Infra-Red spectroscopy, which can rapidly recognize the NIR signature of different polymers, and activate sorting equipment to segregate the polymer types.  NIR is the only technique that is fast enough, powerful enough and robust enough to be usable on a recycling line.  BUT the NIR technique fails to \u201csee\u201d black materials and some colours, because the carbon black pigment used also absorbs the NIR beam and prevents the reflection of the polymer\u2019s characteristic spectrum back to the sensor.  This project, based on our successful previous work, will develop a range of \u201cNIR transparent\u201d alternatives to carbon black, to enable the NIR sorting operations to segregate black and coloured plastic where they have been unable to before, to a purity that will be usable in high value recycled engineering polymers. We will base our market entry strategy on a \u201cspiral economy\u201d approach, where the packaging industry uses virgin detectable polymer to make their packaging, and this, with its product life of under one year, is recycled into high quality engineering plastics for the manufacturers of automotive and consumer durables to use without waiting for returns from their own end-of-life materials.", 411038.0, 1294579.0, "NIRSort", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_210847_952281690"], ["0LQ", "A new  process for removal of odour from Post Consumer Waste Polymer for non-food applications \u2013 ODEX", "Luxus Ltd", "Although much progress has been made in recycling the easier polymer streams such as at-line production waste, or through specialist closed loop systems, the challenge to recycle Post Consumer polymer waste (mainly packaging from consumer goods such as food, sauces and detergents) is still strong, particularly for polypropylene and polyethylene.  These polymers strongly absorb odours from their contents, and form musty taints due to bacterial action in the waste stream, which currently needs uneconomic levels of cleaning before they can be recycled into high value products such as automotive fascias and building products.  \nOf all of the post consumer polypropylene waste produced, under 1% is recycled into high quality products; the rest is used in low value applications such as buried geotextiles, or is landfilled or incinerated. The ODEX process concept from Luxus, a recycling compounder for automotive plastics, has been specifically created to provide a cost effective method to deodourise polymers for higher value uses; it uses only the existing heat energy from the compounding process to drive the odourous compounds out of carefully designed pellets within a continuous at-line process.  This project is intended to validate the feasibility of the process and formulate a business plan, to underpin our future objectives of scaling it up to commercial application.  The future embodiment of the technology is envisaged as a turnkey or retrofit option for Luxus and other existing compounders as licencees, allowing them to provide high quality polymers from materials that would otherwise have been destined for landfill or incineration.", 42579.0, 60827.0, "Odex", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_206787_952281690"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["0LQ", "LUXUS LIMITED*", 408323.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_23181", 2017]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["0EU", "RJL", "LOUTH COUNTY HOSPITAL"], ["0EU", "RWD", "COUNTY HOSPITAL LOUTH"], ["0EU", "RWD", "LOUTH HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS"], ["0EU", "RWD", "LOUTH HOSPITAL MEDICINE"], ["0EU", "RWD", "LOUTH HOSPITAL SURGERY"], ["0EU", "RY5", "LOUTH COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"], ["0EU", "RY5", "URGENT CARE CENTRE (LOUTH HOSPITAL)"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LN11"}
