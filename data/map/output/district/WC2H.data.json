The vocational training must respond to this development with its interface (function) role bitween the education and employmentsystem. Therefore, the internationalisation of our three vocational colleges (1550 students) is an important goal in the school's development. A learning abroad/internship in other European countries is a particularly effective tool for the students. Especially the importance of vocational education for the social development and the professional  perspective of each individual (every student) is undisputed. To gain intercultural experiences and skills while in school education, to deepen knowledge of foreign languages and to secure a head start when entering the profession is becoming increasingly important for many students. Furthermore, a learning stay abroad encourages andboasts the self-confidence and strengthers the emotional stability.\r\nParticipants: Per year, of the three vocational colleges, 94 students, 6 teachers/educational staff of the project group and 2 accompaying persons can apply for a scholarship. The students undergo an initial training/schooting with advanced professional knowledge in the following branches: Social & Health System, Nutrition & Home, Medien & Communication (Design Technical Assistant-GTA), the technical school of social work - social education.\r\nActivities: The students will complete a four-week intenship with project partners. Health/social/education branch:e.g. childrengarden, special scholls or facilities for disabled people in Finland/Sweden/Denmark. Facilities in Northern Europe especially  practise innovative approaches in the areas of early intervestion, education and inclusion. Countries in Northern Europe promote and practise the early intervestion and inclusion more professionally than other European countries. \r\nMedien & Communication (GTA branch): Many countries are very open-minded towards the social media and multimedia education. The GTAs get to know the future-oriented and innovative practises and new techniques through the project partners. They get introduced to the independent project management. The project partners define the project work in advance.\r\nProject implementation: The project group of the vocational colleges is responsible for organising the stays abroad. Appropriate project partners in European countries are build up, contractual frameworks (fixed contact, learning agreement/project agreement, support, language course, valuation) are defined. The information seesions for students/parents is followed by the application. The students are selected through an application process. Then preparation seminars follow. During their stay abroad they are accompanied by the project group/person of trust and their local contact (supervision, own facebook group). Following the stay abroad the students prepare completion reports and an assessment/evaluation is done. Public relations (press releases, school website, presentation at an open house) complete the project.\r\nResults: The students will gather knowledge and experience of other cultures, peoples , nations and behaviors. They can compare the working and living environment in the European area . They will expand their intercultural and social competences and strengthen their own cultural identity. The students will be able to make a more accurate picture of their professional career . The professional perspective is improved and the choice of professional is strengthened. Language skills and self-confidence are encouraged. They will change their view on Europe and the European Community.

Other objectives are:\r\n- offering quality and variety to our teaching offer; offering job opportunities; orienteering to carreer; improving a sense of European and global identity; promoting innovation at school; improving linguistic competences to overcome linguistic and cultural borders; promoting mobility in Europe and in the world and allow success into the more and more fast-moving and demanding job market   \r\n- creating an updated learning environment to enable self-discovery and fullfillment, to create interest and awareness implementing CLIL methodologies; implementing a EU dimension in the school curricola and of the credit transfer system like  ECVET e EUROPASS\r\n- developping competences and skills in using new media in students and staff to fill in the gap between the teachers' and the digital natives' worlds, by creating a common language; facilitating learning with diversified paths, overcoming borders and obstacles.\r\nAccording to the VET Mobility Chart, the number of  beneficiaries will be 60 students attending the 4-5 class (catering, tourism, administration and marketing) and recent graduates of our school. The group includes disables, disadvantaged students and with learning difficulties. First learners will improve their competences in foreign language used abroad and will attend a pedagogic/professional training; after they will do a 4-week work placement to develop their field competences with a focus on fusion food and catering/tourism trends and social marketing. Given the large number of mobilities, they will be nomore restricted to excellence but offered in a systematic way to all students with good behaviour, widening, differentiating the school training offer, increasing motivation and promoting school success as planned in our school mission. Our school will gain an international dimension and will convey mobility and good practises in the area. \r\nStudents will be accompanied by 1teacher given the large number of minors and disadvantaged students+ 1 extra for fluxes with  students with special needs.  \r\nThe staff mobilities will be 25 (teachers, management and ATA employees) to offer wider opportunites abroad to develop competences, overcome disaffection and spread passion for teaching. The mobilities lasting about  8 days will be concentrated on jobshadowing, workshops, courses about foreign languages,  social inclusion, new teaching tecniques, CLIL and exchange of good practises.\r\nOn the return, the students will take part to a final contest: in teams they will prepare a fusion dish/cocktail expoiting the experience they got and the new skills gained. The reception group will prepare a suitable menu and presentation while the marketing group will plan a marketing campaign to launch on the social media. The jury will be composed by chefs/maitre of famous local restaurants while the audience will be formed by representatives of local boards, associations in order to give visibility to the project and offer job opportunities. The staff  will spread the new methodologies learnt in their department and will put into practice their new skills in their classes. Everybody will  update learning paths and will spread an international dimension at school, a dynamic, positive, motivating climate to get success and personal fullfillment. \r\nAccording to the internationalisation process, the network has been reinforced: we have chosen to keep the partners we trust and that are located in strategic markets  as well as to keep te prestigious cooperations we have with oversesas partners, especially due to the project topic. Indeed we believe that training should be opened to an international market to mirror the multicultural, multiehnic, global composition of our society. These partners give added value to our project and will let learners widen opportunities and perspectives, competence and will offer unique trainings in destinations that are among the top-world and in luxury accommodation like the 5-star holiday resort in Turks and Caicos.  Besides they will allow job shadowing, exchange of good practise to the staff with high quality schools and companies in the world.  The mobilities will be at some partners but all the network will cooperate in the project's dissemination and success.\r\nWe wll offer mobilities in the various foreign languages studied in our school", "http://www.rossodisera.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005935_5"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["8HL", "THE NATIONAL FARMERS UNION DEVELOPMENT LTD*", 17573.0, "Other management expenditure (05.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_16850", 2016], ["9EG", "BRITISH ACTORS EQUITY ASSOCIATION*", 534.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_18728", 2016], ["8HL", "THE NATIONAL FARMERS UNION DEVELOPMENT LTD*", 675.0, "Other management expenditure for research and innovation programmes \u2014 Horizon 2020 (05.01.05.03)", "fts_2016_37833", 2016], ["7HH", "SAVE THE CHILDREN INTERNATIONAL LBG*SCI", 189279.0, "Support to conflict prevention, peace-building and crisis preparedness (19.02.02)", "fts_2017_15719", 2017], ["8HL", "THE NATIONAL FARMERS UNION DEVELOPMENT LTD*", 8593.0, "Other management expenditure (05.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_18587", 2017], ["9EG", "BRITISH ACTORS EQUITY ASSOCIATION*", 941.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_20442", 2017], ["9JQ", "LEARNWORLDS LTD", 69947.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_23651", 2017], ["7DQ", "GLOBAL SERIES NETWORK LIMITED", 36839.0, "MEDIA -programme \u2014 Operating transnationally and internationally and promoting transnational circulation and mobility (09.05.01)", "fts_2017_31491", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "WC2H"}
