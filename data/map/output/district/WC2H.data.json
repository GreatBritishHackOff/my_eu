Due to the massive growth of available data, conventional methods of data integration are bound to fail while the complexity of processes within organizations ask for more agile options to link and mash-up data in a qualified way. However, in many cases public sector information is not published in a machine-processable format but only as unstructured documents or reports, thus making the effort and cost of linking and utilizing this information unbearable for SMEs. The majority of available Linked Data tools have an academic focus and hence there is a strong need for supporting consumers unfamiliar with the linked data paradigm through interfaces that hide the underlying complexity and allow the re-use of existing software applications.The LinDA project aims to assist SMEs and data providers in renovating public sector information as well as analyzing and interlinking them with enterprise data, by providing Open Data renovation and Consumption application libraries that are based on the Linked Data paradigm but with a strong business, rather than academic, focus.The LinDA project aims to develop : a) A rule-based system for renovating and converting a wide range of supported data structures into arbitrary RDF graphs, b) A repository for accessing and sharing Linked-Data vocabularies and metadata amongst SMEs', c) An ecosystem of Linked Data publication and consumption apps (visualization, exploration, data mining), which can be bound together in a dynamic manner, leading to new, unpredicted insights.

The so-called 'Web 2.0' represents a precious repository of thematic information, thanks to the heterogeneous content that is inserted daily and spontaneously updated by its users. Very recently, a big commercial interest has started to arise \u2013 especially within industries that manufacture consumer goods and services \u2013 in acquiring, classifying and managing all product related information that emerges out of Web 2.0 channels, thus going beyond the known capabilities of consolidated search engines. It would be possible to use this insight to information at multiple stages of the policy-life cycle to support the definition of the political agenda, the creation, the implementation and the monitoring of policy proposals.In this context, modern politicians could test, detect and understand how citizens perceive their own political agendas, and also stimulate the emergence of discussions and contributions on the informal web (e.g. forums, social networks, blogs, newsgroups and wikis), so as to gather useful feedback for immediate (re)action. In this way, politicians can create a stable feedback loop between information gathered on the Web and the definition of their political agendas based on this contribution. The ability to leverage the vast amount of user-generated content for supporting governments in their political decisions requires new ICT tools that will be able to analyze and classify the opinions expressed on the informal Web, or stimulate responses, as well as to put data from sources as diverse as blogs, online opinion polls and government reports to an effective use.To this end, NOMAD aims to introduce these different new dimensions into the experience of policy making by providing decision-makers with fully automated solutions for content search, selection, acquisition, categorisation and visualisation that work in a collaborative form in the policy-making arena.", 217728.0, 2818719.0, "NOMAD", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_102148_964716411"], ["9JQ", "Boosting the growth potential of CEE start-ups on a pan-Europen level by creating new opportunities, synergies and opening the GATE of Startup Europe to the Balkans", "Nacue Uk Ltd", "'The overall concept of MY-GATEWAY builds around the growth potential boost of CEE start-ups on a pan-European level by exploiting the Consortium partners' Startup Europe experience (as former coordinators and partners of the ICT-13 projects) and by implementing actions aimed at creating new opportunities and synergies within and beyond the MY-GATEWAY\u2019s ecosystem.
