The primary LEANWIND objective is to provide cost reductions across the offshore wind farm lifecycle and supply chain through the application of lean principles and the development of state of the art technologies and tools.\n\nThe offshore wind industry in existing near shore shallow sites has yet to become cost competitive with traditional forms of energy while new sites are being planned for greater distances from shore or deeper water bringing new challenges. The offshore wind industry has not yet applied lean principles to the logistical operations of the wind farm in all stages of the lifecycle as proposed by the LEANWIND project. \u201cLean\u201d principles were originally developed by Toyota to optimise the processes of manufacturing industries; these principles of optimisation and efficiency have subsequently been adopted by many other industries to remove wasteful stages and streamline processes.\n\nThis new \u201clean\u201d paradigm will be applied to each of the critical project stages: logistical processes, shore-based transport links, port and staging facilities, vessels, lifting equipment, safety and O&M.\nThe LEANWIND approach will ensure that unnecessarily complex or wasteful stages of the development process are removed, flow between the required stages is streamlined, quality is enhanced and thus overall cost and time efficiency improved to enable the industry to bridge the gap between current costs and industry cost aspirations. Properly applied, lean management will improve quality, reliability and H&S standards across the project supply chain and throughout the wind farm lifecycle.", null, 11865400.0, "LEANWIND", null, null, null, null, "http://www.b9energy.co.uk", null, "fp7_111310_952122416"], ["2SF", "WIDE spectral band & WIDE dynamics multifunctional imaging SENSor Enabling safer car transportation", "Raptor Photonics Ltd", "The White Paper on EU Transport Policy for 2010 states a key objective: 50% reduction of casualties due to road accidents by the end of 2010. Improvements on road safety are achievable increasing the EU market penetration of eSafety systems, currently limited by performance and cost of sensor technologies.According to ICT-2009.6.1, 2WIDE_SENSE addresses research challenges in the area of 'Intelligent Vehicle Systems for further improving road safety ... This includes advanced in-vehicle safety systems with improved performance and reduced costs'.The project aims at providing European automotive industry with the next generation of imaging sensors beyond the current CMOS imagers. The core sensing technology is a cost-effective InGaAs focal plane array with wide spectral response (VIS-NIR-SWIR) and wide dynamic range (120dB). The benefits deriving from the additional SWIR bandwidth allow enhancing preventive safety functions and car energy efficiency.The specific objectives are:?- implementation of the paradigm of 'application independent' multifunctional camera;?- hybridisation of InGaAs detector on silicon read out circuits;?- deposition of low cost interferential bandpass optical filters at pixel level;?- design of AR coatings and plastic lenses;?- development of multi-spectral wide dynamic range camera engine;?- algorithm development for predictive road status monitoring;?- sensor validation adapting existing ADAS software platforms (LDW, NV, HBA, TSR, VRU);?- synergies and complementary actions with on-going and new projects in FP7 on road safety.The innovations claimed are:?- wide dynamic range and wide spectral response InGaAs focal plane array;?- collective process for hybridisation, including the substrate removal step, of InGaAs arrays on silicon read-out circuit;-? use of wide spectral band cameras in safety applications;?- cost-effective large spectrum plastic lenses;?- road status monitoring for preventive and active safety", 412841.0, 4257709.0, "2WIDE_SENSE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_93770_993183874"], ["2SF", "STORY- Added value of STORage in distribution sYstems", "B9 Energy Storage Ltd", "The main objective of STORY is to show the added value storage can bring for a flexible, secure and sustainable energy system. This will be achieved by showing the inter-relations between technologies and stakeholders as well as the potential and impact of policy and regulation.\n\nThe future European grid has to serve a diverse and mixed landscape of users in a situation of mixed rules and responsibilities depending on the policy and regulatory choices that will be made. Challenges include high penetration of renewables, bi-directional flows of different energy vectors, growing number of users and requirements for higher security. The European commission wants to strengthen the position of the EU energy industry, including those players active in producing solutions for security of supply, increased share of renewables and grid stability. The advances in ICT technology, intelligent control algorithms, inverter and storage technologies provide strong tools to cope with these challenges. \nGiven this context, STORY focuses on providing relevant and wide-covering demonstrations that serve as input for a thorough and transparent analysis on what the impact of storage can be for the involved stakeholders. Storage is considered as a means, while not neglecting other competing technologies that could provide a similar or complementary functionality. \nThe actions that the 18 members from 9 European countries in STORY consortium are going to take in a 5-year project bring a valuable contribution to turn these challenges into opportunities. They will not only develop the most viable storage and ICT solutions for the demonstration sites, but they will also analyse the impact of large penetration of the technologies through simulations, analyse the effect of policies and regulations to the business opportunities of storage related industry and communicate the findings to wider community through systematic strategies for impact creation.", 1171651.0, 12857796.0, "STORY", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_194425_940662933"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["3AW", "HOT PROGRAMME", "ACCEPTABLE ENTERPRISES", null, "ESF", 571605.8, 879393.52, "esf_ni_5"], ["3AW", "The Hands On Training Programme (HOT)", "ACCEPTABLE ENTERPRISES LTD", null, "ESF", 221704.0, 554262.0, "esf_ni_69"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT40"}
