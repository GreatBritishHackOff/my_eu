Funding is sought for three flows, two of five days duration (excluding travel) and one, of three-day duration.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe areas of study have been identified as being priority areas and of benefit to the wider UK economy.  The need to effectively (and imaginatively) engage with and work with employers to identify and address skills needs is well documented: the Richard review of apprenticeships and the UKCES Review of Adult Vocational Qualifications in England (November 2013).  Aligned to this is the recognition of the benefit of skills competition as a way of raising awareness and the benefits of VET.  Competitions, whether domestic ones such as the annual Skills Show or international events (Euroskills and Worldskills) are a way of showcasing the abilities of young adults but lack national buy-in.  The low carbon agenda and the need to provide appropriate and innovative provision to meet skills needs in this growth area is a priority as identified in Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) economic and skills plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of the project is to explore and develop an understanding of the French VET systems and how this supports wider economic and employment needs in relation to the areas of study identified above.", "http://www.boston.ac.uk", "EMFEC", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000209_5"], ["6JY", "Learning languages and observing pedagogical techniques", "Boston Grammar School", 9272.0, "From 2010 to 2014 Boston Grammar School (BGS) was involved in 5 Comenius projects and hosted 4 Comenius assistants. In addition, there was a lot of other international work going on in school, resulting in BGS receiving the International School Award 2011. During this time BGS's international coordinator gained substantial experience carrying out multinational projects and supervising international work with five or more schools abroad. The school regularly hosts visiting teachers from abroad and is therefore acutely aware what to look out for when sending its own teachers abroad. \r\n\r\nBGS is interested in learning about bilingual teaching, web-based learning and is looking to expand its international work by facilitating other teachers with skills akin to those of the international coordinator. The aim of this project is to provide enthusiastic members of staff, who have already shown a considerable interest in international work and have some expertise in the aforementioned areas, with the opportunity of spending some time in a school abroad that helps them develop in their designated area of interest. For four out of five this includes developing language skills. \r\n\r\nFive teachers will be actively involved in the project (Spanish, Geography, Maths, Music and Art). All teachers had to apply to be involved in the project and show that they had the necessary enthusiasm to complete it and feed back their findings to colleagues and pupils. They all have significant experience in the subject(s) they teach and are fully qualified in that subject area. Some have MAs in education. All but one teacher wish to improve their linguistic ability to a level that it can be used in lessons, in two cases leading to bilingual teaching. The other methods include shadowing practitioners in their work, team teaching where possible. It also includes aspects such as bilingual teaching, and web/ internet-based learning. It is anticipated that this form of CPD will enthuse these members of staff even more and that they will take a lead in working more closely with international partners in the future. Dissemination through Inset of what has been learned is also part of this project.\r\n\r\nTwo teachers will improve their language skills using the Goethe Institute's distance learning facilities prior to visiting the Gymnasium am Rotenbuehl. Another two teachers will attend residential language courses in the Easter holidays prior to visiting the schools in Spain and Germany respectively in the early summer period.\r\n\r\nOverall it is anticipated that four of the teachers involved will utilize their language skills in lessons more actively. Also, their pedagogic methodologies will be more up-to-date.

Another fundamental aim of our project is to stimulate involvement in European projects and strengthen the European dimension of our school.\r\nWe believe these actions will contribute to the relevance and standard of foreign language teaching,  guarantee the successful  implementation of a multilingual model and motivate our students by making the adquisition of a foreign language more attractive, increasing their confidence and their interest in participating in European cooperation projects. \r\nEight teachers will take part in the  training activities, including the headteacher, the teacher training coordinator,  teachers who teach their own subject in English using CLIL methodology and teachers of English and French as MFL, as well as  a specialist in ancient greek .

Thus, it was easier to establish a partnership with the five European Twinnings ( Boston in UK , Gandia in Spain, Mettmann in Germany, Lovech in Bulgaria and Suceava in Rumania ) , by travelling to each twinned Town to meet people over there and prepare the mobility. We had a very positive and warm welcome in each town, although the notion of \" training period \" isn't familiar to most of them.Nevertherless, our partners to be immediatly agreed upon the project, and every year,  our students receive the warmest welcome ever.\r\nThanks to that, they can live their mobility in the best conditions, and get deeply involved in the life of the business where they do their work experience. They learn new working methods, meet different people who do the same job as theirs, though in a different way.\r\nEvery year, and for four weeks, we send over 30 students to companies in our twinned towns. The trainees are in 3rd year B TEC Hotel and Catering, Bakery and Pastry Cooking, Cooking and Health and Care. During their training period, they acquire and develop new professional skills; learn to communicate with a new language; they also learn to live on their own, but to share with others, too. And, of course, they learn, discover and  adapt to a new culture.\r\nFor example, the bakers learn to make bread with ingredients from the ones they use in France ( in Spain, they use eggs and oil to make bread ).\r\nAs we regularly keep in touch and have weekly contacts with the tutors all along the training period, it's easier for us to make the mobility a success, according to the working plan agreed upon beforehand with them .

Its objective is to identify ways to improve the education and inclusion of these students, to strengthen their skills in the language of the host country, to allow access to culture and facilitate employment, to better train teachers of French as a Second Language (FSL) and all teachers who participate in the inclusion of these students in regular curricula. \r\n \r\nThe consortium counts 24 members and cooperates with 13 international host institutions. Different profiles of staff are concerned by the inclusion of migrant pupils and students not speaking the language of the host country, and participate in the project: teachers involved in UPE2A \u2013 classes meant for newly arrived migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, regular class teachers, senior management teams of schools and executives of the local education authority of Strasbourg, inspectors and pedagogical counsellors, \r\nproject managers of different departments of the local education authority of Strasbourg. \r\n \r\nThe welcoming and training practices in Alsace are managed by the CASNAV - academic centre for the schooling of newly arrived students and students from traveling families - and can be enriched according to each situation - initiation, improvement, enhancement, broadening, diversification) by the expertise of our European partners and the devices they have put in place.\r\n \r\nThis is why the local education authority of Strasbourg has decided to set up a consortium to apply for an Erasmus + mobility project, in accordance with European values and its regional educational priorities: inclusion in schools, social integration, equal opportunities, diversity and gender equality, employability of youngsters, fighting against school dropout and radicalization.\r\n \r\nThe host organizations were selected according to the following criteria:\r\n- diversity of their experiences in the field of welcoming migrants, refugees, asylum seekers not speaking the languages of the host countries, \r\n- situations in countries which are first faced with massive waves of migrants;\r\n- quality of the historical cooperation that binds them to the local education authority of Strasbourg\r\nTaking into account the destinations of the mobility and therefore the choice of the host partner for each delegation, the steering committee considered it relevant to take into account the matching with the teaching cycle, the level and the specialization of the participants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will make it possible to carry out 128 mobility for the staff of the whole education authority of Strasbourg according to 3 strategic levels:\r\n- level of institutional steering;\r\n- level of management of schools;\r\n- school level of EANA - newly arrived migrants, refugees and asylum seekers not speaking the language of the host country.\r\n \r\nThe activities will consist in work-shadowing lessons, shared teaching and exchanging of best practices, meetings with local, institutional or non-profit organization partners. They will cover the practical aspects of hosting migrants, teaching, methods and material, also the transmission of European values and access to culture and to different forms of artistic expression that are the roots of social cohesion and democracy as well as the education to citizenship.\r\n \r\nThe result of the mobility project will fuel an analysis and a reflection on transferable practices in our local education authority of Strasbourg. \r\n \r\nThe eTwinning platform will be the tool of choice for the organization and communication of the project. This platform will serve as a means of exchanging, sharing and disseminating the results.\r\n \r\nThe expected impacts are at three levels:\r\n - academic steering and institutional management of welcoming migrants, refugees and asylum seekers not speaking the language of the host country, \r\n- the management of schools in terms of welcoming strategy;\r\n- support of newly arrived pupils and students who have newly arrived in the class and their inclusion in the regular curricula.\r\n\r\nThe transferable practices that we have observed during the mobility will make it possible to improve the education of newly arrived migrants, refugees and asylum seekers and their inclusion in the regular curricula to allow a fluent schooling and follow up of the newcomers in regular classes. To put it in a nutshell, all pupils and students with special needs will benefit from the results. \r\nGiven the current political and climatic trends, it is highly likely that the migration phenomenon towards Europe will keep increasing in the forthcoming years.
