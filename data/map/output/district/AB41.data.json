Less toxic alternatives appear to be available already but comprehensive information on their possible toxicological effects are lacking. ENFIRO offers a prototypical case study on substitution options for BFRs resulting in a comprehensive dataset on viability of production and application, environmental safety, and a complete life cycle assessment. Dissemination will ensure the project results to arrive at policymakers' desks. The ENFIRO consortium is a unique collaboration between industries, SME's and universities with a wide variety of scientific disciplines. ENFIRO will contribute to the phasing out of BFRs as proposed in the European Water Framework Directive. The approach and the results of ENFIRO will be useful for similar substitution studies, e.g. in REACH.  Following a study on literature and industrial information, and prioritizing , three flame retardant (FR)/product combinations will be selected (e.g. metal-based FRs, phosphorous-based and nanoclay-based FRs in printed circuit boards, paints and foam). These will be studied for environmental and toxicological risks, and for viability of industrial implementation, i.e. production of the FR, fire safety and application of the FR into products (electronics, furniture, paints, foams, etc.). All information from these tests will be used for a risk assessment. The outcome of that assessment will, together with socio-economic information be used in a complete life cycle assessment. The project will follow a pragmatic approach, avoiding final recommendations on environment-compatible substitution options that would not be viable for implementation by industry. A Substitution Information Exchange Forum with members representing FR users (large industries) has been invited to guide this project.", 128102.0, 3398879.0, "ENFIRO", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_92068_999684232"], ["8ER", "Annually-resolved archives of marine climate change - development of molluscan sclerochronology for marine environmental monitoring and climatology", "Hartley Anderson Limited", "Proposal for a multi-partner ITN (\u201cARAMACC\u201d: Annually Resolved Archives of MArine Climate Change) based around the newly emerging field of molluscan sclerochronology/climatology.

The DENAMIC project is ultimately focused on reducing such effects of environmental contamination on learning and developmental disorders in children. It aims to study and evaluate environment-health relationships in children. Key elements are: development of sophisticated tools and methods for early warning and screening of compounds for neurotoxicity, to study mechanisms of disease development and the role of individual susceptibility, to improve assessment of exposures and effects, focus on combined exposures to environmental agents that can interact to enhance adverse effects and reduction of health inequalities of children through Europe. One of the main aims of DENAMIC is to develop tools and methods for neurotoxic effects of mixtures of environmental pollutants at low levels, possibly resulting in (subclinical) effects on learning (cognitive skills) and developmental disorders in children (e.g ADHD, autism spectrum disorders and anxiety disorders). A broad suite of contaminants will be included in the studies, with options to bring in new chemicals in case evidence comes up during the project. With 14 partners from ten different countries DENAMIC has a true international character. It is a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary project. Six SME\u2019s will play a key role in the development of biotechnological screening tools. The most modern techniques in the fields of genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and transcriptomics will be applied.

This WP combines advanced institutional analysis with a participatory approach in order to identify and assess management measures, strategies and policy options in collaboration with stakeholders that reduce marine litter and alleviate diverse ecological and socio-economic impacts as identified in WPs 2-4. WP6 will integrate the outcomes of the project and hosts the CLEANSEA Stakeholder Platform. Management is dealt with under WP1 with a professional dissemination package, including a documentary film, website, publications, etc. covered in WP7.
