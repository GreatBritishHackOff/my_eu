The core of MOVESMART is a hierarchical urban-traffic infrastructure that is hosted and maintained by a cloud architecture. MOVESMART envisions the server-based creation and maintenance of time-dependent urban-traffic metadata as well as live-traffic logging, hosted in an urban traffic knowledge base (UTKB). The contents of UTKB are maintained and handled so as to allow rapid route planning for energy efficient and personalaised mobility services in real time. The traffic reports are securely and anonymously gathered directly by the travellers via simple portable navigation device and/or smartphone application interfaces. After assessing their importance, all the necessary traffic-metadata updates and/or responses to emergent disruprions are applied to the contents of the UTKB and are broadcast to the relevant travellers. The traffic-reporting is conducted via a crowd-sourcing service, which allows the live (in-route / emergency) reports as well as post-route assessments of travellers for the recommended route plans. A crucial advantage of the MOVESMART infrastructure is the design and implementation of novel time-dependent renewable mobility services that will incorporate eco-friendly modes of transport, most notably that of electric vehicles. A set of innovative cloud-based mobility services will be delivered, such as Renewable Mobility on Demand, Vehicle Sharing and Integrated Personal Mobility, on which new business models will be deployed involving service providers, electric car manufacturers and public authorities.

The experience acquired and the competences improved helped in preparing and starting two modular training programs (finisher and bricklayer) from September 2016. The Centre also started implementing apprenticeship as one of the training forms, and developed the documents that regulate sending and incoming mobilities of VET students and trainers. The establishment of practical training centre in VBTC allows the upgrading of qualification of different target groups, including VET trainers, construction workers, higher education students, secondary school students, unemployed people. Recently the Centre has signed Partnership Agreements with VET institutions from Finland and Estonia. \r\nA working group set at Vilnius Builders Training Centre and responsible for the strategic planning, for the development and implementation of new training programmes and for the international cooperation strategy, analysed and detected which  competences can be acquired by teachers, trainers, students and managing staff in the country and which specific knowledge and practice should be looked for abroad.   In order to improve VET quality, efficiency  and transnational cooperation, the Centre developed a project idea aiming at detecting new training and learning possibilities for the different target groups in construction sector, developing more flexible training conditions and ensuring better chances within the labour market. \r\nThe project aims at transferring the good European practice in applying active and innovative teaching and learning methods that help the students acquire the required competences, develop their feelings, understanding, reasoning and abilities, VET skills, foster their motivation for active and independent learning and working. It is foreseen to benefit from the experience of international partners, namely, from flexible modular training system, ECVET system, apprenticeship training. The mobilities have been planned into 8 partner institutions in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Italy, Finland, Germany, Portugal, Slovakia and UK. Job shadowing activities for teachers and trainers will be organized in the Czech Republic, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain. The planned number of participants is 36 students and 18 teachers/trainers. \r\nThe teachers/trainers will observe the theoretical and practical classes, paying special attention to the development of creativity, innovativeness and entrepreneurship in the VET and by using flexible teaching/learning methods and tools. Another point of interest is dealing with students from socially supported families, risk-group families, dropouts. \r\nAll the activities have been planned in accordance with the strategic plan of the Centre, aiming to further develop provision of education services in working with different target groups (pupils, students, construction workers, unemployed people, adult learners),  to acquire new competences in different EU countries in developing professional skills of the learners, providing learning and assessment possibilities in virtual learning environments.\r\nDuring the training placements and job shadowing activities the participants will be able to learn about application of sustainable development principles in the education process. As a follow-up activity the teachers will provide recommendations on how  to integrate knowledge on alternative energy sources into the existing training programmes; the students will share their experiences in various meetings, career days, skills competitions.  During the visits (preparatory or monitoring if necessary) the Partnership agreements will be signed with some of the partners institutions which have been noted as providers of quality VET.\r\nThe accompanying persons are necessary for the implementation of the project activities due to the majority of the students at the Centre coming from different parts of Lithuania (27 municipalities), not having enough communication or social skills. Most of these students come from socially supported or disadvantaged families and foster homes. The project participants will also include the students who are under 18, therefore, the need for an accompanying person is highly  justified.", "http://www.swc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-LT01-KA116-034997_5"], ["7AH", "Maini pasauli - s\u0101c ar sevi!", "SOUTH WEST COLLEGE", 406156.0, "Project \"Change the world - start with yourself\" is the third Erasmus+ project applied by RTRIT and the first project applied in new quality - with VET Mobility Charter. Mobility projects have always been significant in motivating the learners, raising the quality of VET, enhancing international activities and in overall development of RTRIT.  \r\nInitiated by National Agency, developed by RTRIT, Internationalization strategy 2016-2020  structures the further plans and international development paths of the school. This project application is developed based on two essential documents - Internationalization strategy and VET Mobility Charter. \r\nOne of the targets of international development is to create new partnerships, and this project aims to involve several new partners. Organization CHASE (Consortium of Hotel and Accommodation Schools of Europe) continues it development by involving new partners who are able to fulfill quality criteria and are accepted in internal voting thus tourism and hotel school of Netherlands has joined the CHASE. RTRIT has plans to realize two student mobility to Netherlands within this project. Besides the partner from Netherlands, RTRIT has made contacts and plans mobility to new partners in Spain, Slovenia, Lithuania and Malta. \r\nThe title of the project \u201cChange the world - start with yourself\" is continuance of previous project \"To change the world, you have to start with yourself\" yet this project aims to address the participants more directly, to challenge them to start the positive change, and to put emphasis on development of individual participant and his/her further input in the development of organization. \r\nMobilities that have significant role in international development of RTRIT, are to be carried out in this project as described in the internationalization strategy. \r\n1) Long term mobilities of qualification training for last year students will be realized within CHASE. CHASE members have mutually agreed upon exchange of the learners, quality measures of training programs, and the most important - February 2017  member schools of organization (19) will start development of new training evaluation system that will be fully compatible with education systems working with ECVET. Mobility trainings realized within this project will be evaluated by the newly developed system. \r\n2) 2-5 week long mobilities for various training programs in different sectors and host organizations.  \r\n3) Mobilities addressing the needs of learners who are facing learning difficulties, losing learning motivation or are on the edge to be disclosed of voluntary leaving the education process.  In cooperation with partner-schools from Kaunas and Tartu mobility programs are specially designed to strengthen personality, develop social and communication skills, and raise learning motivation. These mobilities involve necessary accompanying persons that will support learners practically and mentally during the mobility. \r\n4) Mobility of teachers and staff involving a) development of professional skills that will be used in further work after mobility, b) demonstration of skills and sharing experience to rise the status or the school in on international level, and c) developing and strengthening of new partnerships for further cooperation and future mobilities. \r\nTaking into account descriptive evaluation of mobility charter, number of participants is adjusted, excluding the participants that will be funded by own means. Total number of participants is corrected from what has been mentioned in charter plans, corrections with slight decrease in number is made due to actual numbers of current learners and planed numbers for next academic year. The numbers planned for the next academic year are also corrected in common development strategy of RTRIT. Number of participants representing certain education program is directly proportional to the number of learners in each program.  Time and duration of mobility is set according to study process in the represented education program and by taking into consideration possibilities of host to organize study and training at high quality.", "http://www.swc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-LV01-KA116-035386_5"], ["7AH", "Training Skills for Future Thrills.", "SOUTH WEST COLLEGE", 457517.0, "CONTEXT\r\nIn 2016 South West College (SWC) were awarded the VET Mobility Charter recognising our operational capacity to manage high quality VET mobility projects, our long-term commitment to continuous improvement of mobility and the strategic approach of the organisation to incorporate transnational mobility in its activities.
