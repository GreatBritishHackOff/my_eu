The core of MOVESMART is a hierarchical urban-traffic infrastructure that is hosted and maintained by a cloud architecture. MOVESMART envisions the server-based creation and maintenance of time-dependent urban-traffic metadata as well as live-traffic logging, hosted in an urban traffic knowledge base (UTKB). The contents of UTKB are maintained and handled so as to allow rapid route planning for energy efficient and personalaised mobility services in real time. The traffic reports are securely and anonymously gathered directly by the travellers via simple portable navigation device and/or smartphone application interfaces. After assessing their importance, all the necessary traffic-metadata updates and/or responses to emergent disruprions are applied to the contents of the UTKB and are broadcast to the relevant travellers. The traffic-reporting is conducted via a crowd-sourcing service, which allows the live (in-route / emergency) reports as well as post-route assessments of travellers for the recommended route plans. A crucial advantage of the MOVESMART infrastructure is the design and implementation of novel time-dependent renewable mobility services that will incorporate eco-friendly modes of transport, most notably that of electric vehicles. A set of innovative cloud-based mobility services will be delivered, such as Renewable Mobility on Demand, Vehicle Sharing and Integrated Personal Mobility, on which new business models will be deployed involving service providers, electric car manufacturers and public authorities.

The other network is for Food Producers such as bakery and butchery schools with whom the cooperation has developed for more than 15 years.\r\nIn the project the students become more confident with better self-esteem, language and culture knowledge, and higher professional skills. It is an eye-opener for them, when they discover Europe - and the world - as a potential labour market. Through their own networks their possibilities of employment in Europe increases. They become more attractive on the home labour market as well, owing to new ideas and knowledge they have received. \r\nThe staff/management (16 teachers, and 10 staff/management) will increase language and culture knowledge, and their own professional skills through the project. When they meet the partners and discuss pedagogics, transparency and equivalent assessment of the students\u00b4 placement periods through ECVET and learning agreement, they can prepare our own students better and when receiving students and staff, as well, from our partner organisations in Europe.  Their professional skills increase through new influences and ideas they receive in the project and their language skills improve when teaching in English. They become more interested in other cultures and other languages, besides English, as well. They apply more for further education and training in Europe and show greater interest to teach at our partner schools in English.  Our management will implement ECVET and the common documents we use within the project in our school, which will improve the quality of our education and the cooperation with the partners in Europe.\r\nAnother objective is to continue the long-term work in our school and in the project with sustainablity within food, beverage, health, life-style, ethnic, social and gender equality, ethics, which they study in the school environment, in society and at the placements in receiving countries.

At the partner organisations they are firstly offered one month\u00b4s preparation of the country\u00b4s food, language and culture in theoretical and practical lessons together with students from the host school. Thereafter they practise for 4-months in the kitchen/service at hotels/restaurants of high quality chosen by the receiving organisation. During the prepartion month in the host country they are prepared to study and discuss sustainability at the placements and in society and they are offered excursions and study visits to suit the themes of the project.\r\nThe preparation of the 36 bakery/confectionery and butchery students commences in August when they begin their 3rd year and continues until they leave in spring between February and May. During the month in the host country the students will receive between 3-7 days of preparations in food, culture and sustainability during theoretical and practical lessons integrated with other students from the host school, before beginning their practice at the placements for at least 3 weeks.

Our project will address the needs from two different working fields, elderly care and child care. The profile of the participating students is that they are in the ages of 16-19 years old and have chosen to attend our Health Care Programme or our Child Care Programme. When it comes to socioeconomic and ethnical background we have a wide range of students attending both our programmes and the participants involved in our project will reflect this fact. Although we have a majority of girls attending these two programmes our intention is to involve some of the boys in our project as well. The profile of the participating teachers is reflecting the two programmes. They are teaching at The Health Care Programme and/or the Child Recreation Programme.\r\n\r\nIn the European Commission\u00b4s 2009 Ageing Report you can read that the number of people in the ages 80 years and above in EU is increasing from 85 million to 151 million in 2060. In the EU Strategy for the wellbeing and dignity of older people in need of care and assistance you can read that EU wants to promote \"a participatory approach to increase the active involvement of older people in EU projects, including in life long-learning programmes...\u201d. This taken together certainly increases future demands on elderly care. \r\n\r\nWith this in mind you can also read an EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child which acknowledges that \u201cgiving all children access to early childhood education and care is the foundation for successful lifelong learning, social integration and later employability\u201d. As communication between generations is a dimension of social integration and an objective for childhood education and care, it  is essential to give opportunities for people from different generations to meet and communicate in our European societies. \r\n\r\nThe Eurydice report \"Education and training in Europe 2020\" highlights the completion of upper secondary education as the minimum level of educational attainment for young people in today's society. An education target for the EU is to reduce the rates of young people leaving education and training so that more than 90 % completes their education of upper secondary school. Our project YET will improve the quality of our Health Care Programme and our Child Recreation Programme and make students attending these programmes more motivated. This motivation will help more of them to complete their education and to graduate.\r\n\r\nObjective 1: We want the participants, both learners and staff, to earn the skills and knowledge to create meeting places between young and old. An essential activity during these intergenerational meetings will be storytelling, where the involved young children and old people can share memories and experiences of children\u00b4s games, good storybooks, exciting excursions and more. In this way old people will learn about young children\u00b4s world today and the young children will learn about children\u00b4s world yesterday.\r\n\r\nObjective 2: According to the documents mentioned above we want our participants, both learners and staff, to discover and experience how they can, through a participatory approach, increase the active involvement of older people and young children in EU projects. Our idea is that they will make use of this experience and possibility in their future and current professions in school, elderly care or child care.\r\n\r\nThis means that in our project YET both young children from preschools, old people from rest homes and students and staff from Victum Gymnasium and South West College (SWC) will be involved.\r\n\r\nObjective 3: As The Europe 2020 strategy highlights the completion of upper secondary education as the minimum\r\n\r\nlevel of educational attainment for young people in today's society, an objective of our project YET is to increase the number of students completing their education at our school to over 90%. This means that they also more successfully can integrate into the labour market after leaving our school.\r\n\r\nThe participants will be earning the skills and knowledge of how to work with young and old people together in their future and current professions in school, elderly care and child care. This will inspire the students to create these meeting places between young and old at their future working sites. The staff will be more professional and competent in their teaching, guiding their students to work in an intergenerational way. This project will also help all the participants to make use of the opportunities EU gives them in terms of different projects in the future.

This action supports the school\u2019s vision and strengthens and promotes sustainable development such as understanding and respecting multiculturalism and diversity. Internationality is a natural part of everyday school activities. Students' capacity for internationalization and international mobility is supported, which also promotes the rise of organization's level of know-how. Work placements abroad enable different kinds of learning environments and individual learning pathways for students. Incoming international students bring in know-how and increase the internationalization in the school. Organization\u2019s strategy for internationalization includes finding new partnerships and increasing possibilities for international mobility to meet the students\u2019 increasing interest and need for international experience. The curriculum team's task is to develop the international dimension of the curriculum and make reforms according to Ecvet, for example taking the learning points into account. \r\n\r\nThe project is coordinated by Helsinki Culinary School Perho while Helsinki Vocational College is acting as a domestic partner. The project is carried out with the International CHASE Network, which consists of 18 hospitality and catering colleges around Europe. Most of the colleges act both as a sending and a receiving partner. The Network has been operating for over 20 years and represents a wide range of different language and cultural areas. From the gastronomic point of view, the colleges represent traditional European regional gastronomy. Gaining know-how and skills from the traditional European gastronomy strengthens the participants\u2019 possibilities for employment and success in labor market.\r\n\r\nThe participants of the project are primary and upper secondary based students, who study the Vocational Qualification in Hotel, Restaurant and Catering Services. The two-year project provides 40 students with the possibility of 4 and 5 months' exchange within the CHASE network colleges. \r\n\r\nThe exchange consists of a 4 -week language and cultural training in the host college and of a work placement. During the exchange period the students learn skills needed in the internationalizing working life in addition to the professional skills. International work skills include different languages, networking and acting in a multicultural environment as well as different working cultures and customs. During the language and cultural training the participants study languages, some of which are rare or less-used, such as Hungarian, Turkish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Flemish and Latvian.\r\n\r\nThe skills and learning outcomes acquired abroad are validated and recognized as part of the qualification.

These European countries were chosen for ease of access from France, The receiving partners are all high quality hotels and restaurants.The aim of our students is to pass their Vocational B TECH and to obtain the Europass certificate. After being prepared for the mobility, the students, travelling in pairs, are supervised and monitored by our local partners. The receiving hotels or resturaants keep in touch with the tutor in charge of the project. Teachers from the Lyc\u00e9e visit to assess the trainee.

During the first 4 weeks there is a period of cultural and linguistic training to prepare the students for their internships in hotels or restaurants. During the four months internship students are accommodated in the hotel or in nearby hostels or apartments. Students have a nominated supervisor in the hotel or restaurant placements and are also monitored by a tutor from the receiving partner and from the Lyc\u00e9e, the sending organisation.

The aim of this project is to provide not only an opportunity for apprentices to gain new skills but also to raise their aspirations and have a European work placement and experience that will be life changing. This project aims to emphasise to apprentices the tremendous opportunity and scope the European union offers in terms of labour market and job opportunities and being able to have the confidence to work in different countries as a result of a new language. The project aims to provide a mobility work experience for  groups of apprentices who due to financial factors do not get the chance for learning through exchange. In addition to the vocational training and skills development that apprentices will acquire they will also gain new and more updated vocational and customer service skills, better communication skills,  more improved teamwork and problem solving abilities and genuine practical life experience will result from mobility. With regard to skills gaps apprentices need to be more flexible in their attitude, require enhanced motivation and  the wider work based learning experiences that a European placement provides.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor apprentices from relatively disadvantaged backgrounds and prone to risk of leaving College early and whose basic skills require nurturing, project involvement will significantly contribute to improving attainment, enhancing employability, broadening horizons and creating an energy and enthusiasm for learning.

The other network is for bakery and butchery schools in Europe, where we have cooperated for more than 15 years. 14 teachers and 10 staff participate in the project, length: one week.Our participants receive a higher degree of intercultural competences in the project by broadening their persepective and understanding for various cultures and languages, which makes them better citizens, who understand the migration situation better. They deepen their knowledge and critical thinking when meeting various cultures and migrants at the host school and learn how they are integrated in the organisations. The project helps the participants to understand the difficulties, that might occur for migrants to adapt to a new country, but highlights also problems, that can occur for our students to adapt to a new culture and work culture at placements.  The project presents a European Labour market to the students to prevent unemployment among youngsters, where one, in spite of background, has a chance for employment. In the project we communicate in English, which improves and deepens the language competences of the participants. Meeting another language and culture increases understanding and tolerance for other cultures, also at home. The interest to learn other languages, except English, increases among the participants. The students compare their culture with their host country, which makes them more aware of pros and cons between the countries. They study equality, gender equality, migration, integration, etnicity and religion, in their host country, which  increases their critical thinking in a positive way along with understanding migrants in Europe, and other cultures back home.The students mature and become more responsible. They develop their professional skills, which make them better employees both at home and in Europe. They create their own networks meeting young people in the host school and at the placements.Our teachers and staff increase their professional skills, as well, through job-shadowing and in pedagogical discussions with European colleagues. They teach students at the host schools and try their own pedagogical methods on them, and receive new insipration from European colleagues in the teaching field. One part of the pedagogical discussions will include food and beverage labels and their contents, and how to teach students to avoid the greatest hazards. One of the objectives in the project is quality assurance of the ECVET work, which began in the last Erasmus project; the use of MoU and Learning Agreeement in a more efficient way to increase transparency more between the organisations also when assessing students, despite the different schoolsystems. It is important to involve management in the discussions in Europe, how to increase competences for staff in ECVET. When the students (26) in hospitality have been chosen in May, the 2nd school year, they will receive language, culture and food culture preparation, both in practice and theory , in our school for several months before leaving for their host country in Sept. During their placement in the host countries, the practical and theoretical preparations continue during an induction month in the host organisation followed by a 4-month long placement in quality hotels/restaurants chosen by the host organisation. During the induction month the students receive language, culture and food culture preparation, both in theory and practice, including learning  about the labels on foods and beverages and the hazards they are exposed to. They participate in excursions and study visits connected with the themes of the project.30 bakery and butchery students are prepared from Sept, year 3 until they leave for their placements during different times in spring from Febr- May. During one month\u00b4s placement in Europe they receive a few days-one week\u00b4s preparation at the host school in food, culture and about food and beverage labels integrated with students from the host school followed by at least 3 weeks\u00b4 high quality placement periods.Ester Mosessons receives higher status and a more distinct International profile through the project, which results in, students from other regions and from all over Sweden apply rto attend our school.

These actions support the school\u2019s vision and strengthens and promotes sustainable development such as understanding and respecting multiculturalism and diversity. Internationality is a natural part of everyday school activities. Students' capacity for internationalization and international mobility is supported, which also promotes the rise of organization's level of know-how. Work placements abroad enable different kinds of learning environments and individual learning pathways for students. Incoming international students bring in know-how and increase the internationalization in the school. Organization\u2019s strategy for internationalization includes finding new partnerships and increasing possibilities for international mobility to meet the students\u2019 increasing interest and need for international experience. The development discussions of the staff have shown that teachers have gaps in international expertise, as well as the need for language skills and IT skills development. Also ECVET knowledge is insufficient, consequently the teachers familiar with the principles of ECVET before the exchange period. Teachers are trained to use electronic means like Skype in accordance with the development plan for the staff, which enables for example vocational skills demonstration assessment in real-time for students abroad. The curriculum team's task is to develop the international dimension of the curriculum and make reforms according to Ecvet.The project is coordinated by Helsinki Culinary School Perho while Helsinki Vocational College and Lapland Tourism College are acting as domestic partners. The project is carried out with the International CHASE Network, which consists of 22 hospitality and catering colleges around Europe. Most of the colleges act both as a sending and a receiving partner. The Network has been operating for 25 years and represents a wide range of different language and cultural areas. From the gastronomic point of view, the colleges represent traditional European regional gastronomy. Gaining know-how and skills from the traditional European gastronomy strengthens the participants\u2019 possibilities for employment and success in labor market.The participants of the project are teachers and primary and upper secondary based students, who study a vocational qualification. The two-year project provides 40 students with the possibility of 4-5 months exchange and 14 teachers with 12 days, and 2 teachers with 5 weeks training abroad. The student exchange consists of a 4 -week language and cultural training in the host college and of on-the-job learning. During the exchange period the students learn skills needed in the internationalizing working life in addition to the professional skills. International work skills include different languages, networking and acting in a multicultural environment as well as different working cultures and customs. The skills and learning outcomes acquired abroad are validated and recognized as part of the qualification. The project makes use of Europass Certificate Supplement, Europass CV and Europass Mobility Document.The teacher training abroad strengthens professional skills and international competences. Teacher exchanges aim to take place in the same restaurants, where the students are placed. This will strengthen the assessment know-how in the work placements towards the ECVET-principles. The assessment documents tested in the previous project will be developed further. The teacher exchange takes place, when the students start their on-the-job learning. Teachers familiarize the staff in the work placement with the vocational skills demonstrations and the assessment targets such as the knowledge, the skills and the  competence of the student. The teacher organizes the vocational skills demonstration assessment via Skype in the end of the student\u2019s on-the-job leaning.In the annual collaboration meeting The CHASE network agreed on a common project theme ECVET.

This project provides College Level 3 apprentices with a 3 week European work-placement that will enhance and improve their practical skills and knowledge in the vocational areas of Motor Vehicle and Mechanic, Chefs and Beauty Therapy.  It will also build there self as-teem and confidence as the target group are apprentices who are hard to reach and disadvantaged.The Motor Mechanic apprentices will be under taking a work placement in high quality garages in France.   On top of their placement within the UK as a requirement of their core programme, these European placements will further give learners the opportunity to develop a range of skills and techniques, personal skills and attributes essential for successful performance in working life.   Their personal development will be further enhanced by this European perspective to allow contrasts, comparisons and incremental learning to take place. (TRAINING PLANS ARE ATATCHED)The apprentices that will be participating in this project come from very rural country areas where job opportunities are very limited and the competition for jobs that are advertised is very intense.  The aim of this project proposal in the chosen vocation areas through apprentice mobilities is to enable participants gain new skills and knowledge that make them more competitive in seeking and gaining employment in the labour market.  The placement is tailored to the apprentices NVQ course.  The project will find out what the young person wants to get out of the placement, which skills they want to develop, what barriers they face and what their career aspirations are.  The majority of apprentices participating in this project come from areas of high levels social deprivation where opportunities are very limited.  From the College experience these apprentices are hard to reach out to and in many cases have low self-motivation, low self-esteem and lack a lot of confidence in their own abilities in being able to access new opportunities.  The aim of this project is to provide not only an opportunity for apprentices to gain new skills but also to raise their aspirations and have a European work-placement and experience that will be life changing.  This project aims to emphasise to apprentices the tremendous opportunity and scope the European union offers in terms of labour market and job opportunities and being able to have the confidence to work in different countries as a result of new language.  The project aims to provide a mobility experience for groups of apprentices who due to financial factors do not get the chance for learning through exchange.  In addition to the vocational training and skills development that apprentices will acquire, they will also gain new and more updated vocational and customer service skills, better communication skills, more improved teamwork and problem solving abilities and genuine practical life experience will result from mobility.  With regard to skills gaps apprentices need to be more flexible in their attitude, require enhanced motivation and the wider work based learning experiences that a European placement provides.For apprentices from relatively disadvantaged backgrounds and prone to risk of leaving College early and whose basic skills require nurturing, project involvement will significantly contribute to improving attainment, enhancing employability, broadening horizons and creating an energy and enthusiasm for learning.  This project will develop partnerships between education and employment that significantly contribute to the development of key competences and transversal skills relevant to labour market requirements.  Similarly it will enhance and reiterate the award winning international dimension of the College, (winner of the 2012 British Council Further Education International Collaboration Award) all of which mirror the specific objectives of the Erasmus+ programme.  For example it reflects fully the aims of mobility by supporting apprentices in the acquisition of competences, (knowledge, skills and attitudes), \u2022with a view to improving personal development and employability throughout Europe.  It will also raise the apprentice\u2019s awareness and understanding of other cultures, facilitating the acquisition of international contacts so important in a global world.

Mobility projects have always been significant in motivating the learners, raising the quality of VET, enhancing international activities and in overall development of RTRIT.  \r\nInitiated by National Agency, developed by RTRIT, Internationalization strategy 2016-2020  structures the further plans and international development paths of the school. This project application is developed based on two essential documents - Internationalization strategy and VET Mobility Charter. \r\nOne of the targets of international development is to create new partnerships, and this project aims to involve several new partners. Organization CHASE (Consortium of Hotel and Accommodation Schools of Europe) continues it development by involving new partners who are able to fulfill quality criteria and are accepted in internal voting thus tourism and hotel school of Netherlands has joined the CHASE. RTRIT has plans to realize two student mobility to Netherlands within this project. Besides the partner from Netherlands, RTRIT has made contacts and plans mobility to new partners in Spain, Slovenia, Lithuania and Malta. \r\nThe title of the project \u201cChange the world - start with yourself\" is continuance of previous project \"To change the world, you have to start with yourself\" yet this project aims to address the participants more directly, to challenge them to start the positive change, and to put emphasis on development of individual participant and his/her further input in the development of organization. \r\nMobilities that have significant role in international development of RTRIT, are to be carried out in this project as described in the internationalization strategy. \r\n1) Long term mobilities of qualification training for last year students will be realized within CHASE. CHASE members have mutually agreed upon exchange of the learners, quality measures of training programs, and the most important - February 2017  member schools of organization (19) will start development of new training evaluation system that will be fully compatible with education systems working with ECVET. Mobility trainings realized within this project will be evaluated by the newly developed system. \r\n2) 2-5 week long mobilities for various training programs in different sectors and host organizations.  \r\n3) Mobilities addressing the needs of learners who are facing learning difficulties, losing learning motivation or are on the edge to be disclosed of voluntary leaving the education process.  In cooperation with partner-schools from Kaunas and Tartu mobility programs are specially designed to strengthen personality, develop social and communication skills, and raise learning motivation. These mobilities involve necessary accompanying persons that will support learners practically and mentally during the mobility. \r\n4) Mobility of teachers and staff involving a) development of professional skills that will be used in further work after mobility, b) demonstration of skills and sharing experience to rise the status or the school in on international level, and c) developing and strengthening of new partnerships for further cooperation and future mobilities. \r\nTaking into account descriptive evaluation of mobility charter, number of participants is adjusted, excluding the participants that will be funded by own means.

Foreign partners represent a broad range of languages and cultures and are reliable actors (many of them AEHT members). Gastronomic diversity is well taken into account when establishing the network. The colleges of the network represent traditional regional gastronomy. This gives students and staff a good opportunity to deepen their own gastronomy and customer service expertise.

The Internationalization strategy is seen as a strengthening of the vision and contributes to the understanding and respect of multiculturalism and diversity. In accordance with the Internationalization Strategy, students' capacity for internationalization and mobility is promoted and the organization's level of expertise is increased. Our mission is to educate qualified and multi-skilled service professionals in a borderless and digitalized learning environment, which also promotes sustainable development, internationality and entrepreneurship. International mobilities are included in the student's Personal Competence Development Plans (HOKS). The iPerho e-learning campus, which is being developed during the project, supports and enables the students' individual learning paths to be realized. All students have a Personal Competence Development Plan (HOKS), which is updated during the studies. A module for international exchange serving students will be built for the campus, where the student receives information about the exchange and where the services are provided digitally, for example chat, blogs and guidance. The module works as a connecting contact platform where students can exchange experiences with each other and receive guidance. The iPerho e-learning campus will provide modules for core subjects, that students can also complete abroad, which speeds up their graduation. The on-the-job learning teacher is pedagogically present at the iPerho e-learning campus, where communication, guidance and evaluation will be documented.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the National Consortium is to produce a common process for the international Personal Competence Development Plan in accordance with the legislation on the reform of vocational education and training. The implementation and evaluation of HOKS will be ensured by Advance Planning Visits.\r\n\r\nThe international network's assessment competence (materials, guidance, evaluation and evaluation documentation) is guided in the directions required by Ecvet and the reform of vocational education,  especially taking into account the Learning Agreement for student's personal learning objectives and in particular ensuring their realization.

Tis project aims to involve several new partners \u2013 Vilnius Tourism and commerce school, organization \u201cnew service\u201d (Italy), and Vocational School of Mantova (Italy). Cooperation with school from Slovenia, that was started within the previous project \u201cChange the world \u2013 start with yourself\u201d Nr.2017-1-LV01-KA116-035386 with staff mobility, is continued with two long term mobilities of students within this project. \r\nAccording to quality assessment of Erasmus+ 2017 project mobilities, cooperation with IES TIRANT LO BLANC (Spain) and Alytaus (Lithuania) is continued within this project. Staff mobility to Malta, planned in previous project, is not carried out as of the moment of this application; as well the communication about possible student mobilities have not been fruitful, therefore cooperation with Malta is not included in this application. \r\nParticipants with fewer opportunities will be involved in various mobilities, including long term. RTRIT is involved in various projects aimed to support learners with fewer opportunities, those of social, economic risk or lack of family support and to reduce number of early school leavers. For this project it opens opportunity to identify risk group and fewer opportunity youngsters and to invite them as participants. There are also students with special needs who have positive learning results and will be involved in international mobility. \r\nFollowing mobilities that have significant role in international development of RTRIT, are to be carried out in this project as described in the internationalization strategy:\r\n1) Long term mobilities of qualification training for last year students. CHASE network have mutually agreed upon exchange of the learners, quality measures of training programs, and developed training evaluation system for catering and hospitality fields according to ECVET that will be fully compatible with education systems working with ECVET. Mobility trainings realized within this project will be evaluated by the newly developed system.\r\n2) 3-5 week long mobilities for various training programs in different sectors and host organizations.  Mobility flows in Denmark are carried out as modules of education programs. Learning outcomes are assessed by ECVET tools and are recognized in RTRIT.  Also 4-week mobilities to Kaunas and 3-week to Tartu VEC will be done as modules and assessed by ECVET.  \r\n3) 2 week Mobilities addressing the needs of learners who are facing learning difficulties, losing learning motivation or are on the edge to be disclosed of voluntary leaving the education process.  In cooperation with partner-schools from Kaunas and Tartu mobility programs are specially designed to strengthen personality, develop social and communication skills, and raise learning motivation. These mobilities involve necessary accompanying persons that will support learners practically and mentally during the mobility. Considering previous experience these mobilities will be carried out in smaller groups. \r\n4) Mobility of teachers and staff involving a) development of professional skills that will be used in further work after mobility, b) demonstration of skills and sharing experience to rise the status or the school in on international level.\r\n5) In order to renew cooperation with Turkish school, that was inactive due to internal political situation, and carry our Erasmus PRO mobilities, one advance planning visit will be carried out for staff member who is involved in preparing outgoing mobilities. \r\nTotal number of learners to be involved in mobility is planned according to the VET Mobility Charter and composes ~5% of total number of learners in RTRIT.
