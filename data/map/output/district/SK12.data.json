Already the schools have investigated and discussed how they can achieve more with less teacher intervention and control. The schools are all part of the Kunskapsskolan network and as such have access to a range of pedagogical practices and approaches that encourage students to take responsibility for their learning. \r\nTraditionally more academic pathways in  post 16 phases become focused on content and direct instruction. They can become divorced for the reality of the career paths that they may aspire to.\r\nWe are building on early discussions this year in Science and now want to expand the learning by training teachers in maths and Modern Foreign Languages.\r\nObjectives\r\n1. To build programmes that create greater agency for students in their learning\r\n2. To establish relevance in post 16 study so that students develop long term goals relevant to the modern working climate and its global opportunity\r\n3. Explore teacher efficiencies that flip learning practice from teacher to student which in so doing lead to better outcomes for students.\r\n\r\nParticipants and Profile\r\n\r\n The programme is open to 20 school in the UK that through membership of Whole Education have been developing a Kunskapsskolan inspired approach. This is complemented by a similar number of schools in the Netherlands and 5 Kunskapsgymnasier in Sweden. Each subject cohort will be limited to 20 participants\r\n\r\nProgramme and Process\r\n\r\nThe programme begins with a two-day training event for all participants where with inputs from academics and educationalists teachers explore how to bring agency, flip learning and see their subject in a real work context.. At the event teachers will peer with international colleagues who will be their peer coaches.\r\nTeachers will be given the tools for action research which they will then use over the next 18 months with their students to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies. \r\nThe supported programme over the next 18 months will include:\r\n\r\nOct:  Conference call for participants\r\nNovember: Webinar 1\r\nMarch: first part of Teacher Exchange: PEER REVIEW\r\nApril: Conference call with mentor\r\nJune                     Webinar 2\r\nOctober   Return phase of exchange: PEER REVIEW\r\nNovember:   Conference call\r\nJanuary: Presentation of ideas to school heads and leadership teams\r\nFebruary Completion of Research reports\r\nMarch: Published reports\r\nExpected Outcomes and Longer Term Benefits\r\n\r\n1. Greater student outcomes at 18/19\r\n2. Enhanced motivation leading to stronger transition to university and workplace\r\n3. Transfer of strategies from these subjects across the whole school phase.\r\n4.
