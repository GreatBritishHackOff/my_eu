The TACMON technology is innovative in that it applies electrostatic MEMS actuator technologies with a micro hydraulic amplitude transmission to realize a large matrix of tactile dots using cost-effective bath-processing technologies. There are 7.4 million visually impaired people in the European Union. High unemployment amongst the disabled is a serious social and economic problem for the EU, as continued exclusion from productive activity requires increasing state-funded support for social programs. There is a need for effective assistive technology to facilitate employment of the visually impaired and for industry to better be able to meet anti-discrimination legislation. Furthermore, the EU is investing heavily in e-learning to modernize education and training, but locking out the visually impaired since information and communication technologies are heavily oriented to visual user interfaces. The EU must quickly address the needs of sector SMEs that provide technological solutions for the disabled, as there is a continuous competitive threat from both foreign companies and large enterprises. TACMON offers SMEs an innovative technology targeting an interactive graphical tactile display and user interface for the visually impaired to access electronic information. TACMON technology can contribute to the creation of new business opportunities in software for learning, leisure, communicating via Internet, among many others for the disabled community. The TACMON product responds to important market demands in industry, education and other sectors that lack appropriate inclusive technology adaptable to meet the needs of their visually impaired clients.", 252541.0, 3369029.0, "TACMON", "An innovative touch screen for the blind", "There are 12 million blind people in the European Union. They need effective assistive technologies that can help them find employment and avoid social exclusion.", "High unemployment rates amongst blind people are a serious social and economic problem for the EU. Their exclusion from the workforce leads to social isolation, which ultimately results in higher social support costs for society. Assistive technologies can help overcome these barriers.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.tacmon.eu/new/ (TACMON) project developed an innovative and cost-effective touch screen technology that provides blind people with interactive access to both textual and graphically oriented electronic information. The system consists of three modules: a novel tactile actuator chip based on micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) technology, the driver electronics for the MEMS, including high-voltage electronics, and a pneumatic support system.\n\nIn combination with conductive elastomer technologies, MEMS technology is critical for success. MEMS allows for a large matrix of tactile dots to be produced using low-cost electrochemical bath techniques. The pneumatic support system ensures the forces on the tactile dots are maintained.\n\nSoftware specifications for this module, which is a graphical application, were specified with the help of the HyperBraille project. TACMON's research was successfully completed with a small-scale functional prototype demonstrating the viability of both the actuator technology and the other technologies required.\n\nA start-up company holding the jointly-owned TACMON intellectual property rights has been established as a platform for the further development and market introduction of the project's technology.\n\nThe current technology already offers a significant cost advantage compared to the state of the art. However, the consortium is eager to develop the technology, reduce costs and bring graphical tactile displays to the market at a price comparable to current Braille single line displays. This will help to create new opportunities for Europe's blind citizens.", "http://www.tacmon.eu/new/", "http://www.eurexcel.eu", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58175.jpg", "fp7_94826_998460868"], ["2DQ", "INNOVATIVE SMART COMPOSITE MOULDS FOR COST-EFFECTIVE MANUFACTURING OF PLASTIC AND COMPOSITE COMPONENTS", "Eurexcel Membership Projects Limited", "Currently, composite moulds are mainly used in open-mould manufacturing processes and in Light RTM (a low-pressure variation of RTM). The proposed project aims to extend the applicability of composite moulds into the more demanding regime of RTM production, as well as to extend the application of the open mould and light RTM techniques in the field of advanced resin systems, where elevated temperature is required. Most important Innovations are: i. embedded heating elements, based on the carbon reinforcement of the mould, close to the mould-part interface demanding less energy. ii. Incorporation of flow, temperature and cure sensors that will enable full automatic control of the process. iii. Layout of a cooling system consisting of a conformal (following the contour of the part) tubing network. iv. Use of piezoceramic film actuators which will induce micro-vibrations and thus assist resin flow inside the cavity. Such actuators on the edges, can be used for demoulding thus reducing tool complexity and demoulding time. Integration of these functionalities into a single \u201csmart\u201d mould is anticipated to impart a significant advancement of the composite and plastics manufacturing industry. It is obvious that by lowering the cost of the moulds the application of high end composites into the sectors of aerospace and automotive industry widens, serving weight reduction and the greening of the transport sector while extending the use of composites in other industrial sectors such as leisure and sport, the energy sector etc. Managing to develop composite moulds for the demanding RTM field, would automatically make them available for other manufacturing processes for engineering plastics and composites (RIM, Transfer moulding, Resin Infusion).

The moulds have conventionally been made of metal. Composite moulds are gaining ground, but primarily in manufacturing processes with relatively mild conditions. In order to increase the temperature capabilities of the composite moulds so as to tap new markets, important advances in mould technology are required.\n\nA large European consortium launched the EU-funded http://www.coeus-titan.eu/ (COEUS-TITAN) (Innovative smart composite moulds for cost-effective manufacturing of plastic and composite components) project to develop needed technology.\n\nFor heating the mould and its contents, scientists embedded conductive carbon fibres close to the surface of the mould among a number of nano-doped layers having high thermal conductivity. This ensures maximum heat transfer to the resin to reduce energy consumption. The team also developed flow, temperature and cure sensors to enable fully automated process control in combination with analysis tools for process parameter optimisation.\n\nA novel cooling system consisted of a network of channels that followed the contour of the part. Heat transfer fluid circulated through the channels to absorb heat from the system. Two different piezoelectric actuators were evaluated for their ability to enhance resin flow based on electrically induced micro-vibrations. Finally, a new metallic coating based on nanofillers and mineral fillers improved chemical resistance to the resins and facilitated repair in case of damage.\n\nThe final tooling integrated all developed technologies and tested them in an experimental infusion protocol. Further optimisation is expected to lead to a breakthrough in smart composite mould design and extension of moulding capabilities.\n\nManufacturers will be able to use the cost-effective mould technology in the demanding environment of resin transfer moulding. This technique is increasingly used to produce smooth components with large surface areas and complex shapes such as those required by the aerospace sector. It will also enable the use of advanced resins that require higher temperatures in conventional moulding processes.
