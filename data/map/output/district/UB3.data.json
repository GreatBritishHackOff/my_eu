The EU only produces 4.1 % of the total world ethanol, the US has become in recent years the biggest ethanol producer in the world with 48% of the world total and more than two fifths of the global fuel ethanol supply was produced in Brazil in 2006. The major different types of biofuels are between first and second generation biofuels. First generation biofuels are made from food crop feed stocks while second generation biofuels are made from cellulosic biomass. The primary pathway for producing bioethanol fuels from lignocellulosci biomass is biochemical conversion (acid hydrolysis which is an expensive procedure and produce low yields 10 to 40% and enzymatic hydrolysis but unfortunately cellulose is difficult to digest, produce low yields &lt;20% and take 2 days, in addition although research is continuously improving this process, at present biochemical conversion is not been proven at industrial scale). The project concept involves development of a multipurpose prototype for the reaction of various types of cellulosic biomass on a continuous or batched basis using microwave plasma or combined microwave plasma and chemical/enzyme hydrolysis. This technology will breakdown the cellulose molecule structures and allow an efficient (90% yield efficiency) and rapid release of the sugars for the fermentation reaction (&lt;1/2 day). In addition, by using microwave plasma we will use 10 times less energy, chemicals, infrastructure accessories and solvents making the conversion of cellulosic biomass into bio-ethanol an economical procedure.", 258895.0, 1192770.0, "MICROGRASS", null, null, null, "http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/BLT/BEST/RFM/micrograss/index.htm", "http://www.tmd.co.uk", null, "fp7_107794_967062356"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1DD", "F.I.D.A.T.I. - Fostering Innovative Didactic and Active Training Initiatives in VET", "The British International School", 41134.0, "The current Italian working and education scenario requires, more than ever, a strong reflection on training methodologies and content. The competitiveness of the labor market, the high rate of youth unemployment (15-29 years), particularly in Campania, where it reaches a striking 46% (ISTAT 2014) and the need to be ahead of the competition which has become global, pose new challenges for both students, who are increasingly uncertain about the school to choose and their future, and teachers, called to respond to the changes of our time with updated competences and more effective teaching methods.\r\nThe project F.I.D.A.T.I. - Fostering Innovative Didactic and Active Training Initiatives in VET -aims at increasing the skills of ITT \"Basilio Focaccia\" through collaboration with other European countries, using this opportunity to establish new international partnerships and, at the same time, strengthen the relationship with local companies, with the objective of a constant improvement of teachers and staff competences and, finally, to improve the competences of the recipients of the transmission of knowledge and know-how: the students of the Institute.\r\n\r\nThe FIDATI project has the following objectives:\r\n1. establishing cooperative relationships with educational institutions (Finland and the United Kingdom) for the exchange of best practices in innovative teaching, through peer learning activities and job shadowing, planned to improve the teaching of vocational subjects of the Institute;\r\n2. acquiring innovative methodologies for the training workshop, encouraging active learning of learners (discovery, action, problem solving);\r\n3. promote and intensify the internationalization of vocational training, enhancing language skills in a second foreign language teachers and encouraging the acquisition of intercultural mediation tools of both the teaching and the administrative staff;\r\n4. strengthening management and IT skills of the Institute staff, through the adoption of methodologies and tools to optimize cost and time management;\r\n5. testing methodologies for the validation of learning outcomes through the application of the quality circle ECVET and the recognition of credits;\r\n6. fostering the creation of national and international networks and strengthening the relationship between professional training and business, encouraging more participation in mobility projects.\r\n\r\nParticipants will be 20 among teachers and ATA, selected according to the following criteria: motivation; ex-ante evaluation of the candidates competences for mobility and assessment of the possible post-mobility impact level within the Institute.\r\n\r\nMain planned activities:\r\nsetting up an information desk operated by the project coordinator and a support team (European Mobility Desk - EMD); developing a communication plan of the project; mobility planning; assessment of the candidates competences; identification of individual learning objectives; consultation with the project partners for the attribution of ECVET credits according to learning units; signing the Learning Agreement; provision of preparatory training; phase of mobility: the job shadowing training activities will be carried out from December 2017 to March 2018 as planned (10 participants for Finland and 10 for United Kingdom); validation and certification of credits accrued during mobility; communication and dissemination of results; assessment of educational activities; assessment of the level of effectiveness and efficiency of the administration processes of the Institute; thematic workshops.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n- Networking with national and international educational institutions in Finland and the UK;\r\n- Innovation of teaching and methods laboratorial, capacity building and intercultural relationships, use of European instruments such as Europass Language Passport;\r\n- Improving the assessment for the validation of formal, informal and non-formal compentences and testing ECVET for the allocation and transfer of credits;\r\n- Expansion of the management and administrative compentences through the use of ICT tools;\r\n- Consolidation and development of foreign language skills;\r\n- Strengthening of opportunities for professional and career development.\r\nThe impact in the short and medium term will cover primarily the teachers and staff participating in the action of mobility, which will improve their teaching and management skills to be activated in their daily practice. It will also create a \"cascade\" effect: participating teachers and staff will extent among colleagues the results of job shadowing, transferring and systematizing within the management and teaching processes the competences acquired during the period of mobility, in order to increase and harmonize the compentences of the entire staff of the Institute.", "http://www.thebis.com/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT02-KA101-035636_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "UB3"}
