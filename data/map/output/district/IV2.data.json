The ocean is a complex working environment, relatively little is known about it and it is widely used by others, such as fishing, shipping and recreation. However, the prize for introducing ocean energy generation is high, estimated by DG MARE, at 380GW.\nCurrently, several member states and regions are funding ocean energy research, demonstration, technology and innovation (RTDI). There is a shared goal to generate knowledge about the marine environment and to speed the development of this emerging sector. However these research efforts are not coordinated. This is why the member states are proposing the Ocean Energy ERA-NET as outlined in this paper. The ERA-NET will provide a framework for transnational joint activities and will cooperate with the EERA Ocean Energy Joint Programme; other relevant European projects and industry stakeholders.\nThis wide reaching ERA-NET brings together 16 partners from nine member states intent on gaining the benefits of coordinated research funding. Member States have different levels of engagement in the ocean energy sector, and it is important that the ERA-NET actions reflect this. The objective is to improve the quality, scope and fragmentation of research through better networks, addressing common barriers and improving coordination. The proposal sets out the execution of the project from networking and information sharing to the launch of, at least one, transnational joint call. In doing so the partners will develop a shared vision for the sector, an action plan for delivery and a toolkit for call administration. The result will be reduced fragmentation in research funding, development and wider uptake of good practice and support for the commercialisation of the ocean energy sector.", 58756.0, 2111418.0, "OCEANERA-NET", null, null, null, null, "http://www.waveenergyscotland.co.uk", null, "fp7_111295_911770222"], ["7GF", "UK150330_Support to the provision of services Enhancing the innovation managementcapacities of SMEs by the Enterprise Europe Network in 2014", "Highlands & Islands Enterprise", "The overall aim is to ensure that Scottish SMEs with international innovation and growth ambitions are empowered by unlocking their full growth potential through better internal innovation management capability.    \n\nThe underpinning objective of this proposal is therefore to pilot the development of a quality and workable Enterprise Europe Network delivery service in Scotland that supports SMEs to increase their innovation management capacity and to innovate successfully and profitably.
