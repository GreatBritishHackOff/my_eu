The increasing variability of both generation and loads will also require more sophisticated and decentralized decision making.\nThe RESILIENT project aims to design, develop, install and assess the energy and environmental benefits of a new integrated concept of interconnectivity between buildings, DER, grids and other networks at a district level. The RESILIENT approach will combine different innovative technologies including smart ICT components, optimized energy generation and storage technologies, also for RES, integrated to provide real time accounts of energy demand and supply at a district level and assist in decision-making  process.\nThe project strategy relies on a comprehensive R&D and demonstration approach. The proposed integrated concept will be first modelled and simulated for different typologies of buildings and different climates and then installed, monitored and evaluated in three pilot projects (including residential and non residential buildings) in the UK, Belgium and Italy.  These demonstrators will be used to assess the energy and environmental benefits of the new integrated concept and also to validate models and technologies in order for the concept to be easily replicable throughout different climatic areas.\nThe major impact from RESILIENT will be the development of a complete value chain where the annual primary energy demand of buildings collated at a district level is decreased by at least 20% compared to their expected energy performance summed on an individual building basis, this energy gain being associated with a decrease of more than 20% of the CO2 emission reference level.", 262242.0, 6369186.0, "RESILIENT", "Smart local energy management", "EU-funded scientists are seeking effective methods to manage all the phases related to energy production, transformation and distribution.", "Currently, remarkable efforts are being devoted to integrate fossil with renewable energy (RE) sources in a bid to achieve higher RE shares and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. However, growing investments in distributed energy resources (mainly RE sources) call for new ways to handle the increased diversity and complexity of energy management. Along with these, more sophisticated and decentralised decision making is also needed to cope with variable energy generation and load profiles.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, scientists initiated the EU-funded project 'Coupling renewable, storage and ICTs, for low carbon intelligent energy management at district level' (http://www.resilient-project.eu/ (RESILIENT)). The project's innovative concept is based on interconnecting buildings, distributed energy resources, grids and other networks to ultimately assess the associated energy and environmental benefits.\n\nScientists aim to efficiently manage and correlate different energy sources and energy storage technologies. In particular, RESILIENT leverages combined heat and power units and RE technologies such as wind turbines, photovoltaic panels and solar thermal collectors. It also combines heating networks for energy distribution, thermal or electrical storage technologies, and an energy management system for providing real-time accounts of energy demand and supply. Based on these, RESILIENT greatly assists in decision making. Specifically, it controls the time to operate each energy resource, the power levels, the time to store energy and the priority loads.\n\nScientists have hitherto developed tools for simulating thermal and electrical grids, and developed thermal, electrical and heat models for buildings. A combined statistic and stochastic approach has been used to calculate the generated loads for each building. Activities related to further increasing the modelling capabilities of the present library functions are still ongoing. These will be used to simulate the RESILIENT pilot projects and adapt models to the specific characteristics of the demonstration sites.\n\nThe integrated concept will be installed and validated in three pilot projects in Belgium, Italy and the United Kingdom. These demonstrators will be used to assess the energy and environmental benefits and to validate models and technologies to apply them afterwards throughout Europe.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2015/149535.jpg", "fp7_104392_953871617"], ["4BX", "More than color: Applying nanotechnologies for the multifunctional ceramic pigments development", "Performance Masterbatches Limited", "The change in automobile and construction materials requirements has led industries to the\nmodification of bulk materials with nanoparticulate additives or to the application of later high\nperformance coatings in their materials to obtain better, cleaner, cheaper, faster and smarter\nproducts [1].

The rationale that underlies Pentagon approach is that multi-vector smart districts can be the key enablers of future smart grids, provided their flexibility capabilities are augmented with adequate energy conversion technologies. To this end, Pentagon will deliver two key technology assets: a highly efficient power-to-gas installation sized for coupling with typical district heating plants and a multi-vector multi-scale district energy management platform for the combined monitoring and management of all district energy carriers. The power-to-gas technology will achieve a 15 to 25% energy gain compared to state-of-the-art performances. The multi-vector multi-scale district energy management platform will achieve 15 to 20% more flexibility at district-level, allowing for a 25% increase of renewable penetration, by leveraging building and district power to heat conversion capabilities. These impacts will be thoroughly assessed through an iterative validation and demonstration roadmap that will start with lab-scale individual component testing, continue with a focused deployment in district-scale experimental facilities, and conclude with a wider simulation-based assessment at distribution grid level that will rely on a real smart district from a project partner.
