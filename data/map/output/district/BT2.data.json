Seventeen national and regional funding agencies in 13 countries participated. The call for proposals attracted 117 pre-proposals, of which 21 multinational projects from 14 countries were funded.\n\nWith the strong commitment of the funding organisations, the project employed a European Commission top-up funding scheme in which EU money filled funding gaps of the other agencies. A total of EUR\u00a014.5 million was budgeted, representing a regional contribution of EUR\u00a010 million and a European Commission financial contribution of EUR\u00a04.5 million.\n\nProject members combined national and regional programmes in basic science with applied research and related industrial development in materials science and engineering.

This reinforcement may be at the maximum measured by the post-mobility realization that they are capable. Firstly, at the conclusion of the course, the internship, the PAP and any modules that are lagging behind with assiduity, creativity and motivation. Secondly, pursuing studies in your first option or entering the job market in your area and with working conditions that give you stability and the possibility to learn and progress.\r\n\r\nAt the level of the group, we seek greater visibility, recognition and appreciation of the public educational service provided by the group, in particular vocational training and a greater capacity to identify support and opportunities for students, extending the perspective to the European level. To these it necessarily corresponds an improvement and diversification of the formative offer, resulting from the learning with the European realities and the world of work with which we will contact.\r\n\r\nFor the target groups, the focus is mainly on the approximation of European education and training policies, on the visibility of the Erasmus + program, on raising awareness of European values, identity and space, on re-evaluating training, and on informal and non-formal learning, lifelong forms of social and cultural information flow.\r\n\r\nConsidering the characterization of the Municipality of Arouca and the region, in terms of schooling, occupation and economic sectors, it becomes clear how each more qualified young person benefits the business fabric.

This possibility began with training in Customer Service before we extended this first to include Administration  and later Commerce, before our 4th project in Commerce, oriented towards the English-speaking and today those who speak Spanish.\r\nIn the interval, when a teacher involved in Erasmus+ projects has left our School, the recruitment of a replacement has always been the opportunity for the staff to renew its commitment to this aspect of school-life, and for 2016/17 a Business/Commerce teacher has integrated the staff and will be accredited to teach the two disciplines in both French and English.\r\nWe have found this Erasmus+ experience particularly rewarding for pupils: it develops self-reliance, the students are more confident, and as a result they become more open to others: their environment is spontaneous, and they are constantly solicited. In today's disturbed national & international contexts which favour division and where students \"find their marks\" only with difficulty, activities in relation to Erasmus+ have taken on real meaning, given that knowledge of others leads to understanding. In the present case, prejudices are abandoned in this period of apprenticeship, which has a regulating effect on inequality and fraternity.\r\nWe are well aware of our students' need for a better understanding of the Europeans around them, and also the growing importance of professional opportunities for young people in this part of the world.\r\nSo the aims of those participating are on the one hand to improve their language skills and the ability to relate to others, and on the other hand to be open to other ways of life so as to be able to absorb cultures that are different from their own.\r\nMost of our young people come from differing, mainly modest sociocultural backgrounds, and the majority have had a fragile education by the time they join our High School; this translates into students who have incomplete apprenticeships and a lack of confidence in themselves.\r\nIn the academic year 2016/17, 13 students in their second year of study for their professional diploma \"Bac Pro ARCU / GA\" will profit from the Erasmus+ experience in Belfast, while 4 students taking our \"Bac Pro Commerce\" course will be staying in Seville for 4 weeks in March. These visits follow immersion periods in English and Spanish conducted by an outside training organisation, and in which they can prepare this important stay.\r\nAs in previous years, a partner in the corresponding country is chosen; the partner's local knowledge ideally allows us to list appropriate companies and families that correspond to the participants' profiles.\r\nAccording to our terms of reference, participants' visits include: accommodation in a host family ; work-experience lasting four weeks in a business (one student per department or business depending on the size of the company); and planned cultural visits.\r\nAt the end of their stay, students (and their foreign tutors) receive questionnaires to complete, and each Erasmus+ project is the subject of a written review from our partners which highlights the strong points and notes those which need improvement. Remarks made by the National Agency in their report are carefully analysed, and the whole is representative of the systematic reflexion given to projects before we modify, adjust and develop future ones.\r\nFor our students, this experience goes beyond simply crossing borders: it is a real challenge to be met, and our students take pride in this. The confidence they have acquired is reinvested in a growth phase that leads to success (often in the form of further, postgraduate education), giving value to their professional studies in high school and resulting in recognition by their peers. It is an experience that allows these students to count on a \"Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel\" diploma with European honours, namely EUROPRO and EUROPASS, two distinctions that are also synonymous with quality in the eyes of the businesses that they join later.\r\nErasmus+ project experience continues to prove that this is an undeniable bridge from professional to higher education due to the fact that the confidence acquired by these young people opens perspectives of a future that they thought to be out of reach. It also testifies to their adaptability when faced with the requirements of the world of employment.\r\nToday the St. Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise school is recognized for the seriousness of its commitments to European projects. This is a strongpoint that will be highlighted on our website, particularly on Open Days and in forums dealing with career opportunities. \r\nBoth of the latter add value to the notion of professional education as a means to success.\r\nOur students are the best ambassadors of this experience.", "http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk  ", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036058_2"], ["8LA", "PROYECTO EUROPA \"JULIAN SANZ DEL R\u00cdO\" III", "Precept IT Limited", 103178.0, "PROYECTO EUROPA III is the third edition of a project led by the City Council of Soria as project leader.The City Council, aware of the importance of young people in the sustainable development of the city, has determined the need of maintain the focus on them.

They will help local communities to gain new knowledge and experience of the project activities, as well as a greater European awareness through their contact with young Europeans.  It is hoped that there will be increased health and wellbeing for all involved in the activities.", "http://www.volunteernow.co.uk", "Bryson Charitable Group", "erasmus_2017-3-UK01-KA105-046400_8"], ["8LA", "OVERCOME - formarsi per il lavoro futuro", "Precept IT Limited", 192560.0, "\"Overcome\" is going to implement the strategic plan for internationalization dell'IIS Sarrocchi in the version of January 2015 (see page 76 of PTOF), considering transnational placements as a key tool to \"contribute to the promotion of a genuine European labor market\" (03.10.2014 of the Council Recommendation on a quality Framework for traineeships) in which:\r\n- The skills of the outgoing students respond to the real needs of local and international companies;\r\nThe skills of their staff are constantly updated and permeated by a European and intercultural dimension\r\n\r\nThrough the project, the Institute will develop the following two macro-activities for the realization of its strategy of internationalization:\r\nmobility for a period of 37 days internship for 80 students of classes IV of the mechanical and mechatronic sector, computer, electrical, electronic and electrotechnical, chemical companies in the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Malta. Possible areas of performance and LO have been identified by the partners mentioned in the relevant sections C. This action will respond to the strategy of improving the quality of training and prepare students adequately for entering into the job market or university; enhance the certification of skills in the informal sector (see training); improve the personal growth of the individual paths.\r\ninternational mobility for a period of nine days for 7 teachers and expert in guidance and mentoring in international training centers in the UK and Malta. This action will respond to the strategy of enabling a new way of \"doing school\" through the continuous training of teachers and technical staff of the school; raise the quality of mobility experiences of the students and their certification of skills.\r\nBoth macro-actions will contribute to achieving the objective of consolidating the local network, regional and international level between the worlds of education and employment.\r\nSince the implementation of the internationalization plan in 2015 the Sarrocchi Institute established the relationships with training centers and international companies, (eg Foyle, Cap Ulysse) and created new contacts with companies able to identify the quality of training paths in accordance with the professional figures in output by the Institute. The Institute has consolidated relationships with local companies, available to participate in the candidate selection process and moments of the final evaluation of the project and its impact.\r\nFinally Sarrocchi identified the alternating training of teachers in tutoring and counseling for 2018-2019, supplementary to the mobility actions.\r\nThe project management actions correspond to established practices as:\r\n- Signing of the MOU for single professionals;\r\n- Information and selection of candidates and staff through the procedures included in the request for Vet Charter. For staff the selection criteria are as follows: experiences related to international mobility 50%, 20% language skills, 30% motivation and ability to impact at the return.\r\nDefinition of LA in collaboration with international partners\r\n- Mobilities for students and staff as following flows:\r\n25-06/ 2018: 25 students in UK, 10 students in France\r\n01-10/ 2018:  4 staff in UK and 3 staff in Malta\r\n24-06/ 2019:  15 students in UK and 15 students in Malta\r\n02-09/2019:   15 students in Spain\r\nEvaluation of the results, recognition and certification of skills and ECVET points. Development of Europass certificates and review of CV for students and staff.\r\n- Dissemination, project evaluation and impact by developing a survey to gather feedback from students and the participating staff mobility to be used to reprogram and center more accurately other mobility initiatives\r\nThere is no change of purpose than envisaged in the strategy of internationalization. Primary goal is to improve the professional skills, language and key to all the participants. Secondary objective is to improve the practices and the educational offer of the school.\r\nIt confirms both the learning objectives for individuals and for the Institute strategies and its international partners. The numbers of participants in mobility have been expanded: 80 students and 7 staff.\r\nIt was predicted 5 leaders (1 for flow) for 10 days to facilitate the insertion of the students in the company and especially to facilitate their first contact with the international environment and intercultural aspects, according with new styles and customs.", "http://www.PreceptIT.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005744_9"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["8GA", "Specialist Employment Programme", "ACTION ON HEARING LOSS", null, "ESF", 566041.24, 870832.68, "esf_ni_8"], ["7FE", "Young Persons Employment Initiative", "BRYSON CHARITABLE GROUP", null, "ESF", 552742.0, 850372.0, "esf_ni_31"], ["7DB", "CO-MENT", "GEMS NI LTD", null, "ESF", 859228.0, 1321890.0, "esf_ni_34"], ["7FE", "Step Into Employment Project", "BRYSON CHARITABLE GROUP", null, "ESF", 429824.0, 661272.0, "esf_ni_49"], ["7GS", "Working Well", "NIACRO", null, "ESF", 4014640.0, 6176368.0, "esf_ni_58"], ["8GA", "Specialist Employment Programme", "ACTION ON HEARING LOSS (FORMERLY RNID)", null, "ESF", 197911.0, 494777.0, "esf_ni_73"], ["7FE", "Belfast Step into Employment Project", "BRYSON CHARITABLE GROUP", null, "ESF", 381054.0, 952636.0, "esf_ni_80"], ["7FE", "Young Persons Employment Initiative", "BRYSON CHARITABLE GROUP", null, "ESF", 213936.0, 534840.0, "esf_ni_81"], ["7DB", "CO-MENT", "GEMS NORTHERN IRELAND LTD", null, "ESF", 539848.0, 1349621.0, "esf_ni_98"], ["7AQ", "The Connect Programme", "WOMEN IN BUSINESS NI", null, "ESF", 152492.0, 381230.0, "esf_ni_130"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["8HS", "REGIONAL AGENCY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING*PHA", 185297.0, "Third programme for the Union's action in the field of health (2014-2020) (17.03.01)", "fts_2016_14784", 2016], ["7ES", "INVEST NORTHERN IRELAND*", 448533.0, "Promoting entrepreneurship and improving the competitiveness and access to markets of Union enterprises (02.02.01)", "fts_2017_1679", 2017], ["7ES", "INVEST NORTHERN IRELAND*", 65541.0, "Increasing innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (02.04.02.03)", "fts_2017_17598", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT2"}
