MATERA\\ takes advantage of the experience gained along the last 3 years in the previous transnational calls carried out in MATERA (MATERA Calls 2006, 2007 and 2008).\n\nMaterials research is one of the cornerstones of the European economy, being of high importance for the development of such fields as energy, environment, health and safety. The importance of materials can also be seen in many national and regional programmes and strategic activities where materials are one of the main focus areas. To combine these national and regional interests and to reduce the fragmentation of materials research in Europe the cooperation between the funding agencies in the ERA-NET scheme has been found very useful. There are 20 European funding agencies participating in MATERA\\ with a total amount of 17 million euros of national/regional funding.\n\nThe project consists of four Work packages: WP1 Coordination and Management, WP2 Preparation of the Joint Call, WP3 Implementation of the Joint Call, WP4 Monitoring and Impact assessment. The Call will be opened in the spring 2009. It will have two steps, Stage 1 for pre-proposals and Stage two for full proposals. The national and regional funding agencies will jointly select the pre-proposals for the second step.

To meet these challenges, coordinated effort on the part of research and industry at national and European levels is required.\n\nThe successful ERA-NET scheme for collaborative networks in European Research Areas (ERAs) has been improving the coherence of research programmes across Europe. It helps national systems work together on tasks they could not tackle efficiently in an independent way. Building on the previous Sixth Framework Programme (FP6) project MATERA, the EU-funded project 'ERA-NET Plus on materials research' (http://www.materaplus.net/ (MATERA+)) was launched to spur development of multifunctional materials, engineering structural materials and bio-based materials.\n\nMATERA+ was one of the first ERA-NET Plus projects in FP7 and also the first one for many participating funding organisations. Seventeen national and regional funding agencies in 13 countries participated. The call for proposals attracted 117 pre-proposals, of which 21 multinational projects from 14 countries were funded.\n\nWith the strong commitment of the funding organisations, the project employed a European Commission top-up funding scheme in which EU money filled funding gaps of the other agencies. A total of EUR\u00a014.5 million was budgeted, representing a regional contribution of EUR\u00a010 million and a European Commission financial contribution of EUR\u00a04.5 million.\n\nProject members combined national and regional programmes in basic science with applied research and related industrial development in materials science and engineering. The research represented an intriguing variety of cutting-edge materials such as nano-structured devices, high-strength light materials, organic materials and new fire-retardant composites.\n\nProject outcomes are slated to contribute to sustainable development, enhancing industry competitiveness and quality of life in the EU as well. The results of MATERA+ and its sub-projects will benefit many industrial sectors like the automotive, aerospace, chemicals, construction, electronics and energy sectors.\n\nThe cooperation and annual calls are a living legacy, continuing in the new M-ERA.NET project that began in 2012 and includes 36 funding organisations and partners from outside Europe.
