EMIF aims to address this by developing a common Information Framework that enables improved access to these data sources, enhancement through linkage of the different sources and collection of additional new information. EMIF will focus on two specific research objectives in order to guide the development of the Information Framework:  identification and evaluation of biomarkers i) of the risk for metabolic complications in obesity; ii) of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease onset in the preclinical and prodromal phase, which in both cases will identify high-risk individuals for future intervention trials. To achieve this, a variety of data sources ranging from small-scale information-rich disease cohorts for biomarker discovery to large EHR data for population characterisation and biomarker validation will be utilised. An extreme phenotype approach will utilise the subpopulations at the extremes of a particular trait distribution using large-scale metabolomics and proteomics for biomarker evaluation. The development of the Information Framework will involve addressing data standards, semantic interoperability as well as ethics, data privacy, legal issues and the development of an IT platform for multi data sources access. The Information Framework will be designed to support the current research objectives, but more generally studies using human health data.

To illustrate the range of complex environmental and societal issues that climate engineering raises, the EUTRACE assessment focuses on three example techniques: bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), ocean iron fertilisation (OIF), and stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI).\n\nThe main project deliverable is a report that assesses the potentials, risks and uncertainties of climate engineering technologies within the broader context of discussions on climate change, mitigation and adaptation. The document covers natural science and engineering complexities, emerging societal issues, international regulation and governance, research options, and policy development for climate engineering.\n\nThe EUTRACE report is intended to complement other national and international assessments of climate engineering, in particular by providing a distinctly European perspective that draws upon contributions from a range of academic, policy, and civil society stakeholders. It thereby can serve as a basis for future discussions between the various stakeholders that hold an interest in climate engineering research and policy making.", null, "http://www.exeter.ac.uk/", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/161076.jpg", "fp7_103896_999864555"], ["4QJ", "Integrated non-CO2 Greenhouse gas Observing System", "The University of Exeter", "InGOS will support and integrate the observing capacity of Europe for non-CO2 greenhouse gases (NCGHG: CH4, N2O, SF6, H2 and halocarbons).

Therefore, 20 organisations from 10 countries in the Caribbean along with Australia, Europe and the United States joined forces to develop sustainable management tools.\n\nThe EU-funded FORCE (Future of Reefs in a Changing Environment (FORCE): An ecosystem approach to managing Caribbean coral reefs in the face of climate change) project employed the latest scientific knowledge to develop management practices that minimise damage to reef health and stem the loss of biodiversity. Partners conducted field visits, literature reviews, experimental studies and computer-based modelling, which focused on the causes of reef loss in the Caribbean. It also charted the physical, ecological and governance processes that influence reef health.\n\nFORCE has developed a range of resources for disseminating the project's results, including a coral reef manger's handbook, a web geographic information system and the Reef Health Simulator. Throughout the project's lifetime field research on governance and livelihoods engaged with policymakers, practitioners, stakeholders and the general public.\n\nResearch activities culminated in two separate workshops for practitioners and the reef manager's handbook, providing valuable tools and information.

Two established explanations of party system fragmentation and volatility are social cleavages and institutions. However, both approaches do not sufficiently consider the role of political elites in shaping party systems. This research project therefore seeks to complement these two approaches by studying one of the most important ways through which political elites can shape party systems, namely the stability of party supply. Party supply is unstable when new parties emerge and existing parties disappear, split, merge or combine themselves into fluid electoral alliances. In order to understand how the instability in party supply affects party systems, the project asks two questions: (1) what causes the instability in party supply? (2) how does the instability in party supply affect voter behaviour and parties\u2019 electoral support? The project builds on the state-of-the-art in the literature by studying the causes and consequences of those forms of party instability that have been under-researched, namely, party splits, mergers, pre-electoral alliances and dissolutions. In addition, it also constructs an aggregate index of party instability and considers its impact on party system volatility. In order to conduct these studies, the project will build a cross-national dataset recording the instability in party supply in approximately 30 OECD and newer European democracies.

The objectives of Project MioVAT are as follows: (1) To generate a c.20 million-year record of tropical plant diversity in West Africa from the latest Oligocene to the earliest Pliocene; (2) To quantify the nature and timing of plant extinction in the Miocene of tropical west Africa; (3) To quantify the taxonomic diversity of grasses during the birth of the savannah biome in the Late Miocene using fossil pollen grains. This research is designed to investigate the long-term controls on tropical plant diversity such as global temperature, investigate the role of extinction in shaping the tropical vegetation of West Africa, and understand the biome-scale diversification history that underlies the evolutionary success of grasses.

After 48 days, the mutation rates of P.\u00a0fluorescens were examined, revealing that interactions between viruses and the rest of the soil microbial community played a minor role in driving evolution.\n\nFurther experiments between wild type and mutator bacteria in soil suggested that other factors in the soil environment could be responsible for selecting for relatively low mutation rates. These results could explain why bacteria with high mutation rates are found at relatively low frequencies in soil, but at much higher frequencies in the lab and in clinical infections. \n\nIncreased resource availability led to greater bacterial resistance to the phages, but without an attendant increase in phage infectivity or change in coevolution. This suggests that the phages may be less effective in controlling bacterial densities and communities in stable environments with high levels of resources.\n\nSOILCOEV provided valuable insights into the way in which bacteria and phages evolve together in natural environments.

We plan to advance this research in the BAMI project and will:\n\u2022 Develop a standardised method of bone marrow cell collection\n\u2022 Develop a standardised method of optimising reparative potential of bone marrow derived cells\n\u2022 Standardise bone marrow preparation procedure so that it can be universally applied\n\u2022 Standardise method of bone marrow cell delivery post AMI\n\u2022 Conduct the first large scale all-cause mortality clinical trial to test if the product and delivery method mentioned above can lead to a 25% reduction in mortality end-point at 2 years\n\nOur project will establish the therapeutic value of this approach to stem cell therapy.  Success will demonstrate that transcoronary infusion of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells is safe and will reduce the mortality rate by 25% and reduce the rehospitalisation rate by 15%.", 134677.0, 6373876.0, "BAMI", "Cell therapy for myocardial infarction", "A European consortium is testing the efficacy of a cell therapy approach for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).", "Following AMI, the necrosed area of the heart displays a limited regenerative response.

The EU-funded http://www.bami-fp7.eu/ (BAMI) (The effect of intracoronary reinfusion of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) on all-cause mortality in acute myocardial infarction) project wants to establish whether BM-MNC therapy is more beneficial than standard reperfusion therapy.\n\nThe consortium is conducting a Phase III multi-national, randomised and controlled study to demonstrate that an intracoronary infusion of autologous BM-MNC is superior compared to optimal reperfusion therapy alone. So far partners have compared different methods for bone marrow processing to deliver the desired mononuclear cell fraction. The optimal method for BM-MNC preparation has been further standardised so that it could be delivered in hospitals across the EU.\n\nIn addition, scientists have selected the best route for BM-MNC delivery. In the context of AMI, intracoronary infusion is usually employed to administer the cells since it is supported by evidence and safety data. The technique entails balloon angioplasty and cell infusion through an over-the-wire (OTW) balloon. The clinical trial will take place in eight participating countries with an additional 12 active satellite sites across Europe, which have recruited a total of 84 patients so far.\n\nTaken together, the BAMI study will provide solid evidence on the efficacy of BM-MNC therapy in patients undergoing primary angioplasty. Considering the economic losses incurred from patient sick leave or incapacity to work due to chronic disease, an improved therapeutic intervention should reduce hospitalisation and mortality rates.

Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) -also known as Free Form Fabrication and formerly Rapid Manufacturing-, is a novel fabrication method of parts directly from the electronic model by layer manufacturing, using active principles such as laser and Electron beams. Currently, ALM is the first and the best option for short series of customized products. However, layered manufacturing is not without challenges.

The objective of KARMA is to respond to above mentioned challenges with a knowledge-based engineering system (KBE) that can estimate functional properties of ALM parts automatically and in short time. The KBE system would define the optimal production parameters automatically and execute a virtual test of the fabricated part. The KBE system will include a database with characterized material and part properties for all major ALM technologies. The development of such a KBE system is a difficult and demanding task, which will involve both ALM users and companies from the final customer sectors.

The goal of this project is to consolidate efforts of European and Indian researchers with a broad range of leading expertise to create, to validate and to implement a flexible computational framework for modelling of dynamics in realistic magnetic nano-materials and complete devices. The framework will be validated via comparison of computational results against those obtained experimentally or using analytical theories.

Increased understanding in this area has important implications for ecology, evolution conservation and management\nOur lack of progress in this area is almost inevitable given the complex nature of migration. Migration is sequential in nature, meaning that an animal\u2019s state in one season is heavily influenced by previous conditions.

This also means that regulating processes and response can also be separated spatially making it even harder to identify cause. These effects are likely to be emphasized in migrants because fuelling flights and breeding also places huge physiological demands on migratory birds. Yet few studies have linked the stress incurred during migration with subsequent fitness. Integrating mechanism and function would provide very important insights into the ecology and evolution of migration.

The creation of artificial structures in magnetic materials could open the door to unforeseen properties, functionalities and applications, including magnetic field-controlled non-volatile electromagnetic devices. EU funding enabled scientists to push the frontiers of magnetism and its applications through work on the project 'Novel wave phenomena in magnetic nanostructures' (NOWAPHEN).\n\nMagnons are collective excitations of electron spin structure in a crystal lattice. Magnonic crystals, analogous to photonic crystals possessing a frequency range in which light wave propagation is forbidden (the band gap), are metamaterials that possess a periodic structure that prohibits spin wave propagation in restricted bands.\n\nNOWAPHEN scientists, through multi-lateral transfer of knowledge and expertise, conducted a plethora of innovative, proof-of-concept studies to lay the groundwork for future development of magnonic metamaterials. Their research covered fields including spintronics, magnonics, electromagnetics and microwave electronics.\n\nNumerous unprecedented results and a wealth of publications attest to the project's success. Highlights include novel characterisation methods for studying magnonic devices and magnetic properties at interfaces. Scientists discovered enhanced spin wave transmission in nanowires with a zigzag-like magnetisation state. This opens the door to utilisation of effects on propagation velocity in a velocity modulation magnonic transistor. The team also discovered a new form of magnetic anisotropy and a new class of non-reciprocal spin wave phenomena inherent to metallised magnonic crystals.\n\nMagnonics and magneto-photonics are at the forefront of a new era of discovery and magnetic devices with wave control in solids far beyond that offered by photonics and plasmonics.

Consequently, improving our understanding of (i) the vertical and lateral translocation of SOC by erosion as well as its stability and (ii) the coupled effects of land use change on SOC 3 dimensional distribution becomes an important issue.

The results of these empirical modeling will be compared with dynamical process-based models results, such as SPEROS-C.

Wide bandgap optical materials, such as a-SiC:H, when exposed to moderate ion doses develop useful optical contrast between regions of different irradiation levels. Absorption coefficient change of 1-2 orders of magnitude can be achieved by ion bombardment with chemically active species, like Ga\\. The optical contrast formation mechanism is based on the ion beam induced structural and chemical modification of the implanted material, leading to considerable optical band-gap decrease and hence optical absorption increase. Furthermore, high-resolution digital (or analog) features of about 10 nm minimum size can be generated using focused ion beams (FIB), leading potentially to ultra-high storage densities.

Recent findings suggest that protozoan predation could increase pathogen virulence because bacterial defensive adaptations can correlate positively with bacterial ability to harm hosts. Yet, protozoan predation could also decrease bacterial virulence if increased allocation to anti-predatory traits is traded off with pathogen virulence. Thus, different type of protozoa could select for different anti-predatory adaptations which have opposite consequences for the evolution of bacterial virulence. Selection by other enemies such as phages (parasitic viruses) or abiotic environment could also select for bacterial traits that have correlated effects on pathogen virulence.

The central assumption is that FBOs tend to fill the gap left after the supposed withdrawal of the welfare state in several domains of public life, particularly in social welfare and in social protection. At first sight, this looks like a return to the charity of former times, when such associations occupied the fore of social help in many countries.

What is the position of FBOs in combating poverty and other forms of social distress cities? How has this role changed over time and how do these activities contribute to combating social exclusion and promoting social cohesion? What are the implications for policies and the governance of European cities?  From both scientific and policy perspectives, there is a great need for better empirical and comparative data on what is going on in European cites in matters of poverty and exclusion policies and, in particular, the contribution of FBOs in the reduction (or deepening) of the problems.

Project members highlighted the need for better empirical and comparative data on these issues and ways in which FBOs contribute to alleviating such problems.\n\nResearch was conducted in 21 cities in seven countries, and concentrated on FBOs that are active in combating social exclusion. Income inequality and relative poverty have both risen over the last 20 years, offering an opportunity for FBOs to fill in the gap between supply of and demand for welfare provisions.\n\nResearch findings covered areas relevant to the 'welfare society', how the faith identity of an FBO influences its work and outlook. An examination of poverty and exclusion highlighted the fact that poverty scenarios have a lot in common given that they are often the result of fairly similar processes. Among other findings, FACIT researchers noted the case of United Kingdom as probably the best illustration of the impact of welfare state retrenchment on poverty and social exclusion and, subsequently, the role of FBOs in combating these social ills. Another finding was that most FBOs focus on community-oriented functions, characterised by a common pattern of working with those 'beyond the fringes of society'.\n\nthe participation of many organisations points to the potential for major impact of the project's research efforts. The impact can be described in terms of increased visibility for FBOs and their activities, higher political sensitivity for their position and role and better service provision towards beneficiaries.

There is, for example, increasing evidence for transgenerational effects of paternal stress levels with consequences on offspring health. In most cases, the proximate mechanism mediating these paternal effects on offspring remains unknown. \nRecent studies show that these transgenerational effects might be mediated, at least in part, by telomere attrition. Telomeres are regions of non-coding DNA at the end of eukaryotic chromosomes. Telomeres shorten at each cell division or when cells are exposed to oxidative stress, resulting in telomere shortening with aging. A permanent arrest in the cell cycle occurs when telomeres are shortened to a critical length, thereby increasing risk factors in a large number of diseases. Consequently, telomere length predicts remaining lifespan, with individuals with the shortest telomeres displaying the poorest survival prospects.\nTelomeres are very sensitive to damage induced by oxidative stress and paternal exposure to stressors may thus affect telomere length in sperm before fertilization as well as inherited by the offspring, with consequences for aging and disease susceptibility. \nIn this project, I propose to test this hypothesis by examining the three following aims using a captive population of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata):\n\u2022 Measure the effect of stress exposure on sperm telomere length through an experimental manipulation of stress levels at the time of sperm production.\n\u2022 Determine links between paternal sperm telomere length and offspring telomere length at birth using artificial insemination experiments.\n\u2022 Elucidate the effects of sperm telomere length on offspring development and disease susceptibility.", 171639.0, 171639.0, "TELOSPERM", null, null, null, null, "http://www.exeter.ac.uk/", null, "h2020_208898_999864555"], ["4QJ", "Average - Transaction Costs and Risk Management during the First Globalization (Sixteenth-Eighteenth Centuries)", "The University of Exeter", "This project focuses on the historical analysis of institutions and their impact on economic development through the investigation of a legal instrument \u2013 general average (GA) \u2013 which underpins maritime trade by redistributing damages\u2019 costs across all interested parties.

This project will concentrate on Schizophrenia (SZ), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), and Major Depression (MD), as these disorders share part of their symptomatology, in particular social withdrawal and certain cognitive deficits, such as deficits in attention, working memory and sensory processing. By applying innovative technologies (e.g. EEG, cognitive tasks, (f)MRI, smartphone monitoring, and (epi-)genetics) to deep phenotype a clinical cohort of SZ and AD patients combined with a wider analysis of existing clinical data sets from major European and global disease cohorts that also include MD, we will define a set of quantifiable biological parameters best able to cluster and differentiate SZ, AD, and MD patients that do, or do not, exhibit social withdrawal. First, by mining large European SZ, AD and MD cohort datasets with already available social and cognitive proxy measures, and, second, by obtaining objective measures of social exploration levels (using a novel smartphone application), phenotypic relationships with social and cognitive measures will be further tested. For instance we might predict that socially withdrawn individuals may have lower cognitive functioning and poorer clinical course compared to those who are more socially engaged. The two approaches will then come together via selected individuals with low or high social withdrawal who have also been assessed in the deep phenotyping study using integrated behavioural, cognitive, attentional, sensory processing, EEG, and MRI data.\nIn phase I of the project (years 1-3), the clinical deep phenotyping study will provide a proof-of-concept analysis for this quantitative biological approach and will concentrate on SZ and AD patients. To identify shared genetic factors potentially related to the social withdrawal symptom and cognitive deficits observed in these disorders, a cross-disorder genome-wide genetic analysis will be performed in the largest world-wide available samples of SZ, AD, and MD patients. Genetic associations from the global cohorts will be evaluated for their relevance for social withdrawal and cognitive deficits in subsamples with relevant (proxy) phenotypes in large and available European cohorts that have genetic data and clinical proxy data on social withdrawal, sensory processing, attention and working memory available.

SA mutations (that benefit one sex but lower fitness of the other) are proposed to arise in a partially sex-linked (pseudo-autosomal region, or PAR) gene, and establish polymorphisms. To reduce the conflict between the sexes, suppressed recombination between X and Y chromosomes then evolves (unless sex-specific expression evolves first). The guppy is ideal for studying this hypothesis because SA polymorphisms are well documented: male coloration phenotypes make males attractive to females, but also make them conspicuous to predators (while females gain no compensating benefit). Moreover, guppies have a recombination-suppressed sex-linked region that carries multiple coloration genes, yet is thought to have evolved recently. However, no non-Y-linked coloration factor has yet been mapped, and the genetics is complicated by modifers making some XX individuals male, and by male-specific expression of some phenotypes. I will map coloration genes and identify PAR genes using DNA-based markers to take account of these problems.

To face this challenge, the AWESoMeStars project will develop a comprehensive, physical picture of the evolution of stellar rotation, magnetic activity, mass loss, and accretion.\n   In doing so, we will\n(1) Discover how stars lose the vast majority of their angular momentum, which happens in the accretion phase\n(2) Explain the observed rotation-activity relationship and saturation in terms of the evolution of magnetic properties & coronal physics\n(3) Characterize coronal heating and mass loss across the full range of mass & age\n(4) Explain the Skumanich (1972) relationship and distributions of spin rates observed in young clusters & old field stars\n(5) Develop physics-based gyrochronology as a tool for using rotation rates to constrain stellar ages.\n   We will accomplish these goals using a fundamentally new and multi-faceted approach, which combines the power of multi-dimensional MHD simulations with long-timescale rotational-evolution models. Specifically, we will develop a next generation of MHD simulations of both star-disk interactions and stellar winds, to model stars over the full range of mass & age, and to characterize how magnetically active stars impact their environments.

In addition, the wave energy converter technology to be deployed in the project has already been tested and proven in real conditions in Scotland.\n\nThe ultimate purpose of the CEFOW is to increase the speed of wave power development, decrease the levelised cost of ocean energy by improving technical solutions used for multiple device system, and create an efficient supply chain to support larger wave power projects in the future. To reach these targets, the CEFOW consortium will improve the wave energy converter performance by 50% and raise its availability to 70%; develop new types of dynamic mooring and electrical connections suitable for multi-device deployment and deploy 3MW (three 1MW units) wave energy converters in real world offshore conditions in a grid-connected testing environment. In addition, CEFOW will study the feasibility of on-board and on-shore storage solutions and conduct thorough multi-year environmental, health and safety studies.\n\nThe consortium spans the full value chain from research organisations to wave converter technology developers, marine service providers and a large multinational utility company as the operator.", 225644.0, 20837560.0, "CEFOW", null, null, null, null, "http://www.exeter.ac.uk/", null, "h2020_195136_999864555"], ["4QJ", "Structure \u2013 Oxidative Stress relationships of metal oxide nanoparticles in the aquatic environment", "The University of Exeter", "The SOS-Nano project will address one of the most pressing cutting edge issues of econanotoxicology at present: to find a structural property of nanoparticles (NPs) to predict their potential toxicity in real aquatic environments, the final sink of released NPs.

In this sense, as an IB school, in accordance with our European school profile, we could make an even greater contribution to a European dimension of education in the following ways: firstly, entrance for our graduates into all the European institutions of higher education would be made much easier. Secondly, students as well as teachers would be able to actively participate in European intercultural dialogue through access to the IB network. Thirdly, our school would be able to gain valuable experience and insight into European educational standards and pass them onto other schools in our region.", "http://www.exe-coll.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-AT01-KA101-004906_7"], ["8NN", "Die kontinuierliche Integration von bilingualen Projekten und MINT-Modulen in die Unterrichts- und Freizeitgestaltung unseres Ganztagsschulbetriebs - eine Herausforderung mit europ\u00e4ischer Tragweite.", "St James School", 7000.0, "The Carl-Friedrich-von-Siemens-Gymnasium is a grammar school undergoing a reconstruction process right now. In this way it reacts to social and school political changes influenceing both, the economic situation as well as the infrastructure of our area. Our  institution is establishing a three-pillar-specialisation to better promote our students' strength and react to their special education needs. Therefore, the Carl-Friedrich-von-Siemens-school decided to become a whole-day-school. In the long run the school wants to offer a specialisation in three fields: in the bilingual and MINT-sector and in arts / literature. Our vision is that in the near future, students entering grade 7 and their parents can decide in which field they want to be promoted intensively.This reconstruction process is a huge challenge not only for the students and their parents but also for the teachers. In order to realize our long-term-goals we have introduced a bilingual and a MINT-module as well as one module for arts and literataure in all classes. Our teachers have realized an enormous professional training need in bilingual and MINT teaching. They are very motivated to put this reconstruction into practise but feel that they need more knowledge to opimize teaching and learning processes.When it comes to our whole-day-school system we are trying to find well-balanced school rhythms which are appropriate, harmonious and healthy at the same time. In this field, too, we are in a permanent optiminzation process. We develop ideas and methods to further develop our students' individual and independent learning processes.Therefore, we decided to define these three sectors: bilingual teaching, MINT and the whole-day-school system to be the prior teacher training focus at the Carl-Friedrich-von-Siemens-school. Our aim is to find on the one hand precise answers to questions we have collected in these fields and on the other hand to extend our experiences in these fields within the European context.We want to send six committed teachers who have already been very intensively involved in one of these three sectors to our formder Comenius-partner schools. These are the Dronninglund grammar school in Denmark, the St. James school in Exeter, Great Britain and the Lopez Neyra secondary school in Cordoba, Spain. Our project participants will attend lessons of different classes there, study their school curricula, get to know and analyze different test and examen forms and they will take part in conferences so that they will find answers to our questions and develop ideas that will be adapted to our specific school situation and needs.After the project abroad, the participants will be multiplicators and inform the teachers of their corresponding departments about their experiences and their results. After that, possibilities will be discussed how these could be adapted to our students and our school situation in a functional way. In this way not only the teachers who were sent abroad but all the teaching staff and hence especially our students will benefit from this teacher training program. We expect optimization possibilities in the whole-day-school system as well as enriching ideas how to build up a well functioning bilingual sector. Furthermore, we are keen on strengthening the MINT sector with cross-field projects within every day teaching and after-school workshops.The language skills of the participants should not be forgotten. Our project participants will improve their language skills which directly influences their teaching.

These mobility schemes will revolve around three main lines : \r\n- The professionnal line (involving 4 weeks of work placement in a host company leading to a qualification) which will be recognised with the Europass diploma.\r\n- The cultural line (which will be taken care of through a complete immersion for the students within host families, a programme of organised tours of the Capital City of the host country and of the host area as well as a programme of cultural exchanges with young Europeans through sports and recreational activities).\r\n- The linguistic aspect (accommodation in host families which will give the opportunity of sharing daily activities with them, a specific linguistic training aiming at mobility will be implemented, this training will hinge upon DNL courses (Non linguistic courses, that is various subjects taught in a foreign language).

The specific professional skill alone is not sufficient unless it is supported by the mastery of key competences, in particular as concern the communication in foreign languages, the digital competence, <learning to learn>, sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, intercultural awareness. The project aims at offering the operators of the future some training opportunities which can strengthen these skills. This will be realized through preparatory activities and the mobility during summer 2017; the mobility will last 5 weeks, being the first one of preparation and the other 4 of full-time work experience in companies in Austria (Vienna), France (Paris), Lithuania (Vilnius), UK (Liverpool, Brighton , Reading, Torquay) and Spain (Valencia). The choice has been made taking into account the offer of various but complementary typologies of tourism, and the impact that the IT development has on this particular economic segment.

Provide participants with practical training through the 3 months-stay in businesses in Italy, Portugal or the UK, thus enabling the Technician qualification through recognition of the stay by the form of Training at Work or FCT. These stays will be developed between March and June 2019. \r\n- Improvement of their language skills: Learning and/or improvement of one or more languages (Italian / Portuguese / English): general knowledge and technical information relating to their professional field.\r\n- Improvement of Professional Skills: Participants acquire skills and abilities terminals set in the training program placement module, which enable them to carry out their profession. Development of a set of capabilities or skills necessary for incorporation into the workforce.\r\n- Improvement of Cultural and Personal Skills: It is, in many cases, the first experience and stay abroad, which implies personal maturity. To live in a multicultural environment, involves the acquisition of a spirit of adaptation to different social-cultural as well as a huge cultural enrichment. \r\n- Promote and encourage VET innovation and internationalization.\r\n\r\nConfebask has been participating for over 15 years in European mobility projects, with a baggage accumulated over 1600 participants so that vocational students are concerned.

The Spanish school has nearly 4 years of experience using CLIL to teach Science and Art and Crafts, whereas the Latvian school has some less experience. The experience from the British school will also be incredibly beneficial for both the Latvian and the Spanish school as teachers will get the chance to witness other ways of teaching Science, Maths as well as other Curriculum subjects through English in actual native English contexts. \r\nTo be able to carry out this Project, we will first create a common blog where teachers will upload all the relevant experiences they have as well as resources that they use throughout its development. Moreover, teachers who take part in the project will design a set of didactic units around a certain Project and which they will also apply in the actual classroom situation. Accordingly, we will arrange a number of 1 week stays in our partners\u00b4countries during which pupils and teachers will be provided with the opportunity to integrate into the normal school day of the host country.\r\nIt goes without saying that these joint project work events will allow both pupils and teachers to work on one common topic of mutual interest for a term. These Projects would revolve around topics related to the host country. Therefore, both pupils and teachers from the three schools would be carrying out the same project in the term during which the stays take place.\r\nt is worth highlighting that thanks to these stays and Projects, children will acquire skills not just on the areas on which the project would be focus but also, in terms of teamwork with children from other European countries, intellectual learning, usage of ICT, and so on. Similarly, these stays would be an actual \"eye-opener\" for children towards other cultures and ways of life. In addition, the fact that children come from cultures which are so different from each other, will mean that the impact would be even bigger. On top of that, pupils will significantly enhance their fluency and language usage when it comes to using their English.\r\n\r\nWe are actually fully convinced that through this project, teachers will also learn how to approach CLIL from different angles, Spanish teachers particularly will gain some first-hand experience teaching Maths and Numeracy in English, applying new ways of dealing with heterogeneous classes and using ICT with a wide range of purposes. Throughout and after this project, teachers will be able to come up with more stimulating activities which promote a memorable learning experience for their students.\r\n\r\nAfter winding up the project, all the teachers will disseminate the blog where they have uploaded all the CLIL resources and experiences through the local and regional educational authorities as well as e-twinning.

Although the shift towards commercial small-scale entreprises has been identified as the most important professional outcome of the extensive funding and job- cuts in the post-2008 archaeological world in UK for example (according to studies conducted by the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists - CIFA; formerly IFA) there is currently little emphasis on increasing the awareness of archaeology students towards the great diversity of entrepreneurial, skill-based career opportunities in archaeology, and no university programmes in UK and Europe with a formal curriculum on the subject. Thus, although archaeology is traditionally taught in many universities in Europe, only few graduates are aware of their great potential in providing specific specialist skills within an entrepreneurial framework; therefore, they find insertion in the traditional job market to be very difficult and only few of them are able to develop successful careers in archaeology.\r\n \r\nAmong the causes that led to the identified problem are:\r\n-  poor opportunities for sharing know-how among research-active staff involved in educating students and for collaboration with other institutions employing qualified personnel in the field of archaeology;\r\n- shortage of good practice models in archaeology aimed at developing entrepreneurship among young people and of working tools for the acquisition and recognition of skills and competences acquired in an archaeological field school at European level;\r\n- low level of international and interdisciplinary collaboration in archaeology among teachers, researchers or students.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe aim of our project is the creation, adoption and promotion of a coherent model of nonformal and informal learning, and the development of cross-border competences and of professional and transferable transversal skills for the European students within the framework of the archaeological field school at Sarmizegetusa, in order to facilitate the achievement of entrepreneurial awareness and practical experience useful in student mobility within a trans-European professional labour market.\r\n \r\nOur objectives are:\r\n1.

There are growing calls for universities to be more socially relevant and responsible by addressing the needs of society, both locally and globally. In recent years, the concept of the \u201cthird mission\u201d has become popularised, referring to the social, enterprise, and innovative activities that universities perform in addition to core teaching and research tasks.\r\n\r\nIt is increasingly accepted that universities, when well-connected with their communities, can be a vehicle for making healthier, culturally richer and more interesting places to live, work and study. Globally, more and more universities are integrating social responsibility into their mission statements, including those for research and teaching, arguing that higher education is improved when it gives back to the society that is responsible for funding it. Indeed, University Social Responsibility has become a core mission of many higher education institutions around the world.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nThe central aim of this proposal is to share experience and know-how of relationships between European Universities and their civic societies and to use this as the basis for a series of innovative pilot projects in each partner city. \r\n\r\nWe want to understand how Higher Education Institutions can respond to what their local community really needs and perform or broker research with and for communities, in a demand-driven way. \r\n\r\nFinally, we want to drive institution-wide commitment to co-production of knowledge and innovation through social engagement and citizen-led research, where the experience and expertise of individuals, communities and civic organisations is recognised, used and valued.\r\n\r\nProfile of participants:\r\nThis project will bring together universities, their local authority partners, community members, Civil Society Organisations and engagement practitioners, through stakeholder involvement, and participation in case studies and pilot projects in each Partner City.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nWe will conduct a review of the different models of community university partnerships such as front-door (e.g. science shops), embedded and networked partnerships. We will aim to define the processes, structures and governance which best nurture successful partnerships and identify facilitating and hindering factors which influence the collaboration process. We will explore the different approaches currently being used to include underrepresented social groups and ethnic minorities in the engagement approach and consider opportunities for improving equity throughout all stages of the collaborative process. We will also review the methods used by universities to capture and evaluate impact from community university partnerships, and aim to try to understand which indicators different stakeholders such as community partners and policymakers find useful in measuring the success of engagement activities. \r\n\r\nWe will use a case study methodology, to explore successful examples of community university partnerships in each Partner city, understanding what works and why, and measuring the impact of the projects, using interviews, documentation (of reports, course progression etc.) and observations.\r\n\r\nOur findings will then be used to inform the co-design of a community-led Pilot Project in each Partner city, each of which will be evaluated for factors such as impact, inclusion and transferability. \r\n\r\nFinally, to aid dissemination, the lessons will be made available in a variety of formats within a Toolkit which will help universities to identify opportunities to undertake, and scale-up successful citizen-driven approaches. \r\n\r\nResults and impact:\r\nThe immediate outcome of this project will be enriched knowledge and understanding of the myriad ways in which universities can engage with their communities in order to become more embedded in, and responsive to, the needs of their local city and society.\r\n\r\nPotential longer term benefits:\r\nIn the longer term, lessons learned will enhance the relevance and impact of trans-disciplinary engaged research into societal issues (e.g. health and wellbeing & sustainability) by helping researchers to engage with the right people using the most appropriate approach, ensuring equity throughout the engagement, and understand and respond to the nature and quality of relationships which develop.", "http://www.ex.ac.uk", "THE UNIVERSITY OF EXETER", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA203-048046_coordinator"], ["4QJ", "The Rainbow Years (Mid Life Skills Review)", "THE UNIVERSITY OF EXETER", 206233.0, "Europe is currently facing a demographic crisis, with a shrinking workforce coupled with increased demands for social services. The labour force in Europe is projected to decrease by an average of two million every year between 2010 and 2030. This represents a loss of 1% of its current size per year for 20 years. Yet, in many countries, most workers still retire (relatively) early. They often do so not because they want to, but because they feel compelled to (or) that they do not have other options. Solutions need to be found to make work more sustainable, and to extend working lives in order to avoid old-age poverty and to reduce state expenditure on pensions and welfare. (Changing places: Mid-career review and internal mobility, Eurofound Report January 2017)\r\n\r\nRecent OECD research has highlighted that there are many millions of adults in Europe with low levels of functional literacy and/or numeracy skills and that the majority of these are in employment (OECD Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) 2016). This has negative implications for their employment potential and longer term career prospects.\r\n\r\nThe concept of the Mid Life Career Review (MLCR) is one which is gradually gaining favour in many countries and the role of social partners in both lobbying for and delivering elements of this is one that could be critical to its success (Eurofound 2017). A MLCR is a holistic engagement designed to cover many topics such as retirement planning, finance, pensions and central to all models of a MLCR - skills. \r\n\r\nIn the UK John Cridland\u2019s very new report on pensions (published 23 March 2017) includes a recommendation to have a mid-life 'MOT' at 50 for skills and pensions.

This network will support its members and share ideas and experience.\r\n\r\nAs well as a new suite of materials and in keeping with the European priority for prioritising the recognition of skills and qualifications, we will accredit learning through a new online digital badge and explore linking this into the Europass CV Programme. Badging of this kind is increasingly valued and is an innovation which the lead partner has some existing expertise in using. \r\n\r\nWe will gain further sustainable impacts by: delivering a series of events in each partner country to highlight the new materials and support available; developing a series of employee case studies to highlight some of the positive outcomes from the mid-life skills reviews e.g. progression, promotion, career change etc; and building on or utilising existing learner tracking systems to carry out a longitudinal study of the impact of mid-life skills reviews (going beyond the length of the project) which will focus on 3 key perspectives: workplaces/reviewers/employees.\r\n\r\nThe partners have been selected as all have existing close working relationships with trade unions and all have significant experience in working in the adult education and skills sector.

The consortium consists of industrial partners (Nokia Networks, Lufthansa, Torbay Hospital, AachenMuenchener, BMW, Lego) and academics who share a concern with the question:How do we improve on current I&E teaching, coaching and training?While many organizations offer courses that focus on I&E we know these often fail to stimulate a step change in student abilities.  Learners know they should act, but training does not enable this and whilst they gain considerable \u2018explicit\u2019 knowledge, they fail with \u2018TACIT\u2019 element that helps them to apply it.  We suggest this is partly due to the mode of delivery and there is a need for new and innovative approaches that embrace learning as a generative iteration of knowledge and knowing through doing, making and relating:\u2022 recognise different modes of learning; for many practitioners classroom style approaches do not work effectively\u2022 promote experiential learning offering different ways of closing the learning cycle between theory and practice\u2022 create skills-based learning placing emphasis on what individuals in organizations can actually do rather than focusing only on structures and processes to enable innovation\u2022 assure practice-based learning: allowing capability development through experimentation and prototyping\u2022 build on core I&E principles around which individuals configure solutions to work in their own corporate contextThe objective of this project is to combine the efforts of business and university educators to create new learner-centred teaching methods, open up new learning opportunities and develop the practical application of entrepreneurial skills.

The schools have worked together to construct this project because the issues they are all dealing with on a day to day basis, are all connected through an overarching local, regional, national and international concern regarding social inclusion and the potential harmful impact it can have on school, local communities and national agenda. Through face to face meetings and joint cooperation the project encompasses a range of different schools in varying contexts and with a mixture of experience in international projects and leadership experiences. Collectively, this project aims at addressing the following aims and objectives:Aims:\u2022         to have a clear understanding of our own school values within the cultural context of our own region, country and European          dimension\u2022         to explore leadership vision, values and moral purpose - its communication, delivery and impact; reflected through the          curriculum, school ethos and embedded practice\u2022         to understand how schools can influence their community to bring about change so that it can reflect the culture          developed in the school of inclusive practice, social equity and improved life chances for all\u2022         to prepare students for life in modern EU by embedding an innovative values led school culture.Objectives:1.     to understand our own fundamental national values (British and Lithuanian)2.    to reflect upon these values, discuss their implications to develop and celebrate their similarities and differences and meet        the challenges within our schools of :\u2022         Cultural intolerance\u2022         Immigrants and refugees\u2022         Deprivation factors\u2022         Radicalization\u2022         National religious foundation.         Social exclusion.         Special educational needs\u2022         External pressures from government and society3.  to build a cohesive and structured approach to dealing with the above issues in our own schools and local         communities and develop a truly inclusive school ethos, culture and practice.4.  to understand and address the leadership issues connected with these challenges.5.  to develop our own national curricular to meet the challenges in an age appropriate way.6.  to understand the best approach to curriculum development and change; developing ethos and culture; understanding and      articulating moral culture. In doing so answer:       - how to communicate these ideas to all school/community stake holders?       - how we enable the facilitation of students own understanding and practice?We intend to adapt a range of activities and best practice methodology to achieve these aims and objectives to supply school leaders in the project and globally with the tools and resources, confidence and drive to aid  harmonious school and local communities. These include:1. Transnational meetings, 2. Charter of European common school leadership values: 3. Fundamental Lithuanian/British values mapped across the curriculum: 4. Co-design and attend a training course to support school leaders understand and build values driven schools:5. Case studies from each school based on a relevant issue of inclusion for their school: 6. Established protocols to enable effective inter-visitations to observe action and impact in practice:7. Transnational cooperation through e'twinning and broader teacher, class, student interaction established between partner schools. 8. Promotion of student voice in all schools: 9.Share ideas of working more closely within the local community to raise the profile of inclusive practice.The impact of this project is far reaching not only for the schools involved but significantly for all schools facing issues of social inclusion and equity.
