The presence of foreign students is about 10% with over 10 different nationalities: this target represents a daily challenge for teachers who work to ensure their right to education, integration in the classroom and in the community group, imagining the school as a center of extra-curricular aggregation. To the high component of foreign students we have to add all children with learning difficulties, who in our school are about 80. In addition, the Institute presents the need to innovate the teaching / learning processes in order to reach an effective personalization, articulated not only on lectures, but on cooperative learning, problem-based learning, labs, cooperative learning and bilingualism in particular in the Language and Science departments. Finally, given the need to play a role as a cultural reference and socializing point, as well as educational, it is essential to restructure the school management in order to maintain a constant relationship with the students, with families and with the territory so that we can monitor the real needs of the community.\r\n\r\nWith IMAGINE we have therefore identified three areas for improvement:\r\n1. INCLUSION / EARLY SCHOOL LEAVING / EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS\r\n2. METHODOLOGY INNOVATION IN TEACHING STEM AND LANGUAGES\r\n3. MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\nThe general objectives of the project are:\r\n- Improve the ability to structure the training offer to the needs of the least advantaged, with specific reference to the acquisition of skills in the inclusion field;\r\n- Modernize teaching methodologies through the development of EU-wide approach\r\n- promote improvements in the quality, innovation and internationalization\r\n- Improve the ability of participants to determine changes in terms of modernization and internationalization of the school.\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are:\r\n- Acquire operational tools and observe methodologies, to replicate in the class context, that will help in including the SEN pupils and in fighting early school leaving (eg. with the peer mediation), reinforcing the motivation to study and  ensuring the educational success through operational tools such as Mobile Technology and Music, reaching full inclusion of all students.\r\n- Incorporate into daily teaching new teaching methods of language and STEM such as learning-centered education, problem-based learning, cooperative learning, peer education, learning by doing and, for linguistic disciplines, the Bilengual Education.\r\n- Share and learn, observing and discussing with stakeholders, the best practices of the British educational system and other EU systems with particular reference to the aspects of quality management, development strategies and evaluation systems.\r\n\r\nThe project is structured into three general stages: preparation, implementation and evaluation / dissemination / follow up. The preparation phase will include the linguistic and intercultural preparation, on security procedures, as well as on logistics and content-related topics to be addressed during the mobility. The implementation phase involves 20 mobility flows to be organized during 16 months, of which 6 training courses and 14 Job Shadowing involving teachers, Headteacher and the General Accountant in partnership with schools and host training institutions.\r\n\r\nIMAGINE aims at achieving a significant impact in terms of learning outcomes, both in terms of skills acquired and new international, open-to-Europe attitudes and mindset, both at the individual and organisation levels.\r\n\r\nThe final and continous evaluation is a fundamental moment of our project, in order to understand whether and to what extent the objectives and expected results were achieved. The evaluation activities are planned, therefore, in different moments of the project:\r\n- At the end of each mobility\r\n- At the end of the project\r\nThese activities include the use of descriptive / qualitative indicators and quantitative indicators which allow to assess and describe whether the project has achieved the expected results in objectively measurable terms.", "http://www.furnessacademy.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT02-KA101-036098_2"], ["9BB", "E.IN.ST.E.I.N. - Efficient and INnovative management STrategies, English language Improvement and work-based learning: 3 milestoNes for school development", "FURNESS ACADEMIES TRUST", 35153.0, "The project \"E.IN.ST.E.I.N. - Efficient and innovative management STrategies, English language Improvement and work-based learning: three milestones for school development\" is proposed dall'IISS Calamatta of Civitavecchia, in partnership with Furness Academy (UK) and Winnova (Finland).\r\n\r\nThe proposal is based on the knowledge that it is now necessary to innovate management methods and school organization management, in particular by focusing on shared leadership as a virtuous model and, therefore, to train the school staff to apply this. In addition, the internationalization that is the basis of our strategic development plan can not do without an improvement of language skills and the adoption of CLIL method for the non linguistic subjects. Finally, EINSTEIN promoters  believe that in order for the Alternance School/Work and the work-based learning to really help to meet the challenges of employability in a labor market increasingly segmented and specialized, it is necessary to deal with other European educational institutions in order to learn good practices of work-based learning organization, in particular in relation to the Technical Nautical branch, which is one of the areas on which the territorial and national economy is based.\r\n\r\nFollowing the three considerations just described and the needs analysis, EINSTEIN aims at meeting 3 general objectives:\r\n1. Internationalizing the educational offer\r\n2. Make the school management more efficient, dynamic and innovative\r\n3. Improving work-based learning practices in order to reduce the mismatch of skills and really make it functional for employability, with particular reference to the Nautical branch\r\n\r\nThese macro objectives can then be focused on more specific goals that we aim to achieve through the proposed mobility plan. These specific objectives are:\r\n- Empowerment of English language skills for the school governance people (Headteacher and Accountancy General Director) and for non-linguistic subject teachers who want to start the CLIL method implementation. For these latter, starting a gradual adoption of CLIL in non-language teaching is an objective to reach, too;\r\n- Allowing the school managers and teachers with functional responsibility roles to experience new European models of governance, organization and management of educational institutions inspired by the shared leadership and a functional human resources management, with specific reference to the relationship between educational and management areas;\r\n- Convey knowledge, methods of analysis and action to leadership and management support tools (planning, design, evaluation), enhancing the planning and problem solving, to promote and to flexibly manage change and pursuing efficiently and effectively the objectives which the school structure is stressed, appealing appearance motivation of the human resources\r\n- Restructure the organizational system of the work based learning in the Nautical branch, enabling the participating teachers to get competences that will help them to build an alternance school/work that can give the students the key elements to successfully entering the labour market, directing them towards the most requested skills from companies.\r\n\r\nTo meet to the identified needs and achieve the objectives described above, EINSTEIN is structured into 3 general stages:\r\n1. preparation, considered as preparation of the project but also as a preparation of each participant to the mobility experience\r\n2. implementation, including two types of mobility:\r\n- N. 10 training courses aimed at the empowerment of the English language and the CLIL methodology for non linguistic teachers, Headteacher and Accountancy General Director;\r\n- N. 7 job shadowing, which will lasts one week, 5 of which are aimed at the acquisition of management skills and management of human resources at the Furness Academy in the UK, while 2 of them will be focused on the observation of good practices of work based learning and alternance school/work in the Nautical branch. This job shadowing is aimed at allowing to compare and acquire of operative tools to make the alternance school/work as most effective as possible, related to employability.\r\n3. assessment / certification of skills / dissemination and follow up\r\n\r\nUpon completion of training, participants will have acquired new knowledge and skills to stimulate progresses in the modernization and innovation of the organization as a whole, making the most of individual strengths. Given the involvement of the top management of the Institute and of the teachers who will be then assigned management responsibility government functions within the school functional organization, we believe that EINSTEIN will help create a more modern, dynamic, committed and professional learning environment, thanks to the integration of best practices and new methods in daily activities and the opening of synergies with the training institutions and partner schools, which hopefully will lead to future projects.", "http://www.furnessacademy.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT02-KA101-036139_1"], ["9BB", "F.L.A.S.H. + - Foreign Languages and methodological innovation as an Asset for ScHool development", "FURNESS ACADEMIES TRUST", 35481.0, "The FLASH + Foreign Languages and methodological innovation as an Asset for ScHool development project has been designed to meet the following needs:\r\n1. A poor linguistic competence (English and French) of teachers who have expressed their intention to work within the operational group for the development of the European dimension and EU projects;\r\n2. Difficulty to adapt to the teaching systems of the partner schools emerged during the development of the various Erasmus projects in which our school has been involved. These difficulties concerned the different methods of teaching, relationship with the pupils, time and class management, of reconciliation of life and work times. We consider it essential, in order to improve our international dimension, to establish relationships with cutting-edge schools such as the two partner schools, in countries where the two main vehicular languages are spoken - and on which we focused the first linguistic empowerment action - from which we can learn a lot both in terms of managing international projects and in relation to the didactic approaches adopted.\r\n\r\nThis needs analysis has resulted in the preparation of FLASH +, which therefore aims to achieve the following general objectives:\r\n\r\n- to promote quality improvements, innovation excellence and internationalization, in particular through enhanced and deepened transnational cooperation with our European partners, which allows us to understand methodologies and approaches, overcoming the difficulties encountered thanks to the comparison on the field;\r\n- improve the capacity of the teachers participating in the mobility project and part of the \"Erasmus +\" working group to determine changes in terms of modernization and international openness of our school;\r\n\r\nand to achieve the following specific objectives:\r\n- improve the linguistic competence and intercultural awareness of a specific target group of teachers interested in deepening European cooperation;\r\n- improve the understanding of the functioning of the school system in the partner schools, so as to reduce the remaining rigidities in the teaching approach and overcome the difficulties of cooperation found in the previous international projects of the Institute\r\n- learn new teaching methods and classroom management, innovative teaching practices that lead to greater integration of European good practice in daily teaching, with particular focus on new teaching methods devoted to personalization / individualization, cooperative learning, learning based on real problems, peer education and other educational innovations to be integrated into curricular programs\r\n- improve the skills of the teachers directly involved in the Erasmus + Working Group in relation to the quality of the preparation, implementation, monitoring and follow-up of EU projects\r\n- reach a substantial sharing by the teaching body of the Institute that allows the adoption of a bottom-top approach.\r\n\r\nThe project involves 13 units of teaching staff in 19 mobility, including 11 job shadowing and 8 training courses. These teachers are those who, following a transparent and participatory selection procedure, have shown a greater motivation to follow a path of internationalization and modernization of their skills, who are part of the working group \"Erasmus +\". Job shadowing will take place in the UK and Belgium in schools with which cooperation is already consolidated as part of the various partnership networks of the institute; the training courses will take place in the UK and France.\r\n\r\nThe expected impact is, for the participants,  a general consolidation of linguistic and methodological skills, greater familiarity and authonomy in the management of international relations, overcoming the barrier due to poor language skills and communication difficulties, acquisition of new methods devoted to personalization / individualization, cooperative learning, problem-based learning, peer education and other educational innovations. For the institute, a greater sharing by the teaching staff of the internationalization process, greater ability to manage and plan quality EU projects, reinforcing cooperation with partners and integrating their good practices, certifying the learning outcomes and systematize the professional development of the staff. This impact will bring long-term benefits to our school and will generate a broad multiplier effect by integrating with existing projects and fostering the creation of new projects in the Erasmus + and other EU programs.", "http://www.furnessacademy.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT02-KA101-047682_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LA13"}
