The project builds on the knowledge and experiences of both Breakthrough Foundation and Think Forward and looks to answer and unpack the question: how do I become a youth leader or youth worker? The project works on a variety of levels, that include innovation, theory to practice and experiential learning. It follows two professional personal development models for young leaders and those new to youth work, that explore pathways and progression to become a youth worker. One called \u2018Cultivate\u2019, a leadership training programme built around UK Youth Achievement Awards Platinum, and the other the Dutch model \u2018Effective Youth Leadership Badges\u2019, that is based on the work and the models identified by Stephen Covey.\r\nP2YL will be realised through two distinct activities, with the first acting as both an introduction to the main themes of the seminar, and a self exploration of what the participants already know and how they can grow as youth leaders.\r\nThe second activity will be fine tuning the leadership skills and identifying ways in which to apply them. We\u2019ll also provide the participants with the knowledge and opportunities to realise their own projects (e.g. youth exchanges and other local projects in their communities), as another opportunity to apply their learning and develop their youth work practice. In addition to this, we will also support participants to work towards the Council of Europe's Youth Work Portfolio and of course Youthpass.\r\n\r\nMain Aim:\r\nThis long-term training project aims to offer a platform for developing and understanding the principles of youth leadership, an awareness of youth work principles and practice and to explore the opportunities Erasmus+ offers to apply these competences. The project will offer a range of experiential learning opportunities, non-formal educational approaches and a wealth of youth work theory and practice.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\u2022 To develop a greater understanding of the transferrable skills and experiences for youth work;\r\n\u2022 To explore and understand the skills, knowledge and attitude of youth leadership;\r\n\u2022 To gain a greater awareness of youth work theory and practice;\r\n\u2022 To identify and realise youth leadership experiences and opportunities;\r\n\u2022 To follow a range of recognition pathways;\r\n\u2022 To explore the opportunities for realising their youth work potential through Erasmus+.\r\nPathways to Youth Leadership will work with and follow participants from 12 different countries (6 from Programme Countries, 3 from MEDA and 3 from SEE) with the target group being: young adults, those new to youth work, ex-beneficiaries of Erasmus+ (either youth exchanges or EVS) and young people looking to step up a level. Pathways to Youth Leadership will act as a bridge between the two worlds of being a young person within a youth project setting to becoming a youth worker in the field.\r\nYouth work realities differ quite a lot within the participating countries and sharing and learning from these will form an essential part of the programme. The participation of MEDA and SEE neighbouring regions will bring another rich learning dimension to this process and offer an authentic platform for exploring cultural differences and similarities.\r\nYouth work across Europe is changing due to many reasons: financial instability has led to cuts in provision in the UK, in Greece imposed austerity measures has resulted in struggling services for children and young people and in the Netherlands national to regional government changes has left youth work support floundering. Across the MEDA region youth work happens on the frontline of conflict, political uncertainty and issues of migration and the Balkans, much similar to Italy in terms of youth work environment and current state of affairs, are also still dealing with the consequences of war.\r\nWhat is common for all is that there appears to be natural or structured pathway or transition for progressing from being a young person in the youth club to becoming a youth leader, and in most countries there is no recognition tool for young people or newcomers to youth work to develop their leadership skills and youth work practice. Youth Work is very much driven by the third sector and this can mean not only are NGO\u2019s constantly searching and competing for funding to support their youth activities, but also looking for trained and experienced staff to support the ambitions of these organisations.", "http://www.thinkforwardcic.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-3-IT03-KA105-012317_6"], ["9ES", "Observe Rethink Act to generate innovative approaches in youth work", "Urban Organic (UK) CIC", 15262.0, "Our organisation is connecting several realities from different European countries and it's the result of an ongoing dynamic educational process called Observe Rethink Act (ORA) launched in 2009 by several organisations. The concept/methodology underpinning ORA is to provide young people with the direct opportunity to Observe their context(both at a local and international level),to Rethink their own role(both as individuals and as members of society)and to Act as responsible citizens to strengthen the community. This project find its roots in a Seminar realised by ORA Network in January 2016 and it is the direct follow up of a Capacity Building project applied to EACEA and implemented by ORA Network. The overall aim of the project is to realize a long term non-formal educational process at international level and among organisations  (Youth Centres/Clubs, youth associations, associations of social promotion, cultural associations, NGOs) coming from 6 different European countries (EU and Western Balkans) able to empower the youth work that the partnership is realising on field with young people coming from disadvantaged backgrounds and/or vulnerable groups in order to generate innovative approaches in their daily activities, to acquire new methodologies and quality activities tools, to increase the competences of their youth/social workers to better include the different target groups in the social, cultural, and economic life of their communities. Through this multi-activity project our organisations would like to answer properly to the demand and need of actions coming from different actors (young people, youth and social workers, youth centres, youth NGOs, Nature Reserves, local communities, etc.) to improve the efficiency and to enrich the quality of the work done at the grassroots level to broaden the opportunities for the social, cultural, environmental and economic inclusion of young people in the community, and to provide more useful services (educational, cultural, social, etc.) for the young people with whom they work. For these reasons, main activities planned in the project are represented by 11 Job Shadowing mobility and 1 Seminar that will take place between 10 August 2017 and 9 June 2018 (Project date) and will guarantee the participation of 31 among youth/social workers, peer educators, NGOs staff, volunteers, young artists, youth leaders and trainers including 2 facilitators from Germany and Bosnia Herzegovina. During all phases of the project will be respected and applied the principles of non formal education (these include the methods of non-formal/ informal learning, ORA - Observe, Rethink, Act, experiential and active pedagogy, mentoring and/or peer support and relationship-based activities): all the methodologies that will be used and activities proposed are designed to ensure the direct involvement of partners and participants at any time of the project promoting freedom of expression, exchange and cooperation, interaction and creativity. Majority of sessions will be based on participative/active learning combining theoretical and practical inputs coming from the team of facilitators or directly by the participants. Furthermore, the methodology used will be strongly oriented in terms of intercultural learning paying attention to the cultural diversity represented by the partnership (EU and Western Balkans countries), promoting a good environment, mutual understanding and cooperation among all participants. All partner associations will take an active role in all the stages of the project first of all providing human and professional competences and, at the same time, contributing to the development of contents and activities together with the team of facilitators/trainers and the other partners. For these reasons, partners will be responsible for part of the preparation (involvement and recruitment of participants, local partnership, preparatory work, travel details, transport and settlement, etc) and during the realisation they will contribute to the development of the activities in order to achieve the objectives planned and outcomes and results expected .At the end of the project, partners will support the dissemination/exploitation of the results at local level and develop new common projects at international level.", "http://www.urbanorganic.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-DE04-KA105-015587_5"], ["7SY", "Beyond the Differences", "Think Forward CIC", 20073.0, "\u201cBeyond the Difference\u201d is a 5-day seminar, taking place in Daugirdiskes, Lithuania.\r\nBeing a space for professional exchange of knowledge, skills, experience and practice, it will bring together 34 practitioners of international youth work and training from 16 countries (Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy,  Lithuania, Montenegro, Netherlands, Portugal, Russian Federation, SErbia, Turkey, United Kingdom).\r\n \r\nThe seminar will address conflict and crisis transformation, as a multi-dimension topic From the perspective of both - youth workers and trainers two of them are especially relevant to reflect: the political dimension and the more personal, relationship-related dimension. In analysing social inequality it is more important than ever to place the person at the centre of exploration i.e. personal/ individual, community, social, educational, cultural, legal, institutional, governmental and economic etc. \r\n\r\nLiving in post-truth societies, with a growing gap between the \u201cright\u201d and the \u201cleft\u201d , \u201cus\u201d and \u201cothers\u201d; and with lack of dialogue, there is an urge to work towards increasing empathy of young people towards themselves and towards \u201cthe different\u201d. The rapid changes and the dynamics of today\u2019s world influence young people in the first place: at this point of life identity forming is a natural life development, and not being all too clear about their identities young people can be easily influenced to cross to the \u201cdark side\u201d. Youth work should become the safe space for where young people raise their social/emotional competence, to learn and displace empathy towards themselves and or others.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the Seminar are:\r\n1) To offer international youth work and training practitioners a safe and trustful environment for sharing their experiences and bringing in specific cases from their practice of working with challenging groups.\r\n2) To identify the key social, cultural, economic and political issues and trends that shape people's life experience in Europe today and cause tensions and conflicts.\r\n3) To develop understanding of how to approach complexity of conflicts of everyday realities through international youth work and training activities.   \r\n4) To deepen participants knowledge, understanding of the roots of empathy for working with groups of people who have critical, indifferent, pessimistic worldviews and reflect our bias rooted in our backgrounds.\r\n5) To review existing methodological practices and get familiarise with the new methods and approaches of conflict transformation to improve future international youth work and training programmes.\r\n\r\nDuring the seminar, the participants will exchange, learning about themselves, their  personality and fears as well as approaches coming from neighbouring areas (psychology, improvisation theatre, therapeutic approaches etc., mediation as a facilitation technique), to further support youth work trainers in working with young people in affected environments.\r\n\r\nBeing very experienced, recognized organizations and important stakeholder in the scene of youth work and youth policy in their respective countries, the project partners will be able to translate the project outcomes to their local and national realm.

Out of studies, such as The European Youth Forum\u2019s study about the contribution of non-formal education in terms of increased employability, the soft skills that employers most frequently demand include communication skills, organisational/planning skills, decision-making skills, team working skills, confidence/autonomy and numeracy. Five of these six most frequently demanded soft skills that employers require are also being amongst those skills developed to a greater extent in youth organisations, the exception being numeracy. \r\nThese soft skills are seen as a key element for successful job performance. Certain personality traits are also found to be important components of these skills and competencies, contributing to their development.  For example, sense of initiative and pro-activity are traits associated with confidence/autonomy and entrepreneurship. Employers do also have a positive attitude towards young people\u2019s experience in youth organizations. Employers however stress a special emphasis on the way of presenting the skills and competences (what they present, how they present it has more impact than what is written on the paper) acquired during the participation in youth work, which is an area where there is still room for improvement. \r\n\r\nIn youth work, we have the instrument of the youth pass at European level,  a lot of countries have own national recognizing tools for competences, and each young person can use the European CV format (the Europass CV) for presenting the skills and competences towards employers. But only few still know, how to work effectively with it (e.g. what to present if I have already Youthpass from 6 different events). \r\n\r\nWith this project we want to bring youth workers together, to support them in enabling young people to better assess and express their competences for employment purposes.\r\n\r\nYoung workers should be made more aware about the value that employers place on the skills and the competencies developed in the youth work, and youth workers can be trained in how to support the young people they work with, in this topic. That is the central focus in this project, containing a training course of 6 days, and a follow up online meeting with the participants. \r\n\r\nThis goes in line with the recommendation of the European Youth Forum to work further on the transitioning to employability: there is a need to greater guidance and coaching for young people so that they are better able to present effectively the skills and competences they develop in the youth sector in job applications and that they are able to better understand how these skills may be applied in working environments, and can contribute to the performance of specific job-related tasks. \r\n\r\nIn the training course, participants will discover competencies for employment, will reflect upon the reality young people face when applying for jobs, will discuss employability and the role of youth work in it. \r\nYouth workers will be trained to formulating and articulating one\u2019 own competencies, and experiencing a range of methods and activities helping them to run similar activities with their own young participants in the youth work at home.\r\nParticipants will prepare pilot activities, workshops, sessions, methods for working on competencies with the young people of their own organisation. \r\nThese will be shared and improved, and then the participants will run them after the training course in their own organisations. \r\nIn a follow up online meeting, we bring all the participants again together to share the experiences with each other, to investigate the success factors, to measure the effect, to improve the activities and to gain new insights, to finally collect those in a booklet which will be distributed amongst partners and other youth workers, organisations and institutions, but also further and wider, throughout all our European contacts. \r\n\r\nThe training course as such will take place between 17th and 22nd September in the Czech Republic.", "http://www.thinkforwardcic.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-CZ01-KA105-034731_1"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["8NR", "RW5", "BLACKPOOL VICTORIA HOSPITAL"], ["8NR", "RXL", "BLACKPOOL VICTORIA HOSPITAL"], ["8NR", "RXL", "LANCASHIRE BOWEL CANCER SCREENING PROGRAMME - BLACKPOOL VICTORIA HOSPITAL"], ["8NR", "RXN", "BLACKPOOL VICTORIA HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "FY3"}
