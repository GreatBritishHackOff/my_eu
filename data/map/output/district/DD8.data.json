At present, following the introduction of the PLPlatform, we are teaching French throughout all stages of the school. As a result, pupils will be learning French from Nursery to Primary 7 and progressing further with their spoken language skills and vocabulary knowledge than ever before. This requires the need for more skilled, knowledgeable,competent and trained staff members to implement this long term strategy effectively. Spanish has also been identified as our third language and is planned to be taught from summer 2017. Presently, there are no Spanish speaking staff members at Whitehills Primary School and this identified as a development need. The upper stages (P5-P7) require a trained and knowledgeable staff member to help plan and cascade learning and teaching opportunities. \r\n  The opportunity to attend these courses will enable our school to continue to create close ties to both local and international schools and facilitate networking opportunities between native French and Spanish teachers and ourselves. We aim to achieve this goal through use of E-twinning. The school has currently been working alongside our local language staff tutor to help set up links with primary schools in France and this will be similar to the links created with schools in Spain. Through the immersion experience, staff members will have a deeper and broader understanding of the cultures in both countries, which in turn can be passed on to the pupils in our school. This will develop their curiosity and appreciation of what are the similarities between France / Spain and Scotland. \r\n  Following attendance on the immersion courses, training CPD events will be held both within our school as well as the opportunity to share and cascade the learning with other colleagues within the area. Parents will benefit as pupils will share their learning through close home-school links in addition to on-going class assemblies, open afternoons and parents evenings.

Growing out of an idea initially formed during an international seminar on youth employment, the project centres on young people developing a healthy leisure time both physically, mentally and in terms of active citizenship as part of an alternative use of their free time.  Participation of young people in making decisions about their own lives is a key element of the project.  Key objectives include exposing our young people to new experiences and opportunities, learning about Europe, engaging in informal learning as a key element of youth work, to develop interpersonal and life skills,  and learn how to be peer leaders and impact our organisations positively.  \r\nThere are young people participating who come from a range of backgrounds.  The young people have fewer social and economic opportunities and this project is a real way for them to devleop their skills and atticitued, both in terms of personal development, active citizenship and employability.  Activitites will include participating in physical leisure time activities, programmes to develop mindfulness and resilience and the participation in a youth leadership programme.  Methodologies will include group work, self directed learning, multimedia activiteis and planning and participation in porgrammme development.  The project will result in young people who have a greater understanding of themelves and of other young people from Europe, will result in more confident and socially aware young people who have changing attitudes about the opportunites and options available to them, and will result in young people who are more positive about their future and what they can do to influence it.  It will also impact on the participating organisations who will learn more about participation, policy making and the benefits of international work as a key component to our youth work practice.
