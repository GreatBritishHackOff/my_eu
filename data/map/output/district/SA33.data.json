Due to the character of the biomass it is difficult to achieve sufficient biogas yield without some kind of pre treatment. Recent year\u2019s development in enzyme technology and physical pre treatment technologies may open up for the possibility of running biogas production solely on slurry/ manure and straw on the condition that technology and strategy for proper use of enzymes is developed. Key research questions include temperature control and management during pre treatment, biological inactivation during pre treatment, post digestion enzyme treatment on the degassed fiber fraction and the re-injection into the fermentor.\nBIOMAN will for a series of SME\u2019s develop physical and enzymatic pretreatment strategies and technology for biogas plants. This will enable the consortium member SME to bring complete solutions to the market and enable the agricultural sector to run biogas plants directly on cattle manure and straw.", 184814.0, 1497347.0, "BIOMAN", "Manure + straw = energy", "A new form of sustainable, cheap, renewable bioenergy in the EU will soon be exportable, providing new jobs and reducing greenhouse gases.", "Discovering a source of renewable energy is similar to the search for the Holy Grail. For years, researchers in the field of energy have been searching for a cost-effective renewable bioenergy source. The exciting project 'Economically efficient biogas production procedure from manure fibres and straw' (http://bioman.dti.dk (BIOMAN)) moves the world closer to this goal with the Re-injection loop concept. \n\nNumerous biomass materials derived from living or recently living organisms of either animal or vegetable origin have the potential to serve as renewable energy sources. Biomass conversion technologies may release the energy directly in the form of heat or electricity, or convert it to another form, such as liquid biofuel or combustible biogas. \n\nOnce biomasses were identified, objectives included investigating European market for substrates for the Re-injection loop concept. From a public databank eight biomass substrates with high lignocellulytic content were chosen, including green biomasses, different animal manure types and wheat straw. After chemical characterisation of substrates, measurements were performed to assess potential biomethane production. Substrates were analysed before and after tests on different separation equipment, downsizing equipment, different enzymatic treatments and ultrasound. \n\nThe BIOMAN project will result in a technology package for installation on existing biogas plants running on manures and energy crops. In Germany, more than 6 000 biogas plants with a potential benefit from investing in Re-Injection Loop technology have been identified. Benefits also include reduced costs for manure handling for the farmer and compliance with EU environmental regulation. Biogasification of manures will aid in the conservation of nutrients with a degradable by-product that is used as a fertiliser and soil organic carbon enhancer.\n\nThe BIOMAN project will significantly contribute towards achieving the EUs ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Moreover, the renewable energy technology will also aid in creating more jobs and enhancing competitiveness in the energy sector.", "http://Bioman.dti.dk", "http://www.enzymesupplies.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/145761.jpg", "fp7_105078_953459270"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SA33"}
