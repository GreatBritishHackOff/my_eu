Despite its significance, measuring metastatic potential as well as potential indicators of therapy efficacy remain unmet clinical challenges. Recently, it has been demonstrated in vitro, that aggressive metastatic cells pull on their surroundings suggesting that metastatic potential could be gauged by measuring the forces exert by tumours. Furthermore, many solid tumours show a significantly increased interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) which prevents the efficient uptake of therapeutic agents. As a result, a reduction in IFP is recognized as a hallmark of therapeutic efficacy. Currently, there is no non-invasive modality that can directly image these forces in vivo.\nOur objective is the non-invasive measurement of both IFP within tumours as well as the forces they exert on their surrounding environment. This will be used to predict a tumour\u2019s metastatic potential and importantly, changes in these forces will be used to predict the therapeutic efficacy of drug therapy. To attain this goal, the biomechanical properties of the tumour and its neighbouring tissue will be measured via MR-elastography at various measured deformation states.  Resultant images will be used to reconstruct images of the internal and external forces acting on the tumour. We call this novel imaging modality Magnetic Resonance Force (MRF) imaging.\nWe will calibrate MRF via cell cultures and pre-clinical models, and then test the method in breast, liver, and brain cancer patients. Thereby, we will investigate whether MRF data can predict metastatic spread and measure IFP in patients.  We will also investigate the potential to non-invasively modulate the force environment of cancer cells via externally applied shear forces with the aim of impacting cell motility and proliferation. This can provide novel mechanism for anticancer therapeutic agents via mechanotransduction.", 84480.0, 6362259.0, "FORCE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_199748_928631441"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3JR", "HuebEurope II", "Godinton Primary School", 37399.0, "The HuebEurope II Project is a project of the \u201cH\u00fcberts\u00b4sche Schule\u201d, a privately owned Higher Vocational College of Business and Administration.

With this project they are given the chance to gain first work experience at a foreign work place and to improve foreign language as well as intercultural skills in order to prepare them for the challenges of a changing regional, national and European job market. \r\nThis project is built on the experiences of the former HuebEurope I Project, which has been running successfully within the EU programme Leonardo Mobility for two years. \r\nThe project is supported by the EU office of the regional government of M\u00fcnster. \r\nThe project is applied for a total number of 44 participants. It will be carried out in two flows, each with 20-24 participants, who will be sent off for two weeks after the Easter holidays of the years 2016 and 2017. \r\nThe target group of this project are the vocational full-time students specialising in Business, Administration and Foreign Languages. \r\nThe project consists of two actions: \r\nThe main action is the offer of a two-week work experience in different British companies and institutions (e.g. primary schools, grammar school, residential home for the elderly) in the county of Kent. Participants are accommodated in British host families. The H\u00fcberts\u00b4sche Schule organises travel and accommodation of the participants. Two teachers of the college will accompany and support the participants on site during their stay. \r\nThe second, new action is to offer the possibility of a funded foreign work experience to those students who have succeeded in finding a work placement due to their own personal commitment. This action is mainly focussed on foreign branch offices and distributors of regional companies. In this case travel and accommodation will be organised by the participants themselves, who will be supported by the teaching staff of the college. Attendance during this work experience will be ensured by means of email and phone. \r\nThe H\u00fcberts\u00b4sche Schule is responsible for the selection of suitable candidates. \r\nThe common language and intercultural preparation of the participants will take place in the HuebEurope workshop of the vocational college. \r\nTogether with the participants the vocational college and the partner organisations decide on the goals for the stay abroad and keep record in the participant agreements.

This can be explained through the Salutogenic model; a model consisting of three factors created by Antonovsky (1987). The model questions; \u201cWhy do some people stay healthy, both mentally and physically, and why others don\u2019t during a stressful situation?\u201d According to Antonovsky this is dependent on three factors; to have a greater understanding of one\u2019s life, receiving a greater meaning from life and being able to manage life. Sports has the potential to support young people\u2019s understanding of their situation through purposeful activities and physical exercise. Sports is also a positive way to engage with the local community, create networks and cooperate while encouraging a positive community response. Sports projects with young people is a common tool to increase integration and the individual needs of the young people involved. This project will be informed by Antonovsky\u2019s approach as participation in sports is a way to promote health despite the presence of stress in a young person\u2019s life which will stabilise young people. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are; \r\n1. To promote and empower youth people\u2019s individuality through sport; Confidence, self-perception and self- image. \r\n2. To encourage young people to try and actively participate in a range of sports activities \r\n3. To eliminate gender barriers within sports and challenge the segregation towards the participation \r\n4. To promote positive social inclusion through inclusive sports activities. \r\n5. To help build a sustainable local and international network with young people and their organisations. \r\n\r\nThe project will involve partners from; UK, Italy, Turkey and France and will include a total of 34 young people and their youth leaders. Each country will have 5 young people. The main target group within this project will be disadvantaged young people between the ages of 13-17 years of age of any age while Swedish local participants will be 10. \r\n\r\nNon-formal methods will be used throughout the project with the following activities; Workshops. question and answer sessions, small group discussions, sports session, visual tools- flip charts, online presentations, case studies, images and videos, film making, guest speaking, exercise sessions, reflections, evaluations, intercultural evenings, cultural visits. The expected impact is to give young people the possibility to participate in more sports and to give a sense of both awareness and empowerment about gender issues in relation to sports. Young people who participate in this project will experience positive social inclusion. It will furthermore impact local and international networks motivating them to get more involved in their local communities  and organisations and act out as active and well informed citizen.  In general, the preparation of youth with the necessary skills, attitudes and competences will ensure a qualified person in the future that can help for problem solving skills and significant gender barriers.

In today\u2019s society there are many stresses which mean it can be difficult for engagement or participation. There is a lack of knowledge also whereby a significant number of young people don\u2019t have the capacity or way of knowing how to survive or spend their time within nature. \r\nTherefore this youth exchange will take place in \u00d6rkelljunga, Sweden and aims to support young peoples lives in the natural and rural areas and will attempt to revive their desire to be in natural environments. It will raise young people\u2019s awareness of nature and the important value that it holds.\r\nThe participants that will be taking part in the project will be young people 13-17 who;\r\n- Are geographical disadvantaged and have challenges to engage the natural environment (for urban or industrial areas)\r\n- Young people from rural and natural areas who need motivation and inspiration from their European peers to reconnect to their local area.\r\nThe young people will be 13-17, after further needs analysis within the local area we recognised this is the age that are forgotten. There are limited resources and services for them yet they require specific and tailor made activities just for them so they can develop their own skills and awarenesses.\r\nThis will in turn encourage young people to support and participate in environmental protection and increase their connection \"Into the Nature\" as we believe the two can coincide and work together. The objectives of this project will be the following; towards nature.\r\n Objectives: - Increase awareness about environmental issues. \r\n- Increase practical knowledge in the nature. \r\n- Combine sport and non formal learning with nature \r\n- Increase problem solving skills - Expand meaning of nature among young people and connect with daily life \r\n- Challenge young people to go out of their comport zone.\r\n- Provide youth leader tools to work in Nature \r\n- To experience different natural environments; in the lake and in the forest. \r\nEngage in Nature is a Youth Exchange that will bring together 32 young participants from Sweden, Turkey, UK, Italy and Portugal. It will involve visits to the surrounding cities  and participants will be involved in activities with local youth centres and organisations from around the region, as well as inspiring lectures and workshops. Non formal\r\neducation methods such as Creative Drama, film-making, games, outdoor activities, sports, workshops will be main way to reach our objectives. IFALL and partners will continue to support the youth with funding for projects, support and help in developing ideas to make change in their communities etc even after the end of the project. These youth will also cause other youth in their communities to be inspired to become part of nature, thus causing a long-term multiplier effect. In fact, this project itself is a multiplier effect of previous exchanges between IFALL and partners.\r\nThe project will create a unique handbook in partnership with the young people and all participating youth leaders. The handbook will be about raising awareness about natural environment and the best practices for its conservation, will help the impact of the project, its objectives and the spread of Erasmus Plus programmes and organisations works on a local, national and also EU level; The handbook will have two main sections, one addressed to youth leaders and the other to young people, thus helping both the groups increasing their awareness about natural issues and how to work within this environment with a young target group. The first section will include best practises; tools, methods and games about how to engage young people into the nature and the other section will be for the young people.", "http://bauhauscafe.co.uk/", null, "erasmus_2018-2-SE02-KA105-002223_4"], ["1PF", "My Creativity Matters", "Bauhaus Cafe CIC", 28923.0, "Research shows that creativity in young people results in mental well being and achievement in life.
