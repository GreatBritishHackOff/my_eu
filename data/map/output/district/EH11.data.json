The participants to this project are students and teachers in intial vocational education and training of various education sectors in Salpaus Further Education. The staff mobilities increase the understanding and capacity of the importance of European collaboration simultaneously providing our staff learning opportunities for their international paths as great teacher with prominent European networks. \r\n\r\nThe  students also benefit of the mobilities by practising new vocational and professional competence, and as its best, they also learn new skills and techniques that are not included in our curricula. Foreign placements strengthens students' opportunities for employment and continuing education, learning languages, communication skills and multicultural competence in practical environment. By understanding better the European vocational qualifications, we are able to develop our curriculum and didactical perspectives more efficiently and directed to the working life needs. For both students and staff, this project provides for learning together and acquiring skills for better adaptability in continuously changing labour market, economy and societies. As a result, the students' and staff prepardness and awareness of cultural, cognitive and social skills contribute to successful employment and continuing education opportunities in many parts of the world.   \r\n\r\nAt organisational level, this project facilitates for upgrading the quality assurance of mobilities and international cooperation in general.

Our project  fosters equality of opportunity in allowing disadvantaged people to get experience and therefore support their integration into the labour market.\r\n\r\nWe have already  had an experience of mobility since September 2011. On the last project KA 102, we already sent 44 students for 45 scholarships in 7 different countries, and 18 members of staff benefited from the mobility in 4 countries as part of the last KA 101 project.\r\n\r\nThis project involves the enlargement to new countries and also to a  new high school vocational education public.\r\n\r\nWe consider sending  99 students for a 3 weeks' work placement in a company  while seeking for a consistency between the exam regulations and an experience abroad. The students will acquire not only new professional  techniques, but also transversal skills.

We select and prepare the student. A teacher is present to introduce the student in the company and also to proceed to an assessment at the end of the stay.\r\n\r\nTo succeed, we rely on an intermediary  partner (usually a training centre in  the same field ) which helps us to identify host companies and ensure the relays for all the logistics during the trip (accomodation, catering...)\r\n\r\nThe host company appoints  a referent who will train and evaluate the student.\r\n\r\nAfter 6 years of experience, we have tools for the monitoring and the contractualisation. Apprentices, companies, host organisations and our school  confirm in writing before each departure. The host organisation provides activities related to the exam regulations and is there to help the participant professionally and personally.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, our project is a well thought out and  collective project which  allows us to adapt to the evolution of jobs and new teaching methods in a global economy. It brings dynamics  to the teaching staff,  can also rally the students who do not have the possibility to travel  and develop our relashionship with employers.\r\n\r\nWe fully place ourselves within  a sector, local, regional and national context.

We will also offer the opportunity to newly qualified students who haven't found a job yet.

It is an irreplaceable repository of knowledge and a valuable resource for economic growth, employment and social cohesion. It enriches the individual lives of hundreds of millions of people. It is a source of inspiration for thinkers and artists, and a drive for our cultural and creative industries.\r\n\r\nAll of the challenges need to be addressed to ensure the sustainability of Europe\u2019s cultural heritage. The heritage sector also needs to adapt its management and business models and to develop new professional skills  by making the valorisation and preservation of heritage a part of a broader, long-term development plans, rather than by working with authorities through one-off, isolated interventions. \r\nA new approach to heritage and its interpretation consists in:\r\n\u2022 Becoming more people-centred.\r\n\u2022 Taking new opportunities, offered by digitisation and online accessibility, that enable unprecedented forms of engagement and open up new revenue streams.\r\n\u2022 Organising an intelligent dialogue between different points of view thanks to an increasingly community-oriented approach, led by people and stories. For instance , proposing heritage-based narratives that weave the personal stories of community members into the interpretation of larger historical events.\r\n\u2022 Engaging the audiences with the collections, by placing them at the heart of the activities.\r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, an operational committee has brought together 11 partners representing culture (abbeys of Saintes, Trizay, Fontevraud, Saint Jean d'Angely, Noirlac), social inclusion (Belle Rive social center), tourism (MONA, Local Touristic Information Offices for Saintes and for Saint Jean d'Angely) in a strong cooperation with the Saintes Local Authority. This committee aims to identify the best European practices in heritage interpretation and audience development in order to deepen its competencies in these fields.\r\n\r\nIn this framework, our mobility program plans 5 training sessions and 5 job-shadowing perions in 7 EU members states (Germany, United Kingdom, Belgium, Greece, Spain, Austria and Italy). Each participant will use their specific professional approach to enrich the global project with their analysis.\r\n\r\nThe final objective of the ERASMUS+ mobility programme called \"HERITAGE INTERPRETATION, INHABITANTS INVOLVEMENT & INNOVATIVE PRACTICES (H4IP)\" will be the diffusion of a new contributive methodology, associating experts and local communities in the co-construction of innovative heritage tours and touristic visits, and their transposition to other historical monuments, to other French, European and non-European territories.\r\n\r\nThe good practices, identified thanks to the ERASMUS+ mobility programme ,will be diffused to the consortium member staff, the foreign host organisations, as well as the French and the foreign professional world. They will be transposed and experimented on at a local level by different targeted publics (local communities and tourists), who could, in turn, enrich, develop and improve their competencies (human capital and social capital) and their experiences. They will also contribute to improving the capacity of their key-competencies , such as \"digital competencies\", \"social and civic competencies\", \"cultural awareness and expression\", and, in this way, contribute to a better transmission of the European cultural heritage, and to maximise its economic and social potential.\r\n\r\nIn terms of an estimated public, the aim of the project is to instruct innovative heritage interpretation practices:\r\n- directly: 52 adults employed by the consortium members and more that 577 persons employed by the host organisations\r\n- indirectly: more than 283.000 adults per year within the groups targeted by the consortium members", "http://www.nts.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA104-036749_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EH11"}
