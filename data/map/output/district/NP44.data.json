The age of the students will be between 17 and 30 years. It is also important to consider that their socio-economic level is medium-low, so, without the help of this project, they will never be able to participate in a similar experience.\r\n\r\nFor the preparation and management of these mobilities, the work team is made up of teachers from the Health, English, French and Professional Training and Guidance departments, with the involvement of the school management members too.\r\n\r\nThe students will carry out their internships in companies according to their profiles, being their skills acquired recognized with the EUROPASS  also with the certification of the company and with the validation of the workplace training programme . The EUROPASS will also be given to the vocational training teachers who participate in the mobilities.\r\n\r\nWe continue to work with the same host partners, already established as part of our project after several years of collaboration. Throughout this time, they have demonstrated their capacity and willingness,  achieving  such good results that they have allowed us to do without intermediary agencies.\r\n\r\nWe maintain the 4 mobilities for teachers in a vocational training centre in France, in collaboration with the Red Cross. The participants will be teachers of vocational training, interested and involved in the European dimension of education.\r\n\r\nWe intend to add an incoming mobility, inviting an entrepreneur from one of the partner companies (Air Assistance Ambulance)  to come to our school  to inform and train the students of the Emergency Health Care programme  about issues related to their professional profile in France. This will undoubtedly enrich the training of our students, allowing the participation of all of them, motivating them in the project and of course, strengthening   our partnership with this company.\r\n\r\nAs a novelty we are going to introduce a series of diffusion activities in collaboration with \u201cErasmus Student Network Cartagena , under its project \"Erasmus in School\" in order not only to continue making our project known both within our school and the city of Cartagena, but also to motivate the students in previous courses since they can be future candidates to participate in our  projects. This association has a series of activities that we have planned to implement for students finishing their last year of Compulsory Secondary Education and Senior High School (Bachillerato). This plan will be developed during the school year.\r\n\r\nWe continue with the activities of diffusion of the project within our school, both for the teaching staff as well as for the students. We have also envisaged a contest for the cultural week, which our school organizes every year. The aim is to find a slogan for the next Erasmus project with the proposals of our students. In addition and taking advantage of the appearance of the Digital Magazine of our school during this course, we will use this resource as a means of dissemination.\r\n\r\nWe request again the figure of the accompanying teachers, one for each mobility, due, in part to the fact that we have underage students, as well as students, who despite being over 18 years  do not have experience abroad, or have not travelled previously or are even lost when dealing with certain circumstances of the mobility such as travel, presentation in a new foreign company, location in a new environment and so on. The experience of previous courses shows us the need of this figure that serves as a guide in these first days of mobility, providing security to students and even, sometimes, giving them the last push to make the decision to participate in the project.\r\n\r\nWe are conducting a search for new partners through resources such as EURES, EPALE, etc., as well as various websites of vocational training schools in different countries of Europe in order to expand our project and continue to grow and create opportunities for our students in new countries.\r\n\r\nThe teachers of the French department, participants in the  project Erasmus, are developing an e-Twinning project with the Coll\u00e9ge Fran\u00e7oise in Limoge (France) in order to transmit to the participating students and the school itself, the idea of a globalized world bringing another culture closer to the context of a teaching increasingly oriented towards internationalization.", "http://www.giakonda.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA116-047857_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NP44"}
