It brings together major European groups currently working on planetary robotic vision, supported by NASA-JPL from USA. Most robotic planetary space missions performing in situ exploration of the surface and atmosphere for any planetary object outside the Earth involve a means of mobility provided by either a surface vehicle (\u2018rover\u2019) or by aerial vehicles (balloons, aerobots etc.). Mobile systems are among the most critical of all space missions in requiring a rapid and robust on-site processing and preparation of scientific data to allow efficient operations for a maximum use of their limited lifetime. In future the number and variety of such platforms will require more autonomy than is feasible today, particularly in the autonomous on-site selection of and access to scientific and mission-strategic targets. ProViScout will provide the robotic vision building blocks on board of such future autonomous exploration systems. Therefore ProViScout aims to 1. build a framework for planetary robotic on-board vision processing, 2. develop the technology to autonomously select scientific sites of interest during future planetary robotic missions in order to maximize the mission value for scientific research, technology and education 3. develop a unified and generic approach for robotic vision on-board processing, namely the combination of navigation and scientific target selection 4. demonstrate the synergies and complementarities of existing solutions, and complete missing components by defining and demonstrating on-board robotic vision for a set of typical reference mission scenarios, 5. integrate all components into a framework ready for field demonstration 6. increase public awareness of planetary robotic exploration.", 196305.0, 2290298.0, "PROVISCOUT", null, null, null, "http://www.proviscout.eu/", "http://www.scisys.co.uk", null, "fp7_94034_998883788"], ["0GB", "Planetary Robotics Vision Ground Processing", "Scisys Uk Ltd", "PROVISG will build a framework for planetary robotic vision ground processing - develop the technology to better process and visualise existing & future data from planetary missions to maximize value-adedd exploitation of the data for research, technology and education - increase public awareness of such missions and the EC contribution to their scientific evaluation.\nWe define robotic planetary space missions as unmanned missions performing in situ surface exploration on planetary objects. Most such missions involve mobility provided by a surface (\u2018rover\u2019) or aerial (balloons etc.) vehicle and require rapid turnaround of imaging data through processing and proper presentation on the ground (i.e., on Earth) to make maximum use of the limited vehicle lifetime. PROVISG incorporates major EU and US research institutions & stakeholders involved in vision & navigation for robotic space missions and their scientific exploitation. We will develop a unified approach for robotic vision ground processing to establish a generic framework therefor.\nOne main result will be a web-based GIS providing a comprehensive vision data processing chain and visualization of the context, history, vision meta data and -products of robotic planetary missions. For demonstration, a representative part of the US MER imagery will be processed to generate 2D and 3D data products (digital terrain models, mosaics, and a set of scientifically relevant results). Already available rover and aerobot mock-up equipment will be used in field test campaigns to verify and demonstrate the processing going beyond the vision abilities available so far at the MER and currently envisaged ESA missions. A summer school will be attached to the final test.\nRepresentative data sets will be publicly provided, allowing European institutions to test their processing on a competitive basis.

Despite its importance, the latter information is either often omitted, or stated informally via textual descriptions.  Behavioural Types are a suite of technologies that formalise of this information, elevating flat API descriptions to a graph structure of services.
