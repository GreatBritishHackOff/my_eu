Guidelines are also typically developed as a one-size-fits-all package. By developing and evaluating targeted dissemination strategies, DECIDE aims to increase the use of evidence-based interventions in a sustainable way and to reduce the use of interventions where benefits are uncertain.\n\nMethods: GRADE is a systematic approach towards assessing and communicating the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. It has been developed to address the weaknesses of other grading systems and is now widely used internationally. The DECIDE consortium, which is composed of members of the GRADE Working Group, will further develop this approach to ensure effective dissemination of evidence-based recommendations targeted at the key stakeholders (healthcare professionals; policymakers and managers; patients and the general public) who determine what happens in clinical practice. We will collect stakeholder input from advisory groups, consultations and user testing. This will be done across a wide range of health systems in Europe. The targeted dissemination strategies that are developed will be evaluated in randomized trials, refined and used and evaluated with real guidelines developed by the DECIDE partners and other guideline developers that we support.\n\nExpected results: Dissemination strategies for recommendations that have been rigorously evaluated in diverse settings, support the transfer of research into practice, and are adapted to real-world healthcare systems.", null, 3082480.0, "DECIDE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.sign.ac.uk", null, "fp7_97693_984458433"], ["4HG", "Ecosystem-based Responsive Fisheries Management in Europe", "Sea Fish Industry Authority", "EcoFishMan seeks to develop a responsive fisheries management system (RFMS) based on results-based management (RBM) principles. The intended context of application of the RFMS is complex, mixed-fisheries and multi-stakeholder fishery sectors like those found in the EU/Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) area. It will be an ecosystem-based sustainable management system under a precautionary framework that will define maximum acceptable negative impact, target elimination of discards and maintain economic and social viability. EcoFishMan is a multidisciplinary project, involving scientists and stakeholders in activities relating to biology, stock assessment, technology, economy, sociology and legal aspects of fisheries management. The work starts with a review on existing results-based management systems (RBMS), the CFP and tools that aid fisheries management. The next step is identification of outcome targets and development of relevant indicators, which are then visualised through development of a GIS based decision support tool. The RFMS will be designed, developed and evaluated in collaboration between scientists and stakeholders and tested through simulated case studies. This will take place in an iterative process (spiral model) to ensure that the RFMS is adaptive to different types of fisheries and changes in the environment. A roadmap will be produced for the implementation and maintenance of recommendations in the system. In the RFMS, stakeholder involvement is essential and through their active involvement in the development of the system, EcoFishMan aims at improving cooperation and mutual understanding between scientists, policy makers and other stakeholders. Top-down management strategies will be combined with a co-management and bottom-up approach that aims to shift the burden of proof and to involve and benefit stakeholders, offering a fundamentally new approach to fisheries management in Europe.", 98666.0, 3212062.0, "ECOFISHMAN", "New approach to improve fishery productivity", "Developed in collaboration with key stakeholders, a new responsive fisheries management system (RFMS) is set to make European fisheries more efficient.", "The EU-funded 'Ecosystem-based responsive fisheries management in Europe' (http://www.ecofishman.com (ECOFISHMAN)) project developed a new system of fisheries management. This involved switching from an outdated micromanagement system to a results-based management (RBM) system in which fishermen play an essential role.\n\nEcological, economic and social aspects were taken into consideration, as well as ways of improving cooperation and mutual understanding between stakeholders and policymakers. The consortium also presented case studies from Iceland, the Mediterranean, the North Sea and Portugal to illustrate the superiority of the new RFMS.\n\nResearchers analysed the situation of discarded fish worldwide and considered specific reasons for the practice, discard mitigation and stakeholder participation. They also studied economic incentives for reducing discards.\n\nThe project team compiled a list of more than 200 indicators (ecological, social, governance and economic) that was classified against 9 screening criteria by a selection of fisheries and social scientists.\n\nEach fishery was rated based on the list of indicators in order to establish an optimal approach for the entire industry. Notably, ecological-based indicators were weighted more than the productivity of the fishery, whereas the governance and social indicators achieved slightly lower mean scores.\n\nECOFISHMAN will contribute to the development of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and in particular to a new discard policy. It has addressed the challenges of fisheries management by proposing the introduction of an RBM system based on specifying maximum acceptable limits of negative impacts \u2014 i.e. the RFMS.\n\nIn the RFMS, stakeholder involvement is increased and the whole ecosystem, rather than just selected species, is taken into consideration. Therefore, ECOFISHMAN will improve the productivity of European fisheries and minimise negative effects, including fish discards, overexploited fish stocks, fleet overcapacity and a low degree of compliance.\n\nECOFISHMAN outcomes will increase long-term thinking in the seafood industry by encouraging managers to focus on sustainable growth rather than short-term availability of catch.

DiscardLess will help provide the knowledge, tools and technologies as well as the involvement of the stakeholders to achieve this. These will be integrated into Discard Mitigation Strategies (DMS) proposing cost-effective solutions at all stages of the seafood supply chain. The first focus is on preventing the unwanted catches from ever being caught. This will promote changes in gear using existing and innovative selectivity technology, and changes in fishing tactics based on fishers\u2019 and scientists\u2019 knowledge.  The second focus is on making best use of the unavoidable unwanted catch. We will detail technical and marketing innovations from the deck, through the supply chain to the final market, including monitoring, traceability and valorization components. DiscardLess will evaluate the impacts of discarding on the marine environment, on the economy, and across the wider society. We will evaluate these impacts before, during and after the implementation of the landing obligation, allowing comparison between intentions and outcomes. Eliminating discards is as much a societal challenge as a fishery management one, so we will also evaluate stakeholders\u2019 perception of discards. DiscardLess will describe the changes in management and the associated governance structures needed to cement the process. We will propose approaches to managing discards in a range of case study fisheries across Europe, encompassing differences in specific discarding issues. All these innovations will be combined in integrated Internet based interactive programs (DMS toolbox) that will help fishers to evaluate the present and future situation and to take a more qualified decision of how to adjust to the new regime.
