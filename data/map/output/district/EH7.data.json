Guidelines are also typically developed as a one-size-fits-all package. By developing and evaluating targeted dissemination strategies, DECIDE aims to increase the use of evidence-based interventions in a sustainable way and to reduce the use of interventions where benefits are uncertain.\n\nMethods: GRADE is a systematic approach towards assessing and communicating the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. It has been developed to address the weaknesses of other grading systems and is now widely used internationally. The DECIDE consortium, which is composed of members of the GRADE Working Group, will further develop this approach to ensure effective dissemination of evidence-based recommendations targeted at the key stakeholders (healthcare professionals; policymakers and managers; patients and the general public) who determine what happens in clinical practice. We will collect stakeholder input from advisory groups, consultations and user testing. This will be done across a wide range of health systems in Europe. The targeted dissemination strategies that are developed will be evaluated in randomized trials, refined and used and evaluated with real guidelines developed by the DECIDE partners and other guideline developers that we support.\n\nExpected results: Dissemination strategies for recommendations that have been rigorously evaluated in diverse settings, support the transfer of research into practice, and are adapted to real-world healthcare systems.", null, 3082480.0, "DECIDE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.sign.ac.uk", null, "fp7_97693_984458433"], ["4HG", "Ecosystem-based Responsive Fisheries Management in Europe", "Sea Fish Industry Authority", "EcoFishMan seeks to develop a responsive fisheries management system (RFMS) based on results-based management (RBM) principles. The intended context of application of the RFMS is complex, mixed-fisheries and multi-stakeholder fishery sectors like those found in the EU/Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) area. It will be an ecosystem-based sustainable management system under a precautionary framework that will define maximum acceptable negative impact, target elimination of discards and maintain economic and social viability. EcoFishMan is a multidisciplinary project, involving scientists and stakeholders in activities relating to biology, stock assessment, technology, economy, sociology and legal aspects of fisheries management. The work starts with a review on existing results-based management systems (RBMS), the CFP and tools that aid fisheries management. The next step is identification of outcome targets and development of relevant indicators, which are then visualised through development of a GIS based decision support tool. The RFMS will be designed, developed and evaluated in collaboration between scientists and stakeholders and tested through simulated case studies. This will take place in an iterative process (spiral model) to ensure that the RFMS is adaptive to different types of fisheries and changes in the environment. A roadmap will be produced for the implementation and maintenance of recommendations in the system. In the RFMS, stakeholder involvement is essential and through their active involvement in the development of the system, EcoFishMan aims at improving cooperation and mutual understanding between scientists, policy makers and other stakeholders.

This involved switching from an outdated micromanagement system to a results-based management (RBM) system in which fishermen play an essential role.\n\nEcological, economic and social aspects were taken into consideration, as well as ways of improving cooperation and mutual understanding between stakeholders and policymakers. The consortium also presented case studies from Iceland, the Mediterranean, the North Sea and Portugal to illustrate the superiority of the new RFMS.\n\nResearchers analysed the situation of discarded fish worldwide and considered specific reasons for the practice, discard mitigation and stakeholder participation. They also studied economic incentives for reducing discards.\n\nThe project team compiled a list of more than 200 indicators (ecological, social, governance and economic) that was classified against 9 screening criteria by a selection of fisheries and social scientists.\n\nEach fishery was rated based on the list of indicators in order to establish an optimal approach for the entire industry. Notably, ecological-based indicators were weighted more than the productivity of the fishery, whereas the governance and social indicators achieved slightly lower mean scores.\n\nECOFISHMAN will contribute to the development of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and in particular to a new discard policy. It has addressed the challenges of fisheries management by proposing the introduction of an RBM system based on specifying maximum acceptable limits of negative impacts \u2014 i.e. the RFMS.\n\nIn the RFMS, stakeholder involvement is increased and the whole ecosystem, rather than just selected species, is taken into consideration. Therefore, ECOFISHMAN will improve the productivity of European fisheries and minimise negative effects, including fish discards, overexploited fish stocks, fleet overcapacity and a low degree of compliance.\n\nECOFISHMAN outcomes will increase long-term thinking in the seafood industry by encouraging managers to focus on sustainable growth rather than short-term availability of catch.

This in turn makes it harder to actively participate in society and to confidently find fitting career opportunities. \r\nWe see the need for young people, who are facing different and similar forms of discrimination and social marginalisation, due to economic disadvantages and discrimination based on origin, gender and sexual orientation, disability and religion, to come together and to learn collectively how they can find ways to build confidence, mutual understanding and solidarity. Thus bringing together young people from Eastern and Western Europe can bring mutual learning. \r\nTherefore we plan a meeting, where young people, affected by different forms of systemic oppression, exchange experiences on how their social position affects their involvement in social change(-structures).

This will help to find their way from marginalisation into a self-determined life and possibly into the job market. \r\n\r\nMethodology used in the project\r\nInteractive and participatory methods of non-formal education\r\nTheatre of the Oppressed\r\nImprovisation Theatre\r\nPerformance\r\n-> As body-mind connecting practices that build to grow self-esteem and empowerment and to find ways to overcome discrimination and marginalisation.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nThere will be 42 youth participants from three different countries, Eastern, Western and Northern Europe, who are facing marginalisation and discrimination based on their gender, sexual orientation, origin (migration or refugee background and low income families), disability and religion.\r\n\r\nActivities\r\nA planning and preparation meeting will allow partner organisations as well as some of the young participants to meet and bring together the organisations of the youth exchange. \r\nThe main activity will be a 16 days long youth exchange with a mixture of organised workshops and participant led-sessions. Including session on theatre the of the oppressed, improvisation theatre, guided tours, presentation from the participants about their background and home countries, as well as practical skills in facilitation, listening and peer-support. \r\n\r\nResults of the project\r\n42 young people who face discrimination will have met and be empowered to stand up for their rights and liberation \u2013 knowing and respecting different people. Also, there will be experience and lessons learnt in organising across difference which will be used for future projects. \r\n\r\nEnvisioned impacts\r\nHigher self-esteem, feeling empowered and having gained confidence will mean more active participation in society for the participants. An informal network of peer-support of the young participants will be formed. Moreover, participants will have learned skills in facilitation and preparing and organising workshops. Also, the partner-organisations will strengthen their European network for future transnational projects. \r\n\r\nLong-term benefits\r\nWorking towards ending discrimination and marginalisation allows the European Union to become a place where human rights are truly in place.

The creation of the Hibernian Community Foundation as an independent charity in 2008 signalled a clear commitment to step up the efforts to have wider scope and greater impact. The aim of Hibernian Community Foundation is to provide opportunities to everyone through which they can improve their lives. We utilise the power of football and the Hibernian Community Foundation brand across Edinburgh and the Lothians to engage people in a way which other organisations can't. It's the work of our programmes and excellent staff which makes the real difference.\r\n\r\nPart of the Hibernian Community Trust includes the operation of the Hibernian Ladies football coaching and teams. Hibernian Girls and Ladies are amongst Scotland's most successful female football setups. Hibs Ladies are very much a community-based team with a strong commitment to grassroots girls\u2019 football, inspiring young ladies to be active and pursue their dreams in becoming successful football players, or leaders in sports coaching. Our mix of volunteer and part-time coaches support the ladies and girls\u2019 teams by providing coaching, match analysis, and aims to grow the woman\u2019s game and aid the development of young female players so they too play on a level on a par with the men\u2019s game.\r\n\r\nParticipation in women\u2019s football is low, and retention of players is even more problematic. Notably, it is around the age of 16-18 where we see the biggest drop out from the game. It is our aim to combat and increase the numbers participating in women\u2019s football and encourage and motivate young, talented female players to continue progressing with the game once they leave school. There is a vast degree of inequality in football, with the women\u2019s game regarded as somewhat of a lesser sport. This is grossly unfair and Hibernian Community Trust seek to tackle this head on.\r\n\r\nThis project will allow a group of 30 female coaches from The Hibernian Community Trust, aged 17-32 to participate in mobility in Spain, gaining experience in the coaching and community initiatives that drive women\u2019s football in Spain and gives it the platform for success that it so deserves. Participants will travel to the Valencia region for a duration of 10 days.\r\n\r\nMobility will focus on improving the employability for female coaches, players and football professional support staff through a structured mobility experience which will involve the acquisition of key Spanish coaching initiatives and competences. Our project objectives include:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Improve technical, tactical, physical and physiological aspects of the game.\r\n\u2022 Enhance the vocational educational programme of HCT.\r\n\u2022 Assist in the continuity and togetherness of the girls and ladies teams.\r\n\u2022 Learn about Spanish best practice and coaching innovations.\r\n\u2022 Improve the employability of coaches\r\n\u2022 Empower, motivate, engage, and inspire young women and girls in football; to increase participation and player retention.\r\n\u2022 Improve linguistic abilities and cultural awareness, both in football and society.\r\n\u2022 Improved professional development of participants via the implementation of a structured work programme during the course of an Erasmus+ mobility programme.\r\n\u2022 Skills and technology transfer between the Academy mobility professionals in Spain and the UK.\r\n\u2022 Improved employment rates for mobility participants in professional careers within women\u2019s football.\r\n\r\nFemale participation in football and the subsequent retention of players is extremely low, and this project seeks to  establish grounds to combat the inequality in football. This project will develop elite female athletes and coaches to enhance their abilities. Our coaches will deliver these lessons in Spanish football to the female teams at HCT from grassroots level through to the first team, with the intention that developing and innovating our coaching programme will increase the participation rate of female players.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to address the gender imbalance in football and while we will tackle this as best we can, we are under no illusion that this project alone will solve the problem. What it will do however, is start the process in Scottish Football to raise awareness of the need for more investment in women\u2019s football, creating discussions and highlighting the benefits to women in being able to pursue sustainable employment as elite athletes or coaches in the game.
