In the case of the Iberian Empires, the establishment of new trade routes brought up the need for armed merchantmen, galleons and smaller vessels, placing unprecedented demands on Iberian forests for the supply of construction timber. Forestry and sea power became inextricably linked, creating new geopolitical tensions, alliances and forest regulations. Key questions in this context are: could Iberian forest resources sustain the increasing demand of sound timber, or was the wood imported from elsewhere? If so, how were the trade networks organized? And did the lack of raw material force the technological changes occurred in shipbuilding in the 16th century, or were they a result of exchange between Mediterranean and Atlantic shipbuilding traditions? This project will address these questions through a multidisciplinary and innovative training research program to improve the understanding of our historical past, our cultural heritage, and our knowledge of the use of resources for shipbuilding. The prerequisite for such approach is combining knowledge derived from Humanities and Life Sciences. The aims of the project are: i) to consolidate a research line combining historical research, underwater archaeology, GIS and wood provenancing methods (dendrochronology, wood anatomy and geo/dendrochemistry);  ii) to increase the background and experience of trainees in the different research areas, by engaging the fellows in training courses and workshops aimed at developing their scientific, communication, and management skills; and iii) to develop their transferable skills for future careers in academia or the private sector whilst advancing the research fields through the integration of research tools, development of reference datasets and new discoveries.", 575850.0, 3145053.0, "FORSEADISCOVERY", null, null, null, null, "http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk", null, "fp7_111385_959702384"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3EP", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF WALES TRINITY SAINT DAVID ROYAL CHARTER", 5261.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.uwtsd.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF WALES TRINITY SAINT DAVID ROYAL CHARTER", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-012841_coordinator"], ["3HB", "Foundations of Success", "Department for Education & Children Carmarthenshire County Council", 25393.0, "\"Foundations of Success\" will  increase the capacity of the Department of Education and Children, Carmarthenshire,  to build on notable past achievements through Comenius, refresh and modernise its approach to internationalisation,  and once again enter  the European stage through the auspices of the Erasmus + programme.  The project will enable members of Foundation Phase teaching staff and head teachers from four of the county's rural primary  schools to learn from effective practice at centres of excellence in both Italy and Iceland in adopting more creative teaching approaches and making best use of the outdoors.  They will be supported to put this into practice in their own establishments by the local authority advisory team with the aim of  improving engagement and participation of all Foundation Phase learners and  thus raise standards of attainment. The schools concerned will also be supported to participate in etwinning to continue to engage in professional dialogue with other practitioners as well as set up projects  to include their youngest pupils to develop a better understanding of and respect for diversity. These activities  will lead to the schools being better prepared  to meet the needs of the new curriculum to be introduced in Wales with its emphasis on  international perspectives and  developing learners as ethical and informed citizens of Wales and the world. It is envisaged that the schools concerned will  go on to embark on KA2 strategic partnerships to further build on the results of this project and embed an international dimension across the school and curriculum. Project outcomes  will be integrated into the development plans and schemes of work of the schools concerned, shared at local authority,  education consortium and national level , and further exploited and sustained through the creation of a workshop that will become part  and parcel of the  county's professional development training offer. The project will culminate with  consortium members and other stakeholders  collaborating on the hosting of an international training course in Carmarthenshire open to education professionals from across Europe to share our own take on integrating creative pedagogy, use of the outdoors, and international dimension in Foundation Phase.", "http://www.carmarthenshire.gov.uk", "Department for Education & Children Carmarthenshire County Council", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023437_coordinator"], ["3EP", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF WALES TRINITY SAINT DAVID ROYAL CHARTER", 12736.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.uwtsd.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF WALES TRINITY SAINT DAVID ROYAL CHARTER", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035927_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["3EP", "CARMARTHENSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL*WESTWALES EUROPEAN CENTRE WWEC", 20297.0, "Information outlets (16.03.01.03)", "fts_2016_66598", 2016], ["3EP", "UNIVERSITY OF WALES TRINITY SAINT DAVID ROYAL CHARTER*UWTSD", 98578.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_24487", 2017], ["3EP", "UNIVERSITY OF WALES TRINITY SAINT DAVID ROYAL CHARTER*UWTSD", 77940.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_31476", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "SA31"}
