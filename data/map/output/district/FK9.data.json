The broader spectral coverage towards the UV and SWIR will be exploited e.g. to improve atmospheric correction and TSM retrieval in turbid waters and improve the retrieval of yellow matter. Hyperspectral signatures will be exploited by new analysis methods to derive e.g. phytoplankton functional types and their percentage in the total biomass and discrimate between macrophyte species.  \nTo develop these products, a large suite of in-situ and airborne hyperspectral images of European inland waters is already available for INFORM.

To this end, a novel diagnostic tool based on an isothermal padlock probe (IPP) assay for CCHFV RNA detection in cells has been developed. Further diagnostic assays based on immunosensing and lateral flow dipsticks (LFDs) are being developed for the detection of viral proteins.\n\nEpidemiological studies have commenced with the collection of tissue samples from infected cases and which have been stored in a biobank.

A greater public awareness, the need to protect natural resources and increase the food safety requires the development and implementation of new environmental regulations. There is therefore an urgent need to address this negative environmental impact of salmon farming. To date, two means are available 1) preventing fish escaping by improving cage design and containment or 2) produce sterile fish. Although considerable technological advances have been made in the design of cage systems, no system will be fully reliable as escapees through natural disasters are inevitable. Therefore, there is a clear need to revive the previously abandoned triploid concept as the only means, known to date, to address the environmental impact of escapees contributing to genetic pollution. Furthermore, the production of sterile fish would be very beneficial to salmon breeders as a way to protect their domesticated stocks which are the result of long and costly selection processes aiming to improve important traits such as disease resistance, growth performance and flesh quality. Triploidy would also alleviate early maturation problems and subsequent welfare associated infringements and decreased quality standards. However, prior to discussing the potential implementation of such a radical change within the salmon farming industry, previously based on equivocal results, a sounder understanding of triploid requirements and performances is needed at a commercial scale given the significant advancement in rearing protocols made throughout the production cycle over the last decades.

Indeed the high susceptibility of Flavobacterium for the antibiotics commonly used in EU fish farms has been recorded. Alternative methods of disease control are needed for which the use of bacteria as probiotics and/or water treatments is gaining attention. Thus, the role of the beneficial bacteria is to exclude pathogens and promote the good indigenous microbial flora in fish.

The research will focus on three bacterial cultures which have been highlighted in preliminary in vitro and in vivo work by the researcher, to determine their mode of action for disease control in salmonid culture. As Flavobacterium usually affects the host through external surfaces, it is proposed to study how the beneficial bacteria exclude the pathogen from these surfaces.

With declining fisheries, farmed fish constitute an increasing proportion of the fish in the food basket. n-3 HUFA in farmed fish has been obtained using fish oils (FO), derived from feed grade marine fisheries, in the feeds. This practice is not sustainable, and will constrain growth of aquaculture and will further pressurise these dwindling stocks. In this scenario, sustainable alternatives to FO are urgently required, with vegetable oils (VO) the prime candidates. However, VO are rich in short chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) but devoid of the n-3 HUFA abundant in FO. As with all vertebrates, PUFA are essential in the diet of fish, but requirements vary with species. Generally, in marine fish, the dietary requirement is for HUFA, rather than shorter chain PUFA found in VO. Feeding marine fish on VO can reduce health condition, and also lower the n-3 HUFA content of the flesh compromising their nutritional value to the human consumer. HUFA can be biosynthesised from short-chain PUFA in reactions catalysed by fatty acid desaturase enzymes. Evidence suggests that the dependence of marine fish on dietary HUFA is caused by deficiency in the activity of one or more of the key fatty acid desaturase enzyme needed for its synthesis. The objective of this project is to study these enzymes in cobia Rachycentron canadum, a marine fish with a huge growth rate when fed on FO.

Turing Machines used in biology and elsewhere in science today are Newtonian in a broad sense because they deal exclusively with syntax and inference rules based on discrete logic in absolute space and time to deliver predictable behaviour. Despite this approach being extraordinarily useful in engineering human processes, the interactions within the real world has proven to be vague and relational in many ways. A profoundly new understanding of the role of biology in natural and engineering sciences needs to be set out. Our driving argument is that living systems have fundamentally different notions of self-organization from those in engineering sciences.

It is now a serious public health crisis of international concern. The numbers of cases are still increasing 11 months after the first case was described (December 2013): by mid-November 2014 approximately 15000 individuals have been infected and the epidemic is still not under control. The direct effects of this outbreak include disruption of standard medical care, insecurity and social disruption in countries that were already struggling to recover from decades of war. One of the most important key actions to limit and stop the spread of this deadly disease is to identify and isolate the EBOV-infected patients. The diagnosis of Ebola Virus infections has in the past, been performed overwhelmingly in specialist reference laboratories with high-performance molecular, serological and culture methods. In recent years many of these functions have been mobilised into rapid response mobile laboratories. Indeed several of these units supported by European, CDC/USA, Canadian, Chinese and African states have been set up to help the current outbreak by performing laboratory diagnosis, in collaboration with national centres in West Africa. While this type of response has been effective in helping control past EVD outbreaks in rural parts of Africa, it has not been as effective at controlling the current outbreak, which is now spreading in densely populated city and slum areas. Unfortunately, the diagnostic procedures currently used in the mobile laboratories are associated with several problems: i) there are a limited number of diagnostic hubs, ii) performing the diagnostic tests correctly requires specialist training, skill and experience, consequently there a limited numbers of trained staff, iii) the distance between the point of care and diagnostic hubs means that patients cannot be rapidly isolated and thus spread the virus and iv) there are serious biosafety aspects of handling and transporting hazard group 4 infectious samples from hospitals/emergency medical units to the diagnostic hubs. \nThe EbolaMoDRAD project plans to investigate and focus our activities on developing robust, sensitive and rapid diagnostic tools that can be used at the point of care for field investigation.

These mobilities include the creation of 70% of training activities (training of trainers) and the remaining 30% of job shadowing (direct observation). Short mobilities are 72 and will be implemented in the 6 countries mentioned above. The project also provides training packages of longer duration, two weeks, for the staff who will acquire language skills and in particular  the use of technology in teaching of foreign languages and skills and knowledge of the CLIL method for teachers NOT of foreign language.\r\nThese 10 mobilities will be realized in Spain and in the United Kingdom with host partners specialized in the provision of foreign language courses and CLIL method. Even in this second case the mobilities will be constituted by  a part of training of trainers (about 70% of the duration of mobility) and a part of job shadowing (the remaining 30% of the duration). The mobilities provide in both cases, a survey of the knowledge and skills acquired in the course of mobility by the participant; more realistically participants will realize the acquisition of small parts of very specific learning outcomes, that the beneficiaries may transfer in their job context to address concrete problems of their daily work, and that will allow them to contribute to the methodological changes within their organizations. \r\n\r\nThe detection will be done through specific monitoring tools (GRIDS) aimed to the external evaluation and to self-assessment of learning outcomes.
