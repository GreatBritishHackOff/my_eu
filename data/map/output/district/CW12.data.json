However, it also has some drawbacks which are becoming more significant with increasing health and safety and environmental concerns; having significant quantities of highly combustible gases is undesirable; dedicated training on safety aspects of handling oxy-acetylene; the production and transportation of large quantities of combustible gas is damaging to the environment.\nIn project SafeFlame, an alternative to oxy-acetylene heating will be developed, validated and exploited, particularly for SME fabricators.\nOxy-hydrogen flames can be generated by the combustion of oxygen and hydrogen produced locally using an electrochemical cell. This approach has the following advantages over oxy-acetylene heating:\n\n\u2022The cell is highly portable, reducing transportation costs and increasing the flexibility of the process.\n\u2022The fuel is water which is widely available and low cost.\n\u2022The process requires electricity to generate the gases but is >60% efficient.\n\u2022Storage of combustible gas is eliminated\n\u2022The system can be deployed flexibly and is cost-effective compared with oxy-acetylene.\n\u2022Control over the combustion process will enable reducing or oxidising conditions to prevail during the heating process.\n\nThe aim is to develop and validate the use of oxy-hydrogen combustion as an alternative to oxy-acetylene, for applications which could include precision welding, brazing and soldering, cutting, repair and heat treatment.\n\nThe project will involve the specification of the required heating for a given application, different design(s) of electrolyser, the design of heating torch (including process modelling) tailored to the application, product integration, process trials and validation, the development of case studies, dissemination activities and training.", 129705.0, 2167172.0, "SafeFlame", null, null, null, "http://www.safeflameproject.eu/", "http://www.brazingandsoldering.org", null, "fp7_100970_965174057"], ["1QJ", "Enabling Future Arrays in Tidal", "Hmk Technical Services Limited", "In this flagship project, the EnFAIT (Enabling Future Arrays in Tidal) Team, a partnership of leading European companies, will demonstrate a grid-connected tidal energy array that: \n\n- demonstrates a step change in the lifetime cost of energy for tidal power; \n- proves that high array reliability & availability can be achieved with best practice maintenance regimes; \n- captures and disseminates substantial learning on fundamental issues for the ocean energy industry; \n- builds investor confidence; \n- takes a huge step towards creating a commercial, bankable tidal energy sector; and\n- at 6 turbines, will be the largest number of devices ever deployed in an ocean energy array. \n\nThis project will build upon an existing operational site, minimising development risk and allowing the generation of real-world results from day one.
