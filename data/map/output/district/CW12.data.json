However, it also has some drawbacks which are becoming more significant with increasing health and safety and environmental concerns; having significant quantities of highly combustible gases is undesirable; dedicated training on safety aspects of handling oxy-acetylene; the production and transportation of large quantities of combustible gas is damaging to the environment.\nIn project SafeFlame, an alternative to oxy-acetylene heating will be developed, validated and exploited, particularly for SME fabricators.\nOxy-hydrogen flames can be generated by the combustion of oxygen and hydrogen produced locally using an electrochemical cell.

Our cooperation with many successful and internationally active companies in the fields of agricultural machinery, chemistry and the metalworking industry demands a vocational training which prepares trainees, and the teaching staff as well for the challenges of a growing European job market. \r\nThe GEK is a European School which highly values on their European oriented education. One example is the variety of language courses on offer such as English, Dutch, French and Spanish. We consider it to be important that our students have the opportunity to use these languages in real-life professional situations. These take place during a three week internship work placement abroad.\r\nHere, our project background and our project objectives are closely linked. The VET mobilities of trainees as well as trainers lead to an increased cross-cultural understanding of a common Europe.\r\nThe experiences of our students abroad lead to a higher self-confidence and encourage them to seek for job possibilities beyond their country borders. Another project objective is that \u201cEurope\u201d is part of the school\u2019s curriculum. Lessons in various subjects deal with topics that are relevant for a European way of thinking. This is supported by the school\u2019s annual European week which offers the students a variety of projects focusing on Europe.   \r\nWith the start of ERASMUS+, the GEK is able to offer almost 100 mobility participants the chance to travel and work abroad in 2017/18. This is the largest number of participants so far and follows the plans of our district council in Cologne to raise the number of vocational mobilities to 10%.  These participants are for example technicians for illumination advertisements, electricians for automation engineering, chemical lab assistants, metal workers and technical assistants in the field of design.\r\nSo far we have organized VETPRO-projects for trainers and teachers which took them to our partners abroad for one week. Last year they worked under the title \u201cTeaching the European Way\u201d. Our IVT-projects under the title \u201cDifferent Places-Different Faces\u201d enabled our students to work for three weeks in Finland, Rumania, Malta, Great Britain and on the island of La Palma.\r\nAll those activities are now coming together with ERASMUS+ and the GEK is now offering future participants to work under the title \u201cIVT quality+\u201d. In addition to our student mobility under KA1, we also succesfully applied for a KA2 strategic partnership. \r\nBut the GEK does not only send students abroad, we also welcome our partner school\u2019s students from Finland here in the Rhineland area. The teachers and trainers of the GEK organize accommodation and internships with our cooperating companies in the field of electrical engineering, chemistry and design. These internships usually last from four to six weeks.\r\nOur project implementation has been consistently improved and is now divided into 3 main stages: The first stage is the application phase. In this stage students qualify by participating in cross-cultural preparation lessons. Here they also create a europass CV in English and pass a mobility interview, to show their motivation to work abroad. This stage ends in an intercultural evening which prepares all the participants for their upcoming departure day.\r\nThe second stage is their actual stay abroad. During this time, the students are monitored, both by the local partners as well as the responsible teachers and trainers of the GEK. The participants document their linguistic, social, personal and professional impressions and experiences in a travel diary called \u201cTravelog\u201d. It is an important instrument of the third stage of the mobility project. This is where the evaluation of the experience abroad is going to take place. With the help of the Travelog their gained competence are documented and can be comprehended. Later on these competences are evaluated in our competence overview, which are used to fill out the europass Mobility certificate.\r\nThe project results, their benefits as well as their impact are closely related. The Europass Mobility is one example. It is used for future applications by our trainees after the end of their vocational training, as well as by our teaching staff for better career chances. This document increases their career prospects on both the national and European job market. \r\nOur collaboration with regional companies that employ apprentices of our foreign project partners, often results in the decrease of language barriers and more cultural acceptance. By implementing our European mobilities we do not only spread the idea of Europe within the GEK but also increasingly on a regional level.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA116-003909_9"], ["3JZ", "Erasmus+ mobilitet for l\u00e6rlinger  i Vestfold", "Optimum Social Care Initiatives Limited", 111260.0, "For more than 20 years our county has offered Erasmus + placements to apprentices as a centralized measure.  Using Erasmus+ and other EU programs  is a part of a regional political strategy focusing on using internationalization as a tool to perform the tasks assigned to our organsation and to improve the quality of the services we offer in the region. \r\nThis project will be one of 3 actions that will be coordinated by Vestfold county council the next few years. I 2017 we plan a consortium with staff mobility, where 8 out of 10 of the upper secondary schools in our region will take part in a Erasmus+ prosject. Together with 3 other local partners we also apply for a partnership project that will benefit one school in the first place and more schools in the long term perspective. Mobility for apprentices in VET is considered a very interesting possibility to make vocational training attractive, and to offer something extra for young persons who need more challenges and who are curious about other countries and vocational training abroad. Hopefully all the activities will contribute to a stronger focus and improved motivation for international experience and competence in our whole region in the educational sector.  It is also regarded as an advantage to implement more than 1 action and to benefit from the different initiatives for more than one target group. Placements for apprentices have become even more important with regard to the challenges common to Europe at the moment; to counteract prejudice and negative attitude towards immigrants and people from other countries. Meetings between peers across borders is a perfect way of reducing fear of strangers, and at the same time we make Norwegian vocational education known abroad. We apply for more or less the same number of mobilities as last time, for the same periods/weeks. \r\nFor the next period we will also continue our work with designing new documents. It takes a lot of time to test learning agreements and make them suitable for our target group. I 2016 we have made different versions of learning agreements, Memorandum of Understanding, evaluation forms, and plans for handling crisis. We also made a new leaflet presenting the offer of placements to curious apprentices. The work with all the documents is an important contribution to the quality assurance for the projects, but it is also demanding. They need to be accurate and precise, and also useful and understandable for all parties. \r\nIn 2016-2017 we have started cooperating with a new partner in Malta. So far it is looking good, and the partner is included in this application. Apart from one new partner, it is very important for us to continue working with old parnters who we know well and have a well functioning relationship with. As usual we think it is necessary to include accompanying persons for travel companions or visits during the placements of 13 weeks. We tend to think that most young persons travel a lot, but every year we meet young persons who are not experienced in travelling and who benefit greatly from an accompanying person. This makes a safer arrival or a chance to adjust the tasks when somebody visits. An accompanying person is another safety and quality measure.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-NO01-KA116-033926_5"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1QJ", "HMK TECHNICAL SERVICES LIMITED", 637612.0, "Making the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system (08.02.03.03)", "fts_2017_1355", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "CW12"}
