The main aim of the club's Academy is to scout and develop players who will potentially reach professional status. However, regardless of the level of success achieved in football, Apprentices receive advice and education that provide a solid platform from which they can move forward and make sound decisions in life. The framework for this education is the Advanced Apprentice in Sporting Excellence (AASE) programme, a unique sporting vocational qualification for young people with the realistic potential to achieve excellence in sport. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this project is to enhance and improve the vocational training and development of Apprentices at LFC. Working with host partner GLOBALL in Hungary, the project will also aim to provide greater exit and progression opportunities for Apprentices upon completion of the programme. The project will have 3 overarching strategic objectives: \r\n\r\n1. Facilitating the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into both the LFC Academy programme and Apprentices to evidence both formal and informal learning outcomes that contribute towards the achievement of AASE.\r\n\r\n2. Embedding the acquisition of Life Skills into the project activities in order to support LFC's overarching aim of inspiring positive change and building better futures.\r\n\r\n3. Exposing the Apprentices to the European progression opportunities in both sport and other careers so that these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nParticipants will be the circa 40 (male) Apprentices undertaking the LFC AASE programme in the 2018/19 football season (i.e. the 2017 and 2018 cohorts). These Apprentices are selected primarily on the basis of their football ability and therefore incorporate a wide range of academic abilities, socioeconomic circumstances and ethnic backgrounds.\r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe majority of the project activities will be delivered/facilitated by GLOBALL, including:\r\n- Regular training sessions to address the defined sports performance targets. \r\n- Games versus high quality Hungarian youth teams.\r\n- Daily feedback and evaluation sessions to confirm goal setting/reflection.\r\n\r\nGLOBALL has outstanding links at a local, regional and national level which will enable LFC to enhance the activities of participants. For example:\r\n- Access to professional Hungarian football teams.\r\n- A visit to the University of Corvinus University of Budapest.\r\n- Observation of a live professional fixtures. \r\n\r\nMETHODOLGY\r\n\r\nLFC will use the principles of the European Quality Charter for Mobility to set goals and define tasks for the key elements of the project:\r\n\r\n1) INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE: production of clear and accessible resources.\r\n2) LEARNING PLAN: clearly defining the project objectives and the role of each partner in achieving them.\r\n3) PERSONALISATION: pre-visit assessment of participants' desired learning outcomes.\r\n4) PREPARATION: a structured preparation programme tailored to individual needs.\r\n5) LANGUAGE: provision of formal and informal language training.\r\n6) LOGISTICS: a formal contract to be signed by both parties outlining practical and logistical responsibilities.\r\n7) MENTORING: provision of suitably qualified staff to facilitate achievement of individual goals and ensure integration.\r\n8) RECOGNITION: delivery of formal instruments to recognise individual learning outcomes.\r\n9) EVALUATION: comprehensive and objective evaluation of all aspects of the project.\r\n10) RESPONSIBILITIES: agreement by all parties on their roles and responsibilities in the successful delivery of the project, formalised in writing via a Memorandum of Understanding and individual participant Learning Plans. \r\n\r\nIMPACTS\r\n\r\nThe impacts on participants are expected to include:\r\n- Achievement of recognised vocational qualifications. \r\n- Development of life skills and experience that can be utilised throughout participants' education and careers.\r\n- Enhanced cultural and linguistic skills, facilitating openness to new opportunities both in the UK and Europe.\r\n- Improved knowledge and understanding of the European opportunities in sport and other careers.\r\n\r\nThe impacts on LFC are expected to include:\r\n- Enhancement of the LFC AASE programme both in terms of improved technical sporting quality of Apprentices and coaches, and also Apprentice achievement rates. \r\n- Implementation of best practice across the LFC AASE programme and also the wider Premier League AASE programme.\r\n- Improved exit and progression opportunities for Apprentices, both within sport and outside of it, and in the UK and Europe.", "http://www.liverpoolfc.com", "Liverpool Football Club and Athletics Grounds Ltd", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-035709_coordinator"], ["4EL", "Breaking Barriers Through Football Rotterdam 2018", "EVERTON IN THE COMMUNITY", 15021.0, "Football, and sport in general, is increasingly becoming recognised and used as a valid tool for community development and for addressing social issues. Football for development programmes are providing people from different backgrounds with valuable tools to actively make a difference in their own lives, and the lives of those in their community. By addressing the most pressing issues in each community, the programmes are contributing to positive social change on a European scale. \r\n\r\nFootball has the power to change lives. The positive physical benefits of football can address health issues; and the social aspects of participation in football can aid in tackling issues such as racism, employability skills, school attendance, and help to create positive community role models. Football can enhance individual development and self-confidence, and convey values of team spirit, fair play and responsibility. It teaches youth how to deal with victory and defeat, to solve problems and learn to respect rules. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the Youth Staff Exchange in Rotterdam is to break down invisible social barriers that exist between 26 young people from different cultural and religious backgrounds. The participating youth are between the ages of 17 and 23 years and have a diverse economic, cultural and religious background. The participating countries/clubs are Netherlands (Rotterdam) Portugal (Benfica Lisbon)  Scotland (Aberdeen) and England (Everton / Liverpool). \r\n\r\nThrough a variety of experiences during the exchange, the participants will develop a better understanding of one another, and of their differing cultures and customs, through discussions, collaborative presentations and sport activities. They will learn strategies and techniques to communicate their findings with friends and family and increase their leadership skills by being responsible for a particular activity.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the Breaking Barriers through Football Youth Exchange project promotes the involvement of young people in their communities, to discuss the potential invisible barriers that exist in society, and to explore strategies on how to overcome these barriers. The exchange will support young people to feel confident, raise their awareness of cultural diversity within the host city and in Europe by taking part in all aspects of society.", "http://www.evertonfc.com", null, "erasmus_2017-3-NL02-KA105-001931_3"], ["5QE", "Multiple Intelligences and Project Development Through Theatre", "No Place Productions", 14196.0, "This project is an international Training Course funded under the Key Action 1 of the Erasmus+ programme aimed at training youth workers and theatre professionals on the use of non-formal and theatrical methodologies in order to provide young people tools to develop their own artistic projects. In order to do so, we will use Howard Gardner\u2019s Multiple Intelligences Theory, developing workshops in each of the intelligences, and on how such knowledge can be apply in the project development. Furthermore, the training course aims to create new international partnership that could be the base of other European cooperation within the Erasmus+ programme. Besides at the workshops on multiple intelligences and project development, participants will take also part in cultural excursions and intercultural activities. Moreover, the participants will have the chance to visit ON&OFF facilities and try out some of the activities with a group of young people that have participated in workshops related to the Multiple Intelligences and theatre.", "http://www.noplaceproductions.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-3-ES02-KA105-010595_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "L4"}
