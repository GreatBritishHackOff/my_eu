By including a variety of stakeholders and disciplinary perspectives, it will grade and rank foreseeable ethical risks. Based on the study governance arrangements currently used to address ICT ethics in Europe, ETICA will recommend concrete governance structures to address the most salient ethical issues identified. These recommendations will form the basis of more general policy recommendations aimed at addressing ethical issues in emerging ICTs before or as they arise Taking an inclusive and interdisciplinary approach will ensure that ethical issues are identified early, recommendations will be viable and acceptable, and relevant policy suggestions will be developed. This will contribute to the larger aims of the Science in Society programme by developing democratic and open governance of ICT. Given the high importance of ICT to further a number of European policy goals, it is important that ethical issues are identified and addressed early. The provision of viable policy suggestions will have an impact well beyond the scientific community. Ethical issues have the potential to jeopardise the success of individual technical solutions. The acceptance of the scientific-technological basis of modern society requires that ethical questions are addressed openly and transparently. The ETICA project is therefore a contribution to the European Research Area and also to the quality of life of European citizens.

As a result, the \u20ac500m global advertising market is highly inefficient; advertisers are buying blindfold and publishers of genuinely engaging content are undervalued as the bad drives out the good.

Both organisers and artists exchange ideas that strengthen their practice, give room for new collaborations, and establish new audiences.

Their overnight reviews from Pilsen and subsequent summary pieces are published on the Aerowaves website.  Spring Forward reached audiences around the world through a Live Stream which attracted over 1,000 hours of viewing. 16 local Audience Development initiatives have now been funded through the Platform, and audiences for live performances throughout the year have almost doubled to 20,000.Aerowaves is a stable network of 41 dance experts from 32 European countries founded in 1996.
