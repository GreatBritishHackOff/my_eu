However, such a capability also offers profoundly new functionality for molecular-scale devices. The DIAMANT team has pioneered the discovery and development of diamond as a uniquely promising material system for solid-state molecular technologies: Diamond has exceptional optical and magnetic properties that are associated with dopant complexes -- or 'solid-state molecules' -- in the diamond lattice. The DIAMANT project will develop new technologies to enable placement of exactly one atom at a time into a selected location in the diamond lattice with nanometre precision. Control of magnetic and optical interactions between single dopants will enable engineering of artificial molecules with radically new functionalities. Applications in the fields of sensing and imaging at the nanoscale, novel data storage and information processing will be developed both theoretically and experimentally. The ability to control magnetic interactions on the atomic scale will enable miniaturisation of electronic devices down to the ultimate size limit -- single molecules. We will manufacture photonic crystal cavities and plasmonic structures in diamond to realise the optical interfaces required for reading-in and reading-out information from these molecular-scale devices.

Both materials possess durability and robustness to high temperature, radiation and electric field. Diamond material exhibits the best mechanical robustness and thermal conductivity, while GaN presents also high electron mobility, giving high power handling and efficiency. III-N systems have other desirable properties for sensor applications in extreme environments.

Short and ultrashort pulsed lasers enable producing structures with sub-micron accuracy, for example diesel injection nozzles which help reducing air pollution significantly when compared to nozzles made by conventional fabrication techniques. So far, most of the powerful industrial ultrafast laser sources are operating in the picosecond range, which is sufficient for precision micro-machining of metals. On the other hand, to achieve optimum precision in micro-machining of transparent materials like glass and ceramics, pulse durations in the order of 100 femtoseconds are required. Therefore, the main objective of the project is to demonstrate the feasibility of industrial high-average power ultrafast Ti:sapphire (Ti:Sa) lasers and their excellent qualification for demanding high-productivity precision laser mate-rial processing applications. To achieve the targeted high output powers, the thin-disk (TD) geometry shall be employed, which already enabled the efficient generation of up to 740 W of cw fundamental mode power from one Yb:YAG crystal. Symmetrical double-sided cooling with two transparent diamond heat spreaders shall be used to optimize the cooling of the thin Ti:Sa crystal. Within the project, two ultrafast Ti:Sa TD laser systems, one with chirped pulse amplification (CPA) to obtain high-energy pulses and the other without CPA for high repetition rates, both with a maximum average output power of at least 200 W at a pulse duration of well below 100 fs shall be demonstrated. The CPA system, comprising a multipass TD amplifier, shall achieve a pulse energy of 10 mJ at 20 kHz repetition rate. The multipass amplifier will be pumped by two nanosecond pulsed frequency-doubled solid-state lasers developed within the project which are operating at 532 nm with an average output power of 300 W each. The high-repetition rate system shall be a high-power TD oscillator with a pulse energy of 20 \u00b5J at about 10 MHz. A commercial cw Yb:YAG TD laser with intracavity frequency doubling emitting about 500 W at 515 nm shall be used as pump source.

The overall objective of this programme is to develop a nasal avian influenza vaccine using ChiSys\u00ae (chitosan), which is a chitosan-based technology of Archimedes Development Ltd.. Chitosan has already been tested with several nasally delivered antigens pre-clinically and clinically with excellent results. The most effective way of controlling a pandemic flu would be via the nasal route as this route is advantaged to generate both systemic and mucosal antibodies; the latter allowing virus control at its point of entry. In comparison the currently used injection route cannot achieve the mucosal response. Intranasal vaccination has further advantages: avoids the need for injection and safe disposal of syringes, eliminate the risk of HIV transmission through re-use or accidental contact with body fluids, have greater public compliance and well-suited to rapid mass global vaccination programmes. The scientific objectives of the project are: induce both systemic and mucosal immunity, evaluation of efficacy and toxicity in preclinical studies, evaluation of efficacy and safety profile in humans, provide a substantial level of cross-immunity against a drifted strains of H5 or H7, effective at low dose to meet the global demands from limited vaccine stockpiles, thermal stability so as to avoid refrigeration for storage and transportation and user friendly vaccine applicator.
