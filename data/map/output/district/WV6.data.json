It will do so by comparing and making use of the most recent relevant information from recent and ongoing EU projects by a set of carefully selected validation case studies  and in concise collaboration with key stakeholders from policy, industry and markets.The project fits under the overall umbrella of the Europe 2020 strategy for the building of a bioeconomy, as well as the targets for deployment of renewable energies and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.The project will build up a concise knowledge base both for the sustainable supply and logistics of nonfood biomass (quantities, costs, technological pathway options for 2020 and beyond), for the development of technology and market strategies to support the development of a \u201cresource efficient\u201d Bioeconomy for Europe. This includes industrial processes (i.e. bio-based industries) for manufacturing biomass-derived goods/products as well as energy conversion, both for large scale and small scale units.The research work will be organized in three individual but strongly interrelated Themes:\nTheme 1 will focus on methodological approaches, data collection and estimation of sustainable biomass potentials, resource efficient pathways and optimal logistical supply routes as well as will develop the computerized toolset.\nTheme 2 will make use of the findings of Theme 1 and develop a Vision, Strategies and an R&D roadmap for the sustainable delivery of non-food biomass feedstock at local, regional and pan European level.\nTheme 3 will validate the findings from Themes 1 and 2 and ensure the project outreach", 13759.0, 4060521.0, "S2BIOM", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_109514_951809591"], ["7XW", "Risk Management Software System for SMEs in the Construction Industry", "Computors Limited", "The construction sector is one of Europe's biggest industries accounting for 10% of Gross Domestic Product  with approximately 92% of manufacturers being SMEs. This sector directly employs 12 million EU citizens and 26 million workers are dependent on the sector. However, due to the global economic crisis, the last few years have been full of uncertainty for many companies in the construction and engineering industry.  These companies are facing fierce competition and winning new contracts as well as delivering on schedule and on budget is fundamental to their survival. Core to these problems are, enterprises and more especially SMEs are operating in a dynamic business environment with constant exposure to risk leading to underperformance, low productivity and sometimes businesses could stop trading overnight. This project therefore, aims at developing a cost effective, user friendly risk management system, which evaluates, monitors, and reviews both imminent and impending risks with a view to completely eliminate or minimise their impact.  RiMaCon consortium wishes to challenge and overcome the current non trivial, interdisciplinary and intersectoral barriers currently preventing the development and implementation of efficient risk management systems in SMEs. It will therefore design and develop a robust, reliable, and sustainable risk management prototype system suitable and affordable for the construction SMEs, possibly in a software format or a portal. This risk management prototype will be dynamic, flexible to adapt to different construction contexts. RiMaCon has already carried out preliminary survey / investigation and confirmed this need especially for SMEs who are under resourced, vulnerable and also lack the technology to develop a robust risk management system. RiMaCon (two Universities and two SMEs) is balanced in terms of expertise and knowledge  to tackle this problemn and will work with a large database of construction SMEs who would provide the data.", 32261.0, 736142.0, "RIMACON", null, null, null, null, "http://www.computors.com", null, "fp7_106772_926150957"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WV6"}
