This sector directly employs 12 million EU citizens and 26 million workers are dependent on the sector. However, due to the global economic crisis, the last few years have been full of uncertainty for many companies in the construction and engineering industry.  These companies are facing fierce competition and winning new contracts as well as delivering on schedule and on budget is fundamental to their survival. Core to these problems are, enterprises and more especially SMEs are operating in a dynamic business environment with constant exposure to risk leading to underperformance, low productivity and sometimes businesses could stop trading overnight. This project therefore, aims at developing a cost effective, user friendly risk management system, which evaluates, monitors, and reviews both imminent and impending risks with a view to completely eliminate or minimise their impact.  RiMaCon consortium wishes to challenge and overcome the current non trivial, interdisciplinary and intersectoral barriers currently preventing the development and implementation of efficient risk management systems in SMEs. It will therefore design and develop a robust, reliable, and sustainable risk management prototype system suitable and affordable for the construction SMEs, possibly in a software format or a portal. This risk management prototype will be dynamic, flexible to adapt to different construction contexts.

All participants gain a detailed understanding of other cultures, customs, lifestyles, social practices and work practices, expanding their horizons and positively impacting their learning. Consequently, they become more attractive to potential employers in the UK and abroad, and thus improving their employment prospects, in what is often a difficult and intensely competitive job market.\r\n\r\nStudents find the inclusion of a European work placement incredibly valuable, and for the participants it is an integral part of their studies that adds extra value to their course and experience. Participants feel a renewed sense of energy and enthusiasm for their course, which inspires and encourages other students to take part in future projects.
