However, those who are either incapacitated or elderly are often unable to take advantage of the opportunities offered by ICT. The dynamic nature and changing demands of the future European society is inevitably going to have socio-economic implications - with social inclusion at the forefront. Home automation is a $1.3bn industry with an estimated market value of $10bn by 2010, however the smart home market is an area with limited flexibility for the changing European society. The current solutions are expensive and require extensive expertise for operation. The market itself is fragmented, with the dominating players residing in the USA and Middle-East, as are the contributing devices/interfaces to the technology with little or no consideration for differing needs and abilities of the end-user. The Digital Smart Home Solution (DSHS) is a home automation system that will act as the \u2018glue\u2019 to integrate third-party devices compliant with the EIB/KNX communication standards. It will do so by providing a low-cost server architecture \u2013 the central intelligence unit (CIU) \u2013 comprising of a physical server (interfacing the devices), a software-based service gateway with underlying artificial intelligence capable of adapting the system to the intended user(s) and environment, and a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). Current limitations lie within ascertaining the system requirements of the disabled and elderly for such as system, as well as allowing the retro-fitting of third-party devices to become compliant with the DSHS.

(PROfessional COmpetences for local DEevelopment)  is a two-year project of international mobility which includes the provision of 48 scholarships to as many new graduates in computers, electronics, aeronautics, aiming at developing training courses lasting 120 days in enterprises located in Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom.It's proposed by a national consortium of mobility made by the Municipality of Baronissi, as Coordinator, 4 VET School \"Baronissi\", \"Galilei\", \"Mattei-Fortunato\", and \"Guido Dorso \", a Bank (BCC Fisciano) and  a communication company,  Iris Institute The project idea stems from an analysis of local needs and industry, made by members of the Consortium which showed that, in the Campania region, compared with an unemployment rate among the highest in Italy, the companies operating in the computers, electronics, and most recently also the airport, keep a positive growth trend and represent, for our graduates, a good source of employment. However, companies find that these graduates, left the school system, have serious weaknesses in relation to practical skills-operative and the soft skills, particularly language especially when graduates are working in companies operating in foreign markets. Therefore in the first months of joining the company, the activities of neo-matter is quite unproductive.The project, therefore, is to ensure that, through a placement abroad in companies of the sector, the new graduates should perfect their training, achieve competencies and technical skills and cross-claims by companies that offer them work, and ultimately, to access more easily and expertise in the world of work, which in turn, benefiting from human resources and youth already qualified, will see improved their performances.Target group are graduates from the Technical Institutes Consortium partners, selected after participating in tenders issued by the Municipality in collaboration with the sending schools. It's a two-years project and,   for each school, will be selected graduates in the year 2016 and 2017; the selection criteria will favor the motivation, knowledge of foreign languages and the vote of diploma requirements deemed critical to successfully undertake and effectiveness of an experience as electrifying as intense as the majority, never lived experiences of living away from the family context, until now; experience that, therefore,  requires tenacity, perseverance and adaptability.The selected beneficiaries, after a run-up cultural and pedagogical regarding the country of destination, and after signing the Learning Agreement, undertake their internship experience, lasting four months, in selected European companies, taking part at the same time and for all the training period,  in a language training online on the electronic platform designed and made available by the Erasmus+ program. During the internship they will be supervised and assisted constantly by a tutor, both in Italy and abroad, who will assess the progress during the course and the learning outcomes at the end of the internship. This will enable beneficiaries to obtain, once back in their country of origin, the Europass Mobility Document, the Europass CV, the European Language Passport, the Certificate of participation in language training online, indicating the level achieved, certificates expendable for entry into employment.The Municipality of Baronissi is the beneficiary of financing, general coordinator of the project, and point of reference for the Erasmus+ National  Agency;  partner schools are sending bodies, responsible for selecting, referring to the definition of Learning Outcomes; Iris Institute and the Bank  will set in the diffusion and dissemination of project results; The Bank will also act as sponsorship as reward 4 trainees, returning from the mobility experience abroad, with training vouchers redeemable for a specialization course in the field.Benefits are expected from the project on the direct beneficiaries, the new graduates who will consolidate the technical and professional knowledge and language skills, gain practical skills and operational, develop interpersonal and organizational skills, and last , but not least , develop an open mind on European citizenship.
