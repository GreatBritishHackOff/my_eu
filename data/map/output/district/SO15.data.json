The innovation in and rapid rate of shipbuilding are creating unprecedented challenges that call for a new paradigm: one that treats safety as a design objective. The 'prescription' approach whereby ships are understood to be safe based on their compliance with rules and constraints is discarded; it does not ensure a reliable minimum level of required survivability, and as such, this is where changes need to be introduced.\n\nA key http://www.goalds.org/ (GOALDS) objective was the development of an integrated formulation for assessing the survivability of passenger ships in damaged condition. To this end, project partners developed an accidents database, expanding the information currently available for analyses on other databases. Statistical analyses on the gathered data enabled team members to highlight shortcomings of existing formulations and to develop new ones.\n\nThe GOALDS team investigated, for the first time, the mechanism of flooding and subsequent ship loss resulting from bottom damages. One of their conclusions was that grounding damage should not constitute a significant threat to the survivability of a well-designed and properly operated passenger vessel, in calm water and in waves. \n\nAdditionally, they advanced new software for damage stability calculations based on their development of a new survival factor. The new formulation was programmed and tested by end users, with all parameters and criteria thoroughly discussed among the consortium members.

Bigger size offers bigger opportunities and economics of scale, but when a bigger ship accommodates more passengers there may be a higher risk, if evacuation is needed.

In the worst case, all flooding accidents may lead to the capsizing or sinking of the ship within a highly variable time frame.\n\nThe need to ensure safe return to port or at least sufficient time for abandonment, will form major challenge in ship design. However, the assessment of the available time and the evacuation decision are not easy tasks. This process is complicated and there is a notable lack of data.
