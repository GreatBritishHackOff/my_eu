Very long lasting (20\\ yrs) coating systems that offer reliable protection against corrosion/biofouling or corrosion/cavitation, and which also avoid the need for supplementary cathodic protection are not available. The need for such coatings is acute in the case of static offshore structures, where dry docking is not an option. The growth part of this market relates to new build structures ranging from offshore wind turbine foundations to ocean energy devices.\n\nThe SMEs proposing the ACORN project are interested in an alternative, highly differentiated and patentable technical solution to the above problem. The project will develop a new, patentable and long-lasting solution to the problem of marine biofouling, offering specific advantages for static offshore structures such as wind turbine towers and ocean energy generators. The new technology could also be extended to shipping in the longer term.\n\nACORN will take advantage of the proven long-term corrosion resistance of thermally sprayed aluminium (TSA) to provide a matrix coating with a proven life of 20\\ years in the sea. Into this porous TSA matrix, the ACORN research team proposes to introduce islands of environmentally friendly antifouling substances which can then be gradually exposed at the active surface of the coating as the TSA corrodes away at 10\u00b5m per year.\n\nThis will result in an entirely new, non-paint, approach to the long term protection of offshore structures. In addition to this, the project will also develop and prove a corrosion and cavitation-resistant coating with a 10\\ year design life, suitable for tidal energy generators.", 221210.0, 1035158.0, "ACORN", "Protecting long-term marine structures better", "When it comes to structures that cannot be dry-docked like ships can, there is a pressing need to extend the durability of reliable protective coating systems. Offshore wind turbines and ocean (wave and tidal) energy devices will benefit from improved eco-friendly formulations.", "Scientists have made great progress improving marine protective coatings. However, further work is necessary to extend service lives for structures that cannot be brought in for maintenance. EU support of the http://www.acorn-project.eu/ (ACORN) (Advanced coatings for offshore renewable energy) project will help scientists develop improved marine coatings. They address corrosion resistance, anti-fouling related to marine barnacles, and even cavitation resistance for structures in high-velocity environments such as tidal turbines.\n\nStarting with the well-established corrosion protector thermally sprayed aluminum for steel substrates, the team plans to embed islands of eco-friendly anti-fouling substances. This formulation will be designed to last more than 20 years for offshore steel structures, including docks, buoys, and those associated with conventional and renewable energy. In parallel, researchers are working on a corrosion- and cavitation-resistant coating with a lifetime of more than 10 years for tidal energy generators.\n\nWithin the first reporting period, the team defined the anti-fouling coating technology. Scientists chose a 99.5\u00a0% pure aluminum coating applied with the twin wire arc spraying method based on corrosion trials results and economic and production-related criteria. The eco-friendly anti-fouling substances were chosen for their performance, commercial availability and regulatory approval for use in EU waters. Scientists evaluated inert carriers for stability in seawater and hydrophobicity as well as for low processing temperature to protect the anti-fouling agents.\n\nThree different state-of-the-art cavitation-resistant coatings are currently being assessed for performance and compatibility with the substrate. Environmental safety is important in this formulation as well and the team is evaluating heavy metal content. Cost and production criteria are also being considered. Computer simulations will support experimental studies in a cavitation tunnel to fully assess each coating's performance under expected service conditions.\n\nThe cost of building, installing and operating large offshore structures such as those associated with energy production requires a large investment. For structures that cannot be dry-docked for maintenance, protective coatings must have very long service times. ACORN scientists are advancing the state of the art for maximum benefit to the competitiveness of operators. This will encourage more widespread installation and greater impact on meeting the global energy demand sustainably.
