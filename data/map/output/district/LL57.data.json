In metal mineral mines, microbial activities have both positive and negative consequences. Microorganisms reside on minerals, including sulfide ores such as pyrite and chalcopyrite, abundant mine ores in the UK and worldwide. Through microbial metabolism of the iron contained within these ores, sulphuric acid is produced, resulting in an acidic mine environment. Drainage from such mines enter watercourses and wetlands, producing acid mine drainage (AMD). In addition, toxic heavy metals such as lead, are more soluble at a lower pH and are thus usually present in AMD, adding to the environmental concern. While some of the common microbial species found in such mines have been well characterised, there remains significant questions regarding microbial communities as a unit, and their functioning, such as: i) are communities established quickly and do the species within those communities change over time, ii) which species are active and what are they doing, and iii) what effect does mineral chemistry (mineralogy), have on the structure and functioning of the communities. In answering these questions we take a step closer to reducing environmental impacts, through increased awareness of how human activities impact on the microbial activities and the resulting AMD produced. This research will answer the questions outlined above, using Parys mine in Wales, as the study site; a prime example of abandoned metal mines and once the world\u2019s largest producer of copper.

Recent investigations show that survival and fecundity are strongly affected by environmental conditions experienced during early life.. In particular, the conditions experienced by mothers and embryonic stages, can affect traits of individuals such as lipid reserves, or the latent ability to cope with thermal and osmotic stress. Therefore, important changes in survival, fecundity and population dynamics could be caused by changes in environmental conditions of the natal habitat, i.e. where the individuals are born as free-living organisms, but also, where adults mate and eggs/embryos develop associated to the mothers. In the marine habitat, climate change is provoking profound modifications of temperature and salinity, thereby affecting habitat conditions. Most marine animals develop through larval stages that disperse away from the natal habitat, but it is vital for the maintenance of populations that these individuals survive and recruit to the juvenile/adult stock. Maternal and embryonic effects on larval traits can be a source of variability in recruitment, thus acting as a conduit for local and global effects on populations.

I will further test an embodied cognition hypothesis that the same circuitry that is activated by appetitive stimuli also mediate more evolutionarily advanced reinforcers such as monetary compensation and social disgust. Methods.Single pulse TMS elicited Motor Evocated Potentials (MEPs) recorded from the tongue will serve as a measure of cortico-bulbar neuronal excitability during vision and/or smelling a range of rewarding/punishing stimuli.The excitability of cortico-bulbar innervation of the tongue could be particularly informative as a somatic marker of the activity in the reward-related neural circuits, and may provide a direct measure of the hedonic/disliking dimension conveyed by reinforcers. Relevance to the Work Programme. The project addresses the challenge for neuroscience to provide conceptual tools and methodologies for understanding, predicting and modelling the influences of reinforcement on human behaviour including economic decision making.

However, organisms differ in their life history strategy and habitat use, even if they are closely related; these differences may have profound effects on responses to stress. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate the combined role of climate driven variables (salinity, temperature) and anthropogenic compounds (pharmaceuticals) on aquatic animals with different life history strategy. Both salinity and temperature are forced by climate; concentrations of pharmaceuticals have been determined in coastal waters only recently and constitute an \u201cunknown\u201d as a source of larval mortality.

Indiscriminate antibiotic use contaminates the consumer food chain, threatens human populations via the lateral transfer of resistance genotypes to human pathogens, and ultimately reduces the effectiveness of these drugs in a clinical and veterinary context.

Also, we will disseminate the outcome of the project and maximize knowledge transfer across Europe through an educational environment \u2013 teaching the next generation \u2013 as well as more conventional routes.", 49557.0, 4585065.0, "DiscardLess", null, null, null, null, "http://www.tracenetwork.org", null, "h2020_193250_994878076"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["2DG", "M-Sparc", "Bangor University", "Construction  of Menai Science Park (MSparc) creating highly skilled long-term employment opportunities for local people, developing a knowledge-sharing environment and creating an economic hub in sectors such as low carbon, energy and environment and ICT.", "ERDF", 10214948.0, 20208799.0, "erdf_wales_80837"], ["2DG", "SEACAMS 2", "Bangor University", "Collaborative research and development between universities and industry to grow Wales\u2019 marine science sector and supporting the low carbon economy.", "ERDF", 11999999.0, 17142540.0, "erdf_wales_80860"], ["2DG", "Centre for Environmental Biotechnology", "Bangor University", "To establish a world leading facility, developing new biotechnologies for the chemical and advanced materials industries by exploiting biomolecules from extreme environments.", "ERDF", 5000000.0, 7604244.0, "erdf_wales_81280"], ["2DG", "KESS II", "Bangor University", "Partnering businesses with postgraduate research students to develop innovative research projects aimed at increasing the research capacity of welsh business.", "ESF", 28697461.0, 39868663.0, "esf_wales_80815"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["4DF", "BIC INNOVATION LTD*", 273589.0, "Promoting entrepreneurship and improving the competitiveness and access to markets of Union enterprises (02.02.01)", "fts_2017_1692", 2017], ["1LJ", "JCH INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY LIMITED", 303108.0, "Leadership in nanotechnologies, advanced materials, laser technology, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing and processing (08.02.02.01)", "fts_2017_6256", 2017], ["2DG", "BANGOR UNIVERSITY*", 196708.0, "Securing sufficient supplies of safe and high quality food and other bio-based products (05.09.03.01)", "fts_2017_7698", 2017], ["2DG", "BANGOR UNIVERSITY*", 238378.0, "Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie actions \u2014 generating, developing and transferring new skills, knowledge and innovation (15.03.01.01)", "fts_2017_9776", 2017], ["2DG", "BANGOR UNIVERSITY*", 99779.0, "Improving lifelong health and well-being (08.02.03.01)", "fts_2017_13387", 2017], ["4DF", "BIC INNOVATION LTD*", 57970.0, "Increasing innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (02.04.02.03)", "fts_2017_17588", 2017], ["2DG", "BANGOR UNIVERSITY*", 1308379.0, "Strengthening frontier research in the European Research Council (08.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_19176", 2017], ["2DG", "BANGOR UNIVERSITY*", 1265510.0, "Strengthening frontier research in the European Research Council (08.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_20594", 2017], ["2DG", "BANGOR UNIVERSITY*", 85679.0, "Erasmus+ \u2014 Contribution from the development cooperation instrument (DCI) (21.02.20)", "fts_2017_23550", 2017], ["4DF", "BIC INNOVATION LTD*", 19390.0, "Promoting entrepreneurship and improving the competitiveness and access to markets of Union enterprises (02.02.01)", "fts_2017_35472", 2017], ["2DG", "BANGOR UNIVERSITY*", 48552.0, "Promoting entrepreneurship and improving the competitiveness and access to markets of Union enterprises (02.02.01)", "fts_2017_38063", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "LL57"}
