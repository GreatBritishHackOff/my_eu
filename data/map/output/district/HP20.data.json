The  Main Activity of the project is an 8 -day seminar \u201eBreaking barriers\u201c to be held from 08. - 15. 09.2014 in Sillam\u00e4e, mostly in the  Sillam\u00e4e Youth Centre of Interest \"Beehive\", but there are also other venues for some activities of the project: Pannj\u00e4rve adventure park, Rakvere Police Museum, Sillam\u00e4e city centre.  The variety of indoor and outdoor activities will be used during the Main Activity: games, vertical dances on a building, street dance, group discussions, group and couple reflection, brainstorming ideas, lectures in the open air, workshops: storytelling, facial body art, creative youth music. The first 4 days of the Main Activity will be dedicated to building a team, ready to share and analyze each others experience, as well as to elaborating of a guidance booklet \"Breaking barriers\". During first 4 days each partner will be obliged to introduce several methods of working during the seminar. The last 4 days of the Main Activity will be dedicated to practical application of methods, analyzing of feedback and validation of results. The key event of the seminar is a city workshop festival, organized for youth workers, teachers, community workers, Juvenile Police officers and youth from Sillam\u00e4e and neighboring cities, in terms of which partners will apply practically their best practices.\r\nThe main objectives of the project is to provide a space for the participants to share their expertise and experience at European level and present tools and approaches to deal with at-risk youngsters. In addition, the project aims at providing the platform for discussion between the participants, based on theoretical and practical inputs around the theme which is relevant to the work with at-risk groups. The good practices and new methods that will prove themselves to be effective will be integrated therefore into participants' daily activities. \r\nWith the purpose that this practical luggage of tools and approaches would be noticed and borrowed by others, the participants of the project have also set a goal to make and to disseminate a guidance brochure, comprising description of best practices applied, adaptability and applicability of working methods used, learning outcomes, contact details of partner organisations, project blog links, etc.", "http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/bcc", null, "erasmus_2014-2-EE01-KA105-000437_1"], ["1UX", "Open Doors: Diversity Matters", "BUCKINGHAMSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL", 23528.0, "'Open Doors: Diversity Matters is an effective project that concerns LGBT minority groups and is a project by Rooted and five partner organisations from Estonia, UK, Spain, Lithuania, and Turkey. The Main Activity of the project is a 7-day seminar to be held from 12th -18th July 2015 in Qawra, mostly at the church youth centre quarters but there will also be other venues for particular activities of the project. \r\n\r\nThis project will mainly take the form of a conference-based seminar in which expert guest speakers working within the LGBT field will be invited to deliver a conference on a chosen LGBT theme. The themes chosen will focus on LGBT awareness, the importance of reaching out to LGBT young people and strengthening unity and cohesion with other peers regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity. It is hoped that through these themes youth workers are better exposed to the realities of LGBT young people and hence better equipped to potentially reaching out to LGBT young people in youth clubs and other social settings. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this approach is to meet young people where they are and help them protect themselves from alcohol, drugs, sexual abuse and other risks. This approach is relevant to LGBT youth who are the same as all young people when it comes to many of the risks related to early and secretive sexual activity. Here, however, problems are compounded by the absence of social support, adult role models, and relevant sex education within a non-heterosexual environment.\r\n  \r\nAll partners will work together towards attaining a good base of knowledge and understanding of the unique and complex needs of LGBT youth and translate best practices into tools for youth workers to use and serve LGBT youth experiencing problems and ultimately improve the lives of these very important young people. \r\n \r\nThrough this project youth workers will gain more knowledge in how to play an important role in every community, where they will be capable to provide this minority group support, advice about their current lives and future pathways and the chance to develop skills and make new friends. They will also help give rise to LGBT- friendly youth groups, which do not isolate, but rather integrate these youth with the others because after all, LGBT is nothing to be afraid of; it is just another expression of human sexuality.  We have to bear in mind that youth workers are a vital resource for young LGBT people, giving them access to information and support in a correct and healthy manner, that they may not be able to get anywhere else and without being abused. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of the project will provide a space for the participants to share their expertise and experience at a European level and present tools and approaches to deal with youngsters who are being excluded for one thing or another.

We we will be working with cultural organisations looking at costume design, performances and traditional dance and music to build a basis of knowledge of Carnival Culture in both countries.  Besides, the participants will be working and developing their own original music/dance piece and performing during Carnival in Malta in February 2016 and also in the UK in October 2015 during Black History Month. \r\n\r\nThe project has a duration of 272 days and is about 12 young people from two different countries; 6 from Malta and 6 from the United Kingdom working together in new territories using Sustainable Creative Arts Therapy to empower and help educate other young people, people at risk of social exclusion and young people with fewer opportunities whilst learning about different cultures and carnival traditions. Many young people may often find themselves shorn of any creative ideas and activities that may help them deal with the pressures of a very hectic way of life and the stress that comes with it. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to help bridge the gap between young people\u2019s stressful lives and their leisure, quality time. We will find ways to deal with this teething problem which in the long term can have adverse effects on youth because they will not be able to find appropriate things to fill up their valuable free time. \r\n\r\nThis innovative project will give participants the opportunity to share experiences and learn from each other. It will make them more aware of the importance of physical activity and emotional wellbeing through dance and music therapy and the making of artistic carnival costumes out of normally discarded clothes and items. It will provide a space for the participants to share their expertise and experience at a European level and present tools and approaches to deal with youngsters who are being excluded for one thing or another.

They will be able to share with the group their own perspectives, experiences and realities to make the campaigns as real and as relevant as possible.\r\n \r\nEach country will research and share a youth issue with the group and form 5 campaign groups using mixed media to create campaigns to be taken back to each country. The campaigns will be youth led, youth focused and be appealing to young people. Issues will be discussed in detail at the APV and countries will be responsible for preparing a workshop on their chosen area before the exchange takes place.\r\n\r\nUsing a variety of non-formal learning using creative, interactive and mixed media methods the groups will be able to work with radio, podcasting, print, photography, music, film and performance to create a final outcome for their campaign. Whether it is a short film, poster campaign, vodcast, flash mob or eco graffiti; the exchange will use alternative methods to inspire and produce campaigns to awaken young peoples consciousness and provoke thought and raise awareness of their youth led issues. \r\n\r\nOnce the campaigns have been finalised and completed they will be distributed to not only within their home country, but also across the 'Active Voice' Youth Exchange network and viral online.
