The teaching of a foreign language is now a statutory requirement in the national curriculum.  Our pupils' needs as global citizens involve their acquisition of linguistic skills to prepare them effectively for the future labour market as they will be equipped to make the most of available opportunities across the EU.   In order to achieve this our teachers need to develop effective pedagogy and strategies/skills and resources to effectively teach foreign languages.  These development needs can start to be achieved by working with Szkola Podstawowa nr 118 who have a proven track record of effectively teaching foreign languages to primary and secondary children.  Our teachers will be able to observe and share good practice and resources and acquire skills and tools for learning.\r\n\r\nOur school is an experienced Eco school in our country but has no experience of Eco and sustainable work, ideas and practices in other countries.  In order to develop a national and international sustainable school award our teachers and leaders need to learn about different systems, requirements and policies so that they are able to develop a suitable, relevant and robust award to promote best practice in sustainability in our country and parts of the EU.  This will meet the needs of our learners and learners in other schools as global citizens with a responsibility for looking after our planet and its resources.  Szkola Podstawowa nr 118 is a highly regarded Eco school in Poland and has won many sustainable school awards including the Green Flag.  By sharing best practice, observing policies and meeting key people with responsibility for Eco work we can start to achieve our objective through collaborative ideas and plans for the international dimension of the award.\r\n\r\nPromoting common moral and democratic values is a key requirement of all schools in England.  Five years ago we achieved the UNICEF Rights Respecting School level 1 award.  However the pupils currently at the school are different and they have not benefited from key learning to achieve the award.  Our pupils need to learn about the key European values of human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality and the respect for human rights and by linking with another school in the EU our pupils can share these values and start to break down barriers between different cultures and countries by focusing on what values we share and have in common. The project will enable the pupils and staff to explore and share these values with people from another country, and then embed them in our planned curriculum as we work towards UNICEF's 'Rights Respecting School' award level 2.\r\n\r\nNumber and Profile of Participants:\r\nWe have three senior staff who are the participants on this project:\r\nMrs Mary Simmons (paid member of staff) - BEd degree; National Leader of Education (NLE)\r\nShe led St Francis Xavier as a Head Teacher for 18years to an Ofsted outstanding judgment as well as numerous awards including: Eco School status; Rights Respecting Schools; Teaching School status; ICT Mark.  her key skills include leadership, planning professional development for staff and coaching and mentoring.\r\n\r\nMr Andrew Dickinson (paid member of staff) - BA (Hons) degree; PGCE; NPQH \r\nHe is currently the Head Teacher.  He was previously the Deputy Head Teacher and part of the co-leadership in achieving the awards listed above.  His key skills include teaching and learning and curriculum development (including leading international dimension and development.)\r\n\r\nMrs Magda Jones (paid member of staff) - BEd degree; SENCO (special educational needs coordinator).\r\nShe is an Assistant Head Teacher, early years leader and a teacher for over 30years.  She has also worked as an induction tutor for new staff and as a coach and mentor.  She is also a leader of modern foreign languages and inclusion and is currently a school governor.\r\n\r\nDescription of Activities and Methodologies:\r\nThe main activity being undertaken as part of our project is job shadowing.  There will be two mobilities - one if the first ear and a follow-up in the second year.  Our participants will be learning from key staff at our partner school, sharing best practice and reflecting on their learning.  They will then be responsible for disseminating their learning back at St Francis Xavier through the development of action plans.\r\n\r\nShort description of impact envisaged:\r\nThe long term impact is that our children will see themselves and understand themselves to be global citizens with an understanding and appreciation of other cultures and countries.  It will also have a clear impact on all of our staff through their development and professional development, impacting on provision and future standards.", "http://www.st-francisxavier.sandwell.sch.uk", "St Francis Xavier Catholic Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012777_coordinator"], ["4BA", "Przez morze ku warto\u015bciom i lepszej szkole", "St Francis Xavier Catholic Primary School", 16013.0, "Our project is about observing teachers working in a similar school type (\u201cjob shadowing\u201d).As a result this observation, we hope to improve our school performance in the areas we diagnosed as weak and in need of improvement. We plan to achieve the following main goals:1. diversification and improving the effectiveness of our teaching methods (including ICT based ones), especially in teaching young learners (which is related to the lower age of starting obligatory education in Poland),2. improving teaching key competences (through implementing new elements of formative assessment, improving feedback to students and parents, wider use of group work, analyzing the observed consistent teaching policies, e.g. Building Learning Power),3. teaching values to children (ecology, being open to other cultures and religions, tolerance, kindness, truthfulness etc.),4. higher security level at the school,5. finding solutions for more effective work with students for whom the language of the country they are taught in is not their native (immigrants).Moreover, we hope to learn how to teach children who come to our school from other countries and how to deal with their communication problems.What is more, our mobility project is strictly related to the eTwinning project we have been involved in for half a year now. We believe that thanks to meeting our partners \u201cface to face\u201d we will be able to talk about what we have already achieved, to make detailed plans for the future, see the outcomes of the project and create real, not only virtual relationship with our partners. Our eTwinning project relates to the third main goal listed above, i.e. teaching values to children, as the project is based on moral short story by Bruno Ferreo \u2013\u201cThe Emperor\u2019s Horse\u201d.The project participants are a group of six teachers who teach different age groups and different subjects. They are characterized by the eagerness to learn and share their knowledge with others.We plan to organize four placements to our partner schools, during which we plan to:  outline the placement objectives, observe the lessons in the host school (bearing in mind the project main and specific aims), take part in staff briefing, assemblies, students\u2019 performances, see the effects of the students\u2019 work, observe the school site and equipment, teaching aids, displays, classroom arrangement and how this affects students involvement, observe the eTwinning project outcomes and sum up and evaluate the placement.We will use a number of evaluation methods to monitor the participants\u2019 work plan and progress during their placement, such as: attendance list, observation sheet (to be filled in by the participant, to be filled  in by the project coordinator), questionnaire (to be done by the participant, to be done by the host school teachers).We are absolutely sure that taking part in the Erasmus + project will be a breakthrough experience for its participants. Its main outcome will be the improved and more effective teaching, as stated in detail in the project aims. Furthermore, it will help make our students and teachers more tolerant and open to new experiences and teaching methods. Moreover, the teachers involved in the project will improve their English proficiency, which will consequently improve their students\u2019 English competence. We believe that our project will also have numerous longer term benefits. Thanks to it, we will acquire the openness to change and improvement, we will possibly take part in other European projects in the future, as well as we will get more job satisfaction from our work. We also think that the project will be the only possibility for the students from disadvantaged families (unemployment, poverty, limited access to culture) to meet children from other countries through their teachers. Thanks to it, they will hopefully feel Europe is close to them and accessible. They will get hope and belief that in the future they can be professionally linked with other European countries.", "http://www.st-francisxavier.sandwell.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PL01-KA101-024957_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B69"}
