Firstly, a Healthy nation is a Wealthy nation! An improvement in health leads to economic growth through long-term gains in human and physical capital, which ultimately raises productivity and per capita GDP. Secondly, Healthcare is one of the most expensive sectors, which accounts for 10% of the EU\u2019s GDP continuously becoming more expensive. Thirdly, as healthcare is traditionally very conservative with adopting ICT, while big healthcare data is becoming available, the expected impact of applying big data technologies in Healthcare is enormous. \nBigMedilytics will transform Europe\u2019s Healthcare sector by using state-of-the-art Big Data technologies to achieve breakthrough productivity in the sector by reducing cost, improving patient outcomes and delivering better access to healthcare facilities simultaneously, covering the entire Healthcare Continuum \u2013 from Prevention to Diagnosis, Treatment and Home Care throughout Europe.\nBigMedilytics produces: \n\u2022 A Big Data Healthcare Analytics Blueprint (defining platforms and components), which enables data integration and innovation spanning all the key players across the Healthcare Data Value Chains \n\u2022 Instantiations of the Blueprint which implement BigMedilytics concepts across 12 large-scale pilots accounting for an estimated 86% of deaths and 77% of the disease burden in Europe\n\u2022 The Best \u201cBig Data technology and Healthcare policy\u201d Practices related to big data technologies, new business models and European and national healthcare data policies and regulations.\nBigMedilytics will maximize the impact by using its Big Data Healthcare Analytics Blueprint and the Best Practices to scale-up the concepts demonstrated in the 12 pilots, to the whole Healthcare sector in Europe. It will use health records of more than 11 million patients across 8 countries and data from other sectors such as insurance and public sector.", 125929.0, 14776390.0, "BigMedilytics", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_213551_911525491"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["8EW", "MY MHEALTH LIMITED", 125935.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_1258", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "BH8"}
