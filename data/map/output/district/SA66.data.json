More than 60 million containers are handled in the main EU ports alone. These containers are forwarded by rail, sea or road transport. The transport sector provides more than ten million jobs and generates 10% of EU wealth measured by gross domestic product (GDP), equivalent to about one trillion Euros a year. Huge savings can be made for the SMEs in the transport sector by securing delivery time and place, improving the capacity utilisation of containers and reducing theft. A project focusing on electronic container security demonstrated savings of $378 to $462 per container per shipment due to improved monitoring of container movement and tampering attempts. The idea is to develop a tracking and security system with energy source and energy generation to be retrofitted in containers to enable tracking and security independently of fixed check point installations and satellite navigation systems. The supply chain will enjoy benefits from lower shrinkage and increased efficiency. The system will meet demands for increased security in the supply chain and provides location information and protection against crime. The system will increase security against terrorist attacks as it will sense and report tampering attempts before arriving to any crowded place and the container can be halted to reduce potential impacts. The aim of the project is to develop a system utilising a combination of commercial transmitters and cell phone base stations for low power, low cost positioning. The navigation will be based on signal parameters and IDs from commercial transmitters and GSM base stations combined with information in a central data base. Obtaining the position of a GSM base station from the operator is expensive so a clever algorithm is our key element to establish our own data base of coordinates", 81072.0, 1275998.0, "TRACKBOCS", null, null, null, "http://www.trackbocs.com/", "http://www.arbelelectronics.co.uk", null, "fp7_97845_998045611"], ["7RH", "Microwave Cleaning of Drilling Mud and Oil Containing Hazardous Waste", "Arbel Electronics Ltd", "Currently around 70 oil and gas exploration/production rigs drill in the North Sea and approximately 240 floating drilling rigs operate in the global industry. Totally there are several thousand drilling rigs where approximately 2400 rigs drilling for oil and natural gas in North America. Drilling processes are lubricated by a viscous oil/water invert emulsion known as drilling mud. Although Water Based Muds, (WBM), mostly are used in the top hole sections, down in the drilling/bore holes where temperatures can reach 200\u00baC, the mud used is still Oil Based Muds,( OBM) (mixture of 45% oil, 45% water and additives) or Synthetic Based Muds (SBM). The waste from the drilling process is a heavy sludge of rock, clay, sand and drilling mud (oil and brine). In 2004 the total amount cuttings from OBM and SBM generated on the Norwegian Shelf was nearly 250 000 tonnes cuttings and 45 000 tonnes drilling oil brought onshore. Recent operations in sensitive regions in the Barents sea even requires that WBM cannot be dumped and must be treated on-shore.  From 2003 and onwards Western European countries are expected to spend on average between 0.5% to 1.5% of GDP on soil remediation in primarily the agricultural sector, industrial plants, land development and municipalities. In Western Europe there are more than 600,000 contaminated sites with a market of about \u20ac 50 billion p.a.  A threshold of 0.1% Oil Content (OC) on landfill for drilling muds was established by the EU Revised European Waste Catalogue of 2002. This requires development of new technology to meet the requirements in a cost efficient manner as current state of the art solutions are either cost prohibitive or do not meet the requirements.   Our proposed project aims to help cleaning up drilling waste and land contamination at an attractive cost while meeting the 0.1% OC requirement. To achieve this we will develop an innovative, efficient and compact 2-stage microwave process line to fit in a 40 feet container.", null, 1306649.0, "MICROCLEANMUD", null, null, null, "http://www.microcleanmud.com", "http://www.arbelelectronics.co.uk", null, "fp7_107793_998045611"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SA66"}
