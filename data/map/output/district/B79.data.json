This training will consist in a pedagogical project gathering all the elements that form the movement (music, dancing, and graphic design) so as to comprehend this culture as a whole, and not only as separate disciplines.\r\nIndeed, the different elements composing the hip hop movement are too often taught separately, and not enough as a whole. Yet, in order for people to understand its values and get the best out of it, it seems necessary to show the youth leaders the impact an artistic and pedagogical project gathering all the disciplines can have.\r\nThe training will be based on the complementary skills of the participants, in order to create a shared artwork which will be filmed and showed to the public, on stage.\r\nThe video can then be used as a pedagogical resource for the partner organizations\u2019 works.\r\nThe main theme of the training will be solidarity. Although hip hop was formed through competition and individual performance and appears to be an individualistic movement, one of its main purposes is to build a more cohesive society.", "http://www.xl-synchronisity.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-2-FR02-KA105-000954_1"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["7XE", "Get on Track", "By Design Group", "Get On Track will engage, empower and enable 225 disadvantaged young people to access education and training opportunities through a 14 month inspirational sports and athlete driven programme.
