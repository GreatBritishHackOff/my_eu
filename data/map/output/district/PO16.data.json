In order to fulfil the commitment to the Kyoto Protocol, the world usage of fossil oil in transport sectors must be reduced. One important approach to achieving this goal is to increase the share of renewable sources such as feedstocks in conversion routes. These biomass conversion routes involve a number of difficulties that should be attended to first by a suitable process configuration to avoid catalyst poisoning in production of syngas. Second, a major problem in the production of syngas-derived fuel from renewable sources is the presence of contaminates in the product gas from biomass gasifiers. These impurities that cause catalytic poisoning should be completely removed prior to the entry in catalytic systems that utilize in upgrading steps. With the evolution of these advanced uses of biomass derived syngas, it becomes necessary to develop progressively more stringent gas cleaning systems. Therefore, the project's key goal is development of a novel gas cleanup in order to reduce impurities from the gasifier\u2019s product gas to limits required for upgrading to syngas using as a feedstock in production of vehicle fuels. To accomplish this target that biomass conversion should preserve high energy efficiency in the subsequent synthesis steps and prevent catalytic poisoning, an alternative product route and more efficient gas cleaning systems are required. Nevertheless, biomass conversion processes offer many economical and environmental benefits, but it is clear that conversion technology should be able to compete with other conversion routes, for example via methane. Therefore, this RTD programme combines European expertise in the field of gasification, different proficiencies in cleaning technologies, high ranking catalyst expertise, catalyst company, and two research companies with R&D activities in the fields to expedite the development and commercialization of research outcomes.", 166113.0, 3465637.0, "GREENSYNGAS", "Cleaning biomass-derived gas for biofuels", "In the quest to fulfil commitments to the Kyoto Protocol, biomass feedstocks have been found to represent a viable alternative to fossil fuel sources. To build on their potential, scientists set out to devise technologies for the removal of impurities and contaminants during processing.", "As part of the EU-funded 'Advanced cleaning devices for production of green syngas' (GREENSYNGAS) project, researchers made substantial progress towards this goal. For example, one of the project partners managed to develop novel filtering systems to remove particles from biomass-derived synthesis gas (syngas). The idea was to create syngas pure enough for conversion into biofuels for the transport sector and electricity generation, among other uses.\n\nThree techniques were developed. The first used physical removal of tars and another utilised catalytic reforming of the tar contaminants. A third system employed oxidative thermal treatment.\n\nThese promising prototypes fulfilled the aim of the project: to develop and demonstrate advanced syngas cleaning technologies using both chemical and physical methods.\n\nThe research drew on the expertise of those in the fields of gasification, cleaning technologies, catalysts, and product development and commercialisation. Project efforts resulted in a number of journal publications and results have been presented at 20 international conferences.\n\nFurther research will determine if this system and others investigated in the laboratory can be up-scaled for real-world applications. Biomass conversion processes offer many environmental and economic benefits. GREENSYNGAS has added a very necessary building block to this area of research and it is hoped that further studies could even result in commercialisation.", null, "http://www.porvairfiltration.com", "/docs/results/images/2013-06/55231.jpg", "fp7_85766_999716727"], ["8XG", "ChIP and MIRA for clinical diagnosis", "Porvair Filtration Group Limited", "DIA-ChIP seeks to develop state-of-the-art molecular techniques for the routine high-throughput analysis of clinical samples for advanced molecular diagnosis and biomedical research. This will be achieved through a collaborative partnership between academic, SME and public health partners interacting through the IAPP, and the secondments and recruitments it supports. New molecular diagnostics in clinical pathology need to be robust, cost effective and offer significant advantages over existing techniques. With the move towards personalised medicine the specificity of diagnosis will need to be enhanced significantly, yet in the short to medium term will need to be compatible with current gold standards of analysis. In this project the focus will be on the most important cancer affecting the female European population \u2013 Breast Cancer. The ability to analyse archived clinical material is currently limited to immuno-histochemistry and quantification the native biomolecules (DNA, RNA, protein). The advent of functional characterisation of these molecules i.e. DNA-protein interactions and DNA status will provide information to enhance diagnostic histopathology. Application to archival material will provide access to a hugely valuable resource and will contribute significantly to scientific understanding of disease processes by allowing the examination of large patient cohorts, and by facilitating direct comparison to model systems. Also by examining patient samples in concert with model human cell culture systems, alternatives to animal model systems will be developed.  DIA-ChIP features the creation of a strategic partnership between 4 groups that is critical in realising the project. The partners will develop strong long-term collaborative links for future research projects and intellectual exchange that will serve to strengthen each of the partners positions.

An EU-funded project developed new epigenetic techniques to diagnose endometrial cancer and better understand the related technology.", "The project 'ChIP and MIRA for clinical diagnosis' (DIA-CHIP) worked to develop state-of-the-art molecular techniques for routine, high-throughput analysis of the epigenetic status of clinical samples, particularly those fixed in formaldehyde/paraffin (FFPE), allowing for advanced molecular diagnosis and biomedical research unlocking the potential for screening large retrospective patient cohorts from clinical archives. The project realised its goals through collaborative partnership among three key sectors: business, academia and public health.\n\nNew molecular diagnostics need to be robust and cost effective, as well as offer significant advantages over existing techniques. Furthermore, with the move towards personalised medicine, diagnoses need to be far more specific. At this point in time, however, techniques also need to be compatible with current gold standards of analysis.\n\nWorking within this framework, researchers analysed endometrial cancer samples using DNA methylation detection technology. The researchers' focus was on specific targets, including the oestrogen receptor (ER) and downstream target genes of this important nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor.\n\nFor the first time, researchers were able to characterise regulation of molecular variants of the ER. The analysis was conducted using a range of techniques, from bisulphite sequencing for high-resolution analysis to MeDIP for low-resolution work. In fact, during the project's duration, MeDIP replaced MIRA as the technique of choice for low-resolution analysis.\n\nOther changes in technology occurred during this project. Shortly after it was funded, there was a global explosion in the area of epigenomics. At the same time, rapid development of ChIP-seq technology and DNA sequencing technologies occurred. As a result, microarray screening was replaced by a ChiP-seq approach. Work on refining this technology is ongoing.\n\nThe project was successful on many fronts. It advanced technologies for utilisation in epigenomics research, an area that grew significantly throughout the project's lifetime. The research resulted in several manuscripts for submission to scientific journals. It resulted in several new products being launched commercially. Finally, the project brought together partners who shared valuable insights and established lasting relationships.", null, "http://www.porvairfiltration.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/153890.jpg", "fp7_88296_999716727"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["7BJ", "WSX ENTERPRISE LIMITED*WSX", 15832.0, "Information outlets (16.03.01.03)", "fts_2016_69400", 2016], ["7BJ", "WSX ENTERPRISE LIMITED*WSX", 15020.0, "Information outlets (16.03.01.03)", "fts_2016_69858", 2016], ["7BJ", "WSX ENTERPRISE LIMITED*WSX", 16137.0, "Information outlets (16.03.01.03)", "fts_2017_67944", 2017], ["7BJ", "WSX ENTERPRISE LIMITED*WSX", 16137.0, "Information outlets (16.03.01.03)", "fts_2017_67945", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "PO16"}
