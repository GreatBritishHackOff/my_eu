The average cost of waste is \u20ac100/tonne (including landfill or incineration tax, administration, transport and raw material cost). Such high cost has burdened the industry greatly, and SMEs are particularly vulnerable to further increase of landfill tax. In response to the competitiveness of SMEs in this sector, our client is looking for an innovative technology to keep waste to minimum or ideally, zero. The project aims to develop an efficient technique to reduce waste in sheeting, stamping or roller-cutting of dough processing in the baking industry by 25%. By using tessellated roller-cutter with features, morphology of dough can be manipulated. Pieces of hexagonal dough are reshaped into desired forms (round or oval).

Reducing this will be important if Europe is to achieve ambitious emission reduction targets, reduce its excessive reliance on imported energy and the decrease costs to households and industry. The most effective way to decentralise energy production is to increase the amount of generation at source, in this case within the home. A common barrier to the adoption of most energy saving technologies is the high initial investment cost which results in long payback periods considering current energy prices. However, with prices on the rise, existing technologies such as solar thermal heating systems and heat pumps are becoming increasingly popular. Although both are reasonably efficient, existing solar thermal heating systems generally only provide up to 60% of a typical household\u2019s annual hot water demand. Air source heat pumps are more effective and can provide up to 100% of total household heating requirements but their performance decreases significantly in winter and they suffer from frost-build up. As these technologies are becoming commodity products, SME\u2019s in these markets are coming under increasing pressure from cheap and often unreliable imports from Asia.  It is therefore paramount that European SME\u2019s keep a technological edge over these competitors. We therefore propose to develop a novel solar air source heat pump system which is 25% more efficient than a typical air source heat pump and 7% more efficient than a combination of a standard ASHP and a solar thermal system while only costing 60% of the combined price of these separate systems.

A growth in single occupancy, an increase in multi-dwelling buildings (flats) and a fall in household floor space have all driven an increase in the purchase of combined washer-dryers, growing at 9% p.a.\n\nHowever, washer-dryers are inefficient, using as much as 50% more energy to wash and dry a load than separate systems. This is a concern both for energy consumption and cost for the user - estimated 15 million washer-dryers consume 18 TWh of electricity worth \u20ac300m and indirectly emit 10,000 tonnes of CO2 each year. As well as energy efficiency, washer-dryers also have practical limitations. Due to the small drum size of the machine compared to a dedicated tumble dryer, it is not possible to dry a full wash load in one go, adding to cost and significantly reducing convenience.\n\nLoWash will address these issues by creating a highly energy-efficient machine capable drying a complete wash load without user intervention. It will achieve this by combing an innovative hydraulic load balancing drum with a unique passive/active heat pump drying chain to create a washer-dryer capable of washing and drying a complete 7kg load without removing any of it from the machine. It will do this using <50% of the energy required by current washer dryers.\n\nRealising this vision would provide a \u20ac34m market opportunity to our consortium for washer-dryers.

How?\n\nThis project, http://www.lowash.eu (LOWASH), will refine technology and improve design. The newly designed machine will combine a hydraulic load-balancing drum with a passive/active heat pump drying chain creating a machine that washes and dries without stopping. A load of 7\u00a0kg will be washed and dried without a human opening and closing any doors or carrying out other operations.\n\nTo date, research shows the load-balancing system must be capable of detecting out of balance forces and offsetting the off balance rapidly due to the high-speed spinning action. The drum redesign incorporates these key concepts. The heat pump closed loop air drying system, successfully modelled and simulated, receives a signal to start itself.\n\nCertain features of the design are still under development. These include adapting an existing washing machine, efficiency best practices and cloud tunnel development.\n\nWhen this project is completed, the market opportunity is estimated at EUR\u00a034 million.

Moulded Paper Products (MPP) from China are up 20% cheaper than the equivalent EU products. Due to continued increase in prices there is a need for the EU industry to reduce cost affiliated with low energy efficiencies. A major portion of recovered fibre is sourced from local SMEs such as waste paper merchants, waste management companies and corrugated case manufacturers. The recovered paper market will be directly impacted through potentially higher demand. Demand from China for recovered fibre has pushed prices high. Exports globally estimated at over 13 million tonnes per annum (expected to increase by around 18 million by 2009) are used mainly for MPP manufacturing, which are subsequently exported back to Europe. Estimated growth volumes for existing and new markets, show that increasing usage of recovered fibre will be restrained, unless the industry can move forward on the following key issues: \u2022 Improvement in the ability to produce cost competitive products \u2022 Step change in the aesthetic characteristics of products, at competitive prices \u2022 Migration towards utilisation of post- consumer recovered fibre The Solution.

These ligno-cellulosic materials originated from rural locations will be upgraded and densified into uniform sizes at source, allowing cost-effective transportation to existing industrial sites. The core enabling technology is superheated steam processing (SHS). SHS has been implemented in diverse drying applications at industrial scales, due to its superior heat transfer properties. At pilot scales, SHS has been proven to torrefy biomass at temperatures up to 300\u00b0C with minimal ligno-cellulose breakdown. Unlike conventional torrefaction techniques, which use flue gases as heating medium, it does not contaminate the torrefied biomass and volatile fractions, allowing economic recovery of chemicals. Moreover, it is also readily scalable for continuous operation. In SteamBio, a transportable demonstrator unit will be operated at five different rural locations where it will be used to torrefy tonnage quantities of six different agro-forestry residues at a throughput of 500 kg/h. The demonstrator unit will be operated at these rural locations throughout the last twelve months of the project to allow for seasonal fluctuations in the composition of the materials being valorised. The torrefied biomass fractions (solid and liberated volatiles) will then be validated as green building blocks in commercially relevant chemical production and in bioenergy use. Life cycle experts will validate that SteamBio will have positive environmental impacts. A robust business strategy will be developed to enable the results to cross the 'valley of death' post-project and to ensure widespread market replication.
