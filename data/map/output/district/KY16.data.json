Our particular strength lies in the identification and quantification of transport proteins involved in membrane permeation at the cellular level combined with our expertise in quantifying the rate limiting steps of translocation at atomic level.

There is a growing concern that the loss of therapeutic options will present us with a post-antibiotic era where present and future medical advances are negated.  Resistant bacteria dramatically reduce the possibilities of treating infections effectively, and drastically increase the risk of complications with a fatal outcome.  Antimicrobial resistance, however, is an unavoidable consequence of antibiotic use and therefore new, effective antibacterials will always be needed and once developed should be used carefully, avoiding the overuse which can drive resistance.  Despite the recognized need for new antimicrobials for clinical use, the reality is that only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to market in the last 30 years and many drug developers have left the field.  This urgency is especially true when considering resistant Gram-negative infections where carbapenem-resistance is rising and use of drugs of last resort, such as colistin, is increasing. The New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs (ND4BB) initiative is a series of programmes designed to directly address some of the scientific challenges associated with antibacterial drug discovery and development.  The ND4BB ENABLE consortium will meet the challenges ahead by creating and optimising a portfolio of new antibiotics ranging from Hits through Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe overarching goals of the ENABLE consortium are to: 1) create a drug discovery platform with the expertise and resource base to prosecute multiple antibacterial programmes in parallel; and 2) increase the overall pipeline in the antibacterial area by applying this platform to optimise a variety of antibacterial programmes.  More specifically the key objectives of the consortium are designed to increase the overall pipeline of high quality, novel mode of action medicines to treat serious systemic Gram-negative infections by identifying three antibacterial Leads, two antibacterial Candidates and progressing at least one compound into preclinical and Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe platform group is made up of academics and SMEs from across Europe with the diverse expertise including from clinical microbiology, in vivo pharmacology, computational and medicinal chemistry, ADME profiling, PKPD modelling, pharmaceutics, assay development and screening all needed to undertake this programme.  This group, coupled with additional expertise and advice from within the EFPIA partners, will bring an unrivalled focus and breadth of judgment to this important area of research.  \n\nThe programmes are coming from institutions across Europe, initially with seven efforts from public partners, and arising from a novel discovery stage alliance between GSK and Sanofi.

Bringing together different disciplines for the common goals outlined in this proposal will make Europe the world-leader in antimicrobial drug discovery.

Thus, electrically pumped OSLs are mainly impeded by non-radiative losses by bimolecular recombination such as singlet-singlet, singlet-triplet and singlet-polaron quenching at higher excitation densities accompanied by the low charge carrier mobilities in the organic materials. These limitations might be overcome by organic crystals and crystalline films with well-defined long range molecular order which offer superior charge transport properties compared to amorphous materials.

Studies to measure how noise affects animals have suffered from a lack of observational tools. An important advance has been the development of multi-sensor tags that record the sounds experienced by animals and their movements. Field studies with tags on cetaceans have demonstrated surprisingly strong responses to single noise exposures but the short 1-2 day duration of current tags makes it impossible to evaluate their biological significance.

The different sensory systems, environmental constraints and strategies of these taxa will help in interpreting how and to what extent noise can change foraging rates and so impact fitness.

Optical regeneration can be promisingly performed using the four-wave mixing effect and is intended to reshape, re-amplify and retime the signal in the optical domain, which removes the need for oeo conversion and is transparent to the data rate. OSIRIS proposes to develop a multichannel regenerator based on four-wave mixing. The regenerator will be based on a photonic crystal waveguide that exploits slow light effects.

In Iraq, Afghanistan and the Middle East, peace and war exist in parallel and contemporary peace support operations simultaneously involve combat operations and building peace. Hence, the goal of establishing just and durable peace is a fundamental challenge to contemporary peacemakers and academics alike. In order to shed new theoretical and conceptual light on the problematique of building just and durable peace and to offer policy-relevant advice, the team JAD-PbP has identified three critical challenges, which constitute the core of the proposal. The first challenge focuses on the quest for justice in contemporary peace processes, which has become increasingly apparent as several violent conflicts and wars are distinguished by gross human rights violation and ethnic cleansing. The second challenge concerns the quest for durable peace. Several contemporary conflicts tend to resist negotiated settlement. Yet, the ones that do reach a peace agreement still have a poor track record on implementation. The third challenge relates to the quest for effective strategies, particularly concerning the involvement of international actors in peacebuilding. JAD-PbP is convinced that the only way to address these challenges is through an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on insights in peace and conflict research, international law, political science and international relations. JAD-PbP has four core scientific objectives: (1) Enhance theoretical and methodological conceptualisation of just and durable peace (2) Analyse legal and democratic accountability of peacebuilding strategies, including mapping international law and norms on the use of force for humanitarian reasons. (3) Examine the effectiveness of general peacebuilding strategies and evaluate to what extent they enhance just and durable peace  (4) Examine and compare EU:s peacebuilding strategies in Western Balkans and the Middle East", 147290.0, 1497760.0, "JAD-PBP", "A fairer vision for peace", "Peace cannot come at any cost and must integrate the concept of justice if there is to be long-lasting stability.

It analysed legal and democratic accountability of peace-building strategies, outlining existing international norms on the use of force by states for humanitarian reasons. This also involved assessing the legal and democratic accountability of states and international organisations in post-conflict peace-building as well as redefining the concept of jus post bellum, or 'law after war'.\n\nThe project developed an analytical and methodological framework for evaluating and comparing the EU's peace-building strategies. Overall, JAD-PBP improved ways to study durable peace, focusing on just peace as being qualitatively different from the notion of positive peace since it makes no universal claims. The project integrated concepts of international\u2013local dynamics, reconciliation and amnesty provisions in peace agreements into the equation.\n\nAnother important project achievement involved the identification of best practices, mechanisms and strategies to promote peace in line with demands for accountability and human rights protection. In this respect, JAD-PBP also assessed how the concepts of Demobilisation, Demilitarisation and Reintegration (DDR) and Security Sector Reforms (SSR) were combined with peace negotiations.

As the major part of this energy is produced from combustion of oil and natural gas, both the EU and the EU Building Sector are highly depended on imported fossil fuels. Moreover, the Sector is also a major contributor to Green-House Gas (GHG) emissions. To address issues concerning EU security of energy supply, EU contribution to climate change and in line with the Kyoto protocol and ongoing discussions in the European and International community, the EC has set the objectives of 30% reduction of its GHG emissions by 2020 and 20% increase of the share of renewable energy. The Building Sector, as a major industrial sector, has to significantly contribute to the realisation of these objectives. Thus, the trend for the Building Sector is to move from fossil fuels based energy production to the use of renewable energy sources (RES) and clean fuels to produce the required energy to cover the building energy needs. However, in order to ensure continuous operation of energy systems based on RES it is necessary to find a proper way to balance the intermittent nature of RES. Currently, the solution is to store the excess of the produced electricity in large-scale storage batteries, which present several drawbacks. In this frame, our concept is the development of an intelligent, self-sustained and zero CO2 emission hybrid energy system to cover electric power, heating and cooling loads (tri-generation) of either residential/commercial buildings or districts of buildings. In the proposed system, the primary energy will be harvested from RES and directly used to cover contingent loads, while the excess energy will be converted to hydrogen to be used as energy storage material and to be further applied as a green fuel to cover the building heating needs through direct combustion or to produce combined heating and electricity by means of fuel cells", 252187.0, 8510862.0, "H2SUSBUILD", "Hydrogen helps cut emissions from buildings", "An EU-funded project has demonstrated that safely stored hydrogen (H2) could complement the use of renewable energy in buildings.

This is despite estimates showing that scavenging accounts for more energy transfer in comparison to predation, clearly demonstrating its crucial role in determining ecosystem dynamics. Yet scavenging is a still a poorly understood behavior as despite its prevalence across predators, little explanation is available for the enormous level of variation in the level of scavenging both across species and with them. SCAVENGER proposes to address this imbalance using a state of the art simulation approach recently developed by the fellow to test the ecological and physiological drivers of scavenging behaviors and explore the importance of this behavior in extinct, extant and potential future ecosystems. By using a combination of biomechanics, energetics and macroecology in an agent based modeling framework I will test the drivers of scavenging efficiency focusing on the roles of body size, locomotion, biomechanics, population dynamics and environmental factors such as temperature.

As a result, highly durable and practically applicable OLEDs using these materials have been realized. However, the internal quantum efficiency of OLEDs based on fluorescent materials is only 25% because of the limit imposed by the electron spin-statistics under electrical excitation.

Dolphins use whistle modulation patterns for individual recognition, but if and how they use whistles for species recognition is unknown.

The challenge is to hold such particles in strong, highly localised traps, cool them and explore physics at the classical-quantum boundary.\nThe present proposal aims to address these issues with a number of clear routes to address acknowledged bottlenecks in the field. (i) Firstly the use of light propagation in complex media (such as a multimode fibre) combined with vacuum studies leads to an innovative route for trapping, confining and addressing microparticles in complex vacuum systems without the need for \u2018bulk\u2019 microscope objectives or conventional optics. This also facilitates trapping in such geometries and creating with ease loading and 'science' chambers for the proposed research. (ii) A further advance will be the use of nanostructures such as double nanohole arrays for trapping that, due to their strong light confinement lead to ultra-high trap stiffnesses. In turn this means the very high resultant oscillator frequency reduces the cooling needed to achieve the quantum ground state. (iii) Finally a third strand will look at loading antireflection coated particles into such traps. This can result in trap stiffnesses up to one to two orders of magnitude higher than currently seen, again allowing cooling to the ground state.\nThese ideas are disruptive and unconventional and unique to the applicant and host institute to the best of our knowledge.

This has diverted attention from the potentially important role of behaviour as a driver of connectivity in the marine environment. Aspects of a species' behaviour, such as migratory fidelity, social structure and feeding specialisations, can play a strong role in shaping connectivity and gene flow that has been largely been ignored in connectivity studies to date.\nI propose to address this knowledge gap by simultaneously harnessing leading empirical methods, micro-chemical markers and genomics, and integrating these into a novel Bayesian framework for testing hypothesis on the behavioural drivers of connectivity.

Southern right whales show maternally transmitted preferences for migratory destinations that could influence connectivity. The combination of well-described life-history traits and lack of barriers to dispersal makes the southern right whale an ideal species in which to investigate the importance of behaviour on connectivity.
