Second, I will use high-throughput RNA sequencing to characterize cooperative behaviour at the genomic level across levels of sociality (the sociogenomic approach). Third, I will investigate how cooperative behaviour is affected by two important ecological factors shared by these two insects: the biology of invasions and host-parasite interactions. Significant evidence suggests that invasive social insects escape from their natural parasites and pathogens and that the expression of cooperative behaviour increases on establishment in the invasive region. Both these factors are likely to be fundamental drivers of the great success shown by social insects in becoming invasive species.

The EU-funded METAPRO project aimed to optimise the production of several useful ISOs to demonstrate the tools and strategies developed for generic production of useful secondary metabolites in plants. \n\nGenetic engineering approaches were demonstrated for astaxanthin formation and crocin production using tomato and potato. These crops are commonly grown and are produced worldwide and thus amenable to modern agricultural practices. Most of the fundamental reactions involved in the ISO formation pathway have been previously established.\n\nProject results show that secondary metabolism is not a separate entity, but rather a component linked to primary and intermediary metabolism. It also became apparent that biosynthesis and sequestration are interlinked and changes in metabolite composition can alter cellular structures used for deposition. \n\nDuring trials, both enzymatic and non-enzymatic degradation of synthetised ISOs occurred. To overcome this problem, a down-stream encapsulation was developed to facilitate product stability. Implementation of the new strategies led to the generation of exceptionally high levels of ISOs. The prototypes are now available to perform production, technical and economic feasibility studies with a wide range of ketocarotenoid-producing varieties.\n\nMETAPRO is continuing dissemination of its findings at every opportunity to the scientific community, general public, schools and government agencies. Over the duration of the project, 30 peer-reviewed publications have been generated with several in high-impact journals such as Science, PNAS and Plant Cell.\n\nThe project advanced fundamental scientific knowledge and highlighted potential improved sustainable bio production.

Given the ease of transnational distribution of digitized musics, research will also follow certain genres as they circulate among diasporic groups. These and related issues will be studied in five countries, each intrinsically significant as well as yielding instructive comparisons between them: the UK, Cuba, Kenya, India and Turkey.

Loss of dystrophin leads to inflammation and replacement of muscle with fibrous tissue.\n\nDespite prenatal diagnosis, the incidence of DMD is 1 in 5 000 births due to novel mutations that arise in the dystrophin gene. The dystrophin gene is one of the largest known, with 79 different protein-coding regions referred to as exons. Mutations in one of these exons interfere with the rest of the gene being put together and producing a functional protein.\n\nIn Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), DMD mutations still produce a shortened but functional dystrophin protein, and most patients are able to walk and have a normal lifespan. This occurs because although some exons are missing, the remaining can join together.\n\nBased on this observation, scientists have developed a method known as exon skipping, which essentially encourages the cellular machinery to skip the mutated exon. For this purpose, they are using oligonucleotides as molecular patches to produce the shorter version of the dystrophin protein.\n\nPrior work by the members of the EU-funded http://www.skip-nmd.eu/ (SKIP-NMD) consortium successfully demonstrated the therapeutic outcome of skipping exon 51 in clinical trials with boys with DMD.

O-glycosylation (O-PTM) is always altered in carcinomas, creating novel O-PTM epitopes which induce auto-antibodies.  Our Main Objectives are therefore to:- 1.Use a novel glycopeptide microarray technology to identifiy, evaluate and validate an O-PTM auto-antibody signature as an early diagnostic biomarker, focusing on breast, ovarian, pancreatic and lung cancers.  2. Develop and validate novel ELISA-type assays for cancer specific glycoforms of the MUC1 and MUC16 glycoproteins (targets of current serum biomarker assays).

Since females of many species of animals mate with multiple males, it is now widely recognized that post-copulatory male competition and female choice are pervasive evolutionary forces acting on mating strategy. Sperm traits of males, and sperm storage and usage patterns by females would be possible proximate factors responsible for sperm precedence patterns. Loliginid squid offer an excellent opportunity to examine post-copulatory male-male and male-female interactions. Male squid have adult size dimorphism, associated with alternative mating tactics, and females have two distinct sperm storage sites on their bodies, correlated with mating tactics adopted by males. Sperm in both storage sites have the potential to achieve fertilizations during the egg laying process. So the presence of alternative sperm storage sites potentially makes a clear constraint for post-mating sperm competition and cryptic female choice dynamics.

This means male competition and female choice after mating are forces contributing to species evolution.", "The fact that females have multiple mating partners leads to males assuming different mating tactics. Differences among species in mating strategies are predicted to influence fertilisation opportunities and paternity bias, thus affecting male sperm allocation strategies. Large males groups follow and protect females during mating and egg laying, while small 'sneakers' make attempts to mate without challenging the consort male. Such alternative tactics create differences in sperm competition risk, which in turn often result in changes to a species' form and physiology.\n\nSneaker males are thought to put more energy into producing sperm so as to make up for disadvantages in behavioural competition. But sperm competition usually occurs inside the female after mating. This makes it difficult to distinguish the pre- and post-mating processes that drive sexual and natural selection and the effects on male evolution.\n\nFemale loliginid squid have two distinct sites where they store sperm, which can all be fertilised during the egg laying process. This phenomenon has been correlated with the different mating strategies adopted by males and clearly influences post-mating sperm competition and female choice dynamics.\n\n'How do post-copulatory male-male and male-female interactions shape the evolution of mating strategies?

These were applied to both squid species.\n\nData obtained indicate that the opportunity to fertilise affects sperm investment strategy. In L. bleekeri, alternative male mating tactics were associated with discontinuous spermatophore dimorphism. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) was correlated with mantle length, but was not different between male groups. However, higher GSI in smaller males within each tactic suggested strong intra-group sperm competition. Spermatophore dimorphism was also found in L. reynaudii and was also related to male tactic. But in this species, the relationship between male and spermatophore size was continuous, with higher GSI in smaller (sneaker) males.

In the second half of the 15th century, the chivalric poem in ottava rima, often anonymous, assumed a peculiar role in the process of political communication about the war against Muslims and the legitimation of power; it became also the place where those writers reprocessed societal fears about external enemies, the idea of the stranger, the need of alliances.

Yet despite the clear insights into globalization and the significance of trade for forging relations between cultures offered by a study of a modern trading node such as Yiwu, the city has yet to be the focus of sustained research. The proposed project, Trust, Global Traders, and Commodities is an integrated comparative programme of research that will provide new empirical data and comparative analysis on the global trade in low-grade Chinese-made commodities. Its focus will be on the ways in which transnational trading activities are conducted in the cosmopolitan and dynamic  city of Yiwu. This project\u2019s in-depth investigation of Yiwu, and its connections to the wider world through networks and flows of people, commodities, and knowledge, will yield ground-breaking perspectives on the precise ways in which trade facilitates the simultaneous exchange of commodities, practices, ideas, and identities.

As a result, current security mechanisms are commonly located within the cloud platform, hence compelling customers to trust cloud providers. However, customers might be reluctant to outsource sensitive data due to lack of control over data storage and management. To reach its full potential, cloud computing needs solid security mechanisms that enhance trust in cloud computing by allowing cloud customers to have a greater control over the security and privacy of their data.

Firstly, next-generation transcriptomics could allow us to delve deep into this complexity at the molecular level, on a scale that is simply not available in vertebrate social systems. I propose to track information flow through a natural group using brain gene expression profiles, to understand how dances elicit learning in the bee brain. Secondly, although bee foraging ranges are vast and diverse, social learning takes place in one centralized location (the hive). The social sciences now offer powerful new tools to analyze social networks, and I will use a cutting-edge network-based modelling approach to understand how the importance of social learning mechanisms shifts with ecology. In the face of global pollinator decline, understanding the contribution of foraging drivers to colony success has never been more pressing, but the importance of the dance language reaches far beyond food security concerns.
