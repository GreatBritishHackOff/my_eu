[Ref. 1] . Based on the extrapolation of data relating to the UK, French and German railways [Ref 1], the 500,000 kms of rail [Ref. 2] on the European rail network has an average estimated 5000 rail breaks annually with about 1500 due to weld failure. Although the number of weld failures is relatively small compared to the estimated 11 million alumino-thermic welds on the European network, it still accounts for about 20% of the total 7000\\ rail failures each year [Ref. 3]. There is no current available NDT method for the economic and reliable volumetric examination of alumino-thermic welds. This proposal describes the development of a rapid ultrasonic method for the safe and reliable NDT examination of the entire volume of in-situ alumino-thermic welds. The proposed ultrasonic system could be quickly deployed on track using a clamp-on device. The inspection scans will be carried out in a pre-determined sequence, and then the results compared with defect acceptance criteria that will be generated in the project. To achieve this objective, a rigorous analysis of the material properties, the defect interaction with the ultrasonic beams and the design of optimum scanning procedures will first be carried out. It is expected that the scans will be implemented by means of electronic scanning using novel phased arrays and multiple probes. The acceptance criteria will be generated by both Engineering Critical Assessment and fatigue tests on rail samples.", null, 1290171.0, "RAILECT", null, null, null, "http://www.railect.com", null, null, "fp7_92648_999436785"], ["1ES", "EUropean Training and Education for Medical Physics Experts in Radiology", "European Federation of Organisations for Medical Physics", "Medical exposures for radiological examinations represent the highest and fastest growing contribution to manmade radiation exposure in the EU underlying the need for medical physics experts (MPEs), regulators and scientists in industry to bring in new research results and expertise and to deploy resources in addressing this important issue.  The EC recognized the urgency and the EU tender \u2018European guidelines for the Medical Physics Expert (MPE)\u2019 (TREN/H4/167\u20102009) was issued to develop and update the role of MPEs in Europe. The final report has been approved by the EC and includes an agreed mission statement and key activities for MPEs. The new qualification framework defines the MPE as an MP who, through planned advanced training and CPD, achieves the highest level possible (i.e., European Qualifications Level 8) in her/his specialty.\nHowever, it is recognized that few Member States have the expertise and facilities to provide the necessary training. A preliminary survey among National Organisations of MP and medical device companies showed that a dedicated training scheme has become a necessity. Three end-users were identified: the hospital MPE, the scientist in industry and regulators assessing exposures in Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology.\nThe EUTEMPE-RX consortium will develop, put into practice and evaluate a new pilot EFTS for the MPE in Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, which includes both face-to-face and on-line teaching. The aim is to ensure that candidates become knowledgeable about all current issues in radiation safety culture in hospitals and to make the MPE a radiation protection advocate for patients.

Within this perspective, building and maintaining an advanced level of competence in RP, assuring sufficient well-trained personnel and organising an adequate knowledge management, is crucial. Effective education and training (E&T) is a critical element in these matters, helping to prevent the decline in expertise and to meet future demands. ENETRAP III adds new and innovative topics to existing E&T approaches in RP. It will further develop the European reference training scheme with additional specialized modules for Radiation Protection Experts working in medical, waste management and NPP. It will implement the ECVET principles and will establish targeted assistance from regulators that will play a crucial role in the endorsement of the proposed courses and learning objectives. ENETRAP III will also introduce a train-the-trainer strategy. All organised pilot sessions will be open to young and more experienced students and professionals. In this way, ENETRAP III aims to contribute to increasing the attractiveness of nuclear careers and to lifelong learning activities.
