In the aftermath of these encounters, virtually the entire fuselage of an aircraft can be contaminated with ash, necessitating a thorough cleaning of the cockpit, instrument panel, circuit breaker panels, passenger and baggage compartments. The electrical and avionics units can be so heavily contaminated that complete replacement is necessary, mainly due to the possibility that all the units could have suffered from overheating. The ash also contaminates the cargo-hold fire-warning system and can generate nuisance fire warnings which are due to the volcanic ash in the air rather than smoke from a fire.\nThe present proposal aims to provide an advanced airborne volcanic ash detection apparatus which will make use of special machine vision interrogation of volcanic ash (tephra) and novel image analysis software. The integrated retrofittable system will examine air in the aircraft\u2019s ventilation ducts.  By interrogating foreign bodies in the fresh air entering the cabin and identifying the type, size and number of particles per unit time and inferring the presence of low level ash particles in the possible presence of other solids in the air e.g. sand etc an early warning may be conveyed to the crew whence appropriate action may be taken to reduce the exposure of the aircraft, thus making possible enormous savings on maintenance costs.", 52099.0, 1001137.0, "AIDA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.aerocareinternational.aero", null, "fp7_106810_965730449"], ["3LP", "Sustainable products from economic processing of biomass in highly integrated biorefineries", "United Utilities Water Plc", "Economic and sustainable production of fuels, chemicals and materials from biomass requires capture of the maximum energy and monetary value from sustainable feedstock. SUPRA-BIO achieves this by focussing on innovative research and development of critical unit operations, by using process intensification to match economic production to the scale of available feedstock and by process integration that provides energy from process waste, optimises utilities to minimise environmental impact and maximises value from the product mix. A technology toolbox for conversion and separation operations is developed that adapts to various scenarios of product mix and feedstock. These are contextualized by full life cycle and economic analysis of potential biorefinery schemes. Based on lignocellulose, microbial/organic waste or microalgae feedstock, innovation and intensification are used to improve the economics and carbon efficiency of fractionation, separation, bio and thermochemical conversions to produce biofuels, intermediates and high value products. Strain selection, genetic manipulation, molecular design and nanocatalysis are used to improve productivity and selectivity; reactor design, intensification and utilities integration for economics. Fermentation to 2,3 butanediol is demonstrated. Mono and multiculture processes are researched for high value products and feedstock streams. Separation is developed for omega oils and specific lignochemicals. Nano and biocatalytic processes are developed for biofuels and bioactive molecules. Integration into potential biorefinery schemes is explored in laboratory pilots of integrated reactors, by piloting on sidestreams, by exchanging separated fractions between partners and by process evaluations.

Health enforcement agencies are currently in the process of drafting new, more stringent quality regulations for aircraft potable water and the world's other regulators will follow suit.\nAircraft potable water is typically loaded from municipal systems which are susceptible to contamination. While municipal water quality has always been a concern in some parts of the world, it is now becoming an issue in North America as well. As recent outbreaks of waterborne disease in carries Canada and the US illustrate, dependence on any municipal water supply carries an inherent risk. Even when the source water is clean, contamination can make its way into a water supply during ground handling because of contaminated water trucks, contaminated hoses, or from improper handling procedures by ramp crew.\nThe aircraft water system itself can be the source of contamination. Microorganisms can grow within the water tanks, water lines, and even the water filters. This situation is exacerbated by the standard, air pressurized water systems that allow water to remain still in the tank and distribution lines until a faucet is opened and the water begins to move. Bacteria thrive in such conditions, which also encourage bacterial regrowth almost immediately after system cleaning.\nThe present project aims to provide an advanced treatment system which will make use of core/sheath polymer nanofibres which are filled with biocidal substances.

We hope that staff of varying language proficiency will be able to deliver outstanding language lessons that can inspire the next generation of linguists.  We recognise the importance of learning about new languages and cultures, as well as the benefits and positive impact it can have on our pupils' education.  The UK has an alarming shortage of people able to speak another language and we hope that through this project we will provide our children with both the skills, and also the desire to change this. We have worked hard to forge strong ties with our feeder secondary schools and develop our implementation of the language curriculum but feel further CPD would ensure the longevity and impact of languages for pupils within our school. We are currently members of a wider community of primary schools that subscribe to a language network that provides resources and tools for the teaching of languages in school, though many of our staff lack confidence in delivering this to the children. This is an area of improvement that we want to rectify in order to provide our pupils with high quality language teaching.\r\n\r\nTraining will take place in France, the main language that is currently taught at our Primary School.  Our aim is to forge meaningful ties with partner schools in the region, where staff can share good practice and our pupils can engage and understand a different language and culture. In our school currently, there is a shortage of qualified teachers that have the confidence to teach French. We feel that the CPD offered through this programme would allow our teachers to develop their language skill set and be invaluable to the development of languages within school.  This CPD would then be disseminated to other members of staff through a training day and staff meetings with its progress and impact on the children being monitored by our language leader in school. Phase two of our action plan will be to send more competent staff to engage directly with the CPD to enhance their skills and delivery of the language.\r\n\r\nWe aim for this project to have a positive impact on the long term learning of another language for our children. Enjoyment of the subject is a key focus for us as staff to ensure that children are engaged in their learning of this subject. We aim to immerse the children in the development of language skills and also in experiencing other cultures. As part of our ambition to develop a cross phase curriculum from years five to eight, spanning key stage two to three, we aim to use the skills developed at primary level, to ensure that there is no decline in pupil outcomes, as well as an increased participation at GCSE level and higher learning. Therefore, addressing the current national language crisis. 348 children will be involved in this project with a further 90+ planned in the future with secondary links. \r\n\r\nThe activities that we will undertake as part of the programme will first and foremost be language based. Through our international contacts we plan to source high quality CPD that addresses the gaps in language understanding and fluency. Furthermore, we aim to understand how an outstanding language lesson should be delivered. \r\n\r\nWe plan to send 3 members of staff on each of our training events. In the first instance, this will consist of our Primary Foreign Languages leader, a member of the senior leadership team and a class teacher all from KS2. The language leader will oversee the implementation of staff training as well as assessing the progress of the children. The senior leader will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the training received, as well as ensuring that resources and tools are available where necessary. Both will ensure that this is high profile and that staff are compliant in following the implementation of the new programme.  Also attending will be a KS2 class teacher to assist in the implementation of new ideas and concepts gathered from France.\r\n\r\nSince the changes to the national curriculum, a higher emphasis has been placed on languages within primary schools. Through the training courses that we will attend, we expect to see an immediate impact in the way languages are taught in school. We will ensure that teachers are given the tools and resources necessary to provide outstanding lessons to engage and motivate our pupils. Through the programme, we will seek to create new ties with other schools in the region we are visiting and use this as an opportunity for our children to feel comfortable and understand a different language. Our aim is to create ties with other primary schools in which older children would be able to take part in an exchange visit and use their language skills first hand with one another.

The schools of the consortium are urban, and semi-rural,  they serve disadvantaged areas and affluent, they are small and large.  They encapsulate and represent the whole of Warrington and are ideally placed to jointly research, learn and develop new practice that will meet not only their own needs but the needs of the wider community of schools locally and regionally..  These schools are dedicated and focused upon creating an ideal learning community within the town and region and wish to push practice to the next level within their own schools and others.\r\n\r\nIn a climate of disappearing school budgets and pressure upon reaching and maintaining progress measures we feel that staff CPD is too often neglected, causing a climate of inevitably lowering standards and insular practice.  This is an emerging risk in the areas of wider curriculum due to potential over emphasis on core subjects, and in Early Years  practice following the national roll out of extended provision and a new funding formula.  This project offers us the opportunity to challenge this and to look to international approaches to learn and disseminate from the best examples of teaching and learning practice, ensuring that children outcomes are improved in a variety of measures.\r\n\r\nWe wish to focus upon key areas which we feel would be most beneficial to the schools in our area, we have looked at our school development plans, analysed progress data and taken the local context into account, for example we have considered the skills profile predicted for regional employment needs and chosen subject areas accordingly.\r\nIn carrying out our project we have identified a number of training opportunities we wish to send a number of teaching professionals on in a variety of European countries.  The areas of training we have chosen are: Early Years Practice, Leadership of Early Years, STEM subject enhancement, MFL - Spanish.\r\n\r\nEarly Years is a current area of strength for Warrington as a town, however we feel that this can be improved significantly by looking internationally accepted best practice as delivered in Sweden and Italy.  Our Early Years practitioners are passionate and wish to move their areas on through immersion and reflection on how two approaches; Swedens outdoor-based approach to development through play and Italys focus on 'beauty' in indoor provision, can be adapted to perfectly suit the needs of our children and locality.  The two approaches developed in different economic climates we feel when combined will serve our own mix of socio-economic pressures and will allow the development of an innovative practice for the North West and beyond. We place such importance upon excellence in Early Years education that we wish to make this activity the largest in our project.  We will select 10 membeers of staff from across our consortium to attend these courses.  There will be senior leaders attending to direct the strategic development of practice to be brought home, alongside newly qualified teaching staff and teaching assistants to embed great practice from the start of their careers.\r\n\r\nSTEM subjects have been identified as an area of difficulty in some schools who find a lack of expertise within their profile of employees.  A vital curriculum area which must be taught with passion and knowledge we feel that an upskilling of key subject leaders across our consortium will enable renewed confidence in introducing a love for these subjects in our children.  An area of skills weakness for large areas of England, we feel we must begin to address this at a primary education level to begin to address this.  We will send 6 staff members from consortium schools on this training, they will be a mixed group of new staff members and subject leaders, this mix will enable all perspectives to be immersed in the experience to ensure a rounded and thorough learning experience is gained by the whole group.\r\n\r\nThe schools who make up our consortium have significant experience in managing and delivering international project over the years with trips having been made to Denmark, New Zealand and South Africa.
