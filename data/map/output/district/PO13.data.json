Major successful space missions under European leadership have placed ESA and its Member States, the European science community at the forefront. To continue this path Europe must have independent and competitive access to space. With the ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) continuing to impede the acquisition of US components, Europe thus needs to develop an assured independent source of propulsion components.  Today space craft propulsion relies heavily on toxic and carcinogenic hydrazines as propellants. Hydrazine itself is widely used as monopropellant and MMH and UDMH is used as bipropellant fuel. These propellants are a threat to people and the environment, and handling these toxic propellants impedes costly safety measurers.   As new ideas and new technologies emerged in the last years, and as the concerns about both the environment and the handling of carcinogenic propellants significantly increase, the so-called Green Propellants show potential improvements with respect to performance and cost. The goal of this project is thus to select the most promising green liquid propellant candidate/s and to push the propulsion technology to the level needed to prove that Green Propellant technology is feasible and competitive. Research and development on Green Propellants and adjacent propulsion technology in Europe is geographically fragmented and insufficiently funded. With the present consortium, some of the key-players in Europe will harmonize their capabilities to meet this demanding goal.", 311171.0, 3175257.0, "GRASP", null, null, null, "http://www.grasp-fp7.eu", null, null, "fp7_89683_999505461"], ["9AU", "Hybrid Propulsion Module for transfer to GEO orbit", "DELTACAT Limited", "Independent access to space is a key component of the European Space Policy. The competition is increasing in this area both for the full launching systems and the key subsystems. Cost-effectiveness becomes the main driving factor.\nHYPROGEO ambition is to study a propulsion module based on Hybrid chemical propulsion. Hybrid propulsion is not a new technology but its application to a transfer module or to a re-ignitable upper stage is very innovative. It is an interesting alternative for the GEO transfer, between the chemical propulsion (bi-liquid) and the new trend of Electrical Propulsion (EP).  There are very good synergies and complementarities with the other propulsion activities.\nThe proof of concept (specific impulse, thrust) has been demonstrated. The main technical challenge is the long duration firings. The future development of an operational system, already identified in the current roadmaps, requires advanced R&D work on 4 critical technologies:\n- Combustion chamber.\n- High endurance nozzle.\n- Catalytic injector.\n- Production, storage and use of high concentration hydrogen peroxide.\n\nThese R&D activities structure 4 main work packages. A system study ensures the global vision in coherence with an economic analysis, the identification of technical challenges and the consolidation of scientific results. A last work package performs the dissemination of results.\nAn innovative aspect is the fact that the R&D activities are directly driven by the ecvolution of market needs and system requirements.\nMain expected benefits are:\n- Green and simpler design (compared to bi-liquid).\n- Shorter transfer time and reduced cost of operations (compared to EP)\n\nA TRL 3-4 level is expected at the end of the project.\nThe impact of the project is secured by the composition of the consortium led by Astrium with the main European actors of the hybrid: it contributes to the consolidation of the European industrial supply chain for Hybrid propulsion.\nProject duration is 36 months.", 150248.0, 2414635.0, "HYPROGEO", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_193294_999505461"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PO13"}
