The hardware basis will comprise smart meters in buildings, actuators for selected devices, one or more central servers, and an associated communications infrastructure. This system will be developed, and then installed and evaluated at three communities across Europe, namely:  Damanhur in Northern Italy, Tamera in Southern Portugal, and Findhorn in the North of Scotland.<br/>-<br/>In brief and in broad chronological order, the project's activities will be as follows:<br/>-<br/>(i) we will audit the energy network at our three validation communities<br/>-<br/>(ii) we will build numerical models of the three communities, and begin to develop appropriate business models for community-based energy management;<br/>-<br/>(iii) we will develop the various algorithms involved in the ORIGIN architecture, and specify the hardware and communications infrastructure required at each of the three communities;<br/>-<br/>(iv) we will install the ORIGIN system in each community, monitoring mode (before the algorithms are fully developed), and collect 12 months' energy usage data from each community;<br/>-<br/>(v) we will then install the full ORIGIN architecture at each community, beginning with a brief phase in which the system is installed at a selection of buildings and tested and refined.<br/>-<br/>(vi) we will collect 12 months' of usage data in each community while the system is active, and then perform a full evaluation of the performance of the ORIGIN approach.<br/>-<br/>(vii) Based on experience/analysis, we will advise each community on future alternative energy development plans<br/>-<br/>(viii) We will deliver several outputs concern transfer of the technology for more widespread use across the EU, including reports concerning general business models for energy management, applying the ORIGIN approach to arbitrary communities, and we will also deliver a mix of associated open-source software and commercial outputs, the mix and nature of which to be determined during the project in discussion with stakeholders.", 157102.0, 3261714.0, "ORIGIN", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_105918_956589654"], ["1AU", "Smart building retrofitting complemented by solar assisted heat pumps integrated within a self-correcting intelligent building energy management system.", "Aes Limited", "Heat4Cool proposes an innovative, efficient and cost-effective solution to optimize the integration of a set of rehabilitation systems in order to meet the net-zero energy standards. The project develops, integrates and demonstrates an easy to install and highly energy efficient solution for building retrofitting that begins from the Heat4Cool advanced decision-making tool (which addresses the building and district characteristics) and leads to the optimal solution combining (1) gas and solar thermally driven adsorption heat pumps, which permits the full integration with existing natural gas boilers to ensure efficient use of current equipment , (2) solar PV assisted DC powered heat pump connected to an advanced modular PCM heat and cold storage system, and (3) energy recovery from sewage water with high performance heat exchangers.\nThis retrofitting solution together with a closer interaction between building monitoring, demand/respond supply match, weather forecast and HVAC activation/control through a Self-Correcting Intelligent Building Energy Management Systems (SCI-BEMS) will save at least 10% of energy consumption.\nThe project will implement four benchmark retrofitting projects in four different European climates to achieve a reduction of at least 20% in energy consumption in a technically, socially, and financially feasible manner and demonstrate a return on investment of 8 years. The Heat4Cool consortium will ensure the maximum replication potential of the Heat4Cool solution by a continuous monitoring of technical and economic barriers during the development and validation phases in order to present the building owners and investors with clear energy and economic evidence of the value of implementing Heat4Cool solution. \nA detailed business plan will be developed in the beginning of the project to strengthen the exploitation plan of the retrofitting package and set the basis for a massive replication of the demonstrated concept across Europe.", 202020.0, 6920991.0, "Heat4Cool", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_207412_952393434"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["3TZ", "GLOBAL ECOVILLAGE NETWORK", 33464.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European youth area and the participation of young people in European democratic life (15.02.01.02)", "fts_2016_48632", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "IV36"}
