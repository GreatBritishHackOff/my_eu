It is of the utmost importance to enable the transfer of specific knowledge and the best praxis in Latvian countryside regions, where many low-income residents are living because of the emigration of economically more active residents. They often produce food for the needs of their household, but potentially they could improve their social, ecological and economical state. In order to improve the situation, a joint action is needed from different target groups of the society.. Therefore the project has brought together 5 non-governmental organizations that work in the same direction, but with slightly different emphasis, thus reaching different groups of the society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project addresses 3 important dimensions for adult education in sustainable development, that are represented by the non-governmental organizations of consortium. First, citizens have to acquire good examples of environmentally friendly, socially beneficial and economically reasonable and affordable living, management and food production, that is offered by ''Latvian Permaculture Association'' and ''homo ecos:''. Second, these incentives should not stay in hands of few individuals, but they should be integrated in wider local development strategies and visions for transition, as it is done by ''Smiltenei un Latvijai'' and ''Ikskile Transition Initiative''. Third, this type of knowledge can be used as a basis for creation of new ecological communities and development of existing projects, so that they serve as living examples for ensuring sustainable development. This process is supported by ''Latvijas Ekokopienu un Iniciativu apvieniba''.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project includes acquiring of important knowledge and skills through courses offered by foreign partners with great practical experience, adaptation and implementation of this knowledge and skills in Latvian context as well as sharing the information with wider society.

The association  turned 20 years in 2013 and is the first national network of ecovillages, globally. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL\u00d8S experience a growing focus among its members to create business in the ecovillages, focused on developing more qualitative educational activities, which are in high demand. Recent phenomena like the financial crisis and climate change lead to an increased focus on the transition to sustainability and the ecovillage movement can reply with its practical examples of transition initiatives and the building of sustainable human communities. Various groups are looking towards the ecovillage society for experience and knowledge. Education and training is therefore a priority growth area for L\u00d8S. However, there is a need for capacity building among teachers, both in terms of volume, methodology and content. Thus, L\u00d8S has chosen over a 1-year period to provide 10 teachers with staff training abroad. All are committed to educational activities in their local context, but are also active on the national scene, through L\u00d8S. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEcovillages already have a strong European network, organised through the Global Ecovillage Network (its Europe section in particular) and Gaia Education, responsible for the training part. It even has its own training curriculum, in a 4 week course based on the four dimensions on sustainability. It is called GAIA 's Ecovillage Design Education and is developed by adult education trainers throughout years of experience. Most education in the ecovillage society takes place within this educational framework. But the resource base in Denmark is not strong, since not many have taken a full 4 weeks EDE. That is the background for L\u00d8S to send 2 x 2 trainers for EDE training for 4 weeks in some of Europe 's leading providers of EDE courses, being Sieben Linden in Germany and Findhorn in Scotland. The learning objective is that the 4 people acquire a deeper understanding of the EDE in practice and the nesesary skills and motivation to arrange 4 weeks EDE courses in Denmark in 2016. Furthermore, the project is about expanding the resource base for L\u00d8S to also send teachers from Denmark elsewhere in Europe, as an ambition. To become a stronger part of the EDE field in Europe. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo additional trainers from L\u00d8S should be offered a methodical TOT qualification course in an ecovillage /learning center in Ireland, with a focus on innovative, participatory methods. This seek to inspire the trainer network in L\u00d8S with new inputs. In addition to these 2+2+2  staff trainings L\u00d8S will send 4 people to the GEN Europe conference in Germany, summer of 2014, to network and become inspired by a week's abundance of interesting workshops. Previously mostly the organizational people in L\u00d8S have participated in the GEN conference, but it is actually becoming increasingly a venue for trainers and facilitators to meet and inspire each other with their \u2018best practises\u2019. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the mentioned activities are centered within a wish and a need for quality development, while at the same time seeking to mobilize, inspire and motivate to an increased European focus among the participants from Denmark, who will be encouraged to engage in further building of learning partnerships etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe teachers in L\u00d8S are ' ordinary people ' who live in ecovillages, often in remote areas where European activity is not normal. Therefore, this project is anticipated to resonate, lead to pride, curiosity and some publicity in these local communities. The long-term objective of the mobility program is to create more jobs for teachers, requiring quality assurance of the existing and future educational educational activities and inspiration from European ecovillages that have managed to create dedicated learning centers. Therefore, L\u00d8S have deliberately chosen three course providers that have been doing exactly this, which L\u00d8S has as a long-term strategy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of the mobility prorgamme can be found through a wider and more qualitative range of courses as well as increased professionalism, in particular, demonstrated through a more active involvement in the RCE, the Danish Network for Education for Sustainable Development. Even the nominated UN decade of Education for Sustainable Development will end here in 2014; L\u00d8S has found a niche that no one else can fill out - namely the use of the lived life in ecovillages as an innovative \u2019live and learn\u2019 environment. GAIA's  EDE curriculum must be contextualized through European mobility experiences and then local application, for L\u00d8S to create a landmark.

Education for transformation is education that empowers people to involve actively for a sustainable development of our society. In the frame of the ecovillage-movement, but in other contexts as well, educational programs and concepts have been developed that empower people to get actively involved in change for society. This kind of educational work shall be strengthened and internationalised through this project. As an additional goal we strive to develop our organisations to better reach out to people with a migration background.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concrete goals of the project are:\r\n\r\nGeneral project goals:\r\n\r\n1. to enlarge the pool of German trainers who can offer highly qualified courses in education for transformation for an international audience\r\n\r\n2. innovation transfer: to bring methods and course formats to Germany that are not yet existing here, but in other European countries\r\n\r\n3. to open up for new target-groups for education for transformation (international participants, people with migration background)\r\n\r\n4. to ensure an appealing, competent management of international/-cultural learning events in our members' organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\n\r\nIn the frame of an open project, our plan is to offer a learning opportunity abroad for all together 100 people who are involved in the field of education for transformation. GEN is explicitly open for applications from people who have not been active in the context of GEN before, but who are working in the field of education for transformation in other contexts or are working with migrants and want to include education for transformation in their work. The goal of GEN is not only the improvement of its own educational work and the work of its member organisations, but as well a strengthening of the field of education for transformation as a whole.\r\n\r\nWe are convinced that for this kind of educational work it is especially effective if it happens in an international frame, as it is highly motivating to become aware that in different countries and cultures people are involved in building a world worth living, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to reach these goals, the following activities are planned:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

This leads to marginalization, lack of integration and participation among young people. The project aims to tackle this issue and these problems, to raise awareness on how to fight racism with all its forms. In the life we are leading now segregation, xenophobia, discrimination and many other forms of negative human interaction are widely spreading. Accordingly, working on belittling such behaviors is a matter of priority because it is affecting the livelihood of people on daily basis. Therefore, we are targeting throughout our training course two things; first, understanding the cause of such acts and second the best practices to avoid and fight them with young people. \r\n\r\nThe title of the training explains its content; \"face\" represents the idea of standing against and fighting and at the same time it is the human face that makes all the difference; \"race\" projects the word racism as well as symbolizes the fact that life turned into a non stopping race where everybody runs in different directions. Consequently, \"Face the Race\" will be a training course that will deluge into the different perspectives and stereotypes present in human behavior in order to enhance unity and harmony rather than conflicts or dissonance.  \r\n\r\nThe training course gathers together 28 young people from 7 different countries in order to provide educational & theoretical background on how to work with young people to combat racism and build tolerance and equality. Furthermore the project aims to develop the skills and competences of less privileged young people facing cultural, economical, religious or social obstacles to empower and encourage them to take action against racism. \r\n\r\nWe also aim to evaluate exciting human rights educational tools and to develop new tools and methods to be used in non-formal educational framework to combat racism and discrimination. Nevertheless the training course promotes non-formal education and volunteer work as an important tool for social inclusion and active citizenship.\r\n\r\nAfter the training course our participants will be empowered young people who dare to fight against racism and are willing to take actions in their local communities to promote values such as social inclusion, tolerance and empathy.

This implies articulating a shared dream that we work towards, developing the plans to do so, coordinating the actions we defined in our planning and reflecting and reviewing often on how we have done things. These phases come from the Dragon Dreaming PM methodology, but we also often seek flexibility and rapid responsiveness in the way we work, which we borrow from the scrum meetings concept that is found in the family of Agile PM methodologies.

During the TC youth worker will develop their skills and competences in such topics as assertive communication, effective team-work and strategic planning while understanding the importance of youth work and the role they play in the development of their communities.We also seek to improve the level of key competences and skills of youth workers, such as sense of initiative and entrepreneurship and multilingualism, in order to improve the quality of their work and the activities they organise, and to reach further into the European dimension of their youth work.Taking under consideration the needs of the organizations involved the content of this training course will be based on the following objectives:-To identify the role of youth work in our societies and to understand the importance of youth workers-To provide participants with different tools to acquire knowledge and to develop skills and competencies in organizational management-To introduce effective communication, leadership and team-work techniques-To develop competences to implement tools, non-formal and informal educational methods of decision making and strategic thinking-To provide space for participants for discussion and sharing best practices and to develop their leadership skills and competences-To improve knowledge about Erasmus+ Programme as a tool for enhancing the international dimension of youth work through capacity building activitiesAt the end of the TC, our participants will be motivated to participate more actively in the lives of their organisations, develop more projects with and for young people and will be better equipped to provide a higher quality of youth work delivery due to their experience, skills and knowledge.The venue place of the project is The East Clare Golf Course, County Clare, Ireland.  It is a 6-day TC with 24 participants and 4 trainers/logistic assistant from the following countries: Armenia, Czech Republic, Croatia, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, UK and Ireland.  During the activities of the TC we will use different kinds of non-formal and informal educational methods, such as small and large group work, individual time for reflection, simulation and situation activities, energizers, case studies, interactive presentations etc. We will offer a wide range of methods to the participants including indoor and outdoor training elements.

An ecovillage is an intentional or traditional community that is consciously designed through locally owned, participatory processes to regenerate social and natural environments. The four dimensions of sustainability (ecology, economy, the social and the cultural) are all integrated into a holistic approach.Nowadays there is a strong interest among young people in sustainability issues in general and specifically in ecovillages and their holistic approach to a sustainable lifestyle. Many young people are asking for ways to visit ecovillages and learn more.Most of the project partners have been working mostly in the adult education sector until now, with a limited amount of activity in the area of youth work - even the youth is represented in most ecovillages as a group. They this want to respond to the great demand perceived in young people and intensify their work in the youth sector, including international collaboration projects.Therefore, the following objectives have been chosen for this project:- INCREASE YOUTH WORK IN ECOVILLAGES, enabling ecovillages to reach out to  larger numbers of young people- INTERNATIONALISATION, increasing the international cooperation between ecovillages as centres for sustainability education in the field of youth workThis is to be achieved through a networking meeting of 32 youth workers associated with the respective partner organisations. The meeting will take place in Denmark, August 23-28, 2016. The youth workers attending are experts in the field of education for sustainable development and working in ecovillages or bringing the ecovillage concept to other settings. Partly, they are young people with a background in sustainability and keen on working with youth projects. This way, the voice of youth will be represented to bring in young fresh energy. Among the selection criteria is their motivation to start new international collaboration projects.The themes of the meeting can be divided into two main strands:- sharing of best practice- creating new innovative projects & partner findingThe participants will share best practice examples of the youth work in ecovillages they conduct locally in order to inspire the work of each other and promote international innovation transfer. After identifying topics of common interest and brainstorming on ideas for potential future projects, the most promising project ideas are selected. Working groups are formed around these themes who will elaborate a project draft and a project development plan with concrete next action steps.To support the interactive nature of this networking meeting, presentations of the participants are integrated with participative working methods that engage all participants in discussions and collaboration. Methods like World Caf\u00e9 will support the process of brainstorming and identifying objectives and themes for future projects. The working groups are organised in the Open Space style where all participants can invite to a group. Groups can stop or start at any time, they can merge or split and participants are free to change between groups. Only two themes are pre-decided: - A qualified response to the refugee situation, in the field of youth.  - Adaption of the Ecovillage Design Education curriculum to a youth target group. During the follow-up phase after the networking meeting, the working groups continue to implement the project development plan leading to several new funding applications.The output of this project are the future international youth projects initiated, therefore this project has a clear longer term benefit. In the short term, another benefit is the exchange of best practice between the partners, enabling all participants to draw inspiration for their own work at home, thereby qualifying existing and future efforts. The future projects will show the desired impact on the target group of young people, allowing more youth to engage in projects in ecovillages promoting sustainable lifestyles. The project will lead to an increased cooperation and exchange between the partners and possibly other organisations who will get involved in the future projects, including from European countries not represented in this project.It is time that the ecovillage movement take their youth work seriously and this networking meeting is only the first step to spark a new development.

It can address creativity, youth participation and employability, critical thinking and social responsibility. Europe at the moment is facing major problems. Among these, the dis-empowerment of young people who feel marginalised from society, can't find their place and don't know (or forget) how to realise their potential in life. On the other side, phenomena like hate speech and online violence (of which \u201ccyberbullying\u201d is only one of its aspects that affects young people directly: 52% of students experience it, and 33% receive some form of threats online. 84% of all cyberbullying takes place on facebook. Source http://www.statisticbrain.com/cyber-bullying-statistics/) are on the rise. Also, racism, intolerance and ignorance can be greatly fueled by storytelling \u2013 as demonstrated by the strong use that every totalitarian government has done of it.  The course will take place from 17th to 23rd October 2016 and will take place in the ecocentre in Kapraluv Mlyn, near Brno in Czech Republic. It will involve 26 participants from 13 countries: Italy, Czech Republic, Romania, UK, Spain, Poland, Slovenia, Portugal, Netherlands, Greece, France, Hungary, Ireland - plus 3 trainers and 2 staff members.The main objectives we want to reach are:- to identify and understand key elements and skills for storytelling, and explore their potential benefits for learning, personal development and employability; - to analyze the increased impact that stories (and media) have on phenomena such as \u201chate speech\u201d, intolerance and open racism. We will discuss the new needs for awareness, ethics and knowledge that come with the social and digital era; - to explore the concept of \u201ctransformational storytelling\u201d: using storytelling as an innovative tool to address change and personal development; - to use elements of gamification to make youth work more attractive and accesible to young people (especially marginalised YP); - to create an international network of youth workers and organisations, able to use storytelling to develop skills and methods and to have an innovative impact on local levels. The activities will be based on non formal and experiential learning methodologies, all centered on different aspects of Storytelling. We will work on the most classic and traditional forms (sitting around the fire) to the most contemporary, like cinema, comics and videogames. The expected learning outcomes for the participants are: - to be trained on, and receive information about, innovative approaches based on Storytelling, illustrating specialistic concepts such as the Monomyth, the Way of Council, Gamification - and the work methodologies related to them - combining theory, practice and sharing reflections and good practice tips with trainers and colleagues;- to get more proficient in the understanding and use for educational purposes of Comics, Videogames, Board Games - all media very popular in the youth culture; - to increase awareness and learn how to better tackle in youth work their potential negative effects, as well: the risk of addiction and escapism from reality, the possible manipulation and propaganda uses that can be done by authorities, political and social actors, goverments.

There are record levels of youth unemployment and many young people feel a sense of anxiety or hopelessness about their future. It is important to implement effective and transferable methods which encourage positive attitudes, mental and physical health, and which support young people in accessing their creativity and vitality. By helping young people to identify and develop their skills, qualities and entrepreneurial ideas we can create a more positive future for them as individuals and for the communities they live and work in. Social entrepreneurship and enterprises offer a route to inner resilience & initiative that can transform people and communities and drive profound and lasting change.While there is the focus on career, employability and the job market, we are clear that this course will work on multiple levels. The competences developed will support youth workers to work with a range of needs and abilities and provide tools which to help young people in a range of ways including: (1) starting a social enterprise, community project or other group/organisation; (2) engaging and thriving in their own lives and communities; (3) taking initiative, developing creativity and entrepreneurism - whatever their circumstances and abilities.

Increasing levels of youth unemployment, less job security, increased social tensions, fragmented communities and lack of appropriate support in life transitions can lead to young people feeling hopeless, directionless or even heading in a negative direction. However young people harbour the potential to make deep and wide contributions to a more positive sustainable future and in creating healthy resilient communities.

Through this TC we also aim to develop the quality of youth work across Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that one of the biggest challenges of European society is the lack of active participation of young people, caused by a long term empty job market and a lack of resources to tackle the issue. Young people need to be empowered to be able to turn their ideas into actions, to strive to realise their dreams, to engage with and play an active part within their communities and societies - and of course to become more employable. \r\n\r\nYouth workers, volunteers, trainers and all those who work with young people need more creative, innovative and effective methods and techniques both to engage young people and to give them the tools to empower themselves.

This project is a direct result of a seminar for youth workers and young leaders, representatives of national ecovillage networks, coordinated by Mimundo (Danish Ecovillage) in Denmark in 2016. A group of people in representation of 10 ecovillages wrote this application together during the seminar.\r\nThe partners work in the field of education for sustainable development and are all part of the ecovillage movement. An ecovillage is an intentional or traditional community that is consciously designed through locally owned, participatory processes to regenerate social and natural environments. Nowadays there is a strong interest among young people in sustainability issues in general and specifically in ecovillages and their holistic and practical approach to a sustainable lifestyle.\r\nMost of the project partners have been working mostly in the adult education sector until now. They want to respond to the great demand perceived in young people and intensify the participation of their young members.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\r\n- PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT, enabling young people to learn new skills, develop personal resilience, take initiative and learn to critically assess different ways of living.  \r\n- STRENGTHEN THE INTERNATIONAL NETWORK OF YOUNG PEOPLE interested in sustainability and ecovillage life in Europe, both in rural and urban areas; reducing this geographical gap; engaging young people into intercultural dialogue and cooperation.  \r\n- INCREASE YOUTH WORK IN ECOVILLAGES, enabling young people to explore different employment opportunities at or inspired by ecovillages and enabling ecovillages to reach out to larger numbers of young people.\r\n\r\nThis is to be achieved through a Youth Exchange of 20 young participants supported by 4 group leaders, associated with the respective partner organisations. The young participants attending are coming from both rural and urban areas and are interested in low impact ways of living and sustainability. The exchange will take place in March 2018 in the well-established and pioneering ecovillage and community of Findhorn, Scotland, where young people will get in contact with examples of low impact living in rural areas. Participants will enjoy hands on activities with the community and will be encouraged to explore what ecovillages are doing to tackle the global ecological and social crisis with a focus on personal development, active citizenship and employability.  \r\n \r\nOne purpose of this is sharing of best practice and examples of the youth participation at a local level for mutual inspiration and new impulses, promoting international support for youth leading ecovillage lifestyles, and for young leaders to self-organize the exchange.\r\nThe Findhorn Foundation College, community, and ecovillage has a long history of facilitating and teaching sustainability practices. During the youth exchange, these resources and faculty will be made available in sessions encouraging participants to embrace and engage with the everyday life of the community. To support the interactive nature of this Youth Exchange, group leaders will also facilitate exploration time through interactive and participatory methods and self organized seminars. The main question pre-decided is: How could we/I design our/my life to feel satisfied in my relation with myself (personal development), my local community (active citizenship) having a sustainable livelihood (employability)?\r\n \r\nThe methodologies for the youth exchange are innovative participatory methods that allow a diverse group to easily sort out topics according to interest and work on them creatively and efficiently but also in a fun and fulfilling way.\r\nDuring the follow-up phase after the Youth Exchange, the coordination team will link the results to other similar youth exchange taking place across Europe. The goal is to link these projects with a final Youth Exchange where participants come together and share their experiences, and addressing the long-term goal of helping to create a mutually supportive network of empowered sustainable European citizens. \r\n\r\nThe short term benefit is the exchange of best practices between partners, enabling all participants to draw inspiration for their own work at home, empowering young people to become active citizenships in terms of sustainability as well as to increase youth participation in the sending organizations.\r\nThis Youth Exchange aims to show the desired impact on the target group of young people, allowing more youth to engage in projects in ecovillages promoting sustainable lifestyles.

Permaculture, a powerful tool for ecological resource building and for societal integration and citizenship practice, needs to be practiced not just by the landed, but also by the landless \u2013 students, school children, youth, apartment-dwellers, itinerant travelers, migrants, those suffering forced displacement and social exclusion.\r\n\r\nWe have made some strides towards these goals.  But we need to do more. We need more substantial improvement in the breadth and depth of our permaculture knowledge, be better equipped to be able to think about permaculture in new ways and apply it in untried contexts and thus better reach new and marginalized groups.  We need exposure to permaculture practices in other societal contexts, through experience-exchange at permaculture-rich international gatherings, through immersion in advanced courses not available in Sweden, and through contact with practictioners in countries with a more developed permaculture practice.  We need to improve our organizational and administrative capacity, including our capacity to run and promote our diploma system for training new permaculture teachers. \r\n\r\nOur objectives summarized thus are:\r\n1. To more successfully adapt traditional permaculture to a contemporary Swedish context, one that can adequately respond to modern-day local challenges, such as the need for greater social inclusion and more active citizenship, as well as to international challenges such as migration, forced displacement, and global climate change.  \r\n2.

The course will be held at the Findhorn Foundation (Findhorn), a 55-year-old international ecovillage. The Findhorn ecovillage is an exemplar for sustainable development possibilities, as it is one of Europe\u2019s communities with the smallest ecological footprint. The teachers of this course are pioneers of sustainable development in Europe and world, having published extensively on the topic, and helped to found Gaia Education, which developed the UNESCO supported sustainable pedagogical platform of which the EDE course is a part. Gaia Education is an international organisation active in 48 countries on six continents, with a 11-year track record in education for sustainable development and with more than 12,000 graduates around the world and 80 partner organisations.\r\nDue to similar (northern temperate) climate conditions between Findhorn and Latvia, the practical ecological permaculture methods taught in the EDE can be easily adapted for use in Latvia. We acknowledge also that the applications of sustainable and permaculture practices require a symbiotic awareness of multiple dimensions, social, economic, cultural, as well as ecological; and the EDE course is renowned for its course design which harmonizes these dimensions. Upon successfully completing the EDE course, our Latvian Permaculture Society member will have the possibility to become a Gaia Education Certified Trainer of Sustainability. This certification of our member will permit our organization to organize and lead the EDE and other Sustainability courses in Latvia (in Latvian and English), and extend the scope of the sustainability knowledge in the region. Additionally, having our member participate in this course would widen the international collaboration between green organizations by sharing knowledge and experience between the organizations during and after the course.

During the activities with children and parents, coaches encountered several issues due to the historical moment and generation gap (which seems to widen and deepen with the growth of \u201cdigital natives\u201d generation): bullying, cyber bullying,  exclusion, discrimination and apathy are tangible effects of a tendency to individualism and resignation to the status quo, that is catching on all around Europe and can be seen through the growth of nationalism e populism, along with the lacking of faith in the implementation of change and social disease.\r\nThe project wants to focus on the idea of social cohesion, with specific attention on civic and social skills, strengthening participant\u2019s confidence and soft skills and their ability to implement them in their everyday life.\r\nThe general aim is to promote the use of theatre as a medium to ease communication between young people, the sense of solidarity and, with the Forum-Theatre and simulation techniques, to make possible an experience based path which can help to reflect on the condition lived by marginalized and bullied people. \r\nThe Forum-Theatre is one of the techniques used in Auguso Boal\u2019s Theatre of Oppressed, which aim to the same purpose of Paulo Freire\u2019s Pedagogy of the Oppressed: the humanization through dialogue and the start of changing from a na\u00efve and fatalist conscience (that lead to a feeling of powerlessness towards the world) to a critical conscience (capable of modifying the context where it lives) make very topical this form of expression, born in \u201970 in Latin America.\r\nIn order to give further strength and visibility to the project, citizens of Finale Ligure will be involved through some activities which will be held in public places and street, with the double aim to reach more people as we can with the concept of social exclusion and to offer to participants a practical experience of working with the theatre instrument.\r\nThe TC will combine this main part with the use of several non-formal education methodology, used by L\u2019Orma in years of ordinary activities.
