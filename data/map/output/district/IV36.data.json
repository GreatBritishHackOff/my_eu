We gained lot of experience on how to support the development of competencies of youth workers, and we want to bring it now to the next level - to support the development of youth workers working with marginalised youth.\r\n\r\nNEEDS:  rising radicalisation, intolerance, xenophobia and other forms of discriminiation, we used needs analysis with our partner organisations working with marginalised groups (Roma, gay etc.) and research: www.radicalisationresearch.org.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants: In this activity we will involve 28 youth workers who are actively involved in youth work and act as multipliers in their respective communities. \r\nWe want to specifically target youth workers/ youth leaders working with either minorities or different diversity/minority groups. \r\nFor us the INLCUSION aspect is one of the most important characteristics of the project, we aim to have 40% of participants with fewer opportunities /diverse backgrounds). The remaining 60% are youth workers who work with minority groups, but are not members of any disadvantaged group.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES:  2 residential training courses (TC) and a coaching and practice phase between.

The experience of Development Perspectives in these areas of active citizenship ,leadership and employability . We are very passionate about social change through the empowerment young people to make a change in both their own lives and the lives of those around them.\r\nPublic engagement is an important aspect of the work of NGOs as engaging people about the work of organisations can attract more followers and more participants for programmes, exhibitions, workshops etc. However, public engagement is also very challenging for many NGOs especially those which seek to address complex issues.\r\n\r\nObjectives \r\nThe objectives of the project are: to highlight and explain the principles of effective storytelling, to examine the importance and role of values and frames in storytelling and public communications, to allow a space for youth workers to apply the principles of stoytelling to their own practices, to explore the role of emotion and compassion in youth work and; to explore diverse methods of public engagement.\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber of Participants/profile \r\nThere will be a total of 2 participants on this project.

This project is a direct result of a seminar for youth workers and young leaders, representatives of national ecovillage networks, coordinated by Mimundo (Danish Ecovillage) in Denmark in 2016. A group of people in representation of 10 ecovillages wrote this application together during the seminar.\r\nThe partners work in the field of education for sustainable development and are all part of the ecovillage movement. An ecovillage is an intentional or traditional community that is consciously designed through locally owned, participatory processes to regenerate social and natural environments. Nowadays there is a strong interest among young people in sustainability issues in general and specifically in ecovillages and their holistic and practical approach to a sustainable lifestyle.\r\nMost of the project partners have been working mostly in the adult education sector until now. They want to respond to the great demand perceived in young people and intensify the participation of their young members.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\r\n- PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT, enabling young people to learn new skills, develop personal resilience, take initiative and learn to critically assess different ways of living.  \r\n- STRENGTHEN THE INTERNATIONAL NETWORK OF YOUNG PEOPLE interested in sustainability and ecovillage life in Europe, both in rural and urban areas; reducing this geographical gap; engaging young people into intercultural dialogue and cooperation.  \r\n- INCREASE YOUTH WORK IN ECOVILLAGES, enabling young people to explore different employment opportunities at or inspired by ecovillages and enabling ecovillages to reach out to larger numbers of young people.\r\n\r\nThis is to be achieved through a Youth Exchange of 20 young participants supported by 4 group leaders, associated with the respective partner organisations. The young participants attending are coming from both rural and urban areas and are interested in low impact ways of living and sustainability. The exchange will take place in March 2018 in the well-established and pioneering ecovillage and community of Findhorn, Scotland, where young people will get in contact with examples of low impact living in rural areas. Participants will enjoy hands on activities with the community and will be encouraged to explore what ecovillages are doing to tackle the global ecological and social crisis with a focus on personal development, active citizenship and employability.  \r\n \r\nOne purpose of this is sharing of best practice and examples of the youth participation at a local level for mutual inspiration and new impulses, promoting international support for youth leading ecovillage lifestyles, and for young leaders to self-organize the exchange.\r\nThe Findhorn Foundation College, community, and ecovillage has a long history of facilitating and teaching sustainability practices. During the youth exchange, these resources and faculty will be made available in sessions encouraging participants to embrace and engage with the everyday life of the community. To support the interactive nature of this Youth Exchange, group leaders will also facilitate exploration time through interactive and participatory methods and self organized seminars. The main question pre-decided is: How could we/I design our/my life to feel satisfied in my relation with myself (personal development), my local community (active citizenship) having a sustainable livelihood (employability)?\r\n \r\nThe methodologies for the youth exchange are innovative participatory methods that allow a diverse group to easily sort out topics according to interest and work on them creatively and efficiently but also in a fun and fulfilling way.\r\nDuring the follow-up phase after the Youth Exchange, the coordination team will link the results to other similar youth exchange taking place across Europe. The goal is to link these projects with a final Youth Exchange where participants come together and share their experiences, and addressing the long-term goal of helping to create a mutually supportive network of empowered sustainable European citizens. \r\n\r\nThe short term benefit is the exchange of best practices between partners, enabling all participants to draw inspiration for their own work at home, empowering young people to become active citizenships in terms of sustainability as well as to increase youth participation in the sending organizations.\r\nThis Youth Exchange aims to show the desired impact on the target group of young people, allowing more youth to engage in projects in ecovillages promoting sustainable lifestyles.

To expose the volunteers to working in an international and multicultural environment with passionate and engaged people from across Europe and the world, to network with organisations across the world, and therefore give the participants the self-confidence and know-how make decisions and take actions in pursuit of social, economic and environmental justice. \r\n\r\n4. To provide a practical and deeply participative experience of living in, and fully collaborating to, a sustainable ecovillage where novel and progressive solutions to a number of macro and micro level social, economic, cultural and environmental problems are being developed and implemented on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nActivities:\r\n\r\nGEN International EVS Volunteers will each be supported to become actively involved with a range of GEN's Focus Areas i.e. Communications; Education; Fundraising, Operations; IT; Advocacy; and Research. Each volunteer will support the core functioning of our organisation: a role they will be supported to fulfill with support from staff and in-line with independently developed personal learning goals made by the participants themselves. They will also engage in life in the FF to learn practical skills, engage in social entrepreneurship and receive training.\r\n\r\n. Volunteers will work in the GEN office, developing their skills in one or more of GEN's Focus Areas. Tasks may range from administrative tasks such as answering emails and phone calls, to supporting the working groups of GEN, developing educational materials, or setting up and managing small projects within the larger framework of GEN's global work. \r\n\r\n2. In addition, participants will take part in hands-on activities in the day to day community life around the GEN Office, for example, within the Findhorn Foundation (FF). This will fulfill the project objective of supporting the youth in the development of practical skills required for a more sustainable lifestyle. \r\n\r\n3.
