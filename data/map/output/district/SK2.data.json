The students are mostly of White British heritage; few are from minority ethnic groups, or speak English as an additional language. \r\n\r\nWe are a Leadership Training school, and have received several awards, including Artsmark Gold, the Inclusion Quality Mark, the Basic Skills Quality Mark, Investor in People award, Young Carers in Schools Gold Award, and Leading Parent Partnership Award. \r\n\r\nA key target of our most recent OFSTED report was to improve how we challenge pupils. This project will help us to do this as we will be challenging ourselves and will also be improving our subject knowledge and confidence, which should allow us to challenge pupils more.\r\n\r\nWe are keen to broaden the number of languages offered in the school. French and German have been taught at the school for many years, with Spanish being introduced at KS3 in September 2014. from September 2017 it will be offered as KS4 as well\r\n\r\nMFL staff have developed their Spanish subject knowledge and their confidence is growing. However, they need a further boost to allow them to teach GCSE to a consistently high standard. They need to focus on more complex language, and hone pronunciation skills, to give our GCSE Spanish pupils excellent teaching and ensure that the use of Spanish incorporates changes in the language, new vocabulary etc. \r\n\r\nIn line with the new KS3 National Curriculum and new GCSE syllabus we also need to broaden staff cultural knowledge.\r\n\r\nPrevious participants have recognised the huge benefit derived from participation in our previous project. Further immersion training will consolidate learning and boost progress in a short time.\r\n\r\nOne focus of this project will be on collaborative working between Departments. As part of our first project, one non-linguist (English teacher)  took part in a mobility, and this led to excellent outcomes, including the development of materials to support primary schools. Pupils and staff have benefited from the strategy of embedding Spanish culture across the school and reinforcement of language concepts in other subject areas, increasing the European dimension. We want to build on the success of the collaboration between departments with a broader range of staff from different departments.\r\n\r\nWe plan a two-year project including 20 mobilities to take part in structured training courses in Spain. This will involve 5 teachers from the MFL department, each taking part in an immersion course in the first and second years of the project, and 10 staff from other departments across the school. We will further build on the international activities begun in the first project and increase our capacity to work more closely with our link schools.\r\n\r\nHaving used eTwinning in projects we will use this resource once again. This time in particular we will encourage our students to learn more about Spanish culture which they could contribute directly to our new culture awareness project.  \r\n\r\nWe will focus on staff development, modernisation and internationalisation of our teaching, and  strengthening the link we created with a Spanish school through our first project.\r\n\r\nParticipating staff will increase their knowledge Spanish language and culture, having an impact on their own professional development, job satisfaction and future careers.\r\n\r\nNon specialist staff will have the opportunity to extend and enhance their understanding of the mutual benefits of cross curricular learning. \r\n\r\nParticipation of staff from a range of departments will have an impact on team working in our school, increasing our whole school approach to internationalisation.\r\n\r\nWe will be able to offer pupils a wider choice of languages available for study, a consistent approach to language learning across departments, having a positive impact on pupil learning outcomes, and an enhanced curriculum involving more cross curricular working.\r\n\r\nWe will disseminate our results to our whole staff group, our pupils, our partner primary schools, non language specialist peers from other schools, disseminating our project results beyond the MFL community into other specialist areas, and via the school\u2019s \u2018Stockpress\u2019 newsletter.\r\n\r\nWe will evaluate our project results;\r\n\r\nfor participants via use of CEF personal  reflections and creation of teaching materials based on them, reflections on our school visits and creation of teaching materials and language-teaching policies\r\n\r\nfor our pupils through reading pupils\u2019 letters and discussing experiences with them, and joint projects folders\r\n\r\nfor our partner school via their feedback.\r\n\r\nClassroom/pupil activities will be evaluated via lesson observation and book observations.", "http://www.stockportschool.net/Content/Home/Default.aspx", "Stockport School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035413_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["7JE", "RM3", "STEPPING HILL HOSPITAL"], ["7JE", "RT2", "MENTAL HEALTH UNIT - STEPPING HILL HOSPITAL"], ["7JE", "RT2", "STEPPING HILL HOSPITAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES"], ["7JE", "RWJ", "STEPPING HILL HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SK2"}
