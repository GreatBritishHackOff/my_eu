Perceptions and communication of food risks/benefits across Europe: development of effective communication strategies", "White October Limited", "FoodRisC will characterise key configurations of food risk/benefit relationships and the consequent implications for risk communicators, make recommendations about the unique potential of new social media (e.g. social networks and blogging) and provide a systematic understanding of how consumers deal with food risk/benefit information. The FoodRisC consortium is comprised of experts in key fields relevant to food risk/benefit communication from research institutes, consumer organisations and SMEs in ten Member States. This consortium is supported by an Advisory Board of representatives from seven organisations of world renown in food risk/benefit communication (including EFSA, WHO and Google).The project will identify the barriers to communicating to consumers across Europe and identify key socio-psychological and socio-demographic characteristics, including gender, that affect food risk/benefit perceptions and processes as well as consumer preferences for communication channels. These objectives will be achieved through a range of research approaches and methods and by extending the theoretical basis of how people acquire and use information in food domains. The impact of the project will be at a European level and will be facilitated through the development of the FoodRisC toolkit together with practical guidance to enable the effective communication of coherent messages across the Member States. Use of the toolkit and guides will assist policy makers, food authorities and other end users in developing common approaches to communicating coherent messages to consumers in Europe. The effective spread of food risk/benefit information will assist initiatives aimed at reducing the burden of food-related illness and disease, reducing the economic impact of food crises and ensuring that confidence in safe and nutritious food is fostered and maintained in Europe.", 177737.0, 3209383.0, "FOODRISC", "Online communication of food risks", "Focusing on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, an EU-funded project has provided guidelines for communicating food risk in the digital age.", "Recent incidents such as the German Escherichia coli outbreak have revealed the growing power of online media to dictate the conversation around food risk. Coupled with the often complex nature of food risk communication, it is clear that communicators need new tools to communicate food risk effectively.\n\nThe purpose of the EU-funded FOODRISC project was to map the networks and information sources that are used to spread information on food risks. In particular, the team has examined the potential of social media, with a view to helping risk communicators make better use of these platforms.\n\nFOODRISC first reviewed the role of social media during recent food crises such as the 2011 E.\u00a0coli outbreak and the horse meat scandal. Researchers found that social media has rapidly come to dominate the conversation around food risk.\n\nAn online data collecting tool developed during FOODRISC, called VizzataTM, has proved useful in gauging consumer reactions to various types of content. Using VizzataTM, researchers showed that during the horse meat scandal, consumers were mainly concerned that the labels did not match the contents of the products.\n\nMonitoring online activity has provided similar insights into the perception of other food-related issues, such as genetic modification and animal cloning.\n\nLastly, FOODRISC scientists constructed a freely available http://resourcecentre.foodrisc.org/ (online toolkit), or guide, for food risk communication. This will help to promote coherent and scientifically accurate food risk communication via social media channels.\n\nOnline communication has a vital role to play in ensuring food safety, a research priority of the Horizon\u00a02020 Framework Programme for research and innovation.
