This will be piloted in 5 different countries with 5 groups of marginalised learners. Motive provides a flexible pathway for adult learning including validation of prior learning. The project will develop the methodology and accompanying training and learning resources through 5 phase approach:\r\nPhase 1- Research  and Consultation  The partnership will research  good practices around  personal development in their own country and 15 effective   validation tools within community informal and non-formal learning. The partnership will use the findings to inform the development of the Intellectual outputs and to identify the ways that the Motive method and resources are both innovative and complementary to existing European resources. The partnership will also consult with target learners  to ascertain what the specific barriers they face and to begin the recruitment of Community Learning Champions within each of the partner countries. \r\nPhase 2- Motivate: 5 national Trainers  will participate in the initial pilot of the Community Learning Champions course. They will travel to the UK to be trained with the developed  CLC training course.  This training will equip them with the skills and knowledge to support the CLCs in their new role of Community Learning Managers - CLMs  They will recruit 5 CLCs 25 in total and deliver a local training course to adult learners on how to support personal and self development within informal and non formal learning and support learners from marginalised backgrounds to validate their skills.  Broadcasting clips involving CLMs, CLCs and adult learners will be developed on a national level targeted at learners and the wider public to raise awareness and increase attractiveness.  \r\nPhase 3 - Innovate: P25 CLCs will engage with 150 learners through facilitating practical informal and non formal group workshops CREDOs  (Community Resilience Employability Development Opportunities which will help learners to develop their own personal pathway of learning and harness their interests and passions. These learning opportunities will also be of benefit to the wider community, for example health promotion days. The CLCs will provide further support and guidance to enable the adult learners to recognise the skills and competencies that they already possess and are using within the learning activity and new skills that they are developing. During this phase of the project CLMs will also pilot the Motive  process guidelines and learning resources which the partnership develops to support the CLCs.\r\nThe pilot will investigate 3 dimensions of the training resources and toolkit developed for Community Learning Champion the toolkit itself, b.) How to create a rich learning initiative for others? c.) And, how this process supports learners to move onto positive pathways for example further education?\r\nPhase  4- Validate: As discussed in Stage 3 the CLCS will support the Adult Learners to recognise existing and developing skills and competencies which are identified as key skills within employability. They will do this through the piloting of the Motive Validation toolkit for informal learning. This will be developed through the partnership using the collection of good practices developed in Phase 1 of the project.  The Partnership will also develop other OERs which enable learners to validate their skills in a variety of ways. \u2013 through use of methods such as a personal learning journey, action planning, learning portfolio linking to Europass and EQF. Broadcasting clips involving Adult Education staff, CLCs and adult learners will be developed on a national level demonstrating the successful journey of informal learners in validating these skills. As part of this phase of delivery the CLMs will support CLCs to validate their own skills and learning using the Validation toolkit. \r\nPhase 5- Evaluate: 16 of the Community Learning Champions will also be given the opportunity to undertake a new and innovate 3thinking Impact Assessment.  This impact assessment will be based on creative approach which has been developed by P4 which looks at a project in relation to the person, the organisation delivering it, and the community as a whole. The CLCs will travel to LT to participate in a pilot training course in the 3thinking Impact Assessment. Following on from this the CLCs will complete the impact assessment in their own countries with support from their CLM and P4 and P1. The findings of the Impact Assessment will be put into a National Impact Assessment report and these will be summarised in an EU Executive Summary detailing the findings and conclusions from each of the partner country pilots and making recommendations about how to improve the Motive method and how it can be used in different settings", "http://www.windmillsonline.co.uk", "MERSEYSIDE EXPANDING HORIZONS LIMITED", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA204-000064_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "L37"}
