We want our staff to both visit colleagues\u2019 lessons to further educate themselves in their own subjects. Visiting coworkers\u2019 lessons will help to enhance leadership in class and to help develop reading- and writing skills, especially with our immigrant students. We would like to study our colleagues\u2019 work in UK to accomplish these skills.\r\n \r\nWe believe that developing a good working atmosphere, a good attendance and language development to be three important areas of enhancing better achievement for our students. Also, we have an increasing number of students who do not speak a Nordic language.\r\n\r\nOne area of development which we also wish to study in UK is how to improve learning through language development and thereby reach a better result. Our plan is to let our educators study above mentioned areas of development by collaborating with the educators at our exchange school, in Chester in UK.\r\n\r\nOur wish is to send key staff like senior staff, subject representatives and first teachers to Britain. Our objective is to find representatives from the different subject specializations to gain a true impact on the entire staff, which should strengthen the process of change and cooperation between educators at home in Link\u00f6ping.\r\n\r\nWe want to further educate our language teachers to improve their digital- and language skills, and also their knowledge of social science. We wish to implement all of the above to reach our goals in our plan of internationalization and to let our vision live: \u201cTogether with you, we will promote your best possible potential to succeed in the future\u201d.", "http://www.formbyhighschool.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA101-034342_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "L37"}
