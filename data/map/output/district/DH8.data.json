By its very nature, the surface of a filter is an open structure in which microorganisms can readily settle. Nutrients available in the in-feed enable these to grow. As a result biofilms develop leading to an overall reduction of filtration efficiency of 30-50%, unstable processes and frequent filter change. A multitude of strategies are tried to reduce membrane fouling which in itself demonstrates the urgency of the problem. Current strategies, often used in combination, are: enhanced modules and membranes, cross-flow filtration, low flux, regular back flush, permeate stoppage, scouring, sparging, rinsing cycles, chemical cleaning with soda, caustic or tenside solutions. ConductMem will develop an advanced system that can permanently prevent biofilm formation and surface fouling by the electrolytic production of biocidal oxidising agents on the membrane surface itself. The conductive membrane operates as an anode. The current flow will generate OH-radicals, Ozone and Hydrogen Peroxide on the membrane surface. These oxidizing agents degrade organic matter and disinfect the surface. The technology will be demonstrated by an automated non-fouling membrane filtration unit fitted into the partner\u2019s membrane bioreactor design, incurring an additional cost of less than 15% compared with the state of the art - but with membranes that will last twice as long and not require chemical cleaning. It is expected that the MBR market will grow strongly as environmental directives, aimed at improving the quality of European water, are implemented. And domestic sewage will not be the only waste stream that can benefit from our apparatus. Other industries such as food production, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals will also be convinced by the financial and environmental benefits of treating their waste streams using ConductMem technology.", 170851.0, 1278517.0, "ConductMem", null, null, null, null, "http://www.microbac.co.uk", null, "fp7_100444_996819337"], ["7ND", "Bottom-up fabrication of nano carbon-inorganic hybrid materials for photocatalytic hydrogen production", "Thomas Swan & Co Limited", "CARINHYPH projects deals with the hierarchical assembly of functional nanomaterials into novel nanocarbon-inorganic hybrid structures for energy generation by photocatalyic hydrogen production, with Carbon NanoTubes (CNTs) and graphene the choice of nanocarbons.

The steel demand in Europe in 2011 was estimated to be 145M tons, of which 39M tons p.a. for the construction sector and 16M tons p.a. for structural steel. Most of this steel is carbon or mild steel (as opposed to stainless steel) which corrodes at a high rate and although there are a significant number of anticorrosion solutions on the market, protective coating is most widely used, thanks to its low cost and high versatility. Often, an anticorrosion primer is applied just after manufacturing of steel in order to prevent rusting during storage and transportation before fabrication (cut,weld,drill,etc). Most anticorrosion primers last max 6 month due to poor quality or mechanical damage resulting in corrosion. Additionally, these anticorrosion primers are often too thick (~50\u03bcm) preventing weld quality, so time consuming localised grinding is done to remove the primer. If the primer is thin enough (~25\u03bcm) to allow welding, its anticorrosion properties are so limited, not reducing the risk of corrosion. Above all, the increased zinc content in the weldable primer formulation in order to achieve the anti-corrosion property result in health hazards and discomfort during fabrication process as it releases significant amount of zinc fumes. Alternatively, primers are simply not used at all but the expensive and hazardous blast cleaning of steel is carried out before fabrication which may sometimes be too late that it results in huge material waste and cost. The problem to be solved is the inability of the weldable primer produced today to allow both good quality welding and durable corrosion protection without health hazards.\nThe WeldaPrime project proposes an innovative approach for a zinc free corrosion protection primer with an optimum thickness and affordable cost, offering durable corrosion protection, resistant to mechanical damage and weldable without zinc fumes.", 36107.0, 2124821.0, "WELDAPRIME", null, null, null, "http://weldaprime.com/", "http://www.thomas-swan.co.uk", null, "fp7_111373_984372103"], ["7ND", "High Performance Insulation based on Nanostructure encapsulation of air", "Thomas Swan & Co Limited", "The concept of High Performance Insulation Based on Nanostructured Encapsulation of Air (HIPIN), described in this proposal, is to develop a sustainable and affordable technology to produce a nanostructured thermal insulating coating to improve thermal efficiency in new and retrofitting buildings.

Bacteria in hospitals present a major health issue.The effectiveness of cleaning is considerably enhanced on smooth, scratch-free surfaces.Anti-bacterial silver coatings are available; however they are not used in hospitals due to cost, effectiveness and durability.Copper offers a low cost, effective and environmentally friendly solution that could be readily adopted. The challenge is to retain copper nano-particles in a structure that provides antibacterial functionality, but prevents leaching.The CuVito consortium believes that the silsesquioxane structure, formed using Vitolane technology is the answer.\nSilsesquioxanes have the formula RSiO1.5 (where R is an organic ligand), and form cage or ladder structures.They confer hardness and abrasion resistance to coatings and, by selecting appropriate R groups (e.g. acrylate, glycidoxy) can chemically bond to the organic resin in the formulation controlling cross-link density to enhance durability.Hence silsesquioxanes are inherently suited to use in coatings for surfaces which require regular cleaning.Silsesquioxanes have been available for some years but at a prohibitively high cost, due to the complexity of manufacture.Vitolane technology is an alternative, cost effective production route which has been patented and is currently being scaled up commercially.It has a unique processing feature in allowing simple selection of R groups and it is proposed to use this to bond directly to the copper nanoparticles, resolving the issue of leaching.The objectives of the project of the project are:\n1.Develop a copper nano-particle production process\n2.Functionalise silsesquioxanes with copper using Vitolane technology\n3.Produce a commercially acceptable coating\n4.Validate coating in a hospital environment", 61314.0, 1685792.0, "CUVITO", "Nano-structured antimicrobial materials", "Antimicrobial coatings for the medical and food industries are an important deterrent to development of significant health hazards.

The challenge was to find a way to retain the copper NPs in a structure without inhibiting antibacterial functionality but preventing leaching of copper.\n\nPartners exploited silsesquioxanes, compounds that form cage or ladder structures and confer hardness and abrasion resistance. They can be functionalised by choosing the appropriate side group, R. One of the unique processing features of the patented Vitolane technology is simple selection of R\u00a0group. CUVITO used this feature to bond directly to copper NPs and resolve the bleaching issue.\n\nScientists produced coated textile at lab scale and also produced copper NP-impregnated polymer fibres. Copper NP antimicrobial coatings were created from bases of polyurethane, epoxy, acrylic and polyester. Coatings were applied on aluminium and stainless steel.\n\nAntimicrobial testing in the presence of common hospital microbes demonstrated that the copper-containing fibres developed by CUVITO were equivalent or superior to silver-containing fibres. Work is ongoing to test the fibres in a medical environment.\n\nIn summary, thanks to a close and fruitful collaboration, the consortium has developed a cost-effective method for manufacturing copper NPs exploiting a silsesquioxane structure formed using Vitolane technology. Partners are currently scaling up production to batch level. In the meantime, results have led to six patent applications, three in Mexico and three in Europe, and numerous products being prepared for commercial exploitation.\n\nCUVITO technology will provide a cost-effective and non-toxic alternative to silver antimicrobial coatings for health care and food applications.
