This has led to dramatic cultural, social and political changes and challenges. The study of diaspora and migration has therefore evolved into a burgeoning field of research with an urgent practical relevance. In a wide and sometimes confusing array of approaches it is mainly covered by the humanities and the social sciences. The CoHaB Network unites world-leading institutions in this field in the conviction that interdisciplinary training as well as international and inter-sectoral co-operation are key to any productive study of diasporas. CoHaB gains scope and momentum by its \u2018Network of Networks\u2019 rationale, binding together already existing cooperations. It is based on the resolve to strengthen interdisciplinary research in the field with a view to establishing diaspora studies as a transdisciplinary research area in its own right. Training young researchers on the basis of this conviction means to provide them with the opportunity to conduct their work in a variety of disciplinary environments as well as outside a purely academic context. Specifically, CoHaB aims at stimulating and facilitating cooperation by negotiating core concepts between the various disciplines involved among the partner institutions. Each of these disciplines has developed its own, highly sophisticated understanding of diaspora studies, and it is high time that these diverse understandings entered into a sustained dialogue. For this purpose, early stage researchers from various disciplinary backgrounds, but with similar interests in the field of diaspora studies, will join forces to develop their projects on a shared platform. This will assist them in opening their projects to a strong, interdisciplinary research environment and in producing tangible results for their own research careers, for the scientific community, and for the general public at large.", 225226.0, 2701544.0, "COHAB", "Reconsidering diaspora research", "The concept of diaspora needs to be re-examined because of the changing nature of modern-day events such as conflicts and wars, and labour mobility due to globalisation.

With the support of EU funding, the 'Diasporic constructions of home and belonging' (http://www.itn-cohab.eu (COHAB))\u00a0project has set up an interdisciplinary network of leading diaspora experts to carry out an in-depth study on diaspora by collaborating on projects. The overall aim is to provide a holistic approach to diaspora that integrates humanities, social sciences and various other disciplines.\n\nThe project encourages and facilitates cooperation by funding 12 doctoral and three postdoctoral fellows engaged in research focused on home and belonging.\n\nDuring the first reporting period, a series of outreach activities and joint network events were held focusing on the two notions. Lectures also took place on contemporary issues in diaspora studies.\n\nResearchers participated in training events at their home institutions and presented their research findings at conferences and other international high-profile events.\n\nA global conference on home and belonging was held in Germany in 2013 that was well attended by notable diaspora academics. The event attracted several distinguished keynote speakers.\n\nOther project activities include hosting two of its three planned annual summer schools. These week-long events bring together researchers' findings with lectures, workshops and network panels.\n\nThe project website features a wiki page that serves as a collaborative platform for the researchers to contribute content on topics such as digital diaspora and diaspora law and models.\n\nCOHAB is facilitating knowledge sharing towards a research strategy that crosses many disciplinary boundaries in order to create a common approach to diaspora studies.

While the system for metals recycling is already well established, the rising volumes of waste plastics point to stalemates in the current plastics economy, which hamper its shift to a more circular model. Although there are individual efforts to improve the collection and recycling of WEEE plastics, the plastics value chain is still too fragmented and WEEE recycled plastics seem unattractive material for the end-user. To shift towards circular economy a systematic transformation is required, involving all actors in the value chain and encompassing the entire lifecycle of plastic materials.  \nWhile substantially reducing the WEEE plastics generation and enhancing the use of recycled plastics in new applications, PolyCE will demonstrate the feasibility of circular plastics supply and value chain. In particular, PolyCE will elaborate harmonized set of technical requirements addressing the entire value chain and develop grade system for recycled plastics according to their material properties and final application suitability. Accordingly, PolyCE will strengthen the market for recycled plastics through an online platform integrating the different plastic grades. In parallel, the technical and economic feasibility as well as environmental benefits of using recycled plastics will be validated in several electronics demonstrators. In addition, PolyCE will provide Guidelines for designing new electronics products with recycled plastics.

There is  the clue that transition from school or apprenticeship to work is not always successful and therefore the requirements for young people with disadvantages or disabilities are not availabe.
