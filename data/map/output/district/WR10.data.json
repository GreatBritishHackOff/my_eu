Thus, the vast majority of foams are landfilled at the end-of-life where they take-up a large volume and resist degradation. In addition, foamed polymers constitute a very high level of litter which is persistent in the environment and is the main source of marine debris. As a result of these factors, food retailers are looking to develop foamed packing solutions based on biodegradable polymers from natural sources.

Hence we have extended our international educational programme in 2015. The additional qualification (\"European management assistant\" - EMA) for apprentices (industrial mangement assitants) is designed to assure international and intercultural qualification: The apprenteces attend additional courses about international business processes (such as international marketing, basics of international trade and contracts, law of international sale contracts, shipping documents and foreign payment transactions), and acquire certificates: ECDL-Base, certificats of foreign language competence (Englisch (at least B1, intended B2) and French or Spanish (at least A2).

Additionally 10 interested apprentices in other educational programmes will be offered to participate in a commercial 2-week-internship. Teachers who will be chosen for staff mobility are either already teaching in the Europakaufmann (\"EMA\") or EBBD (European Business Baccalaureate Diploma) programmes or seek to teach in these programmes or want to contribute to the internationalization of our college in another way, e.g. by creating new exchange programmes or projects of cooperation.\r\n\r\nAs all apprentices currently enroled for the \"EMA\" programme are apprentices as industrial management assistants their work placements will also fulfill their training regulation.
