Such processes offer limited commercial viability, generate significant waste streams and raise ethical and sustainability concerns with regards to the feedstocks used (competition with food crops & genetic modification to improve yield). Paralleling conventional petroleum refineries, integrated biorefining overcomes these limitations through utilisation of the wider biomass components to deriving multiple bulk and high value product streams (zero waste processes), thereby achieving commercial competitiveness in line with conventional refineries and enabling a transition from dedicated non-food crops to low cost, readily available and sustainable biomass. The Phytatec Technology Platform is built on this concept, combining environmentally benign critical fluid processes with the selectivity and efficiency of enzyme transformations.\n\nThe BREW-PACK project will apply and further develop the existing Phytatec platform for the integrated biorefining of brewers spent grain \u2018BSG\u2019 (a readily available and low cost biomass feedstock), building on two core areas of innovation:\n\n- Application and further development of existing critical fluid processes for the sequential hydrolysis and fractionation of BSG to lipophilic, proteinaceous and polar (carbohydrate rich) primary material fractions\n- New know-how, strategies and technological development for the separation and knowledge based transformation of BSG proteins, enabling development of multi-layer biopolymer films demonstrating enhanced performance and functionality suitable for innovative high value packaging applications\n\nThe project will conclude with a desk based feasibility study for design of a pilot and subsequent large scale plant, targeting establishment of supply chains worth over \u20ac72 million, generating ~450 new jobs and providing potential benefit to over 9000 wider SMEs.", 239577.0, 1217876.0, "BREW-PACK", null, null, null, null, "http://www.biopac.co.uk", null, "fp7_107803_996063416"], ["2JN", "RENEWABLE ECO-FRIENDLY POLY(LACTIC ACID) NANOCOMPOSITES FROM WASTE SOURCES", "Biopac (Uk) Limited", "Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a compostable polymer derived from renewable food-derived sources (mainly starch and sugar beet) and possesses the highest potential for a commercial major scale production of renewable packaging materials.

The main objective of ECLIPSE is to revalorize waste-derived products (algae biomass waste and plant and crustacean wastes) into novel packaging materials. The ECLIPSE approach intends to revalorize waste materials for the production of an algae-derived PLA matrix. In addition, ECLIPSE also seeks to reinforce such PLA matrix with functionalized nanofillers extracted from non-edible banana plant, almond shell and crustacean shell wastes. This project aims at decreasing both the production costs of both poly(lactic acid) and algae biodiesel, by increasing the added value of algae waste via its revalorisation into the production of lactic acid.\n\nTo this purpose, the industrial partnership was designed to combine leading companies to supply the raw materials involved in the project, namely algae (ALGAENERGY), lactic acid (GALACTIC), PLA (FUTERRO), banana waste (BANACOL) and seafood waste (ANTARTIC), with sound research groups active on biopolymers and nanoparticle functionalisation and dispersion (UMONS, CIDETEC, FRAUNHOFER, LTU, UPV/EHU, UPB, PUC) and a global end user with multiple plastic packaging converting facilities.

The project focused on packaging fresh steak, wanting to extend shelf life and quality, enhance safety, and reduce food and packaging waste.\n\nFirst, the project successfully tested biopolymers produced by bacteria from biological waste as a replacement for currently used plastic films.

Foam packaging is an essential part of the food processing and transport process to prevent damage and spoilage. However, they are made from synthetic polymers and have low density (50 kg/m3) which makes them difficult to recycle economically. Thus, the vast majority of foams are landfilled at the end-of-life where they take-up a large volume and resist degradation. In addition, foamed polymers constitute a very high level of litter which is persistent in the environment and is the main source of marine debris. As a result of these factors, food retailers are looking to develop foamed packing solutions based on biodegradable polymers from natural sources. Only Poly lactic acid (PLA) is produced in sufficient tonnages as a natural alternative. However, due to its\u2019 chemical structure, PLA thermally degrades during processing which prevent the production of low density unmodified PLA foams using traditional extrusion technologies. Only modified PLAs have been successfully foamed to low densities. However these modified PLAs rely on technologies only available from the USA and the modification process affects the final properties and biodegradation behaviour. The proposed \u2018PLA-Foam\u2019 project will develop a supercritical CO2 assisted foam extrusion process and thermoforming method that will produce unmodified PLA foam products with greatly reduced thermal degradation. This will enable the consortium to produce low density foams using unmodified PLAs whose performance and biodegradation behaviour will exceed current alternative.

The recycling of these products is very expensive and time-consuming due to the high labour cost for the collection and the impossibility to be automatized.

So far, existing bio-degradable plastics have serious product costs and performance issues that are unacceptable to agricultural-horticultural professionals. In addition, there are no clear methods to test the migration levels of biodegradable agricultural plastics in contact with agri-food during their growth.\nBy joining the efforts of three National Associations from Agricultural, Bioplastic and Food Quality sectors, DEGRICOL Consortium will develop cost-competitive, 100% natural-based bioplastic formulation based on a thermally stable and crystalline PLA matrix for the manufacturing of Agriculture and Horticulture accessories. Such formulation will contain natural fillers (such as lignin or chitosan) isolated from animal- and agro-residues to further reduce costs and, and bio-surfactants (humic acid-like) isolated from compost of urban food or agro-residues to improve and control the biodegradation process according to their use.
