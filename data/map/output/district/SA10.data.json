We try to encourage our students to do work practice abroad because we think it is a very valuable experience.\r\n\r\nDuring some years now, we have had successful mobility projects together with a school in the Netherlands, Lentiz MBO, and we also participate in a Strategic Partnership project together with Lentiz MBO, a school in Wales (NPTC Group) and a school in Finland (Kainuun Ammattiopisto) . We want to continue this cooperation and give more students the opportunity to go abroad for work practice and new experiences. We would also like our teachers and instructors to get use of this cooperation through exchange of experiences, participation in the other schools classrooms , visits to work placements etc. Furthermore we see this as a good opportunity for our vocational teachers to improve their english, with focus on English professional, which will be helpful for our students in the end.\r\n\r\nWe are first of all applying to send  a class of 9 Animal Husbandry students (D16DJ) to do 2 weeks work practice in the Netherlands, the spring 2018. These students will be hosting a class from  the Netherlands this spring (2017) when they are coming to Grans for work practice. In this case we need an Accompanying Person, because some of the students have special needs.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we are applying to send students on work practice in connection to participating in one of the course modules we have developed during the strategic partnership project we are involved in (AHENE). The students can apply to two different modules at each partner school; Reptiles and First Aid for Animals in the Netherlands, Beef Cattle and Sheep Husbandry in Wales, and dairy Cows and Dogs in Finland. (We also have two modules at Grans; Nordic Animals and Sled Dogs). The course modules are 4 weeks in total with one week of theory, one week of practical training at school and two weeks at a company within the field of the module. We are only  appliyng for three of the four weeks, which are the weeks of work practice/training. We aim to send at least 2 students per module, in total 12 students.\r\n\r\nFinally, we are applying for sending 8 staff/teachers to our partner schools in Wales and the Netherlands, (one week/person)\r\n\r\nWith this project we hope to give the participants more skills in their profession, increase their understanding of the different conditions  for agriculture and animal care, give them experiences that will strengthen their self-confidence and entrepreuneric skills, increase the understanding of other cultures and improve their ability to communicate in English, especially English used in their profession.\r\n\r\nWe see this project as a way to strengthen our students for the labour market and increase the quality of our school\u00b4s education even further.", "http://www.nptcgroup.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA102-034249_2"], ["6JL", "European Initial Vocational Placements 2017", "Towers Hotel and Spa", 525530.0, "Context:\r\n\r\nThe Departament d'Ensenyament (Ministry of Education of Catalonia), considering (1) the experience gained in 17 years in VET mobility projects, (2) the launch of the Erasmus+ program and (3) aware of the remaining barriers to the promotion of mobility, launched during the academic year 2014-2015 the \u201cProgramme for training mobility and European and international cooperation in VET institutions\u201d to give a new impetus to mobility strategies not only within the Departament d'Ensenyament but also at VET schools.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, this Erasmus+ (VET) project \u201cEuropean Initial Vocational Placements 2017\u201d (EUROINVOC 2017) is part of this wider joint strategy, which also includes another consortium project in the Erasmus+ higher education area.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\nAs a result, the Directorate General for IVET and Specialised Studies of the Departament d\u2019Ensenyament aims to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Erasmus+ KA1 action:\r\n\r\n1. Improvement of the internationalization strategies of the VET schools\r\n2. Contribution to the improvement and innovation of the VET curriculum\r\n3. Creation of a more modern, dynamic and professional collaborative environment in VET institutions\r\n\r\nso as to achieve the specific objectives of the project:\r\n\r\n1. Promotion of the exchange of best practices among VET schools\r\n2. Increase of the number of VET schools in mobility projects and improve the quality of its management.\r\n3. Increase of the number of stable partnerships between the Departament d\u2019Esenyament and VET institutions, and their respective partners.\r\n4. Improvement of the professional skills of both students and teachers involved in projects.\r\n5. Improvement of the knowledge of the Erasmus+ programme by the educational community.\r\n6. Improvement of the skills of teachers in relation to the implementation of the dual vocational training in Catalonia, taking the experience of more established European models.\r\n6. Contribution to the implementation of the CLIL methodological approach for language learning in VET.\r\n\r\nDescription of activities:\r\n\r\nIn this consortium project for VET 71 centers throughout Catalonia are involved; 91 mobility flows to a total of 13 EU countries (Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Slovenia, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, United Kingdom and Sweden) will be carried out. The duration of the flows varies from 14-90 days and the participants come from all VET sectors.\r\nTThe flows distribution is as follows:\r\n\r\na) 88 flows for 214 VET students at intermediate level (equivalent to EQF 4), lasting between 31-90 days. The minimum duration is 31 days to make the experience truly meaningful. Work placements are an integral part of the compulsory in-company training, and there will be full recognition of the activities.\r\n\r\nb) one flow of 15 students in basic VET training (equivalent to EQF 3). The duration is 14 days, with 4 accompanying trainers. The work placements have academic character with full recognition of training.\r\n\r\nc) one flow for teachers training; 15 trainers in intermediate VET will participate in a Job Shadowing experience on the dual system in Germany. The duration of the stay is 5 days of training.\r\n\r\nd) one flow for teachers training; 13 trainers in intermediate VET will participate in a Job Shadowing experience on CLIL methodology in Finland. The duration of the stay is 5 days of training.\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\n\r\nTwo devices are going to be used for the management of this project, which are:\r\n\r\n1. Public call for selection of VET schools organizing stays for the academic year 2017-2018. These schools are included in the consortium project EUROINVOC 2017.\r\n2. The programme of training mobility and European and international cooperation in VET, within the Departament d'Ensenyament, launched last year.\r\n\r\nThese devices contemplate in turn control measures for the quality of placements and project management. These devices are reinforced by the use of:\r\n\r\n1. ODISSEA: moodle platform for the management of stays included in EUROINVOC 2017: information and documentation.\r\n2. qBID: platform for the approval and monitoring of the host companies, as well as the evaluation and validation of the internship.\r\n\r\nResults and Impact:\r\n\r\n- Improvement of professional and transferable skills of students. Contribution to the achievement of the diploma.\r\n- Increased awareness of Erasmus+ program.\r\n- Increased mutual trust between VET institutions and their partners, and improved quality of the stays and their management.\r\n- Improvement of the skills of VET teachers on the dual VET system.\r\n- Improvement of the skills of VET teachers on the CLIL approach.\r\n\r\nLong-term benefits:\r\n- Improvement of the image of VET institutions, making them more attractive to potential students.\r\n- Increase of the number of VET institutions active in mobility.\r\n- Strengthening the regional strategy of the Departament d\u2019Ensenyament in the promotion of mobility.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037014_20"], ["7RF", "Vleugels", "Neath Port Talbot College", 90033.0, "Under the new name \u201cWings\u201d, \u201cVleugels\u201d in Dutch, we further develop our last KA-1-project \u201cInternational working placements on farms in Western Europe\u201d of Vabi (> 5 years) and our involvement in the KA2 project Agri-ECVET that is co\u00f6rdinated in Holland (2 years). In the past we have sent around 20 students a year on a two week traineeship with a farmer, and around 10 students attended a practical course in one of our agricultural partnerschools within the Agri-ECVET project.\r\n\r\nWith this application we fuse both projects and we apply for the schoolyear 2017-2018 for 53 students. The strategy is still to send students on practical courses and working placements on agricultural companies, but this time we also want to give the students of the other directions in our school (horticulture, animal care and biotechnics) the opportunity to have an international experience. The project name \u201cWings\u201d has a connection with most of these directions and refers to exploring. The students we want to send out will mainly come from the following directions: +/- 30 students from 6TSO/7BSO agriculture, 12 students from 6TSO/7BSO animal care, 8 students from 6TSO/7BSO horticulture and 3 students from 6TSO Biotechnics. The majority will still come from the direction agriculture, of which all last year students will be sent out. For animal care, horticulture and biotechnics there will be a selection based on motivation, attitude, level of English,\u2026 . We will also take into account the social background of the students in order to give chances to the socially vulnerable.\r\n\r\nFlow A1: 30 students will attend a traineeship in France or the Netherlands. These are students of agriculture and horticulture. These students will be placed on an agricultural or horticultural company in France or the Netherlands. The countries are very different concerning language and culture, but also in terms of agriculture and horticulture. The student can choose the type of company: a pig farm, a dairy farm, an arable farm, a greenhouse company, a gardener, \u2026 We find it important to place our students in companies with a warm family-like atmosphere. Most of the time the students can stay with a hosting family and in this way they experience other customs and other cultures. The weekend is the perfect time for cultural excursions with the hosting family. We go to different countries because every country has its own agricultural and horticultural specialities. The Netherlands are famous for their pig farms and greenhouses, Normandy is famous for cattle and arable farms. The just before the actual traineeship is used to introduce the region to the students. There is a weekend program with cultural and agricultural or horticultural visits organised and accompanied by two teachers. Sunday evening all students are at their working placements and the actual traineeship can begin. In these two weeks the students are also visited by two teachers and in the end of the traineeship the teacher picks them up again, after evaluating the traineeship with the farmer.\r\n\r\nFlow A2: 25 students will attend a traineeship of 3 to 4 weeks on an agricultural school in Wales, the Netherlands, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark or Austria. Already two years we are involved with Vabi in a network of 5 agricultural schools (KA2-project Agri-ECVET), and now we will join a parallel animal care schools network, that exists for 2 years under the name Ahene (the Ahene-project is a highly regarded KA2-project in the Netherlands, https://vimeo.com/161062967). By linking both networks, we are in a network of 9 European schools each organizing 1 or 2 practical courses. Vabi organizes one course already in this network and will organize an extra course in the future. At the\r\n\r\nmoment there are around 12 innovative courses, especially around animal care and agricultural subjects. The courses are practically orientated with a lot of visits, working placements, \u2026 Some topics students can choose are: the lambing season in Wales, sledgedogs in Sweden, First Aid for small pets in the Netherlands, high yielding dairy cows, agro-marketing, \u2026 In each course there are around 10 students from different countries and this makes it especially interesting for young people to learn from each other\u2019s cultures.\r\n\r\nWe are growing in our international story, not only in quantity, but also in quality thanks to partners we have known for years, but also thanks to the new partners we are looking forward to work with. The new partners have already proven their virtue in the parallel network.\r\n\r\nWith Wings we take a new step in our internationalisation, with possibilities for every student in VABI!", "http://www.nptcgroup.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-BE02-KA116-034804_9"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SA10"}
