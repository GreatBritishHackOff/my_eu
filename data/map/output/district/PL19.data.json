Our school has the task and mission to develop an intercultural teaching practice supported by innovative methods and entrepreneurship to achieve a more entrepreneurial learning for the benefits of our students. For some years now, we have run a number of international projects to develop our school and the training provided, and our experience is that it is a successful means to foster an international spirit to help make young people mobile and apt to actively seek a career or education in other European countries. It is of great importance that the teachers expose themselves to the international experiences we prompt our students to seek. Going abrouad for work shadowing is a step in the right direction. Participating teachers learn new methods to develop their teaching to enable a growing number of students succeed in their learning, which will impove their odds on the European work market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe method to obtain the targets is to enable our teachers to develop their own learning as well as the learning of others through a greater intercultural understanding, improved lingusitic skills, stonger professional skills and an enhanced self-esteem. The international perspective provided by the project makes it possible to view oneself from a European perspective, which helps the individual to (also) take the steps forward as they are included in an international context which prompts initiative. The participant teachers learn new methods to develop their teaching to make a greater number of students succeed in their learning. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn line with the aims for Education 2020, we add to our students' opportunities by making them more attractive in their future work fields by making them develop entrepreneurial skills, their professional special skills as well as their cultural know-how and understanding.  We do this by developing the entrepreneurial learning by  focusing on ICT pedagogy, collaboration between education and enterprises  increased student influence and tutoring/mentoring as well as by by adding to their linguistic competences and sense of democracy as a result of them being included in an international context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this stage, 24 of our teachers will perform five days of work shadowing and study how teachers in carefully chosen schools work with a strong development in the chosen fields of interest, i.e. Modern Languages, Mathematics and the Natural Sciences.  The participants will be selected upon submission of an application, and they will then prepare for the time abroad linguistically and culturally. We will use the chart provided by the commission and also create learning agreements an formulate learning outcomes for all participants.

Our partners for work shadowing are Newton Abbot College, Tavistock College and South Devon College. In addition, a great number of our vocational students, 146 to be precise, will do work experience with numerous organisations and enterprises in England, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Poland. All organisations to be receiving partners have had vocational students from us in previous projects, which ensures that they will take on our students in the very best way and provide them with supervision, relevant work as well as plan, carry our and assess to what degree the learning outcomes have been reached in the time of work placement. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participants will be selected upon submission of an application, and they will then prepare for the time abroad linguistically and culturally.

The students who engage in work placements elsewhere in Europe will inspire other students to do the same in the future.
