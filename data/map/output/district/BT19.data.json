Audio technologies and coding methods are as essential to the development of very high quality immersive and interactive 3D media as MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3) has been to on-line music and streaming media. Sound is directional: the positioning of sound sources and the acoustics of the space are critical to the experience, impact and sense of presence. Future 3D media and the Internet will need to make it possible to locate and navigate 3D sound as well as vision. Current channel-based approaches to audio coding are unsuitable in several respects and object-based schema such as MPEG-4 AudioBIFS (ABIFS) and Advanced AudioBIFFS (AABIFFS) have so far proved too complex to implement. CASA will research an develop a new 3D audio object approach, based on the application of Auditory Scene Analysis and metadata-based processing to create algorithms, codecs and methods for delivering multi-channel audio that can support 3D interaction. The resulting tools will make it possible for audio engineers to capture and transmit the audio mix as metadata, which can be transmitted with audio assets in such a way as to recreate the audio scene in an optimum way, in any digital environment be it a smart phone, PCs, games console, in-car or home entertainment system, or cinema. The project will be implemented in a programme of work built around a series of exchanges of scientific and technical staff between an academic research centre Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT, Ireland), specialising in audio research and algorithm development; Europe\u2019s leading audio codec developers at DLLNI Ltd (UK) and a specialist SME audio postproduction company (Tamborine Ltd, UK).", 226705.0, 509535.0, "CASA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.dts.com", null, "fp7_96579_998866619"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1QS", "Europeaan Imput in Lifelong Learning Lab", "KILCOOLEY WOMENS CENTRE", 43554.0, "In the next two years, Learn for Life will extend, both around the festival as with its other activities, in particular its subject- oriented expertise with knowledge and skills on new themes.\r\nThe goals of the project EILLL are:\r\n1. further strengthen and organize the Festival of renewal of the Learning and other activities by Learn for Life.\r\n2. competence development of the professionals and volunteers involved\r\n2. reaching specific target audiences, notably young job seekers, refugees and the elderly who want to continue to participate in society\r\n3. more young people interested in working in adult education.\r\nTo this end, the insights need to be processed and transformed into new initiatives, activities and projects with a focus on implementation in local activities, whether in the Learning Festival framework.\r\nThe most important topics are:\r\n- Theme health and education\r\n- Theme Refugees and education\r\n- Theme elderly and education\r\n- Theme youth in adult education\r\nLearn for Life makes use of project partners, which have long time cooperation, either in Grundtvigprojecten or within EAEA. On this basis, a trust arise, thereby avoiding risky commitments. The expertise of these organizations are in line with our learning needs.\r\nThe participants are administrative and staff and volunteers involved in the activities of Learn for Life.\r\nCriteria for the selection of participants:\r\n- Already several years and actively involved from a pronounced 'drive' to Learn for Life and / or the Festival\r\n- Focus on people for whom learning is not obvious\r\n- The desire and ability to learn and share the gained expertise in Learn for Life and other relevant organizations\r\n- Willingness to participate in a two-year lifelong learning lab focused on job development, innovation and implementation\r\nEach participant is its own package of activities to participate formulated to suit his / her learning needs and the needs of Learn for Life on feedback and accounting within the Learn for Life organization.\r\nThe two-year project includes four five-day training sessions and six- three-day seminars.
