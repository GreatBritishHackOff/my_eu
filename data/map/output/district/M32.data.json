For this purpose, environmental-friendly bactericides will be fixed onto nonwoven textiles assuring a long lasting biocide effect and optimum mechanical properties. Legionella is present in all aqueous media. However it becomes a threat for human health when appropriate conditions for its growth and proliferation are met, which frequently happens in large in-doors facilities using systems for climate control: cooling systems, sanitary water distribution equipment (tanks, boilers, heaters and pipes) and other equipment subject to similar conditions. All large public facilities need climate control equipment. The same happens in industrial facilities, where apart from human comfort, specific conditions are needed to prevent malfunctioning processes. During period 2003-2004, a total of 9.166 cases of legionnaire's disease were reported by 35 countries in the European continent. The overall mortality rate was 8,2%, increasing to a 40% for immunocompromised patients (i.e. in hospitals). Within this scenery, increasing regulation for the installation, operation and maintenance of climate control equipment for large facilities in relation to Legionella has lead to the requirement for more effective bactericide systems. LegioTex will be an opportunity for SMEs in the sector to improve their competitive position by developing an innovative product able to prevent Legionella outbreaks, which complies with applicable normative and minimizes installation and maintenance costs. LegioTex will also be an opportunity for SMEs in the textile sector, allowing for a high-tech application of nonwoven fabrics, and SMEs in the textile chemicals sector, by developing an environmental-friendly biocide for LegioTex.", 5268.0, 1187059.0, "LEGIOTEX", null, null, null, "http://www.legiotex.eu/", "http://www.accepta.com", null, "fp7_93706_998883109"], ["0TH", "Fostering Innovation and Creativity in Europe through Public Administration Modernization towards Supplying and Exploiting Linked Open Statistical Data", "Trafford Borough Council", "The OpenGovIntelligence project aims at stimulating sustainable economic growth in Europe through fostering innovation in society and enterprises.

Specifically, by 2020 it is expected that over 500 million barrels/day of produced water (PW) and about 15 million m\u00b3/day of refinery wastewater (RW) are generated. Despite the necessity and potential beneficial impacts of reusing the water involved in extraction and refining activities,  several significant barriers are hampering this opportunity. Firstly, the existent commercial water treatment technologies cannot be used directly in the O&G sector without an extensive adaptation, and they are not flexible and reliable enough to bear the complexity and variability of PW/RW composition. Moreover, there is no expertise or experience in the O&G sector in the design and operation of water treatment systems.\n\nThe INTEGROIL project aims to develop and demonstrate a robust but flexible integrated solution for treating O&G water flows with variable compositions to different water qualities depending on the final reuse objective. This new solution will be readily designed with different modules each comprising innovative water treatment technologies that will be operated and optimized in an integrated manner through a novel Decision Support System, in line with 3 priorities of the EIP Water. The INTEGROIL approach ensures minimal design and operational efforts involved from the O&G end-user side and that the energy and chemical costs are kept to an absolute minimum for a certain target water quality. Its feasibility and long-term application will be assessed through demo activities in 2 real operational conditions, that will provide critical information for the commercialisation actions to be undertaken.\n\nThe INTEGROIL consortium brings together 10 entities (6 SMEs) covering the full value chain, including technology developers, O&G end-users, a Sustainability Assessment firm and a professional association.", 138683.0, 5025595.0, "INTEGROIL", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_202633_937218366"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["0TH", "Greater Manchester ESF Co-Financing Organisation \u2013 GM Working Well Programme", "Trafford Council (operating on behalf of Greater Manchester Combined Authority)", "The Working Well Programme is a central pillar of Greater Manchester\u2019s devolution agreement with Government.
