The FabriGen project aims to combine organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials with tensile fabrics to enable the construction of solar-power generating fabric structures. These structures could be connected to the grid, or used for distributed power generation, and will enable generators to participate in Feed-In-Tariff schemes that are being offered to promote the uptake of renewable energy technologies.\nThe FabriGen project will research the use of commercial roll-to-roll printing technologies to deposit and pattern state-of-the-art OPV materials and produce large-area PV modules (20cm in research, scaling up to 100cm roll width). Means to integrate the PV fabrication processes with polyester fabric membranes will be developed. A key aspect of the research will be development and integration of barrier and encapsulation layers to provide long-life performance needed for outdoor use.

This opens up new opportunities for creating thin, lightweight large-area PV panels with potentially lower cost.", "Currently, the EU faces strong competition from China's solar panel industry that exports panels at very low prices. To fend off competition, there has been a turn to non-silicon-based and thin-film PV technologies. However, these technologies have only marginal benefits and installation requirements are similar to conventional solar panels. In addition, modules are mostly rigid panels and cannot be integrated into large structures without modifying the architecture design.\n\nThe EU-funded project FABRIGEN (Fabric structures for solar power generation) decreased module and installation costs by combining flexible OPV materials with tensile fabrics using roll-to-roll production techniques. The ability to produce the panels on fabric surfaces means that complex shapes can be designed to maximise solar collection.\n\nCovering large areas with flexible polymer structures costs less than glass, with applications spanning from walkway shades, bus stops and carport covers to arcades and stadiums. The organic solar cells also do not contain the customary indium-tin-oxide that is scarce, expensive and brittle. Instead, project partners used aluminium that is cheaper and can be scaled up to produce aluminium foils.\n\nFABRIGEN modules comply with European and international standards and regulations for implementation in off-grid as well as grid-connected or feed-in-tariff (FIT) power schemes. In the short term, FIT plans provide operators with incentive for investment by paying them for energy produced in their installed systems such as shades.\n\nIn the long term, scientists envision a final system in which FIT schemes will be unnecessary given the low cost of the PV technology compared to grid prices. Taken together, the materials and technology promise to bring the cost of solar power on par with that of conventional energy.\n\nReduced production, transportation and operating costs should encourage investment in PV solar power. The technology is truly pioneering as there is nothing comparable available on the market today.

Reducing the need for immunosuppression would dramatically improve the outcome for transplant recipients and reduce health costs for society. The means to achieve this goal has not been realised with pharmacological or biological agents yet. Conditioning the immune response of solid organ transplant recipients towards allograft acceptance using cell-based therapies is now becoming technically feasible and clinically promising. The central focus of our proposed cooperative work programme is to produce distinct populations of haematopoietic regulatory cells and comparatively test their safety and efficacy in minimising pharmacological immunosuppression in solid organ transplantation. Preparations of regulatory T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells will be licensed for clinical manufacture in outstanding research facilities across Europe, and subsequently, these different tolerance-promoting cell types will be assessed in a single Phase I/II clinical study for safety, clinical practicality and efficacy. The therapeutic potential of these cells will be directly compared using one, single clinical protocol. In addition, we will study the tolerogenic characteristics of these regulatory cell types at in-depth molecular and functional levels. These integrative, but very focused, research plans are expected to result in the identification of the most promising regulatory cell products for further testing, and commercial exploitation: the final outcome is to identify a cell product which has genuine potential to induce operational tolerance if correctly applied in a Phase IIb clinical trial.

They are produced by embedding load-bearing fibres into a thermosetting or thermoplastic resin matrix. Depending on the choice of fibre, resin and their physical structure, a wide range of properties can be obtained and in large part this explains their widespread use. \n\nAvailable manufacturing processes include hand or spray layup, resin transfer moulding (RTM), compression moulding, vacuum infusion and the use of pre-impregnated materials, which are normally consolidated in pressurised autoclaves. The choice of fibre, fabric and matrix materials influence processing requirements, so that selecting a manufacturing process is a complex decision taking into account material properties, cost, quality, capital expenditure and the number of parts to be manufactured.\n\nComposite manufacturing processes are slow, labour intensive and consequently costly. For example, RTM requires high capital investment for tooling and resin injection equipment. Prepreg materials are expensive to purchase and the cost of autoclaves is only justified for high value applications. Vacuum infusion is slow with ongoing consumable costs. Although the use of composites has increased in aerospace and wind energy markets, high manufacturing costs continue to hold back composites growth, particularly in high volume markets. \n\nForward Composites has a solution to the above issues. We have demonstrated a new process where infusion time can be reduced by over 80% and materials costs can be reduced by up to 75% compared to prepregs. Once fully commercialised, labour savings will be realised through automation and cure times will be reduced using localised heating and cooling solutions.
