To fight counterfeiting, the European Central Bank has implemented strict requirements under the Banknote Recycling Framework which require that no counterfeit notes are re-circulated by cash handling devices. In Northern Europe, today approx 15 000 point of sales systems are already equipped with both coin and note recycler systems and market in Europe is at a tipping point where self-service and self-checkout systems are gradually gaining in acceptance as a mainstream retail technology. These systems, integrated with the proposed EUROTHENTIC Cash Checking Machine system, will enable efficient and secure recycling of money. The advantages for the stores are secure and lower cost for cash handling due to amount of cash in store is reduced and also back-office work and CIT will be minimized. This will also enable cash back function - consumers to be able to withdraw cash directly at checkouts. While automated systems for validating bank notes are currently available, they have yet to find wide acceptance in the retail sector due to high capital costs and in particular performance considered slow by the sectors standards. The EUROTHENTIC project aims to overcome the current technical barriers to wide scale adoption of cash authentication technology by creating a low-cost, retrofitable cash validating module. The module will have the capability for high performance note processing and image recording, intelligent image analysis utilising a neural network approach and secure networking to provide remote system updates and a database facility for the secure tracking of bank note serial numbers and other characteristics such as location and time.'", 280309.0, 1258758.0, "EUROTHENTIC", "Improved cash handling systems for retail", "A novel automated system for checking bank notes, in an effort to prevent counterfeit, shows promise for cash handling operations in stores.", "To combat counterfeiting, strict requirements have been implemented by the European Central Bank (ECB) under the Banknote Recycling Framework: no counterfeit notes are to be recirculated by cash handling devices. The northern European market has some 15\u00a0000 point-of-sale systems equipped with coin and note recycler systems. The market is at a pivotal point, with self-service and self-check\u2013out systems gradually gaining in acceptance as a mainstream retail technology.\n\nThe 'Development of a secure, modular, cash checking machine' (http://www.eurothentic.com/ (EUROTHENTIC)) project proposed the integration of these systems with its Bank Note Validation system to enable the efficient and secure recycling of money. Stores can benefit from more secure cash handling, as cash in store amounts can be reduced, and back-office work and cash in transit minimised. The system can also support a cashback function so consumers can withdraw cash directly at checkout points, safe in the knowledge that the bank notes have been validated.\n\nAlthough automated systems for validating banknotes do exist, their high capital costs and perceived slow performance are a stumbling block to wide retail sector acceptance. Crucially, they do not address the critical fitness test, to see if the notes are in a condition suitable for redistribution.\n\nEUROTHENTIC focused on overcoming technical barriers to the wide-scale adoption of cash authentication technology through development of a low-cost, retrofittable cash-validating module. The module is capable of high-performance note processing and image recording. It can perform intelligent image analysis through a neural network approach and offer secure networking with remote system updates. It can also incorporate a database facility for secure tracking of banknote serial numbers and other features such as time and location.\n\nFinal project results show that all major objectives were achieved, primarily concerning the creation of a money validation prototype. As a result of this success, project beneficiaries now have a clearer understanding regarding the handling and validation of money as well as the technical aspects required to get this product on the market in Europe. Ultimately, small shops and retail chains alike will access new revenue streams through banking services and in the end save on money handling, transport and exchange fees.", null, "http://www.v-viz.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/149760.jpg", "fp7_100630_964486327"], ["9BE", "Innovative Non-Destructive Corrosion Under Paint Integrated Detection System", "Intervision Global Ltd", "Corrosion under paint (CUP) is a ubiquitous and persistent problem which affects almost every part of the entire infrastructure of modern civilization. Apart from the great economic damage which it causes annually, it also compromises the safety, environmental and aesthetic characteristics of the affected structures, machinery and other artifacts.\nMetals in their natural state exist as the various oxides that form ores and it is only with the application of large amounts of energy to process, refine and form them, that they are converted into useful industrial artifacts. However, it is thermodynamically inevitable that metals in such an activated state will always return to the energetically lower state of being oxides.\n\nThis project shall deliver three novel, fully developed and complementary NDT Techniques. These techniques, both individually and in combination, represent a truly disruptive technology: they are completely non-contact and can instantly detect CUP under very large areas of painted surfaces from stand-off distances of up to ten metres or more. It is even possible for to perform rapid stand-off detection of CUP on painted surfaces which are underwater.\nSuch a CUP detection system would offer an immediate market advantage and SME participants currently active in the CUP NDT sector shall be able to both negotiate favorable licensing terms and also be able to control and direct product development in line with their specific commercial requirements.

Scientists working on the EU-funded project 'Innovative non-destructive corrosion under paint integrated detection system' (http://www.cupidndt.com/ (CUPID)) are developing a pioneering solution to this global problem.\n\nThe disruptive technology for non-destructive testing (NDT) will instantly detect corrosion under paint from distances of up to 10\u00a0m and even under water. It combines three different NDT techniques to be used individually or in a complementary fashion. Millimetre-wave and near-infrared imaging exploit non-ionising radiation. Capacitance imaging will use electrode arrays in air to produce an electric field in materials that changes according to properties.\n\nCUPID's system will be an immediate market booster for the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) involved. This will create socioeconomic advantages for the EU economy, businesses and society.\n\nDuring the first reporting period, the team produced stand-alone prototypes of all three techniques as well as associated microcontrollers and software. Given the groundbreaking nature of the proposed NDT system for corrosion under paint, the consortium has secured foreground intellectual property protection. A United Kingdom patent application establishes a priority protection date for any later international patents based on the project's results.\n\nThe CUPID system will include various combinations of the three NDT technologies integrated according to target application. It is expected to revolutionise the way corrosion under paint is detected and treated for major impact on the durability of virtually all infrastructure. Equally as important in difficult economic times, it will provide access to large global markets for the partner SMEs.
