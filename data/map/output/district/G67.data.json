The project will integrate existing European infrastructures into a \u201cEuropean flexible OLED pilot line\u201d, which will operate in an open access mode and serve customers from along the value chain with individual product designs, validation of upscaling concepts, and system-level flexible OLED integration. \n\nThe Consortium will connect the most advanced pilot line facilities with the best material providers and equipment manufacturers, creating a service that will offer substantial numbers of flexible OLEDs that can meet efficiency, durability and cost requirements of end users. Together with end-users for various markets, such as automotive and designer luminaires, PI-SCALE will demonstrate the capabilities of this pilot line doing process optimisation for product demonstrators to enable cost efficient production and facilitate an effective market introduction.  \n\nIn addition PI-SCALE will include a number of outreach activities to actively engage and educate interested users and suppliers for flexible OLEDs in interactive product concept development. PI-SCALE will not only support the market acceptance of flexible OLED products, but it will also ensure that prototype ideas from European companies will have the possibility of reaching a semi-industrial scale in a very short time.", 80847.0, 13415743.0, "PI-SCALE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_199175_959192455"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1JW", "BG+ Lanarkshire Lead Partner Direct Staff Costs", "North Lanarkshire Council", "Management costs as permitted by national rules", "ERDF", 71960.86, 179902.16, "erdf_scotland_77"], ["1JW", "Business Advisory, Expert Help and Workshop Support", "North Lanarkshire Council", "Identify and work closely with 1624 SME\u2019s across Lanarkshire to develop growth aspirations, provide specific expert- help, specialist advisory services focusing on overcoming sectoral and market development / generic barriers to growth.", "ERDF", 1214048.96, 3035122.4, "erdf_scotland_78"], ["1JW", "Business Competitiveness Grant Support - Lanarkshire", "North Lanarkshire Council", "Grant support for sustainable business growth, helping SMEs to implement projects which safeguard or increase employment (with a focus on youth employment) and increase their turnover", "ERDF", 510000.0, 1275000.0, "erdf_scotland_79"], ["1JW", "North Lanarkshire Council Lead Partner Management and Compliance", "North Lanarkshire Council", "Strategic Intervention management, administration and compliance.", "ESF", 436442.87, 1091107.18, "esf_scotland_191"], ["1JW", "North Lanarkshire's Working Employability Pipeline", "North Lanarkshire Council", "The operation will support participants with multiple barriers to progressing in the labour market through an employer engagement programme - assessing employers recruitment needs and matching opportunities for unemployed people; and provide warp around care including work based training, health interventions, debt & money advice, IT provision, vocational training, support with dependent care, literacy & numeracy.", "ESF", 3026606.58, 7566516.58, "esf_scotland_192"], ["1JW", "North Lanarkshire's Youth Employment Initiative (NLYEI)", "North Lanarkshire Council", "Supporting young unemployed people aged 16-29 into education, training and employment", "ESF", 3590981.0, 5359673.0, "esf_scotland_246"]]}}, "outwardCode": "G67"}
