MID lead finally to highly integrated multimaterial and multifunctional 3D compact systems. With a 20% of growth per year since 2008, MID is the tomorrow\u2019s converging technology for electronics and plastics.\nTo achieve advanced high precision and high quality 3D micro systems, the EU industry is facing the following MIDs bottlenecks:\n-\tto be able to manufacture high precision 3D micro-parts integration plastics and electronics, including 3D plastic system carrier, 3D-conductive tracks and 3D electronics component assembly\n-\tto be able to reduce the manufacturing cost by 50% in order for EU industry to be competitive with low-wage countries,\n-\tto provide the industry with reliable, robust and in-line controlled manufacturing processes for plastics and electronics converging technologies.\n3D-HiPMAS will overcome these challenges by providing the EU industry with a pilot factory based on 4 key technological building blocks enabling the manufacturing of low costs and high precision 3D multi-materials parts:\nA.\t3D high precision plastics micro-parts\nB.\t3D high definition conductive tracks\nC.\t3D precision electronics components assembly\nD.\t3D reliable and robust online monitoring and quality inspection system\nE.\tThese 4 technologies will be integrated in order to launch the future EU pilot factory\nThe consortium is composed of all key actors from the value chain, from the material manufacturer to the end-user", 329726.0, 4287677.0, "3D-HIPMAS", "Smart miniaturized plastic devices", "Moulded Interconnect Devices (MIDs) combine all the features of moulded plastic parts with electrical circuitry and electronic components assembled directly on the plastic package.", "The concept of 3D MIDs has been around since the 1980s. However, although the technology promises major benefits compared to conventional printed circuit boards, a number of issues have proven obstacles to commercialisation. As the technology comes of age, advances could meet the challenges of complex and costly technology requirements.\n\nAnnual market growth has been steady at about 20\u00a0% for several years and European scientists are planning a strong presence with the EU-funded project 'Pilot factory for 3D high precision MID assemblies' (http://www.3d-hipmas.eu/ (3D-HIPMAS)). Technology will be showcased in a futuristic European pilot factory. Four demonstrators are planned, consisting of micro fuel cells, hearing aids, micro switches and automotive pressure sensors.\n\nFabrication relies on selective plating processes on plastics based on laser direct structuring (LDS). A laser beam 'draws' a circuit on the surface of a part moulded with a plastic containing a laser-sensitive additive. The surface of the activated plastic is then plated with metal layers similar as used in printed circuited board technology.\n\nScientists selected plastic raw materials and developed several new high performance thermoplastics containing new fine-grained LDS additives. They also developed a laser machine with a very fine focus and a new plating process for producing finest metal pitches up to 70 \u00b5m.\n\nTwo-shot moulding, the more established technique, exploits injection moulding of polymer resins in two steps and subsequent activation for conductive metal plating. The innovative experimental two-shot moulding process has been set up as well and the process is being optimised.\n\nResearchers are also developing the required 3D precision electronics components assembly together with reliable monitoring and quality control. 3D assembling and manipulation concepts have been developed for high precision and high throughput. The team is currently putting together the X-ray inspection system that will be used for online process and quality control.\n\nThe 3D-HIPMAS technology is expected to reduce raw materials usage, energy consumption and costs, as well as improve cycle time and production yield. A plan is already in place for transfer of building blocks to industrial production plants throughout Europe for increased competitiveness in production of smart plastic micro components.", "http://www.3d-hipmas.eu/", "http://www.photonic-science.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/155695.jpg", "fp7_104687_998519941"], ["5LA", "Demonstration of LIDAR Based Wake Vortex Detection System Incorporating an Atmospheric Hazard Map", "Photonic Science Limited", "Wake vortex and wind shear are major causes of accidents and injury to passenger and crew of all aircraft types. There has been little protection and the main way of mitigating accidents has been to have mandatory separation times that affect the operating performance of airports.  The objective of GREEN-WAKE is to develop and validate innovative technologies that will detect the Hazards and thus improve the operating efficiency of an airport and improve passenger safety.  GREEN-WAKE will represent a significant step beyond current state-of-the\u2013art as it intends to improve upon: (1) The understanding of wake vortex and wind sheer detection. (2) Current detection methods. Commercially available technologies do not provide a solution and this project seeks to develop a new sensor that is able to provide real-time detection. It will develop new and novel technologies particularly in scanning and detectors that will enable real improvements to be made. Further it will develop a new concept in the 3D visualisation of atmospheric hazards, which is an important first step to developing closed loop-systems.  GREEN-WAKE will improve the knowledge and functionality of previous projects.  GREEN-Wake meets and will contribute to four objectives of the AAT.2007 call. Many of the concepts and the innovations will have applications in other on-board sensors for monitoring atmospheric hazards, engine emissions, engine heath and air quality.  The 3D simulator will take another new step, creating tools that can model instrument performance.    The structure of GREEN-WAKE will enable the latest technologies to be individually evaluated and made available to industrial users. Given the high level of innovation that goes beyond just the sensor, this is an important aspect to the exploitation plan.  Dissemination will be through a web-site and briefings with key industrial and user groups.", 224013.0, 2611817.0, "GREEN-WAKE", null, null, null, "http://www.greenwake.org/news.html", "http://www.photonic-science.co.uk", null, "fp7_89388_998519941"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TN32"}
