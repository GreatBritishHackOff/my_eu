Manufactured on plastic substrates, these novel \u2018light touch materials\u2019 will be thin, flexible and formable, allowing seamless integration into products. They promise to greatly expand design freedom and unlock totally new modes of product-user interaction, enabling us to take the next step in product design: using touch sensitivity and luminosity to produce simple, affordable and intuitive user interfaces so that eventually \u2018the product becomes the user interface\u2019. Light.Touch.Matters focuses on products for care and well-being applications that can help consumers feel better, monitor or improve their health and increase comfort, such as rehabilitation aids, wearable alarms, and diet coaches, though we expect strong spin-off to other sectors. Light.Touch.Matters will use a proprietary design-driven research methodology based a comprehensive body of industrial product design knowledge that has been built up over the past decades. It consists of iterated cycles of materials-inspired and design-driven materials research with direct and prolonged design-researcher interaction, leading to a convergence of the conceptual designs and feasible materials in 4-6 interaction showcases. Analysis of results will include end user value, commercial value and environmental impact (LCA/critical materials). The design-driven research on integrated piezo plastics and OLEDs can directly contribute to innovation and competitiveness in a large number of related sectors, many of which are strategic to the EU: not only design, (health)care and consumer goods, but also the chemical, automotive and printing industries, as well as mechanical-, electrical-, packaging- and systems engineering.", 76376.0, 4320953.0, "LIGHT.TOUCH.MATTERS", "Smart products with a sense of touch", "EU funding is giving designers the opportunity to radically change the look and feel of products, unlocking wholly new modes of product-user interaction. Wearable sports devices, rehabilitation aids and even car interiors are just some of the markets that stand to benefit from the new \u2018light touch materials\u2019 developed in this project.", "In the EU-funded http://www.light-touch-matters-project.eu/ (LIGHT.TOUCH.MATTERS) (Design driven development of touch sensitive luminous flexible plastics for applications in care & well-being) project, materials scientists and product designers are jointly developing a new generation of smart materials that combine touch sensitivity with luminosity. These 'light touch materials' promise to revolutionise interface design so that the product can literally become the user interface.\n\nThe innovative core is formed by piezo-electric materials: smart materials that turn pressure (e.g. touch input) into voltage. The \u2018piezo plastics\u2019 developed in this project consist of piezo-active compounds in a polymeric matrix \u2013 a new composite that combines the best of both worlds. This translates to piezo-active, yet thin and flexible materials that can be easily integrated into everyday products.\n\nThese innovative piezo plastics allow for affordable and intuitive-to-use user interfaces. For response, the consortium is adding on top the latest developments in flexible organic light-emitting diode materials (OLEDs). Another top layer is responsible for the tactile feel and modulates the colours the materials give off.\n\nLIGHT.TOUCH.MATTERS deploys an iterative development process in which material development is performed in parallel to the iterative conceptualisation and design of products. This allows the product design work to \u2018drive\u2019 the materials R&D. The project\u2019s results will be threefold: the new \u2018light touch materials\u2019, technology demonstrator products that showcase the potential, and a method for design-driven materials innovation, generalisable to other technology contexts.", "http://www.light-touch-matters-project.eu/", "http://www.minima.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-08/157187.jpg", "fp7_106326_953443168"]]}}, "outwardCode": "IP13"}
