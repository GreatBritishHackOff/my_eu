The head teachers were keen to advocate for the value of arts education in delivering a broad and balanced curriculum for all children in Leeds, but they felt the need to learn how other European cities embrace the value of cultural education and how arts and culture subjects are taught in their schools. Leeds City Council was tasked with coordinating an ERASMUS+ bid for a consortium of schools to explore best practice in cultural education with other European cities which have  a proven track record in this field.  In this way we are building new \"Partnerships in Arts and Cultural Education\", or PACE.\r\n\r\nThe PACE project has been designed in response to this demand, in order to allow a consortium of schools to undertake job shadowing with schools in other European cities which are successful in delivering arts and cultural learning through:\r\n- the formal curriculum\r\n- extra-curricular activity\r\n- effective partnerships between school and art and cultural providers to deliver the above\r\n\r\nThe job-shadowing visits will involve the headteacher or deputy head from all 8 participating schools, plus a middle leader from each school, totalling 16 teaching staff.  In addition the job-shadowing will involve 4 local authority staff who work directly with consortium schools to develop their work around cultural education and who are working towards the creation of the Leeds Cultural Education Partnership.\r\n\r\nLeeds City Council has identified and selected a number of partner cities to work with, each of which has an excellent reputation in the field of cultural education.  Each of them has a slightly different focus or specialism and the learning and development needs of each consortium member is considered when allocating mobility participants to the different job shadowing mobilities.  The cities are Dortmund in Germany, Lille in France, Espoo in Finland and Malmo in Sweden, each offering consortium members an insight into:\r\n\r\n- the education system of the host country\r\n- the way in which cultural education is delivered in the city and the legacy of European Capital of Culture (for Lille and Dortmund)\r\n- the way in which schools deliver cultural education within the curriculum \r\n- the way in which cultural education is delivered through extra-curricular activity and the role of schools and local education authorities in promoting this\r\n- an insight into how schools and the local education authorities work in partnership with arts and cultural organisations\r\n\r\nIt is expected that participants will bring back new innovative teaching methods, improved foreign language skills, new ideas for partnership working with cultural organisations, higher levels of motivation, a renewed passion for the European dimension, ideas of how to use arts and culture when working with migrant children and students with EAL, an ability to challenge stereotypes and promote tolerance and inter-cultural understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe learning from the visits will be disseminated widely.  It will be shared with teachers, leaders, governors and parents and built into each participating school's strategic plan / school improvement plan.  As the schools are involved in an influential headteachers' forum,  the learning will be disseminated at city level, thereby shaping the Leeds Cultural Education Plan, our culture strategy and the Leeds2023 bid for European Capital of Culture.\r\n\r\nWithin the consortium the learning will impact 5603 learners and 535 teaching staff in the short term, with the potential to reach all city schools in the longer term through the creation of the Leeds Cultural Education Partnership.", "http://www.leeds.gov.uk", "Leeds City Council", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036003_coordinator"], ["1JF", "Consortium acad\u00e9mique lillois de mobilit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne en enseignement scolaire CALME_sco III", "Leeds City Council", 147769.0, "In the academy of Lille, at the start of their secondary school years, 77% of the pupils master the skills of the common set in Modern Foreign Languages (skill 1) \u2013 the French average being 82.1% - and 66.6% in Mathematics and Sciences (skill 3) \u2013 the French average being 72%. These lower percentages can indeed be said to stem from a certain form of social determinism, but a deeper comparison of academies with the same social framework show that this is not the only reason. Besides, such low academic success comes with sharp contrasts in the mastery of language between pupils belonging to higher and lower social classes. This situation questions the school system\u2019s ability to make underachievers progress, and to improve the overall quality of its teaching as well as its overall success.\r\n\r\nThe Framework Act on the Republic\u2019s Educational Framework Planning and Renewal passed on July 8 2013 aims at actively combating early school leaving and academic failure. The teachers play a fundamental role in these reforms, whose main lines they will have to get to grips with. Lille\u2019s academic consortium for European mobility in a school environment (in French: CALME_sco III) aims at providing better training to teachers, developing formative observation practices and feedback between teachers, and reinforcing educational support in schools. Such professionalization of the position of teacher is bound to contribute to fighting against early school leaving and to helping underachievers and underachieving schools.\r\n\r\nCALME_sco III therefore programs formative European mobility for 100 members of staff in the academy of Lille: 83% of them are in junior schools, 49% in priority education (primary or secondary school), 9% in vocational training. The staff is distributed between 7 junior schools in 5 different pools, 5 primary schools associated with 2 of the aforementioned junior schools, 1 vocational high school and the LEA\u2019s inspecting body for vocational training. Their mobility will essentially be a period of immersive observation, sometimes preceded by a time for taking part in a structured lesson \u2013 including a linguistic training period covering defined targets \u2013 and in three junior schools it will lead to longer stays including periods of teaching.\r\n\r\nCALME_sco III mainly relies on the training of the educational support staff as well as work in networks. 5 members of the management staff be a driving force for CALME_sco III: their own training mobility (done with CALME_sco III or with another academic programme) will instigate the formative and collaborative mobility of the teaching staff in their junior or vocational high schools, if not in the priority education network of their schools, towards partner schools in Europe. 5 out of the 7 junior schools that are partners in CALME_sco III are in a priority education network and bring 5 of the schools and one LEA inspecting body in their network in their wake. CALME_sco regroups the projects of these 5 schools, these 7 junior schools, this vocation high school and 3 trainee IEN-EG/ET inspectors by providing them with what they need in terms of common academic direction and management, and by giving them the opportunity to communicate throughout the length of the CALME_sco III programme.\r\n\r\nCALME_sco III counts on European, formative mobility for all types of staff and for every level of the education system, helping 100 members of staff in continuing or statutory education (3 members of the management staff and 3 inspectors) to combat academic failure and to help underachieving pupils as well as underachieving schools. This mobility must contribute to stopping the vicious circle of underachievement and inequalities in order to enter a virtuous circle of European openness, of social diversity and academic success. CALME_sco III is looking forward to 2019, foreshadowing school partnerships which will mark the entry of the primary, junior and high school partners of CALME_sco III into this virtuous circle thanks to ERASMUS+.", "http://www.leeds.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA101-036837_1"], ["4AD", "International Learning", "Yorkshire MESMAC", 52259.0, "Yorkshire MESMAC is one of the oldest sexual health organisations in the country.
