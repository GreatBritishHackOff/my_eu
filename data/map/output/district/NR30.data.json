Through a detailed program of activities and initiatives, including workshops and interaction with local communities, it encourages a common space of dialogue that looks toward integration of practices rather than homologation. The researches of common aspects together with the valorisation of cultural differences are significant aspects of this project.  JR Circus moves on two parallel directions. On one side, it promotes the circus language as a means of development and active citizenship by enhancing the transnational mobility  of creative professionals and young artists through an extended stay where is fostered the artistic co-creation of a circus opera, based on one of the greatest masterpiece of all time, Romeo and Juliet, to be toured between different countries. JR stands for Juliet and Romeo and suggests meanwhile the word Junior, as the main actors involved are young artists between 16 and 22 years old coming from different EU countries. On the other side, it promotes the EU integration and intercultural dialogue through the issues it point out and the universal language of acrobatics that is used. At the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare\u2019s birth, Romeo and Juliet is still a universal story. Romeo and Juliet are two acrobats that struggle between love and hate. As hanging from a trapeze, they tend their hands toward each other to avoid the barriers imposed by the world. The story itself will become a training opportunity on the fundamental values of human rights, equality and justice for the European youth population. Romeo and Juliet make up the essence of the rationally meaningless cultural conflict.", "http://www.seachangearts.org.uk", null, "creative_552163-CREA-1-2014-1-IT-CULT-COOP1_2"], ["2LZ", "CONTACT ZONES", "THE SEACHANGE TRUST", 145797.0, "Contact Zones is a multidisciplinary project: its aim is creating contact and interaction between performing arts, urban spaces / non-conventional venue and people. Contact Zones wants to contribute to the sustainable development of cities, generating \u201cgood pratice\u201d of cooperation of art, urban spaces and people. The project will take place in spaces redefined by urban transformation \u2013 as pedestrian zones, squares, market, cultural centres, un-conventional venues \u2013 where it is possible to reach an enlarged new audience.Contact Zone is defined as the space in which transculturation takes place \u2013 where differents cultures meet and inform each other, often in highly asymmetrical ways. A Contact Zone allows people to interact between cultures and break the cultural boundary.  When a contact zone is established, people are able to gain a new perspective because they are able to interact with people of different cultures.  Contact Zone allows to improve the artistical proposal and to make it usable and available. Urban spaces, never used or through by performances and artists, will be completely renovated by the \u201cuse\u201d of the artistic events. Urban spaces  will be changed, transformed by artistical experience: historical centres, suburbs, parks, markets, boundary places or impoverished spaces can have another chance thanks to art.Contact Zones is a dialog, developped through different forms, aesthetics and experimentations, in order to build new visions and suggest unpredictable answers.", "http://www.seachangearts.org.uk", null, "creative_559224-CREA-1-2015-1-IT-CULT-COOP1_2"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["2QF", "Great Yarmouth Community Economic Development (CED) Project (Access)", "Great Yarmouth Borough Council", "The project will support new and innovative neighbourhood-based employability services to meet gaps identified by local residents with governance provided by a Community Economic Development Group and Panel.
