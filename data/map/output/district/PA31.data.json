Among the project\u2019s innovative elements are a very durable and flexible polymer plastic net pen, a predator guard, a control system, easy set-up and replacement of damaged cage parts. The technological solutions involved in the sea-based cage will preserve advantages of land-based fish farming while at the same time taking advantage of the cost efficiency of seabased fish farming. Furthermore, the new cage system will be both substantially more cost-efficient and also more environmentally friendly existing fish farming technologies. Consequently, ClosedFishCage will result in the development of new, more appropriate technology enabling increased use of sea-based fish farming and thus also greatly improve possibilities of fish farming technology.  The market for fish, and especially European farmed fish, continues to grow. However, EU catches have dropped in recent years, aquaculture production has remained stable, and the current supply of fish is therefore not enough to cover market demand. Furthermore, as a result of a combination of near depletion of certain EU fishery stocks, reduced annual catch quotas, and reduced fishing fleets, Member States of the Union are becoming increasingly dependent on imports from third countries. ClosedFishCage will not only improve the competitiveness of SMEs in the aquaculture sector but also safeguard the potential production of good quality fish, in sufficient quantities, at competitive prices.", 10220.0, 1234182.0, "CLOSEDFISHCAGE", null, null, null, "http://www.closedfishcage.com/", "http://www.seawork-scotland.com", null, "fp7_107808_997737830"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8SR", "HLW Rankweil lives Europe", "Crinan Hotel", 195333.0, "The development and objectives are divided into six priorities.\r\n1. Quality assurance\r\n2. Expansion of the existing network with partner companies in EU countries\r\n3. Social commitment\r\n4. Strengthening the idea of the European Union\r\n5. Public relations - dissemination of Erasmus + projects\r\n6. Getting to know and appreciate new places and cultures\r\n \r\n1. Quality Assurance:\r\nSchool education must be comparable with other vocational education and training systems. Educational objectives and learning outcomes must be clearly described. The allocation of ECVET points for the learning results must be carried out by a superior expert team uniformly for all schools; teachers of the HLW Rankweil are ready to be part of working teams.\r\n\r\nThe qualifications which our pupils have acquired during their internship abroad will be made visible by the partner companies and the HLW. Practice-oriented teaching while incorporating the knowledge and working techniques acquired abroad is implemented.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of language certificates (DELF, BEC, DELE and CILS) and specialised certificates (boys' chefs and cheese chefs) increases the quality of the training and must be promoted and financially supported.\r\n\r\nMotivation of the pupils to participate in language competitions.\r\n\r\nTeachers must constantly update their knowledge and skills and are encouraged to pursue professional development at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nTeachers are motivated to complete internships during their summer holidays both in local and foreign companies.\r\n \r\n2. Expansion of partnerships with foreign companies\r\nIn recent years, the Board of Trustees has been able to establish a network of 40 partner companies abroad. Currently there are only partnerships with tourism companies. The network is to be expanded with other industries.\r\n \r\n3. Social commitment\r\nWhen engaging in social services, pupils should show responsibility for the well-being of people in Europe. We want to deepen our commitment and further develop the project \u201cStreet Children\u201d in Romania and Bulgaria.\r\n \r\n4. Strengthening the idea of the European Union\r\nThe philosophy of the EU and its importance and impact should be increasingly explored in teaching. Students of the third or fourth year are to visit the EU Parliament in Strasbourg as part of an excursion. Increased travelling exhibitions in the school. EU experts as speakers to the school.\r\n\r\n5. Public relations and dissemination of the project should be substantially improved. A focus group is to be appointed for this. New media will be increasingly involved.\r\n \r\n6. In the case of excursions, language, culture, and sports weeks, the students should get to know new places and cultural and sports facilities in the EU.\r\n \r\nThe number of participants in his project has remained stable for the last 8 years at our school. More than 92% of the students have completed the compulsory three-month internship at a hotel abroad.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase the quality of the foreign exchange program, cooperation with the companies has to be intensified. The hosting partners need be more involved in our preparations. In the future we want to stress the \"reflection on the results of our work\". This reflection needs to be done on various levels: self-reflection by the pupils, assessment or reflection by the company, recognition of the internships by different bodies of the school.", "http://www.crinanhotel.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA116-034870_13"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["8RT", "Business Gateway Local Growth Accelerator Programme - Argyll and Bute", "Argyll & Bute Council", "To provide support SMEs who demonstrate growth ambition, and deepen support available to those already growing.", "ERDF", 272100.0, 544200.0, "erdf_scotland_55"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PA31"}
