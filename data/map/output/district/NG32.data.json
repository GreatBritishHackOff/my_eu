Histology is a complex process requiring several steps for the tissue sample preparation. The most demanding and time-consuming step is the microtomy, where the tissue sample, now dehydrated and placed inside a piece of paraffin wax, is cut into slices 4-micrometre thick. This step is further complicated by the fact that the thin slices become wrinkled with the cutting and are normally put on warm water in order to smooth out (the with the aggravated problems of rehydrating the cells and increasing the risk of cross-contamination). Microtomy is a labour-intensive procedure carried out by highly-skilled clinical/scientific staff. A skilled operator can perform up to 80 samples a day, but will cost well over \u20ac100,000 p.a. The MicroLean project proposes a low-cost automation of the microtomy process by a contactless manipulation of the samples. The MicroLean system will be retrofittable to existing microtomes.", 3643.0, 1145058.0, "MICROLEAN", null, null, null, null, "http://www.thetrc.org.uk", null, "fp7_111597_952896573"], ["3LT", "An innovative, disruptive, advanced technology for ultrasonic flow enhancement of injection moulding that significantly reduces cooling times  improves productivity", "The Technology Research Centre Limited", "Injection moulding is a large portion of the EU thermoplastics processing industry. In 2008, its value was \u20ac55 bn, but fell to \u20ac43 bn in 2009. The industry continues to contract, struggling against low cost economies. While energy cost savings are welcome, cycle time dominates cost so reducing it is key & will increase productivity. Cycle time is dominated by cooling time, which depends on many factors including melt temp. Polymers are often heated well above the ideal melt temp. to aid injection by lowering viscosity. Similarly, very high injection speeds/pressures are used. But we show later that these methods have drawbacks. Our idea is to apply ultrasonic energy into the molten polymer just before it enters the cavity. This can achieve as much as 60% reduction in melt viscosity, enabling a significant reduction in melt temp. while still being able to fill the mould. Lower embodied heat reduces heating/cooling time & energy. \n\nKey benefits are that melt temps. can be maintained and the lower viscosity used to enable easier filling of existing parts with lower internal stresses; melt temp. can be reduced significantly, reducing thermal degradation, energy consumption & cooling time. Or melt temp is maintained and much longer flow paths or thinner wall sections can be filled, offering a step change in design for thinner parts with even shorter cooling time. The ultimate goal of the Phase 2 project is to achieve market readiness of the \u2018Ultramelt\u2019 process, with follow-on Phase 3 achieving commercialisation in the EU marketplace.

Over 40m tonnes of multilayered plastics are produced globally, per annum, of which the EU contributes 9.6m tonnes, with an expected growth of ~7%. \n\nHowever, due to the extreme difficulties in achieving effective seperation of the material into its constituent polymer components, multi-layered plastic waste is currently collected as a single waste stream & disposed of through landfill (at costs of \u20ac130 per tonne), or incinerated (~\u20ac80 per tonne). Thus, the future of multilayer packages is now a great environmental concern, with an urgent need to develop effective separation technology.\n\nOur objective is to develop an ultrasonic assisted chemo-mechanical recycling method to separate multilayered plastic packaging waste (semi-rigid trays, cups, tubs & their film-based lids), currently deemed unrecyclable, and recover polyethylene (PE) & polyethylene terepthalate (PET) individually in order to sell these end products in the EU recycling market & thereby create a new business opportunity of ~\u20ac4.8bn. Successful development of this technology will create the business opportunity to recycle this material, generating new revenues while reducing waste, landfill, energy & saving ~14.4m tonnes of CO2 emissions per annum. Our novel process will not only ensure the sustainable supply of these plastics as raw materials via environmentally friendly recycling but will also provide participating SMEs with the opportunity to derive an ongoing income. \n\nIt is envisaged that the potential benefits of the LAMPACK technology would be:\n\u2022\tAnnual value for recovered PET per plant of \u20ac3.5m\n\u2022\tAnnual value for recovered PE per plant of \u20ac5.2m\n\u2022\tEnergy savings of  \u20ac1.6m p.a per plant\n\u2022\tCO2 reduction of ~ 22,500tpa per plant", 43032.0, 61475.0, "Lampack", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_205377_920940602"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NG32"}
