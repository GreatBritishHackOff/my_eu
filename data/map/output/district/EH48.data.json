This course will be fully completed and complemented by the immersion course in France.  As a follow-up the teachers will confidently implement and teach French in accordance with the four capacities contained within the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence guidelines.\r\n\r\nAlso, they will ultimately share their learning with others whom they will train as future facilitators of French  to pupils throughout the school.  The techniques learned and used will be applied to other modern languages, such as Spanish since our pupils will be learning both languages.  This will include both teaching the language, culture and geography and historical aspects of France and Spain.  \r\n\r\nA variety of methodologies and strategies will be used and in particular the use of ICT to enhance the learning and teaching of French.    We will continue to use the resources on the platform provided by LFEE which will ensure our use of ICT with the pupils.  We will use the methodology of active learning to involve and immerse our pupils in the language of French.   This will involve us making use of games, drama and songs, especially in the early stages of primary school where we will concentrate on the talking and listening of the modern language.  \r\n\r\nAs our pupils become more confident we will ensure that they are using the four language skills of talking, listening, reading and writing.  We will also follow the guidelines issued by Education Scotland that outlines exactly what material the pupils should be learning at each primary stage of school.  We will use West Lothian Progression Pathways to aid planning , teaching, learning and assessment.   Together, all of this will ensure that French is embedded into the life of our school.  Included in this are the parents who will be informed and given the opportunity to discover, shape and direct  their child's learning in this area.  At the same time, we intend to share our knowledge and good practice with other cluster schools in our network, other schools in Scotland via Education Scotland website and European colleagues via links established on immersion course and platform.", "https://blogs.glowscotland.org.uk/wl/simpsonps/", "Simpson Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035708_coordinator"], ["4DT", "Food for Good", "Bathgate FABB Club", 24736.0, "The project proposes an exchange between the three associations for young people with and without disabilities from Italy, Scotland and Germany.\r\nThe experience period will take place from July 28 to August 6 2017 in Turin, the city where \"Si pu\u00f2 fare\" Association (the project leader) has its headquarters.\r\nParticipants will be in total 49 young people, some of them is with intellectual disabilities. The group-leaders are made up of 11 experts in the education of young people.\r\nThe issue addressed, which will guide all the activities proposed, is the psycho-physical well-being and includes several topics: good nutrition, sports, activities for inner well-being, respect and self-knowledge.\r\nThe choice to focus on well-being comes from the observation of groups of young people from the all three organizations, often not accustomed to reflect on themselves and the quality of the activities of their lives, on the general condition of their body and their mind.\r\nThe associations are working together since 2012 and from that year together are monitoring the people needs who dedicate their services. The exchange of 2016 was the time to discuss the observations made on the groups and there was a strong need for well-being, to take care of themselves in every aspect that composes the person.\r\nThe activities will be critical to improving feeling good about themselves: after a few ice-breaker games to create a good atmosphere among the participants, will alternate sports activities (where the Italian participants will be the main organizers, telling through sports that practice and accompanying the whole group to try it), cultural activities (museums for the city of Turin and discover its history), activities related to wellness (yoga in the morning or evening), the activities proposed to learn more about themselves and their limits (experiences to challenge the participant's fears), activities to continue to work on the knowledge of Italian culture, German and Scottish, activities related to health and nutrition.\r\nThe structure for the ten days is the Hostel OPEN 011 of the City of Turin, with 4 people rooms and halls where the groups could stay together for the activities.\r\nFor cooking and healthy eating activities we will use the Si pu\u00f2 fare Association's spaces in 30 Fagnano street, multipurpose facility where participants could contribute to the preparation of the dinners.\r\nThe evaluation activities will be interim and final, designed to involve everyone and to reflect the best of what the exchange is doing arise in people.\r\nThe results expected at the end of the experience are the improvement of self-awareness, an increase in self-esteem and self-care.

Since 2002 it's the project's aim to integrate young people with and without a disability into the group. They will grow more mature, as well as learning from each other and developing a feeling of togetherness. They will develop skills for their future lives, their environment and deal with people with disabilities, with their strengths and weaknesses.
