This project brings together international experts in innovative clinical trial design methodology in these specific areas along with key stakeholders including regulatory authorities, industry, clinicians and patient groups to address this need.  Our aim is the development novel methodology for the design and analysis of clinical trials in small populations.  We will focus on four specific areas where we believe there are particular challenges: (i) early phase dose-finding studies in small populations, (ii) decision-theoretic methods for clinical trials in small populations, (iii) confirmatory trials in small populations and personalised medicines, (iv) use of evidence synthesis in the planning and interpretation of clinical trials in small populations and rare diseases.\n\nWe will build on recent research advances, of our own and of others in this area.  In the rare disease setting, we will focus on Bayesian and decision-theoretic methods that formally enable comparison of the gain in information with the cost, both in economic and opportunity terms, of clinical experimentation, and assess how information from outside the trial can formally be incorporated in the design and decision-making processes.  In the personalised medicine setting, we will develop methods that allow evaluation of efficacy in a number of sub-populations simultaneously in a confirmatory clinical trial without any reduction in scientific or statistical rigour.", 43032.0, 2304595.0, "InSPiRe", null, null, null, null, "http://www.CTCT-Ltd.co.uk", null, "fp7_110064_950433937"], ["1TH", "\"Development and demonstration of a dynamic, web-based, renewable energy rating platform\"", "Solartech Ltd", "'In order for the EC to achieve ambitious renewable energy targets there is a strong need to accelerate market penetration of Renewable Energy Systems (RES) in both industrial and domestic sectors. The domestic sector is of major significance, as it will reduce reliance on large centralized energy plants. There are several domestic options including solar thermal, solar electric, heat pump and biomass systems. Of these, solar and heat pump technologies have the widest potential application as they require no physical feedstock. However, despite steady market growth, these technologies still make up only a small fraction of total household energy supply. One of the main reasons for this is the initial investment required, coupled with uncertainty over return on investment. This is compounded by the huge range of available products and a lack of objective information relating to system performance.  As a result, consumers are often confused and unable to make informed decisions. In addition, installation companies often experience difficulties when advising customers on the various options and their respective benefits. Hence, despite considerable technological advancements in terms of system performance and efficiency, there exists a significant knowledge and confidence barrier that restricts increased market acceptance.  In order to address this problem, we propose to develop a system that can automatically provide accurate and objective information about the suitability of a renewable energy technology for a given user scenario. The system will be intuitive and easy to use employing a unique dynamic grading technology. This will enable consumers to make better informed decisions and will allow our membership to provide better service. This will help to significantly increase market penetration and revenues for our pan-European membership involved in the design, manufacture and installation of domestic renewable energy technologies.'", 154775.0, 2572890.0, "EAGLE", "Online platform for renewable energy rating", "EU-funded researchers are creating a website that provides a bird's eye view of building roofs and assesses their suitability for solar energy technology.", "The EU has set ambitious goals for increasing the share of renewable energies and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. In particular, solar energy represents one of the most promising technologies for residential applications. Despite considerable technological advancements in terms of system performance and efficiency, it represents a small fraction of the household energy supply.\n\nFunded by the EU, the aim of the project 'Development and demonstration of a dynamic, web-based, renewable energy rating platform' (http://www.eagle-fp7.eu/ (EAGLE)) was to increase the market acceptance of renewable energy systems (RESs). Project members focused on developing an online platform that evaluates the potential of a building to use solar energy as a first step.\n\nPartners envisioned an intuitive and easy-to-use system employing a unique dynamic grading technology. This should enable consumers to make better informed decisions and allow project members to provide better services, significantly increasing market penetration and revenues.\n\nThe renewable energy rating platform analyses the solar energy market and its financial incentives by processing all the available data. It employs high-resolution imagery such as aerial photography and identifies potential obstacles on roofs by mapping buildings in 3D.\n\nEAGLE should help project members increase their RES sales by providing them \u2014 as well as consumers \u2014 with objective information about building-specific RES performance. In turn, this should allow calculating the return on investment for any given scenario and potentially reduced installation costs.\n\nProject partners defined a methodology for prototype image processing and roof space modelling.
