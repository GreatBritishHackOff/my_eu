Wind energy is the cheapest and technologically most straightforward way to generate the majority of this energy. As a result for this the amount of wind energy installed in the EU is predicted to increase from its current level of 56,000 MW to 300,000 MW by 2030, equating to the installation of over 80,000 wind turbines. Due to the very large radar cross section of the turbines and the motion of the rotating blades, these turbines have a detrimental effect on civilian radar navigations systems and there is growing concern about the potential problems which wind turbines may have on passenger safety. Due to space limitations, wind turbines are increasingly being located in areas close to the main shipping lanes and aviation flight paths and wind farm planning applications are increasingly being rejected. As a result of the radar interference issues, wind energy companies are desperately looking for a solution. Although both electronic radar solutions and the use of Radar Absorbing Materials (RAMs) coated onto the turbines have been considered, no cost-effective solution has as yet been produced. Current RAMs are far too expensive and their performance is not sufficient for wind turbine applications. The proposed \u2018OSGRAM\u2019 project will develop an innovative continuous process for the production of intrinsically conductive polymers (ICPs) whose radar absorbing properties can be accurately tailored. The ICPs will be used to produce a multilayer RAM that can achieve radar attenuation of 20dB  in the S- and X-bands and which can be applied to wind turbine towers, nacelles and blades with a weight of <4kg/sq.m and a cost of 125(Euros)/sq.m.  This will allow our SME consortium to develop world-leading RAMs, giving us global market leadership and leading to sales in excess of 80 million Euros 5 years after the project ends and increase profits across the consortium.", 136885.0, 1059925.0, "OSGRAM", "Decreasing wind turbine interference with traffic control radars", "Wind turbines have come under scrutiny lately for their interference with civilian radar, thus impeding their installation. EU-funded scientists developed novel materials to minimise interference and pave the way to achieving ambitious EU goals in the field of renewable energy sources (RES).", "The EU has targeted a 20\u00a0% contribution of RES to overall energy supply by 2020 and 100\u00a0% by 2050. Wind turbine installations are increasingly contributing to energy supply in the EU. However, the large size of the turbine blades and their rotational motion has a detrimental effect on civilian radar, raising concerns about the safety of aircraft and marine navigation in the neighbourhoods of onshore and offshore wind farms.\n\nThe EU-funded project http://www.osgram.eu (OSGRAM) developed a novel radar-absorbing material (RAM) that is more cost effective and better performing than current RAMs. To achieve this, scientists exploited an intrinsically conductive polymer (ICP), polyaniline. The key to achieving related goals was in the development of a continuous polymerisation process (continuous oscillating baffled reactor (COBR) technology) never before achieved with polyaniline. Enhanced control of polymerisation enabled scientists to tailor its properties for radar absorption at frequencies used by air traffic control and marine navigation. Preliminary tests demonstrate promising microwave absorption and attenuation in the frequency bands of interest. The innovative RAMs can be utilised in the tower, nacelle (housing the gearbox, generator, drive train, etc.) and the blades themselves.\n\nOSGRAM technology is poised to help wind farm stakeholders gain approval for their installation applications, increasingly near main shipping lanes and flight paths due to space limitations. Enhancing the contribution of wind energy to the EU's renewable alternatives will be an important step towards utilising purely eco-friendly energy sources for our needs.", "http://www.osgram.eu", "http://www.hitek-ltd-co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58322.jpg", "fp7_92308_995655628"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DN17"}
