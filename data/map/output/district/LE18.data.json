The aim is to capitalise on new competitive strategies based on demand product differentiation and personalisation to deliver high quality to individual consumers. Specific addressed RTD topics will include: -innovative 3D integrated digitalization and design tools and solutions dedicated to personalised biomechanical and biomedical as well as style and aesthetics aspects; -adaptive production processes and technologies guaranteeing functionality, quality, performance and health; -micro and nano devices providing the product with innovative sensing and actuating functionalities, such as comfort, ease of use, control and modification of product properties (thermal, pressure distribution); -innovative high-performing materials with self-adaptive capabilities to optimally fit consumers physique and ergonomics, whilst guaranteeing comfort and aesthetic quality; -materials and production processes to achieve full ecosustainability of the product; -development of specific methodology for functional assessment of products considering environment of use and individual consumers; -dynamic human behaviour modelling, in particular lower limb (feet).", 293231.0, 4202480.0, "SSHOES", "The shoe fits for diabetes sufferers", "High-tech footwear modelling could potentially bring comfort to millions of diabetes sufferers who have problems in their lower limbs.", "Diabetes is a potentially debilitating disease that is set to affect 334 million people by 2030, according to the World Health Organization. One of its most common complications is the diabetic foot, which may involve amputation of a part of the foot. In a move to help sufferers, the EU-funded project 'Special shoes movement' (Sshoes) supported the development and production of footwear and insoles for patients with diabetic foot.\n\nThe project defined new industrial systems for the footwear industry based on three-dimensional (3D) scanning, progressive design and customisation tools. It incorporated flexible production technologies that advanced functionality, comfort, health and performance, in addition to modelling anatomy, particularly the biomechanics of the lower limb. Moreover, the products were designed to be eco-friendly and to promote sustainable production.\n\nIn more technical terms, the design process incorporated advanced software algorithms based on artificial neural networks to process huge amounts of collected data and produce customised footwear. This high-tech approach employs advanced computer-aided design (CAD) tools and accelerometer readings to measure gait activity levels, foot deformation and other parameters in order to create the ultimate shoe. Style and fashion have also been considered, as well as the most appropriate materials for insoles and outsoles.\n\nThe new prototype shoe would even be able to measure pressure points, temperature and humidity inside the shoe itself, in addition to evaluating foot motion. Principally, the process has involved sophisticated 3D scanning equipment for the foot using several cameras, advanced software and two industrial robots.\n\nThe technology not only promises to bring relief to millions of diabetics, but also to advance the footwear sector in general, such as in applications related to occupational or more comfortable fashion shoes.

Sending organization selects students, inform students and parents, makes reservations, assessment forms and evaluation.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the internship, the students spread their newly acquired knowledge and experiences to other students and teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt our school, we want to offer our students an added value in their education. An added value is for example to be able to do some of their practical training in a place other than the home market. Students leave school better prepared for their career and know that there is a larger labor market than in the immediate area. Each student must understand that there are great opportunities for jobs on a flexible labor market if he himself is willing to move. The pupils are also trained to take more  personal responsibility for their career. A boost may be curiosity and excitement in making vocational training abroad. Even those students who don\u00b4t do training abroad are becoming aware of the possibilities by spill-over from those who had been abroad.\r\n\r\nThat our school can interact and share their experiences between vocational programs, strengthen our vocational training courses.\r\n\r\nStudents in vocational programs are extremely positive to take new professional experiences abroad.\r\n\r\nWe can through previous exchanges see big gains for students; professional pride is strengthened, self-confidence improves, English language skills are strengthened and the student will gain knowledge of other cultures, thus increasing understanding of each other's similarities and differences.", "http://www.slcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-SE01-KA102-000048_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LE18"}
