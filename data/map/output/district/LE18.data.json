The aim is to capitalise on new competitive strategies based on demand product differentiation and personalisation to deliver high quality to individual consumers. Specific addressed RTD topics will include: -innovative 3D integrated digitalization and design tools and solutions dedicated to personalised biomechanical and biomedical as well as style and aesthetics aspects; -adaptive production processes and technologies guaranteeing functionality, quality, performance and health; -micro and nano devices providing the product with innovative sensing and actuating functionalities, such as comfort, ease of use, control and modification of product properties (thermal, pressure distribution); -innovative high-performing materials with self-adaptive capabilities to optimally fit consumers physique and ergonomics, whilst guaranteeing comfort and aesthetic quality; -materials and production processes to achieve full ecosustainability of the product; -development of specific methodology for functional assessment of products considering environment of use and individual consumers; -dynamic human behaviour modelling, in particular lower limb (feet).", 293231.0, 4202480.0, "SSHOES", "The shoe fits for diabetes sufferers", "High-tech footwear modelling could potentially bring comfort to millions of diabetes sufferers who have problems in their lower limbs.", "Diabetes is a potentially debilitating disease that is set to affect 334 million people by 2030, according to the World Health Organization. One of its most common complications is the diabetic foot, which may involve amputation of a part of the foot. In a move to help sufferers, the EU-funded project 'Special shoes movement' (Sshoes) supported the development and production of footwear and insoles for patients with diabetic foot.\n\nThe project defined new industrial systems for the footwear industry based on three-dimensional (3D) scanning, progressive design and customisation tools. It incorporated flexible production technologies that advanced functionality, comfort, health and performance, in addition to modelling anatomy, particularly the biomechanics of the lower limb. Moreover, the products were designed to be eco-friendly and to promote sustainable production.\n\nIn more technical terms, the design process incorporated advanced software algorithms based on artificial neural networks to process huge amounts of collected data and produce customised footwear. This high-tech approach employs advanced computer-aided design (CAD) tools and accelerometer readings to measure gait activity levels, foot deformation and other parameters in order to create the ultimate shoe. Style and fashion have also been considered, as well as the most appropriate materials for insoles and outsoles.\n\nThe new prototype shoe would even be able to measure pressure points, temperature and humidity inside the shoe itself, in addition to evaluating foot motion. Principally, the process has involved sophisticated 3D scanning equipment for the foot using several cameras, advanced software and two industrial robots.\n\nThe technology not only promises to bring relief to millions of diabetics, but also to advance the footwear sector in general, such as in applications related to occupational or more comfortable fashion shoes. The humble shoe may finally be reinvented.", "http://www.sshoes.eu", "http://www.soletecsystems.com", "/docs/results/images/2013-01/53159.jpg", "fp7_92106_996820210"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LE18"}
