It will achieve this through taking waste streams that are at present lost to the environment (as pollution) and converting them into secondary raw materials for the production of high value organisms such as seaweed and shellfish. To do this IDREEM will develop, demonstrate and benchmark (against existing production techniques) innovative production technology for the European aquaculture industry.\nAquaculture is now a major component of global food security and is the fast growing food production sector globally. However the European industry is stagnating. The industry is facing real questions of economic and environmental sustainability. IDREEM will address these questions by working with a range of SME aquaculture producers across Europe to develop deploy and quantitatively assess the new production technology. Using an integrated approach defining the environmental, economic and social impact of the new production technology, life cycle assessment and life cycle costing will be used to quantify and demonstrate the economic and environmental benefits. Along with this process a combined environmental and economic modelling platform will be used to provide an evidence based decision making framework for aquaculture producers, regulators and policy makers.\nThroughout the project a dedicated impact coordinator will ensure that the project is fully engaged with the wide range of stakeholders, inviting their participation from the beginning and throughout the project (specifically in the form of a project advisory committee) and ensuring that results are fed back into that community. This will ensure that there is a rapid up take of the new production technology across the European sector, creating opportunity and support for a range of new SME producers, processors and up the value chain", 200969.0, 4585922.0, "IDREEM", "Revitalising European aquaculture", "An EU-funded initiative is taking the first steps in deploying a new, eco-friendly aquaculture technology across Europe.", "Aquaculture is a key global food production sector, but the industry faces both economic and environmental sustainability challenges.

Working with small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) aquaculture producers, IDREEM is identifying the risks and benefits of IMTA and developing decision-support tools for industry and policymakers.\n\nResearchers began by collecting environmental, social and economic data concerning the existing practice of fish monoculture. The economic studies showed that SMEs are currently under pressure from local and regional competitors, and that IMTA would boost their businesses through market differentiation.\n\nFurther environmental modelling was also done, and new protocols for monitoring the environmental performance of the new IMTA system were developed. Researchers also discovered that legislative and regulatory processes are often lacking, and that policy reform in areas such as food safety and environmental management is needed.\n\nIDREEM is now implementing some form of IMTA within every SME producer taking part in the project, and monitoring continues. The type of IMTA depends on location and other factors, but seaweed, mussel, sea urchin and oyster production in the Atlantic and Mediterranean are included.\n\nThe eventual deployment of IMTA across the European aquaculture sector is expected to reduce reliance on primary resources through waste recycling.

Furthermore, it should be noted that some fish species considered to be good candidates for aquaculture are so susceptible to handling that the only feasible method of obtaining embryos will be through natural spawning; two such species are included in the study.  While the correct environmental cues will induce natural spawning in captive fish, the physical features of the holding tanks may be manipulated to reduce the negative behavioural traits which may impede courtship. To achieve this end for flatfish, each female will be provided with a \u201cbreeding nest\u201d, a gravel-filled structure, while demersal round-fish species will be held in shallow raceways so broodfish populations can perform schooling behaviour along a high-speed current axis. Both features are expected to facilitate undisturbed courtship. Infra-red cameras will document fish behaviour in the system.

Bacterial biofilms constantly and quickly develop on all surfaces in the tanks and endanger the production of high quality and quantity fry which is an absolute must for successful aquaculture operations in a growing, highly competitive market. Thus, there is an enormous need to find a sustainable technology for an efficient cleaning of the tank surfaces and the standpipe meshes. Meshes on the standpipe, which prevent the aquatic life from being sucked away from the water flow, need to be continuously replaced due to the formation of biofilms, resulting in high material and labour costs. CLEANHATCH aims to develop and implement a new technology that constantly sweeps the sides and base of the tanks as well as backwashes the meshes whilst injecting ozonated water into the tank directly over the tank surfaces. Compared to the state of the art, the new technology has the advantages of (a) cleaning the tank&apos;s sides, base and standpipe&apos;s meshes saving considerable man-hours, (b) disinfecting the surfaces and meshes through the focused injection of the ozonated water, (c) reduce the amount of mesh required and focus the mesh to the bottom part of the tank where the water is best extracted from. CLEANHATCH will develop, implement, test and optimise the new technology under pilot and real production conditions, aiming to achieve a marketable product within one year after project termination. The project is centred on complementary technological problems and innovation needs of the three participating SMEs.

These systems, however, do not come without their hazards as small fish and fish larvae become more susceptible to disease when cultivated using recirculation technology.\n\nTo overcome this phenomenon it is necessary to improve cleaning and disinfection of hatchery RASs, a process that consumes much time and money. The EU-funded project CLEANHATCH developed a novel solution to remedy such limitations. It conceived the idea of hatchery tanks that clean themselves rather than having to be cleaned manually, thus saving on manpower and costs.\n\nThe project team examined how the internal surfaces of the tanks and the standpipe meshes could be cleaned to remove biofilms and residues effectively. It worked on a system to disinfect surfaces and meshes by injecting ozonated water where needed and by reducing the amount of mesh surface area involved.\n\nAfter testing and development, the team was able to minimise cleaning-related labour costs by an impressive 80 %, resulting in a 32 % increase in the weight of trout larvae. It successfully reduced bacterial counts on tank surfaces to a significant degree and created a safe, easy-to-operate system. The concept is supported also by the adoption of small stainless steel mesh that does not require cleaning and regular replacement, as oppose to nylon meshes with a much larger stand pipe surface area.\n\nSo far, the prototype has been successfully tested on sea bream, sea bass, rainbow trout and turbot. More development and testing in the future could help fine-tune the system even further and identify more species that could benefit from CLEANHATCH. The team's results have been disseminated through http://www.cleanhatch.net (the CLEANHATCH website), but also through conferences, presentations and trade fairs, opening up ample opportunities for exploitation.\n\nAs existing RASs can for the most part be retrofitted with this new solution, the project team expects keen interest in marketing the system and ensuring rapid uptake of the technology. While a fully marketable product hasn't been realised yet, with some development it is more than likely that one or more project partners will achieve this ambitious objective.\n\nCLEANHATCH systems will contribute to a better quality of life, health, safety and the environment, while helping fish farmers upgrade their production systems and improving the sector's economic viability.

The estimated amount of feed used to support this production was 150,000 tons valued at about \u20ac 100 million. Notwithstanding the increase in production, producer\u2019s profit margins are squeezed by i) the increase in price of feed ingredients, and ii) the decline/instability of fish prices. Feed costs account for up to 60% of total production costs and inappropriate feeding management can therefore be detrimental to farmer&apos;s profits. Optimal feed management includes the use of well balanced feeds covering the species\u2019 nutritional and energy requirements and cost efficient feeding regimes. The large variation amongst generally poor industrial feed conversion ratios (FCR) obtained in European sea bass farming is a clear indication of inappropriate feeding. This project is a joint effort between European aquaculture stakeholders targeting the accurate determination of the basic nutritional requirements of sea bass throughout the production cycle and best practices in feeding regimes and technology in order to achieve a significant reduction in production FCR values. Specifically, the optimum dietary protein and energy levels which are crucial parameters for effective feed formulation will be determined for European sea bass and evaluated on the farm using the latest demand feeding technology. These requirements will be studied in relation to the main influencing biotic and abiotic factors which are fish size, diet composition, feeding level and frequency, water temperature and oxygen levels. The cost efficient use of diets with formulations targeting the specific seasonal and developmental needs of the fish will effectively improve production FCR and have a significant economic benefit for aquaculturists.
