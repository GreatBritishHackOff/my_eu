This is a market which is experiencing exponential growth globally, and one in which Europe could take the lead. As a catalyst for regional development, high level research in this area also has the potential to make a significant contribution to the \u201cGrand Challenges\u201d facing society, such as health and wellbeing and carbon reduction, as Game Technology and Thinking has applications which are potentially significant to the wider economy and society. The appointment of an ERA Chair in Digital Games Technology and an associated research team would also be a catalyst for building a sustainable games sector in Cornwall.  Research excellence in this field would allow us to participate in, and potentially lead Research and Innovation across the commercial, cultural and social sectors.  The ERA Chair will actively contribute to the definition and implementation of Smart Specialisation Strategies at a regional, national and European level.  This will facilitate the integration between research investment and Cohesion Funding, accelerating regional development. Building on this research excellence, Falmouth University will establish a European Institute for Digital Games Design and Technology.  In this the University will create a world-class and sustainable hub for Digital Games research.  Centred in a rural, economically-deprived region, the Institute will build on the University\u2019s engagement with the creative industries and other sectors where games concepts and technologies can create significant benefit.  In this way, we aim to create the conditions required for innovation and high growth business performance in the region and in other European regional economies.", 1940658.0, 2414571.0, "GRO", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_185732_996746490"], ["4RX", "Establishing the scientific bases and technical procedures and standards to recover the European flat oyster production through strategies to tackle the main constraint, bonamiosis", "Martin Laity", "The European flat oyster, has been part of the human diet for many centuries. High mortality episodes and overfishing decimated the populations of O.edulis in Europe through the first half of the XXth century. Then, two diseases (due to Marteilia refringens and Bonamia ostreae) spread in the early 1970s and 1980s, drastically reducing the production. Despite new management practices, and intensive repletion programmes, the production of O. edulis has remained low since that time. The recovery of European flat oyster production is seen as an important opportunity for the shellfish industry in Europe. Thus this project proposal aims to attain a clear competitive advantage for a number of SME AGs and their members for different reasons: 1st- Chance to diversify production (risk management) 2nd- High market value of the product. 3rd- Environmental positive effects of fostering aquaculture activities based on native species 4rd-Biotechnology provides tools and procedures to face the oyster industry problems that were not available until recently A total of five Shellfish Producer Associations from four different Member States and three SMEs in major oyster production countries in Europe, concerned about the above mentioned issues and being aware of recent scientific progress in selective breeding programmes for bonamiosis tolerance, decided to work together with the common general objective of facing the challenge of establishing the scientific and technical bases, procedures and standards that allow the recovery of the O. edulis production, through development of strategies to tackle the main constraint, bonamiosis . To successfully achieve this goal those European Research Centres and Universities which have mainly contributed to scientific progress on O. edulis recovery and selective breeding programmes for bonamiosis resistance, will be hired by the SM-AGs and SMEs involved in this OYSTERECOVER proposal to carry out the relevant research.", 64684.0, 2702118.0, "OYSTERECOVER", null, null, null, "http://www.oysterecover.eu", null, null, "fp7_99787_991007970"], ["4RH", "Video Communications for Networked Communities", "Falmouth University", "The inability to discover the conversations that matter, to understand how others are feeling, to recognise a friend in need, to share the joy of someone happy, or to see how certain things should be done, are common limitations of social networks. All these require people to be able to see and hear each other. Vconect targets this space by aiming to develop capabilities that will allow ad-hoc groups of people to enjoy real-time high-quality audio-video communication. Such capabilities will be able to deliver the best possible communication experience to all the participants involved, no matter their number, the types of devices or the characteristics of the bandwidth they are connecting through.The Vconect platform will be able to support complex and dynamic structures of group communication by intelligently mediating the conversation and framing it in narrative structures through methods akin to those used in cinematography. Active cameras, shot types, screen compositions will be decided dynamically, to ensure meaningful, engaging and immersive communication experiences. In turn, these decisions will be optimised in real-time for the network and devices that are being used. The platform thus becomes service-aware, displaying intelligent behaviour both in communication mediation as well as in adapting the way the audio and video is processed within the network to best support the communication needs.This new development builds upon two of the most significant achievements of the current Internet: video conferencing and social networks. It will make social networks as flexible and as engaging as chatting face to face to a group of friends: it will allow us to see what's really happening, to know who's hurting and who's laughing.
