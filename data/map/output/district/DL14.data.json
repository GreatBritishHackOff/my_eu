We recently introduced a separate class for students who do not yet speak much German but are expected to reach Grammar school level. Most of them are refugees, some are children of foreign university teachers who spend a short time in Tuebingen. \r\nEach year, several students have to leave the school due to failure to meet academic standards. Teaching classes can be very challenging as we often do not set students tasks at different levels of difficulty according to their ability.\r\nThis is why we launched our first Erasmus+-KA1 last year, involving job-shadowing at St. John's School in Bishop Auckland in North-East England. The aim was to learn more about inner differentiation. We were overwhelmed by the professional approach to  streaming in the classroom that was not only well-developed but also practised in every class we saw. Although we had already profited from the inspiration and the practical material we received, we agreed that we wanted to observe these features in more detail. At the same time, there was another thing that struck us: How do the teachers manage to get the students to start work immediately and to behave so well? This is something we want to find out and learn to do ourselves. This is why we have applied for another KA1 to build on the first one: We want to job-shadow again in England in two groups of five teachers, with a larger interval in between in order to properly evaluate and build on the first experience. Out goal is to learn from a European partner school and profit from their knowledge and experience.\r\nTo provide our efforts with a scientific basis, we have already started cooperation with the Tuebingen School of Education, a newly-founded university department.\r\nIn addition to the first KA1, we have now included  a second partner, Colegio Hijas de Cristo Rey, in Oleiros in North-West Spain. We met teachers from that school in England because they job-shadowed at the same time. The discussions we had with them on various points of education and school systems made us keen to go to Spain to seek inspiration from the methods and structures that apply there. We could thus gain a different view on our system and identify improvements to implement in our curriculum.\r\nFurthermore, this offers an opportunity to involve the department of Spanish in our school,  in addition to the department of English. We are planning to visit Colegio Hijas de Cristo Rey, with six colleagues, in a third phase of the process, re-evaluating what we have learned by then.\r\nAs teachers in Germany always teach two or three different subjects, many other departments will be involved, such as history , biology, German and RE. \r\nWe also make sure that teachers who do not teach either English or Spanish are able to participate.\r\nIn addition, we are  planning to take courses that support our focus. One of the purposes is to accomodate colleagues who prefer structured courses over job-shadowing or who are afraid of language difficulties.\r\nOur school is familiar with different methods of teaching, including cooperative forms, job-shadowing with a tandem partner and feedback. Therefore, we expect our staff to use their new knowledge and experience in their own work in the classroom and to share with colleagues as widely as possible.\r\nUltimately, we expect inner differentiation / streaming to be used across the entire school with a positive impact on the learning atmosphere.", "http://www.stjohnsrc.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA101-035365_1"], ["6JT", "European Continuing Development Programme", "St. John's Secondary School and Sixth Form College, A Catholic Academy, Bishop Auckland", 30432.0, "To bring about transformational change via teaching and learning we will identify subject areas and members of staff; selected specifically where not only is teaching considered outstanding, but where there is also there is a willingness to explore innovative and different teaching and learning styles.\r\nThrough our project of job shadowing and participation in structured courses we work with staff from each department in Spain, Germany and Hungary and to look at what works for them and how we can implement similar rationale with our students\r\n\r\nWe will :\r\n *Examine approaches to differentiated teaching and learning which supports underachievers;\r\n*Study ways to engage students to become more independent learners and how to tackle the setting and completion of quality homework tasks\r\n* Build home school relationships and understand how improved links can support achievement.\r\n\r\nThe close co-operation with other European schools will further develop our well-established work with our partners in Galicia, Spain, Tuebingen Germany and Szolnok ,Hungary who have a different and innovative approach to each of our principal school development issues\r\n\r\nThe findings of our project team will then be shared with the whole school staff and lead practitioners will trial and test innovative practice before assessing the fit with St John's need and ultimately adopting new approaches to classroom teaching and learning models. \r\nParticipation in this programmme will help the school to further develop its profile as a centre for internatioanl education co-operation and as a beacon school for innovative and reflective practice.", "http://www.stjohnsrc.org.uk", "St. John's Secondary School and Sixth Form College, A Catholic Academy, Bishop Auckland", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035412_coordinator"], ["6JZ", "German Architecture, Carpentry, and Culture", "Bishop Auckland College", 56568.0, "The Erasmus German Architecture, Carpentry, and Culture Project is designed to transfer knowledge and skills of German building construction techniques to the staff and students of Bishop Auckland College, in order that we can expand our delivery of the range of these skills, which are used to create energy efficient buildings and which are currently emerging in use in the UK.  Students and staff will work with KozMet Biberach, a specialist training college in southern Germany, who are renowned as a Centre of Excellence in Carpentry.  KozMet train the German World Skills Competition Teams and recently, one of their students won the Gold Medal for Carpentry Skills in the World Skills Competition in Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\n\r\nThey will learn about:\r\n\r\n1.  passive haus technologies \r\n2.  air tightness skills\r\n3.  alternative timber construction methods, including roof structures\r\n4.  use of specialist tools and carpentry techniques\r\n5.  energetic refurbishments\r\n6.  greater use of renewable energies within building construction\r\n7. employment opportunities, German architecture and German culture\r\n\r\nStaff that undertake the staff mobility project element will  extend their understanding of German construction techniques, from both a skills development and a teaching approach and will also understand their use and purpose within the overall construction of buildings.  They will use that learning to adapt the curriculum content that they teach in England, so that it incorporates the skills learned and will also work with local construction companies in order to provide up skilling to their workers.\r\n\r\nStudents will learn as practitioners - practicing new carpentry skills and undertaking work place experiences to understand the whole industry, including the manufacture of construction materials that are used in passive haus construction.\r\n\r\nAs students learn, their skills will be tested through the creation of components - the sum of which come together at the end of the project to create a timber roof structure that students construct from the components they have made and which demonstrates their skills learned.\r\n\r\nTwo groups of 15 students, aged 16 to 21, will experience the project and they will include full time, part time and Apprentice learners from Bishop Auckland College in County Durham, England.  Three staff members from the College Construction team will also undertake the project, to learn the skills alongside students, undertake team teaching and carry out a detailed review of curriculum materials, tools, machinery and resources that will be required in order to transfer the skills training to Bishop Auckland College.\r\n\r\nThe project will enable Bishop Auckland College to invest in delivering these skills in order to meet the needs arising from their emerging use in the UK, as businesses and residents demand more energy passive buildings as homes and business premises.", "http://www.bacoll.ac.uk", "Bishop Auckland College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036298_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DL14"}
