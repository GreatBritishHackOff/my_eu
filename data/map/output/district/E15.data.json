In a sandwich course,  the learners' experience is the starting point of the learnin process, it enables them to build their own knowledge but also to open to others. This kind of learning /teaching method requires  a strong collaboration between all the partners involved in the training: tutors in the workplacements, actors of the social life, parents, teachers and trainers. \r\n\r\nIn our first two consortia in 2012 and in 2013, young people from 4 then 7 schools registered in their final year of vocational or technical A-level were able to experience a workplacement in different countries in Europe. Little by little, the idea of european mobility has developed and become more and more popular throughout the different schools. Today, the new Erasmus + project  involves 9 schools (out of the 12 in the regional network) and concerns a broarder range of courses and a larger group of young learners (CAPA and Bac Pro and Bac techno). The aim is to increase the number young people's european mobilities, to develop their sense of european citizenship, to increase their professionnal integration but also to strengthen the european mobility program:\r\n\r\n- by integrating european mobility in the overall organisation of the CAPA and Bac Pro courses\r\n\r\n- by developping the technical skills of the teams involved in the  mobility programs and by enabling the MFR employees to get trained in Europe\r\n\r\n- by increasing the quality of the follow up of the learners thanks to better relations with our european partners (quality chart, agreement, questionnaires...)\r\n\r\nThe project is set up for 15 to 20 years-old A-level, girls and boys who have decided to take a sandwich course in order to discover the realities of the working world.\r\n\r\nThe project is also set up for the MFR employees who, for their own personnal development and in order to meet the MFR's objectives in terms of international development, will take part in working experiences in VET schools and will share good practices and build european training programs.\r\n\r\nThe project concerns:\r\n\r\n- 186 VET and Technological A-level learners for 3 weeks placements in 9 european countries\r\n\r\n- 27 CAPa learners for 2 weeks workplacements in VET schools and on workplacements in 4 european countries\r\n\r\n- 20 emloyees (2 per school and 2 from the Regional organisation) for a 5 day workplacement in 9 european countries.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the mobility program will be at the heart of the Erasmus + program: quality of the follow up of the participants, quality of the people involved in the program thanks to the training, quality of the partnerships.\r\n\r\nFor the learners, the main impact that is expected is:\r\n\r\n- increased pourcentage of professionnal integration thanks to the development of the personnal and professional competences, \r\n\r\n- development of cultural knowledge and the feeling of belonging to an european citizenship.\r\n\r\nFor the employees, the main impact that is expected is a better involvement and  management of the european programs so that  the teaching methods improve.\r\n\r\nFor the partner orgnisations, the impact that is expected is the integration of the european mobility in the training courses, the improvement of the VET image, and a better recognition of the sandwich courses as part of the development of the people and the professional sectors.\r\n\r\nOur ambition is to promote european mobility by allowing learners from the12 MFR to get access to it.", "http://www.flexlearn.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA102-001550_15"], ["1XH", "Vers un projet de coop\u00e9ration pour une formation professionnelle europ\u00e9enne", "Citywide Ventures t/a Flexlearn", 207409.0, "The FRMFR is applying for its 4th VET mobility project through the Erasmus+ program. The consortium counts today 11 MFR involved in the application out of the 12 MFR in the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es region. Partnerships have evolved and new european working groups have started to emerge within our partnership: strategic partnership on new skills needed in rural areas, ECVET workgroup. Today, not only can we offer quality workplacements for the learners and employees throughout Europe but we can also consider setting up partnerships and collaborations on common VET topics. We are therefore applying for 256 mobility grants so that more learners and staff can take part in this new project.\r\nThe learners who will benefit from the workplacements are all studying in VET secondary schools (french level V and IV) in various business sectors: agriculture, health and social care, retail, environment, hospitality and catering, agricultural equipement. The employees who will benefit from the professional training abroad can be trainers or any staff involved in VET.\r\nThanks to a qualitative preparation involving our european and local partners and using european documents (Europass CV and cover letter, languages passport), the particpants will define their own training goals depending on and related to the curriulum (learners) or the european development plan (staff). For the learners, the workplacements  last 3 weeks on average, the quality of these workplacements depends on the relationship established with the tutors and other european partners.

This is based on established European members and the change that having new member states brings, as well as what effects it has had on all countries involved in the exchange, specifically young people.\r\n\r\nThis exchange arose as a result of successfully conducted trilateral youth exchange by the tree partners in summer 2015 in Finland and contacts formed during attendance at International training early in 2014 by all partners in the exchange.  During and after the trilateral exchange in Finland, communication has been maintained and resulted in this proposal. An advanced planning visit will be arranged in June 2017 in Copenhagen, Denmark where all parties will discuss and take the plans forward.  It is intended that the format of the exchange will be finalized then.  Open dialogue about the programme has been an ongoing process.  All partners in the exchange are members of African European Youth Network and have had other means of co-operations in the past specially, in the field of Culture and Media. All partners involved, both youngsters and leaders will be actively participating in all aspects of the exchange program.\r\n\r\nThe objective is exploring the impact and raising awareness of an expanding European Union relating to young people\u2019s issues about Minorities and Mainstream Europeans. We will focus primarily on how citizenship affects young people on a daily basis and how it affects their participation in the long term and explore local, national and European differences for all countries.\r\n\r\nThe countries involved are Denmark, Poland, Finland, Sweden, UK, Portugal, Norway and Ireland.\r\n\r\nVenue: Copenhagen, Denmark\r\n\r\nDuration of the project: 10 days (14-23.07.2017), including the travel days.\r\n\r\nThere will be 40 participants in the exchange including youth leaders.\r\n\r\nDuring the exchange, participants will be introduced to the concept of informal group workshops and to support the development of their communication and presentation skills. They will be introduced gradually to games and exercises designed to stimulate discussion about national identity, European citizenship and integration and they will be given increased responsibility for peer leading within workshop sessions. Youth workers will support the group to draw out and analyze points that they raise naturally through their group discussions.\r\n\r\nDuring the planned discussion workshops in the Youth Exchange, participants will discuss their knowledge and perception about their counterpart and also compare and contrast their ideas about Europe as a multicultural continent. These sessions will develop their understanding of National and European identity and challenge their ideas about society and culture. They will learn tolerance and respect for other cultures and identify ways of overcoming barriers to living together. \r\n\r\nThis Youth Exchange will prepare participants to take part in a project of this nature. The exchange will be recorded visually and be made in DVDs for exploitation and sharing experience with other European partners and stack-holders after the conclusion of the exchange. The result will be shown in every possible EU youth in action future events that the two organizations participate in. The DVD will also be distributed to local youth centers, libraries and other relevant groups. \r\n\r\nIntended Outcomes\r\n\u2022 The minority young people will develop an awareness of different cultures and that they are European citizens.\r\n\u2022 The participants will share a common understanding of youth issues through collaborative working.\r\n\u2022 The participants will learn new skills including: employability skills, social media skills, different languages\r\nThe project will help to raise the self-esteem of participants by illustrating that their contributions are valued not only at home but also in a European Arena.\r\n\r\nThe project will support young people\u2019s personal development, enabling them to understand: national identity; the geography of Europe and the rest of the world; cultures, values and traditions typical of European countries; cultures, values and traditions typical of cultures outside of Europe; barriers to working together and ways to overcome barriers; racism, xenophobia and discrimination of minority groups; and issues related to successful immigration.
