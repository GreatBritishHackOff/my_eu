It is applying for its 6th VET Erasmus + program. The FRMFR coordinates the regional network and supports each association in the developement of the \"sandwich course\"pedagogy, the associative life, their projects. The consortium is composed of the 12 MFR from the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es region together with the f\u00e9d\u00e9rations d\u00e9partementales of Guyane with its 3 MFR and of the R\u00e9union with its6 MFR. The MFR from Guyane and R\u00e9union have asked to join our consortium in order to benefit form our experience to start implementing VET mobility projects for their staff and students. The FRMFR coordinates the consortium and helps the MFRs to define their european development plan:\r\n1. professionnal integration thanks to european programs\r\n2. development of the european dimension within the MFR thanks to:\r\na.  the involvment of each and every stakeholder (staff, board of directors, tutors, partners) in the imlplementation of the mobility programs and european cooperation as a whole\r\nb. new dynamics within the boards of directors\r\n3. pedagogical innnovations and better integration of the european dimension within the training programs\r\n4. new partnerships with the local, national and european companies.\r\nThis european development involves each and every one in new projets and new porgrams including KA1 (VET and youth programs), KA2 (VET) and KA3 (youth programs).\r\nThis application aims at allowing a total of 364 learners ; and a total of 49 staff, tutors and members of the boards of directors to experience a workplacement in Europe. The learners are registered in VET training courses in various sectors: agriculture, health and social care, retail, environment, hospitality and catering, agricultural equipement and buiding. Staff, members of the boards of directors will be able to discover new professional realitiesand other VET systems.\r\nThanks to quality preparation session organised in collaboration with our local and european partners, the participants will be able to define their specific training goals related to their curricula (learners) or related to the european development plan (staff, members of the boards of directors, tutors). On average, the learners will be on workplacement  for 3 weeks and staff for 1 week. \r\nThe expected results of the project are:\r\n- for the learners: personnal and professionnal developement; new professional, linguistic and personnal skills. \r\n- for the staff, members of the boards of directors and tutors, an improved knowledge of the different VET systems in Europe, pedagogical innovations involving the european dimension, an increased number of partners.\r\n- for the organisations, being involved in a european VET system. \r\n- better knowledge of the MFR accross Europe.", "http://www.flexlearn.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036478_7"], ["1JA", "Citizenship for marginalized group", "FAYO Foundation", 26686.0, "The theme of the project is \u201cEuropean Citizenship: impact of minorities and the changes that affect young people within each country, and the type of the project is multilateral youth exchange. This is based on established European members and the change that having new member states brings, as well as what effects it has had on all countries involved in the exchange, specifically young people.\r\n\r\nThis exchange arose as a result of successfully conducted trilateral youth exchange by the tree partners in summer 2015 in Finland and contacts formed during attendance at International training early in 2014 by all partners in the exchange.  During and after the trilateral exchange in Finland, communication has been maintained and resulted in this proposal. An advanced planning visit will be arranged in June 2017 in Copenhagen, Denmark where all parties will discuss and take the plans forward.  It is intended that the format of the exchange will be finalized then.  Open dialogue about the programme has been an ongoing process.  All partners in the exchange are members of African European Youth Network and have had other means of co-operations in the past specially, in the field of Culture and Media. All partners involved, both youngsters and leaders will be actively participating in all aspects of the exchange program.\r\n\r\nThe objective is exploring the impact and raising awareness of an expanding European Union relating to young people\u2019s issues about Minorities and Mainstream Europeans. We will focus primarily on how citizenship affects young people on a daily basis and how it affects their participation in the long term and explore local, national and European differences for all countries.\r\n\r\nThe countries involved are Denmark, Poland, Finland, Sweden, UK, Portugal, Norway and Ireland.\r\n\r\nVenue: Copenhagen, Denmark\r\n\r\nDuration of the project: 10 days (14-23.07.2017), including the travel days.\r\n\r\nThere will be 40 participants in the exchange including youth leaders.\r\n\r\nDuring the exchange, participants will be introduced to the concept of informal group workshops and to support the development of their communication and presentation skills. They will be introduced gradually to games and exercises designed to stimulate discussion about national identity, European citizenship and integration and they will be given increased responsibility for peer leading within workshop sessions. Youth workers will support the group to draw out and analyze points that they raise naturally through their group discussions.\r\n\r\nDuring the planned discussion workshops in the Youth Exchange, participants will discuss their knowledge and perception about their counterpart and also compare and contrast their ideas about Europe as a multicultural continent. These sessions will develop their understanding of National and European identity and challenge their ideas about society and culture. They will learn tolerance and respect for other cultures and identify ways of overcoming barriers to living together. \r\n\r\nThis Youth Exchange will prepare participants to take part in a project of this nature. The exchange will be recorded visually and be made in DVDs for exploitation and sharing experience with other European partners and stack-holders after the conclusion of the exchange. The result will be shown in every possible EU youth in action future events that the two organizations participate in. The DVD will also be distributed to local youth centers, libraries and other relevant groups. \r\n\r\nIntended Outcomes\r\n\u2022 The minority young people will develop an awareness of different cultures and that they are European citizens.\r\n\u2022 The participants will share a common understanding of youth issues through collaborative working.\r\n\u2022 The participants will learn new skills including: employability skills, social media skills, different languages\r\nThe project will help to raise the self-esteem of participants by illustrating that their contributions are valued not only at home but also in a European Arena.\r\n\r\nThe project will support young people\u2019s personal development, enabling them to understand: national identity; the geography of Europe and the rest of the world; cultures, values and traditions typical of European countries; cultures, values and traditions typical of cultures outside of Europe; barriers to working together and ways to overcome barriers; racism, xenophobia and discrimination of minority groups; and issues related to successful immigration.  The project will enable the participants to share their views with others, further their knowledge of common European cultural heritage, and develop their feeling of being European citizens.", "http://www.fayofoundation.org/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DK01-KA105-034107_7"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["4EA", "RINOVA LIMITED", 50872.0, "Promoting entrepreneurship and improving the competitiveness and access to markets of Union enterprises  (02.02.01)", "fts_2016_30406", 2016], ["4BQ", "LUMOS FOUNDATION*", 716.0, "Support expenditure for European Social Fund and non-operational technical assistance (04.01.04.01)", "fts_2016_32678", 2016], ["4EA", "RINOVA LIMITED", 99900.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2016_33946", 2016], ["4BQ", "BRITISH REFUGEE COUNCIL LBG*", 39962.0, "Supporting legal migration to the Union and promoting the effective integration of third-country nationals and enhancing fair and effective return strategies (18.03.01.02)", "fts_2017_28204", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "E15"}
