We will create and symbiotically use natural eco-materials for healthier indoor environments through hygrothermal (heat and moisture) regulation and the removal airborne contaminants through both chemical capture and photocatalysis. Our objectives include advancing state of the art in the technology and application of multifunctional bio-based insulation materials, vapour permeable and hygrothermal and moisture buffering finishes, together with wood panel products, to create both internal partition and external highly insulated wall panels. Novel chemical treatments and processes will be used to enhance volatile organic compound capture capacity of materials. We will also develop highly novel photocatalytic coatings using nanoparticle technology, which will be suitable for use in interior spaces and compatible with lime and wooden surfaces. Novel material development will be completed in partnership with world-class expert organisations in indoor environmental quality. We will also create a new holistic modelling framework that combines air quality, hygrothermal comfort and acoustic quality for the well-being of building users. We will take new products through to proof of concept development with prototype manufacture, large scale tests and pilot studies. We will deliver products with at least 15% lower embodied energy, at least 20% longer life, and, for at least 20% lower build costs. Our consortium brings together a multi-disciplinary team of world-class researchers from universities and research organisations with a number of large enterprises and innovative SMEs, whose combined expertise and capacity will lead commercial development and exploitation of our products. We will engage with stakeholders, including Public and Health authorities and standards committees, and deliver training and technical guidance.", 134280.0, 7492835.0, "ECO-SEE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.kronospan.co.uk", null, "fp7_108954_951655361"], ["6RG", "A Safer Alternative Replacement for Thiourea Based Accelerators in the Production Process of Chloroprene Rubber", "Clwyd Compounders Limited", "In December 2007, the European Commission imposed a total of \u20ac 247 635 000 fines on the five largest manufacturers of chloroprene rubber for participating in a cartel. As a result of this price fixing and market abuse by large enterprises, the SME involvement in this sector has diminished and requires research investment to re-build its presence. Additionally there is increasing pressure to replace the vulcanisation accelerator, ethylene thiourea (ETU), due to its assessment as a Cat 2 rep carcinogen as per the EU classification, IARC and EPA. It is believed that under REACH it will be classified as a CMR substance (Carcinogenic/Mutagenic/toxic for Reproduction) which will lead to legislation prohibiting or banning its use. The \u2018SafeRubber\u2019 project aims to develop a safer alternative accelerator to replace the carcinogenic ethylene thiourea (ETU) based accelerators to be used in the manufacturing of rubbers such as polychloroprene (CR) and epichlorohydrin (ECO). This will be based around a new catalyst molecule that has tri-functionality, which offers the added benefit of reducing consumption of metal oxides during manufacturing, lowering manufacturing costs and giving SMEs another unique differentiator, allowing them to compete in the market.", 151154.0, 2222733.0, "SAFERUBBER", "Quickly and safely getting up to speed", "Vulcanisation is a chemical process that makes rubber more durable. A novel process accelerator developed with EU support is an eco-friendly alternative to the currently used carcinogen and will help put EU manufacturers ahead of the competition.", "Ethylene thiourea (ETU)-based accelerators have been the industry standard for speeding the vulcanisation process (acting as an accelerator). However, ETU has now been classified as a suspected human carcinogen by various EU bodies. Its use is expected to be restricted or prohibited by the EU in the near future.\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) working in the rubber sector will be particularly hard hit, particularly in the face of rising competition from Asian countries with less stringent health and safety requirements. A large consortium took advantage of EU investment to find a safe replacement for ETU. Scientists developed an eco-friendly and inexpensive alternative within the context of the project http://www.saferubber.eu (SAFERUBBER) .\n\nThe additive SRM102 demonstrated many important benefits. Chloroprene rubbers made with SRM102 have improved flow characteristics, much more easily filling the mould. This has potential to reduce both the mass of rubber used and the scrap generated. In addition, it is possible to reduce levels of zinc oxide, a vulcanisation activator.\n\nOptimisation of the SRM102 may also decrease the cure cycle for savings in time and energy consumption. Finally, results of studies of algae growth on samples produced with SRM102 suggest it is not toxic.\n\nFive factories in three countries tested processing of chloroprene rubber containing SMR102. Scientists found the additive to perform as well as or better than compounds containing ETU. In rubber manufacturing trials, SRM102 was shown to be a viable replacement for ETU.\n\nWhile technical viability is critical, commercialisation relies on the bottom line. Since the percentage of SRM102 required compared to rubber content is similar to that of ETU, the new additive is expected to have minimal effect on the final manufacturing cost.\n\nSAFERUBBER has delivered a safe and cost-effective alternative to the carcinogenic rubber vulcanisation accelerator additive ETU. The numerous European SMEs active in the sector stand to benefit tremendously. Technology will help them meet the challenge of increasing competition from Asian countries unlikely to be affected by stricter regulations.", null, "http://www.clwydcompounders.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/148614.jpg", "fp7_96346_991999989"], ["4BJ", "Head protection: a European training network for Advanced Designs in Safety", "Charles Owen & Company (Bow) Limited", "Head injury is the most severe injury caused by motorcycling, bicycling, snowsports and equestrian activities, and it is the leading cause of death within these activities. Linear acceleration has been used extensively to determine head injury risk, but it has been found that brain injury is actually influenced by angular kinematics. This is ignored by current injury criteria and product certification tests. To date, there is no consensus in terms of head injury due to angular kinematics and this represents a significant gap in the state of the art. The scientific goal of HEADS is to improve the understanding of head impact injury and to design new helmet standard test methods that recognise the influence of rotational kinematics. This will lead to improved helmets and a reduction in the severity of injuries and the numbers of fatalities. This objective will be achieved through a combination of computational simulations of real-life accidents, experimental and computational investigation of injury thresholds, and design of new helmet certification tests. Another major objective of the network is to train a group of highly specialised doctoral graduates who are equally cognisant of head impact biomechanics and helmet design technologies as well as being aware of commercialisable market opportunities. The ESRs will work in world-class facilities with highly qualified experts, and will benefit from the training scheme developed based on the expertise of academic and industrial partners. This project will reach a new level of understanding of head injury and how head injury should be prevented, with directly applicable results to European industry. It will develop a well-networked group of young engineers and scientists into world class researchers and innovators with numerous career paths open to them, who will advance technology for the benefit of society and maintain Europe as a global leader in industrial development.", 224574.0, 2783486.0, "HEADS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_193935_968366424"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LL14"}
