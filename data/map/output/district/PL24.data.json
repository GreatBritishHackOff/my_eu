Its primary aim is to create a European training network designed to improve the career prospects of its 10 ESRs and 2 ERs in both the public and private sector. The network will deliver a joint multidisciplinary research training programme which will encourage and foster the growth of the researchers\u2019 skills in scientific expertise, technological knowledge and professional aptitude. The key vehicle in this strategy is a supervised personal, original research project in a critical aspect of sustainable packaging.\nThe network has been designed to achieve the following objectives (i) to conduct top-level research and training and devise innovative solutions for specific EU needs in the area of sustainable packaging, (ii) to advance the state-of-the-art in wood cellulose based sustainable packaging in three specific areas (a) next generation packaging composites, (b) cellulose-fibre based active packaging and (c) environmental, economic and societal aspects of packaging production, (iii) to educate the next generation of researchers inside a broad European research training network which includes universities, research centres and industry, thereby accelerating the researchers\u2019 advancement to team leader status, (iv) to improve the career prospects of ERs and ESRs through complementary training such as; writing and presentation skills; language, effective communication and collaboration; project management and finance; project/product cycles; entrepreneurship; IPR, (v) to create an integrated, long-term sustainable packaging research and training base in the EU by bringing together universities, research institutes and industrial players active in key research disciplines.", 96751.0, 2558838.0, "NEWGENPAK", "Superior natural packaging materials", "Recycling and garbage bins are loaded with fossil fuel-based packaging materials left over after the foods they contained are consumed. Improved 100 % biodegradable wood-based alternatives are just around the corner to minimise environmental impact.", "Researchers have turned to cellulose-based biopolymers as a promising 100 % biodegradable alternative to petroleum-based packaging materials. Seventeen partners are supporting 13 researchers in their investigations within the EU-funded project 'New generation of functional cellulose fibre based packaging materials for sustainability' (http://www.newgenpak.eu/ (NEWGENPAK)).\n\nAddition of nanocellulose can significantly offset some of the weaknesses of other biopolymers in mechanical strength and barrier properties. It can be functionalised for anti-oxidant and anti-bacterial activity and even yield intelligent or active packaging solutions.\n\nThe first pillar is improving barrier properties of coatings and films. Modelling techniques are being used to understand and predict the relationship between structure and function. The team produced a mineral oil barrier with effectiveness up to 98 % in the lab. Scientists also produced a multi-barrier system with dry oxygen permeability similar to polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the most common type of polyester.\n\nA second line of research is focused on developing cellulose fibre-based active packaging. The team has already had promising enhancements in anti-microbial activity. An SME, that is a full partner in the project, has assessed a number of commercial thermochromic inks for printability on both benchmark and modified substrates. They will used in studies on intelligent packaging, for fruits and vegetables, that changes colour with temperature.\n\nFinally, scientists want to ensure that the processing is as sustainable as the product. They have developed 10 criteria to evaluate the environmental, economic and social impact of manufacturing processes. A comparison life cycle assessment of conventional versus active packaging shows that the overall impacts are comparable. The environmental impact due to incorporation of active agents can be offset by their contribution to increased shelf life.\n\nNEWGENPAK is focused on the development of barrier and active technologies to enhance the performance and thus the use of carbon dioxide-neutral, cellulose-based packaging materials. Given the volume of packaging material used annually and the global demand for sustainable materials and processes, EU manufacturers' competitiveness will be boosted.", "http://www.newgenpak.eu/", null, "/docs/results/images/2014/148129.jpg", "fp7_102018_968264283"], ["2SQ", "Sustainable Technologies for Calcined Industrial Minerals in Europe", "Imerys Minerals Ltd", "Europe is a major global producer of industrial minerals.  Around 180 million tonnes per year of products are extracted in the EU, with an estimated contribution of \u20ac10 billion to European GDP and offering direct employment to some 42,500 people.  A secure supply of sustainable mineral products is essential to maintaining the European mining, mineral and manufacturing industries.\n\nThe main objective of STOCISM is to enhance the competitiveness of the European industrial minerals industry by developing cleaner, more energy efficient extraction and processing technologies.  STOICISM is an industry-led project with a specific focus on calcined industrial minerals which are presently energy intensive to produce.  Most calcining uses the direct combustion of fossil fuels, contributing to up to 85% of their carbon emissions.\n\nTo meet the overall aim, three key calcined industrial minerals have been identified: diatomaceous earth; perlite and kaolin.  The processes implemented can also then be directly transferable to many other industrial minerals. In global terms, the EU produces one third of the world\u2019s production of perlite, 20% of calcined kaolin and 20% of diatomite.  Key markets for these minerals are beverage filtration, coatings, plastic, rubber, cosmetics, insulation and construction materials. STOICISM will research, develop and demonstrate a range of new innovative technologies along the industrial minerals value chain. This will include developments in extraction, beneficiation, drying, calcining and waste recycling.\n\nSTOICISM is expected to impact significantly on the sustainability of the EU\u2019s industrial minerals industry by decreasing the use of natural resources (both mineral deposits and energy resources) leading to the sustainable production of better and purer products with less waste and lower environmental impact.", 762419.0, 6859720.0, "STOICISM", null, null, null, "http://www.stoicism.eu/", null, null, "fp7_106426_968264283"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PL24"}
