Fresh cut salads, fruit salads and deli salads were chosen as model food system. Food producers will be able to optimise their raw material selection, product formulation and processing steps virtually. The software estimates the effect of each production step on the safety (growth or survival of relevant pathogens) and shelf life (growth of specific spoilage organisms and/or formation of undesirable by-products) while considering quality (organoleptic characteristics and other quality parameters). The predictive and probabilistic models are based on existing data sets of bacterial growth and quality changes under various conditions generated during previous studies (where available) and data generated during the project. Users will also have the possibility to insert own data, e.g. initial bacterial contamination. The web-based software can be continuously expanded \u2013 even after project end - by inserting new data sets (e.g. other food products, different environmental conditions, etc.).\nFurthermore, the project aims not only to develop predictive and probabilistic models, but also to compile information about different processing techniques, product formulations (e.g. clean label), environmental conditions (e.g. modified atmosphere packaging) as well as hygiene, quality and safety management. These information sheets aim to educate food producers, as they should not only see the effect of different factors on shelf life and pathogen growth calculated by the models, but also understand why. This increased awareness is crucial in improving overall food safety and quality. Information of this nature is essential for small businesses with limited technical resources.", 169196.0, 3126323.0, "SOPHY", null, null, null, "http://www.sophy-project.eu/", "http://www.bryanssalads.co.uk", null, "fp7_101655_963586458"], ["6XJ", "Piezo Pair Materials for the Selective Exclusion of Workplace Noise", "GBA Services Ltd", "The problem of Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) in the work place is a problem for SMEs and European workers, particularly in the manufacturing and transport sectors. NIHL results in reduced productivity from lost work days, insurance claims and potential early retirement. Current EU legislation requires employers to provide suitable ear protection for workers exposed to high levels of noise, but worker compliance is often low as they perceive the use of hearing protection as impairing hearing capability. Thus a suitable alternative to existing ear protection is needed, allowing speech and alarms to be heard whilst significantly reducing other potentially harmful sound. In summary the PiezoSelEx device will: \u2022 Promote productivity due to easier communication \u2022 Reduce the risk of NIHL \u2022 Contribute to a more comfortable work environment \u2022 Reduce employee absenteeism due to increased wearer comfort and a reduction in NIHL \u2022 Contribute to a safer working environment as warning signals will be easier to hear. The use of piezo materials in this proposal has many advantages over prior art of high end earplugs. The novel use of \u2018piezo pairs\u2019 self-powers the earplug, thus eliminating the need for external electrical equipment as is required by all current piezo earplugs. Furthermore, the use of sets of piezo pairs not only enables the device to cancel out all noise above 75 dB (A), but also \u2018filter\u2019 out background noise except for sound frequencies associated with speech and warning signals. The use of piezo pairs removes the need for batteries, thus having positive environmental implications. Ergonomic and safety testing of the prototype will take place to ensure maximum comfort and safety for users over extended periods of time. There are also a number of wider benefits for Europe. In addition to working environments currently protected by legislation our device may provide a driver to enforce new legislations, particularly in the entertainment industry.", 315124.0, 1228074.0, "PIEZOSELEX", null, null, null, null, "http://www.gbaservices.com", null, "fp7_97069_985074286"], ["0XJ", "Attract, Retain and Develop New Nuclear Talents Beyond Academic Curricula", "Westinghouse Electric Company Uk Limited", "The primary motivation of the ENEN\\ project is to substantially contribute to the revival of the interest of young generations in the careers in nuclear sector.

INSPEC2T approach bases its conceptual foundations on EU crime prevention and Member States specific Internal Security Policies, validated research results and best practices from cooperation between police and local, regional and national communities. This is perceived as an origin to apprehend special characteristics, particularities and determinants for trust between all stakeholders. INSPEC2T is focusing on a user-centric design and development approach, and has already mobilized and engaged a critical user group mass, in EU and abroad. With special emphasis on social media, it consolidates and modernizes bidirectional communication of stakeholders, using multi-level anonymity flags and having a clear understanding of acceptability issues. Driven from accommodated transnational and multicultural best practices, it adheres to an approach where social, cultural, legal and ethical dimensions are embedded into core user centric design specifications and implementation procedures. INSPEC2T will be demonstrated and validated in 5 EU cities by a wide range of relevant stakeholders. INSPEC2T engagement and active participation is stimulated through fully dynamic, interactive and immersive training Serious Game applications that empower players to familiarize themselves with the system, gain an intuitive understanding of its functionalities and motivate their engagement in Community Policing activities.  Special focus will be given to Community Policing awareness raising activities for both police and citizens.
