This development will provide the natural cosmetic sector with an alternative to replace the current use of chemically-derived surfactants from oleo-chemical feedstocks. One of their main applications is in personal hygiene products representing 40% in volume of the cosmetic ingredients used in the EU. This work will optimize the production of natural bio-surfactants by fermentation to achieve industrial efficiency and economic yields by using organically certified sources (e.g. post harvest loses by-products from primary process). The proposed work offers an opportunity to achieve the full utilization of organically certified raw materials increasing the efficiency of the European Organic Farming Systems. Scientific objectives are: 1) To investigate supply of raw materials from waste streams or by-products to lowers the initial costs; 2) To develop scientific knowledge on the interdependencies of the various process parameters and substrate properties ; 3.)To establish of a database of compound characteristics, stability and performance for suitable applications. Further, the overall technical objectives are to define the characteristics of the product to meet the organic certification standards and the performance requirements for their application in the natural cosmetic industry. This will be followed by the specification, optimization and scale-up of an appropriate industrial bio-process for bio-surfactant production (up to 1 m3 to 10 m3) by developing an integrated fermenting and in-situ removal system. Further, a technology platform for product information, formulation and applications will be created for the benefit of the SME-AG members.", 8544.0, 2172472.0, "O4S", "Towards cheap, efficient bio-surfactants", "Researchers are developing a natural, organic alternative to chemically derived surfactants for use in cosmetics.", "Many personal hygiene products and other cosmetics include chemical compounds known as surfactants. However, the European natural cosmetics sector lacks a sustainable source of natural and organic surfactants.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.organic4surfactants.eu (O4S) project aims to optimise the efficiency and cost of natural surfactant production on an industrial scale. Organically certified raw materials will be sourced from waste streams and the by-products of primary processes.\n\nResearchers began by benchmarking available industrial, bio-based and biological surfactants. The products were evaluated for physical and chemical characteristics, and for their foaming and emulsifying properties.\n\nA fungal strain (Pseudozyma aphidis) able to produce a promising bio-surfactant was then described, and microbial synthesis of a number of surfactants was achieved. For all bio-surfactants produced during the study, researchers again assessed foaming ability, surface tension, purity and water solubility.\n\nThe research team also evaluated the downstream processing of surfactants. They found bio-ethanol to be the best option for replacing the petrochemical solvents currently used to purify these compounds.\n\nO4S has already brought scientists much closer to high-performance, low-cost bio-surfactants.

It aims to increase the performance of a sector that, over the past two decades, upheld three main strategies to handle global competitive pressure: cost-oriented, product/service-oriented and productivity-oriented. TCBL provides a business experimentation framework for exploring variations on such strategies. The framework will be supported by Knowledge Spaces as a generative force and Business Services as an enabling force. A network of Business Labs will be set up, based on three key variations: Design Labs (e.g. creating emotionally-oriented immaterial value), Making Labs (e.g. converting skilled labour into material value), and Place Labs (e.g. generating spatial community- and socially- oriented value). Each of these Labs will explore the issues of cost, product/service and productivity enhancement in a transversal manner and from cross-disciplinary perspectives - including economic, anthropological, and engineering approaches as well as new business values such as environmental and social responsibility, sharing economy, social enterprising, customer-driven small series production (the focus of this call) and emergent or disruptive technologies. With these tools, and supported by an open Associates Programme, TCBL will carry out real-life experimentation and market deployment of a number of Supply Chain, Localisation, Business, Skill Management and Policy innovations involving no fewer than 160 workshops, laboratories and manufacturing plants at EU level with at least 15,000 T&C workers involved. In addition, 10 new innovative companies will be generated within the supply chain of T&C, enabling the diffusion and scaling up of results.

These trusted networks, built horizontally and vertically, will fully integrate shippers, LSPs and intermodal operators as equal partners. To reach a high level of sustainability, we will not only bundle freight volumes, but shift them off the road to intermodal rail and waterway. NEXTRUST will build these trusted networks ideally bottom up, with like-minded partners, adding multiple layers of transport flows that have been de-coupled and then re-connected more effectively along the supply chain. We will develop C-ITS cloud based smart visibility software to support the re-engineering of the networks, improving real-time utilization of transport assets. NEXTRUST will focus on research activities that create stickiness for collaboration in the market, validated through pilot cases in live conditions. The action engages major shippers as partners (Beiersdorf, Borealis, Colruyt, Delhaize, KC, Mondelez, Panasonic, Philips, Unilever) owning freight volumes well over 1.000.000 annual truck movements across Europe, plus SME shippers and LSPs with a track record in ICT innovation. The pilot cases cover the entire scope of the call and cover a broad cross section of entire supply chain (from raw material to end-consumers) for multiple industries. The creation and validation of trusted collaborative networks will be market oriented and implemented at an accelerated rate for high impact. We expect our pilot cases to reduce deliveries by 20%-40% and with modal shift to reduce GHG emissions by 40%-70%. Load factors will increase by 50%-60% given our emphasis on back-load/modal shift initiatives.
