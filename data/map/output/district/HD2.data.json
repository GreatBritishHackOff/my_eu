This development will provide the natural cosmetic sector with an alternative to replace the current use of chemically-derived surfactants from oleo-chemical feedstocks. One of their main applications is in personal hygiene products representing 40% in volume of the cosmetic ingredients used in the EU. This work will optimize the production of natural bio-surfactants by fermentation to achieve industrial efficiency and economic yields by using organically certified sources (e.g. post harvest loses by-products from primary process). The proposed work offers an opportunity to achieve the full utilization of organically certified raw materials increasing the efficiency of the European Organic Farming Systems. Scientific objectives are: 1) To investigate supply of raw materials from waste streams or by-products to lowers the initial costs; 2) To develop scientific knowledge on the interdependencies of the various process parameters and substrate properties ; 3.)To establish of a database of compound characteristics, stability and performance for suitable applications. Further, the overall technical objectives are to define the characteristics of the product to meet the organic certification standards and the performance requirements for their application in the natural cosmetic industry. This will be followed by the specification, optimization and scale-up of an appropriate industrial bio-process for bio-surfactant production (up to 1 m3 to 10 m3) by developing an integrated fermenting and in-situ removal system.

However, the European natural cosmetics sector lacks a sustainable source of natural and organic surfactants.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.organic4surfactants.eu (O4S) project aims to optimise the efficiency and cost of natural surfactant production on an industrial scale. Organically certified raw materials will be sourced from waste streams and the by-products of primary processes.\n\nResearchers began by benchmarking available industrial, bio-based and biological surfactants. The products were evaluated for physical and chemical characteristics, and for their foaming and emulsifying properties.\n\nA fungal strain (Pseudozyma aphidis) able to produce a promising bio-surfactant was then described, and microbial synthesis of a number of surfactants was achieved. For all bio-surfactants produced during the study, researchers again assessed foaming ability, surface tension, purity and water solubility.\n\nThe research team also evaluated the downstream processing of surfactants. They found bio-ethanol to be the best option for replacing the petrochemical solvents currently used to purify these compounds.\n\nO4S has already brought scientists much closer to high-performance, low-cost bio-surfactants.

TCBL provides a business experimentation framework for exploring variations on such strategies. The framework will be supported by Knowledge Spaces as a generative force and Business Services as an enabling force. A network of Business Labs will be set up, based on three key variations: Design Labs (e.g. creating emotionally-oriented immaterial value), Making Labs (e.g. converting skilled labour into material value), and Place Labs (e.g. generating spatial community- and socially- oriented value). Each of these Labs will explore the issues of cost, product/service and productivity enhancement in a transversal manner and from cross-disciplinary perspectives - including economic, anthropological, and engineering approaches as well as new business values such as environmental and social responsibility, sharing economy, social enterprising, customer-driven small series production (the focus of this call) and emergent or disruptive technologies.

To reach a high level of sustainability, we will not only bundle freight volumes, but shift them off the road to intermodal rail and waterway. NEXTRUST will build these trusted networks ideally bottom up, with like-minded partners, adding multiple layers of transport flows that have been de-coupled and then re-connected more effectively along the supply chain.

NEXTRUST will focus on research activities that create stickiness for collaboration in the market, validated through pilot cases in live conditions. The action engages major shippers as partners (Beiersdorf, Borealis, Colruyt, Delhaize, KC, Mondelez, Panasonic, Philips, Unilever) owning freight volumes well over 1.000.000 annual truck movements across Europe, plus SME shippers and LSPs with a track record in ICT innovation. The pilot cases cover the entire scope of the call and cover a broad cross section of entire supply chain (from raw material to end-consumers) for multiple industries. The creation and validation of trusted collaborative networks will be market oriented and implemented at an accelerated rate for high impact.

To be more clear it was a training course aiming at encouraging newcomers to start international projects in Erasmus+ Youth Programme. Organisation \"HPCA\" not only found the core of the partners for this project but also we with our partners came up with the idea of this YE.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the project is to:\r\n1. Challenge the perceptions and raise awareness about consumerism (capitalism) culture;\r\n2. Overcoming the stereotypes of eating habits of vegans, vegetarians and meat eaters;\r\n3. Change habits of participants which demonstrate non- conscious life style;\r\n4. To learn how to grow own food (adaptable in the city with low space resources) and how to collect food from the nature;\r\n5. To encourage a healthy nutrition as natural part of the daily routine;\r\n\r\nA variety of educational tools and methods of non-formal learning and interactive participant orientated approaches as role plays, simulations, workshops, exercises theatre tools, debate sessions and presentations will be combined during the Activity.\r\nWe are planning to use methodology according to the youth pass but as well we are about to improve the following competences of participants: \r\n1. Young people will learn all the crops growing process: from planting to collecting fruits. Though it is long procedure and short period of time is not always enough, germinating would be the perfect solution in this case. We also see this project as to be continuous. Participants will also be asked to bring different seeds and later on we will mix them all together and each of them will bring some of the various seeds home, plant and will have a beautiful outcome of the project: grown plants from the \u201cYOU-th & HEAL-th\" on their windowsill or in the garden. \r\n2. Participants will be able to understand the differences of various eating habits and to consciously choose which one is the best for them. As most of the organisations have different experience, we are sure that participants will be able to gain very important knowledge about foods and will be motivated to interest even at home about this kind of topic.\r\n\r\n3. Youngsters will understand what is the consumerism culture and how it damages our world and will be able to make conscious decisions towards buying. Though the results of it almost never seen in the home country, the world is one big family therefore we really need to start to care about others. I.e. cheap clothing has a real cost and it is not fair that anybody sit 12 hours sewing and sewing until they collapse of dehydration and hunger. Most of the youngsters are not aware of this situation therefore we see how out partners from Netherlands can share their knowledge with other participants.\r\n\r\n4. Participants will learn how to survive in the nature. As we will go for the camping, it will be the priceless experience and challenge for them. We will also learn how to collect berries, mushrooms, various herbs which are very important for the health and it does not requires finances but only work.\r\n\r\nWe do expect that partners will establish new partnerships and will develop concrete projects within Erasmus + programme, using conscious lifestyle as a core. Each partner commits to continue the local activities with learning outcomes from the project. We consider local transfer workshops as additional measures of dissemination and exploitation of results achieved during this project.\r\nThe activity will consist in a youth exchange, held in Tbilisi, Georgia, from 5th to 16th of April 2018.
