On the whole, performances on secondary lower level are much better which is proved in the test results of national standards E8 from 2014. Unfortunately only a small number of schools received raters to find out about pupils' oral communications skills. Speaking in a language class does still not have the importance it should have. In inclusive settings every child  can contribute to language learning providing knowledge and skills in their mother tongue.\r\nCLIL is an option to introduce more English in schools without rising the number of English lessons per week. Only teachers with a high language competence can run CLIL-lessons, only teachers with high language competence can set up a learning environment that challenges the pupils to use English as a medium of instruction and communication. Therefore we need to qualify our teachers in terms of language competence as well as in methodology and didactics. Teachers also have to prepare pupils to make use of digital ways to learn and improve a language. As a consequence e-education must be part of teacher training as well.\r\nOur project goals:\r\nFostering the knowledge of modern languages and intercultural communication\r\nTeaching staff that keeps improving their own competence in modern languages to act as role models for students\r\nIncrease of ICT in language classes\r\nIncrease of CLIL in primary and lower secondary schools\r\nIncreased use of the potential of collaboration within Europe\r\nFurther development of ICT competences as a basic prerequisite for innovation and collaboration in the field of education\r\nReinforcement of motivation and contentment of teaching staff\r\nIncreasing the number of joint projects in the province of Styria (School to school partnerships, eTwinning, A-Twinning)\r\nInitiatives to set up regional and European networks of teachers\r\nSetting up an online communication helpdesk for pupils operated by native speakers \r\nRaising awareness for the importance of language learning on all levels (teachers, inspectors, school authorities)\r\nExpanding of invitations to informal \"tea time chats\" for all teachers run by native speakers \r\nThe participants in job shadowing are headteachers and teachers who have been using innovative ways of teaching already and who are willing to share their experience with other colleagues within Europe. In addition school inspectors who have to guide schools with their school development as well as education psychologists who contribute their knowledge of learning styles to the implementation of successful inclusive learning environements take part in job shadowing and exchange meetings.\r\nAs far as job shadowing is concerned teachers usually have only limited knowledge of how other teachers of English act in their classes. Observing classes has become more frequent on secondary level, but is still the exception in primary schools for reasons as tight timetabling and English considered a low priority subject. Teachers need time to watch the students' learning process with both struggling and success. Teachers will volunteer to job shadowing and will indicate their interest to the Landesschulrat via their headteachers.\r\nTeachers who want to do intensive training in a course in Ireland or Scotland will come up with a selected course from the Erasmus+ SEG course catalogue. Teachers who choose courses that are in line with the school profile will get priority. Only schools with a school development plan that contains \"Improvement of language competence\" will be nominated. All participants must be willing to share their experience with other colleagues not taking part in the programme. They are to act as disseminators.\r\nThe strong impact of the consortium will help the region and the province to make faster progress aiming at the targets of Europe 2020. \r\nAbove all the project will serve the pupils: better learning performances achieved with the help of innovative and motivated teachers will improve the students career opportunities and will in the end strengthen the economy and as a consequence the province of Styria. Strong regions form the backbone of Europe.\r\nThe consortium consists of 1.300 compulsory school teachers plus  members of the school authority , teaching or being responsible for 7447 students. Out of this 1300 educational professionals 179 will do an European job-shadowing, 76 are intending to do a teacher training course, this means that around 19% of the staff members of the consortium will go for a mobility.

This changes the role and task assignments at all levels. School inspectors, as \"regional education managers\", should contribute more to a regional education planning. Autonomy requires new leadership skills from the head teachers. The mobility project is to be supported by internationalization, European opening and cooperation in the implementation of these objectives. Schools are given the opportunity to accentuate their own priorities. Due to international cooperation, the project participants can get to know successful models and take them into consideration for their work or school development. Training courses and conferences will give them new impetus and input on innovative methods. In order to promote international co-operation, it is important to develop further the knowledge as well as the competences of the participating educational staff by means of courses. Job shadowing is intended to help develop new learning and teaching methods, personnel development, quality assurance, new management and management processes and structures.\r\nThe project aims to strengthen the international network of both the participating schools as well as the authorities and institutions, the introduction of new measures in school development and improved professional competences, which will ultimately support the development and achievements of our pupils.", "http://www.anglolang.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA101-034958_21"], ["5JX", "U\u010dme angli\u010dtinu moderne a in\u0161pirat\u00edvne", "ANGLOLANG (SCARBOROUGH) LTD", 5242.0, "We will implement the project \"Let us teach English in a modern and ispirational way\" at our school from June 1, 2017 till May 31, 2018, during 12 months. \r\nWithin the project two English teachers  will participate in two mobilities - the training courses Language And Methodology For Teachers Of English in our partnership school Anglolang Academy of English in Scarborough, UK. \r\n   One of the main priorities of ous school development conception is to increase the quality of teaching English language.

The participants of the mobilities have been experienced English teachers who perform almost the entire English teaching at our school. In the teaching process they closely cooperate with each other, they make the most important decisions related to the trends and ways of English teaching at our school. They keep trying to grow professionally and motivate their pupils with their creative approaches. One of the participants is the chief of the commision of the social subjects.

We believe that the effective use of intuitive-to-use devices with touch screens, so tablets and interactive whiteboards will help our students develop their skills. In this way we not only improve the quality of education in our school, but also we meet the expectations of today's youth. As teachers we often observe that young people are so accustomed to the use of digital technology at every step of their lives that they acquire knowledge passed on a flat screen much faster than the one from the old fashioned books.
