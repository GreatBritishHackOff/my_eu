The consortium assembles 4 research performing SMEs with unique and complementary expertise, who will produce together a pre-series of 250 containers, obtain the relevant approvals from FAA/EASA, and deploy the solution with the pilot customers.\n\nThe project results, as compared with the current packaging, transport and security management methods, will be widely disseminated via industry associations such as IATA, TSA and TIACA.

Given the inadequate educational and well-being outcomes for many of the most disadvantaged groups in British society (particularly looked-after children, families experiencing multiple problems) the social care sector is called upon to achieve fundamental changes. The high-profile Munro review of child protection argued for a child-centred system as is commonly found in countries where social pedagogy underpins care and welfare provisions. The influential Association of Directors of Children's Services therefore recommended that local authorities should adopt social pedagogy to ensure 'a consistent and holistic approach to underpin the commissioning and provision of support for children and young people across the age range, and their families'. Whilst social pedagogy is clearly recognised as a way of addressing the need for systemic change - the Government is currently funding a social pedagogy pilot under its Innovation Programme - and pilot projects have consistently demonstrated its potential to improve outcomes, taking social pedagogy to scale is hampered by the cost of training a substantial part of the workforce and a lack of free comprehensive learning resources that can offer compelling insights into social pedagogical practice in other countries and support innovation.We aim to address these issues effectively by creating a Massive Open Online Course in European social pedagogy, consisting of 9 sessions that offer unique insights into social pedagogy in the partner countries. Our international multi-sector partnership between 9 organisations leading social pedagogy developments in higher education, vocational training and organisational capacity-building is designed to share innovative and best practice across linguistic barriers that have frequently prevented cross-fertilisation in social care across Europe. To support this aim and influence policy-making, we also propose to produce an academic research report that draws on the learning about social pedagogy between the 7 participating countries, outlines innovative ideas with the potential to impact on social care practice and makes policy recommendations about how these can be cross-culturally translated in order to develop a coherent conceptual and practice framework in social pedagogy across Europe. The partners chosen to achieve our aim of stimulating cross-European discourse and learning about social pedagogy and related innovative practice are:\u2022 ThemPra Social Pedagogy, a pioneering social enterprise providing organisational capacity-building through vocational courses in social pedagogy, strategic consultancy and team development\u2022 University of Central Lancashire, one of the largest Schools of Social Work in the UK and recently developed a BA in Social Pedagogy, Advocacy and Participation\u2022 Professionsh\u00f8jskolen UCC, leading provider of full-time distance learning degree programmes in social pedagogy\u2022 Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, who are at the forefront of social pedagogy qualifications and lead the social pedagogy discourse in Spain and Latin America\u2022 Masarykova Univerzita, one of the largest universities for social pedagogy studies and actively involved in sector developments in Central and Eastern Europe\u2022 Universiteit Gent, with substantial teaching and research expertise in social pedagogy, contributing to its discourse both in Flanders and internationally\u2022 Kocaeli Universitesi, one of the largest universities with regards to social work qualifications and active in sector developments in Turkey\u2022 KJSH - Stiftung f\u00fcr Kinder-, Jugend und Soziale Hilfen, a large not-for-profit organisation providing social pedagogical services in youth care and VET activities in Germany\u2022 CommonView, a VET organisation providing coaching and consultancy in social pedagogy both in Denmark and the UK, with expertise in cross-cultural learning transfer of innovative social pedagogical practiceTo ensure high quality results and sufficient space for dialogue and learning between us, we will undertake 8 transnational project meetings, allowing for regular reviews and refinement of intellectual outputs based on feedback from critical friends and MOOC pilot learners.
