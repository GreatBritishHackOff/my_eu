The first activity if for 20 teaching staff from all vocational areas and campuses within NWRC, to attend courses entitled :\r\n- \"Programming for the 21st century classroom\", \r\n- \"Collaboration and innovative learning scenarios\", \r\n- \"Interactive technologies for the future classroom\", and \r\n- \"Creative use of multimedia, games and tablets in school. \"\r\n\r\nThe second activity will provide 5 teaching staff within the Essential Skills and Early Years environment to job shadow staff in the Swedish school system, where achievements in these areas are acknowledged as being of best practice standard. \r\n\r\nNot only will the participants receive skills training but they will also have the opportunity to develop ideas and insights in how to apply these skills to provide a transformative effect on their teaching and learning processes.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that by better integrating technology into all curriculum areas that students will have access to a more varied learning experience that makes the classroom or learning environment more appealing and thereby sustain the desire to stay in education or acquire skills or competences that will enhance employment opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe learning gained by both staff and students as a result of changes made will further inform the College's strategy on pedagogy and resource development to provide ongoing longer term benefits beyond the lifetime of this project.", "http://www.nwrc.ac.uk", "North West Regional College", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002231_coordinator"], ["0NA", "Trainees and trainers from Hamburg learn in Europe", "Foyle International Ltd.", 580430.0, "International competencies become more and more important in many professions.

In the year 2011, the mobility certificate for the target group of trainees (IVT) was awarded to our company due to the high quality of our activities. We are working very successfully as a nationwide pool project in the open -flow management. Continuously, a high number of trainees is interested in our company\u2019s mobility program. Especially internships in English language target countries (UK , Malta) are in high demand. Most of the participants come from the commercial and office sector, but industry, tourism, hotel and catering services are common branches as well. In principle, Azubi-Mobil is open to trainees from all kind of different professions. In the project, we work according to the principles of ECVET. The orientation towards learning outcomes is thus a priority for all our partners. Therefore, in cooperation with the partners we have derived practically applicable, inter-professional and comprehensible units of learning outcome from specific job descriptions. These units are used as the basis for the learning agreement and the contents of the internship. Clear rules for assessment and a quality-oriented documentation ( Europass) have been set up in order to ensure the quality of valid learning outcomes (MoU). Our service is perceived by trainees and training companies (mostly SMEs) with very great esteem and consistently positive feedback. For the majority of the participating sending companies (each having 1-2 trainees) the effort of organizing an individual mobility application would be too high. In addition, many companies confirmed individual competence increase on the part of the trainees. Hence, the opportunity to participate in a mobility program during the company training has now become an attractive marketing tool for the companies. Quality, evaluation & recognition of achieved learning outcomes are not only important features in the specific context of European priorities (ECVET) but they are also the basis for VET mobility in general to become an integral, integrated part of operational training with corresponding \"training\" quality. Thanks to the positive feedback from our participants, many training organization send on a regular basis trainees with our help abroad. In addition to the application management, we have a very good European network of partner institutions that support us in the active organization and supervision in the destination country. This is necessary, since 80 % of our trainees do not have any contact to receiving companies in the desired hosting country. Together with our partners, we organize tailor-made internship positions, take care of travel and accommodation, carry out administration & project management, ensure the proper documentation (Europass, contract, learning agreement) and act during the whole period of mobility as personal contacts for the trainees.\r\n\r\nDue to the IVT mobility a growing interest among the training staff (VET staff) arose to get to know the vocational training systems and the receiving organizations of their trainees. Since 2012, we now organize parallel to the trainee program study visits for the target group training staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information: www.azubi - mobil.de", "http://www.foyle.eu", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000130_5"], ["7NN", "Azioni di mobilit\u00e0 per lo sviluppo delle competenze e la promozione della competitivit\u00e0 e creativit\u00e0 dell\u2019industria culturale e del turismo", "Derry City Council", 332539.0, "One of the central ideas underlying European Lifelong Learning policies is that international mobility should become a natural part of education and training schemes.

The project focuses on learning new elements, methods of VET in order to deepen and widen the vocational skills and to implement and apply the most-up-dated and latest Information and Communication Technologies combined Multimedia Applications through the channel of Vocational English. The major aim of the project  to refine vocational English in VET and to specify interactions, dialogues and intercommunication in sound, photo, video and digitalized formats to represent ESP. Tutors of the team have the strength to possess the VET orientation and knowledge while students' strength is to be able to utilize the modern multimedia tools as on their daily basis. Youngsters have a primary skill to gain knowledge by ICT but tutors have the secondary skill in the same theme. Tutors and stakeholders acquire and sort out the compulsory, authentic, thematic studies, and they are to select the original and life-like interactions. ESP such as Vocational English applies online platforms as they are spread by everyday use. Having learnt the acquired knowledge youngsters and their tutors as well should learn the time-bounding and time measuring techniques in infochange.  Participants of MEET via VET project take part in workshops, technical visits dealing with the following topics; - teaching techniques in filtering methods, scanning and skimming reading, - recording vocational dialogues, - identifying vocational language terms,- demonstrate creative learning activities, - operate smart techniques and put these applications into practice. Life-long learning is essential in the world of dynamic, ongoing changes to be able to answer the world of digital reality and virtual knowledge-based issues. The stages of traditional education have changed as education is interwoven by IT platforms which are popular with teens. In addition to this, it supports professional development in vocational training too.

In addition, the period is long enough for employers to see if the participant has what it takes to be taken on full time.  This means that the work placement can have two outcomes. The first being that the student will stay for a longer period of time, because they have gained employment at the company they did their internship (job shadowing) for. And the second being that the participant will return home with increased knowledge, experience, self-confidence, self-awareness, independence and an appreciation of Europe and European values and projects.

The training programme includes an internship in selected companies in the tourism and catering sectors, to acquire knowledge and skills within the sectors and compare the various professional techniques, and activities aimed at the inclusion and integration in the context and for the improvement of language skills and to better know the culture of the hosting country. The main expected results from the project include: the rise of the personal and professional skills of the students, and the promotion of key competencies related to the real exercise of active citizenship; increasing the employment potential of the participants, the introduction of innovative training methods as a complement to existing practices and pathways and the improvement of the educational level of technical and vocational schools, the development of relations between the transnational partners and the promotion of processes of cooperation and exchange of good practices between the partners involved, with a significant impact in improving the educational and vocational guidance.\r\nThe construction of a permanent network of transnational public-institutional organisations and not only, therefore, is one of the main objectives of the project and allows the exchange of experiences and best practices at various levels (technical excellence, best practices in educational policies and governance of the system). The Consortium, with this proposal, therefore, aims to give momentum to the internationalization of institutional relations and cooperation at European level. The opportunities for economic and social growth cannot be separated from the desire to create strong interdependence and synergy between educational and training institutions and strong partnerships with local and foreign business realities.\r\nThe project is, besides, implemented in an European context considering the European priority and thematic approached such as \"ECVET for transparency and recognition of learning outcomes and qualifications\" and is in continuity with the Leonardo da Vinci project TOI \"LEO quali-TC\" promoted by the Lead Partner in 2013 and currently in its implementation phase.

Norway is very similar to Scotland when it comes to fishing, climate, and the landscape surrounding the rivers. Norway has larger salmons in the rivers, but is nevertheless not in any way able to compete with Scotland when it comes to salmon fishing tourism.\r\n\r\nWe want to bring our students to Scotland to watch and learn about the ways in which the Scots manage their waterways in order to observe how they facilitate and organise for both the salmon and the fishing. We will also use two of Scotland\u2019s most well-known instructors, Gary Scott and Ian Gordon, as we enter the fly fishing instructor certification program. This certification is unique in that it is the only one to be found in such a course of study in the world, and in order to achieve immediate recognition for our certification in the world of fly fishing we depend on having well-known names associated with our academy. Gary Scott and Ian Gordon will assist in arranging our participation in seminars, conversations, and practical exercises with professionals in relevant areas within tourism and management in relation to salmon fishing in river Spey and river Tay.\r\n\r\nDuring the next 2 years, we wish to bring a total of 37 students and 6 teachers to the areas surrounding the 2 rivers for 2 weeks in spring 2015 and 2016. In the rivers, we will meet ghillies and the local biologists. We will also visit a large hatchery in river Tay.\r\n\r\nIn each of the rivers, the students will gain knowledge about how the entire system surrounding salmon fishing tourism is constructed. We imagine that this project will be the basis for future additional knowledge and competence in several of the students\u2019 subjects during their three-year studies in the sport-fishing academy. The main objective for this project is therefore to learn as much as possible from the Scottish way of meeting the same challenges related to salmon fishing as we see in Norway. This involves, for instance, river management, fishing rules, accommodation and hospitability, and marketing. \r\n\r\nIn the course of this project, the students will, besides the competence we are working to build up, participate in commercialised practical fishing, practice and develop their language skills, and expanded their contact network.

The project term is for two years (June 2014 to May 2016).\r\n\r\nThe need for these planned mobilities abroad is a result of the continuously converging European labor, training and educational markets.

An important factor for covering such needs are specialists and continuing education professionals with experience abroad, intercultural knowledge, labor market skills, and foreign languages. \r\n\r\nThus the project \u201cMoin Europa!\u201d supports not only apprentices but also continuing education professionals from the trade sector in pursuing and expanding their competencies in profes-sional, intercultural, language and regional aspects as additional qualifications during their foreign stay.  \r\n\r\nThese competencies will be achieved by the apprentices through an internship in a business venue abroad (and possibly supplemented by attending a vocational or language school locally). Here the educational goals will be agreed upon and an ECVET instrument will be signed. Both, the HWK as well as the host organization and the business venue make sure, through extensive support (continuous contact with HWK as well as a tutor and mentor locally) and evaluation (continuous process at the project and participant level through the use of guidelines, standardized questionnaires, logbook and checklists), that the participants achieve their planned goals and feel comfortable on site.

In 2015 we want to send 40 apprentices to the United Kingdom. The apprentices are part-time students who do an apprenticeship as a management assistant in retail business, in wholesale and foreign trade or office management assistants. In order to increase their business knowledge, intercultural experience and language skills the students attend an Intensive Course (PDP - Professional Development Programmes) that takes 3 weeks. In the courses they get an overview of British business and culture and an introduction to their specific areas of occupation and interest which can be built upon at a later stage. There are also excursions that have close relevance to the course topics. Their professional competences are developed through team work, communication and and oral presentations. During their stay at  British guest families and in London they gain insights in British life and culture and  improve their cross-cultural competence and understanding. After the course the students get the European College of Business and Management Attendance Certificate and the German-British Chamber Certificate (AHK London). Moreover, after successful completion of their final exams of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) in Germany they can acquire the Kaufmann/-frau International Certificate (KIC), which is fficially accredited by the German-British Chamber of Industry & Commerce (AHK) in London. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we want to enable and support companies and students to establish and maintain international business partnerships it is also necessary to qualify our educational staff to organize and develop European mobility programmes and partnerships and to teach our students language and intercultural skills in a modern way.

Proof of intercultural skills and experiences are gaining increasingly importance for the successful transfer into employment. This is especially true for the service sector and skilled craft and trade related sector as well - which are the occupations of our target group. But in cause of the socio-economic situation of our target group  those young people do face considerable obstacles when it comes to the acquisition of work experience abroad. There is considerable danger for them that this lack of opportunity and hence experience and key skills will result in a life defining disadvantage and / or exclusion regarding future job chances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn most cases, a stay abroad holds especially for young people with precarious socio-economic background the first opportunity to try and develop an indipendent lifestyle out of the framework of their family and social structures. Following the feedback of those who benefit from work related international exchange programmes, those youg people experience considerable personal growth, feel more empowered and more purposeful in regard of their vocational perspective than they felt before their departure. At the same time they felt more intercultural tolerant and more affirmative towards the European Project. In respect thereof the \"Leinen los!\" project is making an important contribution to the fight against ethnic, social and gender related discrimmination and towards the promotion of a european citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the context of the project 70 students of vocational schools  (age 18 - 29) who are in training for a cereer in skilled craft and trade or servcie jobs (i.e. baker, salesmen, confectioner, stylists, hairdresser, childcare worker) will be offered the opportunity for a month-long internship and work experience in Spain, Italy, Great Britain or Ireland. This is meant to give those young people the chance to acquire work related international and intercultural skills to facilitate an easier transfer into the domestic and european labor market.

During the first week of each training period the students benefit from a linguistic and cultural immersion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first year : a placement is proposed to the students in the classes of Administration and Sales of the European Section. They are aged 15 or 16 and will go for three weeks to Athlone in Ireland or Valencia in Spain, in 2015 and 2016.\r\n\r\nIt is a real advantage for these young people of 16, who change remarkably both personally and in their social behaviour.\r\n\r\nFor the second year: a placement abroad is proposed to the students of the Catering class, European section. They are aged 18.\r\n\r\nThey will go for five weeks to Londonderry in Ireland or to Huesca in Spain, in September and October 2014 and 2015.\r\n\r\nFor the second year: a placement abroad is proposed to the students in the Administration and Sales classes, European section.\r\n\r\nThey will go for three weeks to Athlone in Ireland or to Valencia in Spain, in October - November 2014 and 2015.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommon goals for all our schools in the Administration, Sales and Catering classes:\r\n\r\n- Capacity to adapt in a work team, despite differences in sex, culture or social origin.\r\n\r\n- Development of open mindedness and initiative.\r\n\r\n- Social and professional integration\r\n\r\n- Increased confidence and self-esteem\r\n\r\n- Learning vocational and language skills\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\nFor our students, learning a language and using it in the professional world is essential to continue studying. Mobility is beneficial for professional integration as the businesses value it. Our students experiment supervised mobility, which very often encourages them to do it again spontaneously and so the probability of working abroad is high.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of mobility are more than satisfactory, as follows:\r\n\r\n    -  Adaptability, analysis abilities, initiative\r\n\r\n    -  Greater confidence and self-esteem\r\n\r\n    -  Dealing with another language, culture, local gastronomy\r\n\r\n    - Ability to cope with a problem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe benefits of mobility can be immediate or delayed\r\n\r\nFor young vocational students, mobility enhances personal development as they benefit from very rewarding and challenging experiences.\r\n\r\nConsequently, they become more involved in their professional or learning project and they come out of it better and more experienced.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the students commonly experience two work placements abroad.\r\n\r\nWe intend to make training periods in European countries - Ireland or Spain- a more extended programme.\r\n\r\nMobility allows our students to have access to the European job market.", "http://www.foyle.eu", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA102-000665_2"], ["0NA", "GoEurope - wir bringen Berliner in Bewegung: Mobilit\u00e4t f\u00fcr Auszubildende, Berufssch\u00fcler, Absolventen der beruflichen Bildung, Referendare und Berufsbildungsexperten.", "Foyle International Ltd.", 702394.0, "15.7 % of all youths in Berlin are currently unemployed - considerably more than most regions of Germany. This difficult situation leads to the most essential goal of our project: improving the employability of young apprentices, students in vocational schools as well as recent graduates. We intend to achieve our goal by offering high-quality, custom-designed stays abroad for these youths - directly related to each participants' individual vocational background. We will collaborate with numerous vocational training centers in Berlin, the participants' training local companies as well as with the Chambers and the unions. Additionally we will improve the \"European competence\" of stakeholders in vocational training and other local institutions through knowledge transfer and will institutionalize this process by integrating these players into our project as project partners.

Most of them can draw on a network of hundreds or more internship companies. They are well connected with the vocational training centers and political institutions  in their respective regions. \r\n\r\nAs soon as the decisive parameters of a mobility flow have been defined together with the local training institution the project is actively promoted to the defined target group. As soon as the participants for a particular flow have been secured the partner organization in the host country is commissioned with carrying out the preparations for the flow. The quality of each flow is ensured by a number of measures, e. g. mid-term reports, evaluation meetings, accompanying visits and/or a preparatory visit. \r\n\r\nThe desired outcome of the stay abroad is always to improve the participants' employability (roughly 10 % of our participants even receive a job offer abroad), improved social integration of participants who are young parents, have a migration background or learning disabilities, improved proficiency in foreign languages as well as personality development. Furthermore, we intend to create excitement for the European Union in general amongst satisfied participants! All of them can be instrumental in internationalizing their educational institutions. Particularly by helping to create a functional network between the body responsible for the project and local partner organizations. \r\n\r\nOur network has been growing for nine years now and the long-term effects of our steady growth in terms of quality and numbers of participants are becoming ever more evident. By now 15 Berlin vocational training centers have already appointed an EU-Affairs Representative to manage their collaboration with us. Two vocational training centers now even offer vocational training courses with integrated mobility stays abroad. For our EUROPASS mobility ceremonies we are often honored to have undersecretaries of state personally handing over the certificates to our proud young participants.\r\n\r\nA development towards an innovation and internationalization cluster including our local, national and international partners is becoming ever more visible. Junior and Senior Management as well as EU-Affairs Representatives are exchanging experiences and inspiring each other in their efforts towards enhanced employability of the youth.\r\n\r\nLast but not least close to 500 youths come back home - excited about their mobility experience abroad.

This helps learners to achieve higher qualification levels which are crucial for a successful first step into the labour market or for career improvements. The EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people take advantage of the opportunities open to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET schemes are a particular focus of this commitment, and the Member States recently set a target of enabling 6% of all learners in initial VET to have completed a period of VET study abroad by 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through this project, the VET school(Escuela Profesional de Hosteleria de Jerez) aim to improve the quality of education and vocational training, giving a European dimension to the learning paths and thus providing the young participants the opportunity to test and improve their skills: professionalism in the specific areas of vocational education (hospitality, tourism promotion and management), cultural knowledge and linguistic preparation. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 strategy is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of a learning mobility internship abroad of 4 weeks for Level 1 students/ and a 3-month internship for 60 recent graduates from the Level 2 and 3 . The training programme includes an internship in selected companies in the sector of Hospitality industries and tourism, to acquire knowledge and skills within the sectors and compare the various professional techniques, and activities aimed at the inclusion and integration in the context and for the improvement of language skills and to better know the culture of the hosting country. The main expected results from the project include: the rise of the personal and professional skills of the students, and the promotion of key competencies related to the real exercise of active citizenship; increasing the employment potential of the participants, the introduction of innovative training methods as a complement to existing practices and pathways and the improvement of the educational level of technical and vocational schools, the development of relations between the transnational partners and the promotion of processes of cooperation and exchange of good practices between the partners involved, with a significant impact in improving the educational and vocational guidance.\r\n\r\nThe construction of a permanent network of transnational public-institutional organisations and not only, therefore, is one of the main objectives of the project and allows the exchange of experiences and best practices at various levels (technical excellence, best practices in educational policies and governance of the system).

The socio-economic changes have generated new problems (maladaptation, violence, behaviour problems, students migration).These, corroborated with the general decrease of learning motivation (although  the school has got outstanding results at the Olympiads on different subjects), as well as an increasing competitiveness among schools in attracting students (because of  funding per capita) and with growing demands from parents led to a slightly decreasing ranking of the school in the county (the results at the National Evaluation, less interested parents in enlisting their children in the school) In accordance with the satisfaction questionnaires applied to the parents, the students as well as the need questionnaires applied to the teachers, it has been concluded that the teaching, although scientifically proficient, is tributary to some unattractive traditional methods, centred on excessive information. The formal got has the precedence over the non-formal, there is a reticence to multimedia and IT because of the lack of experience of the teachers in this domain. That is why, in the European development plan there were established two major imperatives up to 2010: the   necessity of improving the teaching skills (through attractive and applicable modern methods, use of IT equipment and non-formal methods) and the educators\u2019 abilities of relating with others. Thus the alignment to the European educational standards is extremely necessary. Also the management needs to be oriented to leadership, to building a distinctive ethos of the school, to opening to community and creating a motivating environment for the employees. A placement mobility in a European country, with well-known proficiency, having as a partner an expert in the domain, represents a step forward to quality and internationalization. The objectives of the project are: increasing of the quality of the teaching and evaluation (didactic, methodological, psycho-relational and technical teaching skills), the ability of designing and implementing of modern managerial, educational and curricular strategies, developing of a modern and efficient leadership. North West Academy from Great Britain is an organization which grafts on our needs and objectives of institutional development (they possess professionalism, experience, tutoring; offer courses which cover all educational domains; organize placements according to individual and institutional needs) The project presumes the mobility of 8 people (7 teachers, each representing a different curricular department and 1 manager), who will carry on activities in placement units for 10 days. The selection of the participants will be transparent, with respect of objectivity and equality of chances for the teachers and the 3 school managers (external commission, 3 tests: evaluation of CVs, interview and language test). The project team will respect the stages of a project including the preliminary preparation. On agreement with the partner it has been established a detailed daily programme for the mobility for the teachers as well as for the manager which implies 8 tutors in the placement units and a tutor of NW Academy. The activity in three steps: assist \u2013 discuss with the tutor \u2013 apply is valid for each day of mobility. Participants will assist different activities: integrative activities, outdoor activities, lessons of different domains, using IT equipment and the interactive smart board, meeting the classes and the educational partners (in the case of the manager). At the end of the mobility tutors will evaluate the portfolios of the participants (they made while working in the placement unit) and will fill in an evaluation sheet, and the NW Academy tutor will send feedback questionnaires to the participants and the tutors. The host organization- NW Academy-complete certificates of participation to the mobility and of teaching competence. The expected results are: teachers able to use modern, efficient, attractive teaching and evaluating methods; multimedia and multi touch instruments; non formal methods, positive attitudes concerning tolerance, adaptability, flexibility, assertiveness.

By organising the work placement for at least three weeks in institutions of social work and youth welfare services and the intensive reflection it is guaranteed that the students gain more than just superficial impressions that might be based on prejudices.

In principle, Azubi-Mobil is open to trainees from all kind of different professions. In the project, we work according to the principles of ECVET. The orientation towards learning outcomes is thus a priority for all our partners. Therefore, in cooperation with the partners we have derived practically applicable, inter-professional and comprehensible units of learning outcome from specific job descriptions. These units are then used as the basis for the learning agreement and the contents of the internship. Clear rules for assessment and a quality-oriented documentation ( Euro pass) have been set up in order to ensure the quality of valid learning outcomes (MoU). Our service is perceived by both the trainees and the training companies (mostly SMEs) with very great esteem and consistently positive feedback.

It covers all aspects starting from occupational orientation and preparation, dual apprenticeship to qualifications earned at professional schools and master classes. The main focus lies on dual apprenticeship and vocational preparation. Dual training will take place for the following fields of occupation: specialist within the field of hotel management, specialist within the field of restaurant management, specialist within the field of catering industry, specialist within the field of hotel and restaurant industry and culinary chef. Also found under the same roof are the vocational college for the meatpacking industry which offers two fields of occupation - butcher and specialist within the field of meatpacking industry \u2013 as well as the vocational business and economics college which is widely known as a school of hotel management.

The apprenticeship syllabus shows a general studies based working experience for the first part whereas it intends a joined specialization plus demands a specific concentration for each individual apprenticeship type during the second part. The G 11 apprentices are being trained in class as well as at their training properties and companies (=dual system). Classes are being held en block meaning two blocks of five to six weeks per year. About 64 apprentices are being able to receive grants for this programme each year.\r\nTraining facilities and G 11 have to approve the application process.

A direct approach between all participating countries and partners is possible due to an excellent long lasting relationship and good standing to one another. The collaboration between instructors, trainers, trainees, apprentices, professors, agencies, chambers of commerce, governmental departments and social partners fosters content and organisational requirements.

In order to strengthen the motivation of learners and prevent Early School Leaving (ESL) the EU strongly fosters, in fact, the possibility of offering them the opportunity to have new flexible approaches based on Personal Learning Plans (PLPs) designed by VET staff (TEACHERS, TRAINERS, TUTORS) in collaboration with enterprises and the world of work. The tutor has, therefore, a crucial role, since he integrates the curriculum with skills that can be effectively developed within the enterprises and promotes their assessment, certification and validation in a European context and, therefore, in a framework of ECVET implementation.\r\nThe project therefore aims to achieve the following objectives:\r\n1) Develop flexible pathways linking the VET curriculum of formal education to the School and Work Alternation and the WBL carried out also in a European context;\r\n2) Improve the training offer proposed by the schools to learners, enhancing personal developments  and building projects of professional life;\r\n3) Enrich the learning acquired at school level by the learners with the acquisition of professional skills to facilitate their entry into the labor market;\r\n4) Promote the implementation of the ECVET tools and procedures to recognize and transfer the competences acquired in formal, non-formal and informal learning;\r\n5) Strengthen a NA and a EU network of VET schools, VET providers, public bodies, companies, associations and social partners, to foster their active participation to the School and Work Alternation and WBL paths.\r\nVU-BI-ELLE provides training courses according to the three different envisaged target groups:\r\na) PATH FOR SCHOOL TUTORS, lasting two weeks / 80 hours (a flow of 20 participants for each of the hosting countries, for a total of 120 participants). The contents of the training will include multimedia teaching; communication; the role of the school tutor; the relationship between the school and the company; the design and evaluation of flexible paths of Alternation / WBL.\r\nb) PATH FOR ENTERPRISES TUTORS, lasting 1 week / 40 hours (a single flow of 10 participants to MT). The training will include collaboration with the school in terms of defining the Alternation / WBL project; role; monitoring and evaluation of the learners\u2019 paths, even in a mobility context.\r\nc) PATH FOR NETWORK TUTORS, lasting 1 week / 40 hours (a single flow of 10 participants to ES). This path will be for the staff who comes from the world of vocational training and the third sector, which for years collaborated with schools in the management of projects for the construction of pathways and vocational qualifications, and who acts as a liaison between the school and the local context. The training will include collaboration with the school and the company in terms of defining the Alternation / WBL project; role; monitoring and evaluation of the learners\u2019 paths.\r\nThe partner organizations of the Consortium are all active in VET and are in direct contact with the target groups of the project. Therefore, in the long term, the project results will bring their obvious advantages, since they can be easily integrated into their daily work activities and training, improving the quality of VET. The innovative and flexible approach will undoubtedly increase the reputation of the partner organizations, having, these, the possibility to offer more attractive and flexible vocational education and training paths and in line with the expectations and needs of learners. The partners of the consortium will also benefit from an increased capacity and professionalism gained throughout Europe; at NA level other organizations / schools that pursue similar objectives of School and Work Alternation and flexible pathways of WBL will benefit indirectly from the project, since they will need to certify Alternation and WBL paths in the learners\u2019 Curriculum.", "http://www.foyle.eu", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IT01-KA102-004271_8"], ["6AT", "Adristorical Lands: promoting mobility for achieving excellence in Tourism and Culture", "Derry Visitor and Convention Bureau", 409395.0, "One of the central ideas underlying European Lifelong Learning policies is that international mobility should become a natural part of education and training schemes.

The best way to transfer such skills is through the use of experiences that encourage the learning by doing approach. Among these, a crucial role is played by learning experiences based on the Project-based Learning (PBL)  methodology and by the participation in transnational traineeships. Through PBL, which is a teaching method that organizes learning around projects, students gain knowledge and skills by investigating complex and real issues, carrying out tasks and developing project products. The transnational experiences carried out outside the friendly environment encourage the development of transversal skills such as adaptability and flexibility that are part of the skills required to develop an entrepreneurial attitude. Since several years, the members of the national consortium (ENAC, SCF, ENGIM VENETO) are trying to apply PBL methodologies within their centers, and they have recently decided to promote a joint project, based on this methodology, aiming at creating a network among several IVET centers by establishing a buyer-supplier relationship. In this way the centers engaged in the network will create products / services to be used by other network centers.\r\nThe mobility project EU gives you WINGS would like to interact with this joint project in order to combine the development of PBL methodologies and transnational mobility experiences addressed to VET students and staff. The specific objective of the project EU gives you wings are: a) to strength the competences of VET staff engaged in planning and managing learning processes using the PBL approach and through the exchange of good practices with other VET providers; b) to strength technical/professional and linguistic skills of VET students, as well as  improve their transversal skills through transnational placements carried out in a different economic and social context. This will allow VET students to develop innovation, creativity and responsibility that in the short term will support them in the planning and implementation of projects using the PBL approach and in the long run will increase their employability. \r\nTo achieve these objectives, the project promotes three types of mobility activities: 1)traineeship for IVET students in a company abroad for a period of three / four weeks; 2) traineeship for IVET students in a VET center abroad - with learning periods in companies or other organisations - for a period of two weeks; 3) job shadowing activities for staff members in other VET centers throughout Europe. The first two types of mobility activities will involve 210 students (in IVET pathways, 2^-3^-4^ year or within one year of obtaining their graduation), the third is addressed to 35 VET staff members. The project provides a wide sectorial and geographical coverage and will involve students, providers and partners from different economic sectors. The students involved in the project have different professional background: catering (15%), food processing (14%), administrative (25%), graphic (17%), well-being (23%), fashion (6%). In addition, the partnership have a significant geographical dimension both at national level (13 Italian regions) and European level (24 partners from 13 countries). The large number of foreign partners and the criteria used to select these institutions will assure VET students that the mobility experience is suited to their professional profiles and will provide VET staff with an extensive knowledge of PBL methodologies developed in the EU. The project envisages the use of ECVET tools in order to allow the exploitation and recognition of the learning outcomes acquired during the transnational mobility. To this end, the consortium will take advante of the experience of SCF and will use the ECVET tools developed by SCF during GORES and LET's GO projects.\r\nThe main results of the project will be a) a manual with the PBL methodologies and best practices seen by the staff during the job shadowing experiences; b) the creation of video/ multimedia materials concerning students\u2019experiences. \r\nThe project will have an impact on the development of professional and transversal skills of VET students and staff involved, as well as on the improvement of VET  training provision which will be possible thanks to the improvement in the use of the PBL approach and by strengthening the mutual trust among project partners.

The training programme includes an internship in selected companies in the social and social health, to acquire knowledge and skills within the sectors and compare the various professional techniques, and activities aimed at the inclusion and integration in the context and for the improvement of language skills and to better know the culture of the hosting country.\r\nThe main expected results from the project include: the rise of the personal and professional skills of the participants; the promotion of key competences connected with the exercise of real active citizenship; increasing the employment potential of the participants; the introduction of new training methods to complement existing practices and the improvement of the educational level of technical and vocational schools; the development of relations between the transnational partners and the promotion of processes of cooperation and exchange of good practice between the parties involved, with a significant impact on improving the educational and vocational guidance. The construction of a permanent network of transnational nature of public organisations and not only constitutes, therefore, one of the main objectives of the project and allows the exchange of experience and good practices at different levels (technical excellence, best practices in training policies and governance of the system). The Consortium, with this proposal, therefore, aims to give momentum to the internationalization of institutional relations and cooperation at European level. The opportunities for social and economic growth can not be separated from the desire to create strong interdependence and synergy between education and vocational training institutions and strong partnerships with local and foreign business realities. The project is, besides, implemented in an European context considering the European priority and thematic approached such as \"ECVET for transparency and recognition of learning outcomes and qualifications\" and contributes, in particular, to create a European area for lifelong learning in the social and social health sector.

The mobility of VET learners is aimed at recent graduates from VET schools aged between 18 and 28 years old (the participants will undertake their training placement abroad within one year of their graduation) and they will realize a VET training abroad in the general vocational field in the project called \"INTEGRATED RELATIONAL TOURISM\" that involves differente professional fields  related with tourism and promotion of cultural and enviromental heritage and provides a mobility project abroad to VET learners for a period of 16 weeks in the following countries : Spain, Portugal , Ireland, Greece, Malta, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Sweden, France , UK, Austria and Germany The integrated relational tourism is a particular kind of tourism named Relational Tourism and that goes beyond the traditional concept of supply and demand for tourism, focusing on interpersonal relationships and environmental promotion and stimulating the historical-cultural dialogue between enterprises and customers. The project also intends to devote interest to the assessment, validation and recognition of learning outcomes in vocational training courses and transfer of skills. The project was born from the collaboration of a large working group that has actively involved the transnational and national partnership. This Mobility project intends to be a privileged mean for the acquisition of new skills and knowledge in the professional field covered by the proposal , which could not be acquired in the usual training and in the economic environment of origin (the region of Sicily in the Southern part of Italy). The contexts of destination indeed stand out as unique experiential places, suitably identified by the partnership, with a strong innovative characterization and specificity in the integrated relational tourism. The primary objective is to make the project a strategic vehicle for territorial development according to the recommendations of the EU strategy for growth called \"Europe 2020.\" It requires the involvement of a strong multi-actor partnership at local level (with substantial institutional support). The project is characterized by a strong EU learning added value thanks to the identified countries of destination of mobility. The work placements will be made in structures operating in the integrated relational tourism identified by the proposed project located in the host countries. The project will provide a period of cultural and pedagogical training in Italy before the departure. In the host country the project provides a better preparation for the professional integration in the new social environment of the hosting country. The training abroad will be certified by receiving and sending organisations, thanks to the Europass Mobility document. We evaluate acquired new skills with the goal of empowerment of the participants involved in the project. It also provided a management plan with a strong quality control and evaluation phases throughout the lifetime of the project and a broad and enhancement strategy involving all the partners.

Hyria was established in August 2009 by merging seven vocational education institutions and adult education centers. Hyria operates in the rapidly growing Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Riihim\u00e4ki region which has nearly 90 000 residents, 34 000 jobs, and 5000 companies of which many operate internationally. \r\n \r\nThe development of international operations is very important to Hyria and therefore internationalisation is one of the focus points in its strategy and operations. Student and staff mobility have been identified as critical success factors in reaching the objectives set for international activities. \r\n \r\nThe aim is to increase our students\u2019 and teacher\u2019s professional and international skills by offering them a possibility to participate in international mobility programs. By enabling our students and teachers to acquire new skills and knowledge the quality of education increases as well as student\u2019s employment opportunities. At the same time, Hyria serves the needs of the area\u2019s working life by producing a highly skilled workforce. \r\n \r\nObjectives and expected results\r\n\r\nThe most important objective is the increase of students\u2019 professional skills, knowledge and attitudes by emphasizing the acquisition and development of key competencies of lifelong learning.\r\n \r\nThe exchange period comprehensively enables students to develop those key competencies which are needed for personal fulfillment and development, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment. During the exchange period students encounter new situations; apply already gained knowledge and language skills in practice; learn to use new technological solutions and platforms while communicating with their teachers, friends and family in the home country; and, compare working methods, the acquisition of technical solutions, the level of sustainable development and legislative issues in the host country.\r\n \r\nIn addition, students are able to develop international and personal capabilities such as cultural awareness, language skills, interpersonal skills, individual growth, independence and the ability to work in a multicultural environment. For teachers the project activities give a possibility to update their professional knowledge and understanding of current requirements of a working life.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of this project the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 professional identity gets stronger, and they are able to find out more field-specific professional development possibilities. It enriches the education in many ways and encourages students\u2019 to entrepreneurship and to learning languages. \r\n\r\nThe second objective is to continue the development activities of the mobility processes at Hyria. This time the development activities are focus on the following issues: \r\n- Facilitate the implementation of skills demonstration/competence tests abroad (create instructions, process flowcharts etc.)\r\n- Moving from short-term co-operation agreements to longer ones (MOU, LOI)\r\n- Building up a partner information database for improved information flow within the organization\r\n- Creating a centralized mobility process, instructions and orientation to teachers and staff members. \r\n \r\nMobility\r\n\r\nWith the help of the project, Hyria aims to reach its objectives for student mobility (10% of young students). The project comprises 8 1student mobility (for 4-15 weeks) covering 25 vocational qualifications. Principally exchange periods are offered to Hyria\u2019s second or third year students (young), but also to adult students and recent graduates. In addition to that we wish to send two special needs students for collecting experiences. Hyria would like to develop international mobility possibilities of special need students in the future. \r\n\r\nTeacher mobility is connected development of mobility activities (skills demonstration, ECVET) and visiting partners in Italy and Denmark.

In order to improve the feeling of \u2018being a European\u2019 an experience in a different country is a must. Not just a holiday, but a work placement, so that people can experience what the labor market has to offer in the rest of Europe. In the new Erasmus+ program it is possible for Vocational Education (VET) students to do a work placement a year after they have graduated. This is an golden opportunity to help those graduates gain work experience, as the current project \u2013Introducing EU Opportunities-  has shown. In order to improve the current project teachers will be included in this project as they are a primary source of knowledge for students and offer a perfect position to inform and encourage students about internationalization, The Project The idea of the project is to improve the current project \u2013Introducing EU Opportunities- and to introduce recently graduated VET-students and their teachers to the European labor market. The goals of this project are; Firstly, to improve the participants labor market perspective and career possibilities. Secondly,  to increase entrepreneurship and initiative. Thirdly, to boost the participants self-confidence, self-awareness and independence. Finally, to raise their intercultural awareness and create a more positive outlook on Europe and European values and projects. There are three outcomes behind this initiative: Firstly, mobilize graduated VET-students in Europe and make them go where there is enough work in their field.  There is a good chance they stay with the company that has a job offer.Secondly, introducing graduated VET-students to different work techniques and give them valuable work experience they can take back home in order to gain a better position in the local labor market. Thirdly, creating a modern viewed teacher when it comes to internationalization. This means that teachers will be open minded when it comes to the opportunities the European labour market offers to their students. The aim is that this positive outlook will reflect on the students and encourage them to take the step towards an international mobility. DetailsThe participants in this project will be recently graduated VET-students (max. 1 year), because they will not be aided by the schools and will most likely be a left over group. The beauty of this group is that they have no obligations back home (i.e. they do not have to make a school exam or worry about school guidelines) because they have finished their education. Making them the perfect group to explore the rest of Europe and experience firsthand the chances the continent has to offer. The work placement does not have to be a long one, it will last for two weeks. With a preference for two weeks if the participant does not speak the language of the destination country properly. This period is long enough for the participant to get a taste of Europe and decide whether they want to stay in the country they did their work placement or go back home and share their experience on the local labor market. In addition, the period is long enough for employers to see if the participant has what it takes to be taken on full time.  This means that the work placement can have two outcomes. The first being that the student will stay for a longer period of time, because they have gained employment at the company they did their internship (job shadowing) for. And the second being that the participant will return home with increased knowledge, experience, self-confidence, self-awareness, independence and an appreciation of Europe and European values and projects. By undertaking such an experience the participant are already improving their entrepreneurship and initiative taking. Therefore, this project will have a positive impact on its participants and the people involved whatever the outcome may be.", "http://www.foyle.eu", null, "erasmus_2015-1-NL01-KA102-008784_8"], ["0NA", "Opening the Paths for Student Mobility 2", "Foyle International Ltd.", 102909.0, "Opening the Paths for Student Mobility 2 (OPSM 2) is a two-year project. 77 students at Raisio Regional Education and Training Consortium (Raseko) perform their 5 - 10 weeks  work-based-learning period abroad.

The project has positive impact on language skills and confidence to work in new environment both for students and staff members. Every participant has to disseminate experiences at least inside the professional study field so that the knowledge of the international experiences and new competencies can be utilized in future.

However, the Agrupamento de Escolas Tomaz Pelayo also defends the principle that all students should have the opportunity of mobility, irrespective of their social or economic background, concerning the importance of these experiences, not only in technical and scientific learning but also in linguistic, cultural and social aspects.

In the medium term, the project also aims to facilitate the integration of mobility into national training systems, and also to promote the recognition of the knowledge and skills acquired during mobility through the attribution of valid credits. In this way, the project will contribute towards lifelong learning in the truest sense of the term, by ensuring that the resulting competence and enhanced employability will serve to reduce the risk of social and professional exclusion and, on the contrary, improve awareness of active European citizenship.\r\nThe participants selected will have clearly followed a training path relevant to the achievement of these objectives, but are currently facing difficulties as far as breaking into the job market is concerned. In order to remove this obstacle the participants need to acquire some form of competitive advantage, especially given the fact that the current scenario of socio-economic crisis in Europe is leading employers to further reduce the number of employees and, at the same time, make higher demands in terms of required qualifications. As a result, young people without access to a chance to develop key skills, to gain professional experience and to prepare themselves for entry into the market, may risk long-term unemployment or find themselves obliged to accept survival work which has nothing to do with their chosen career. In either case, this inevitably leads to frustration, and sometimes even to social and professional exclusion.\r\nTransnational mobility, promoted by a high quality project, creates added value in terms of employability by means of better language skills, not just for social integration but also for professional development, and by means of a clearer understanding of the European dimension of life and work in the future. Mobility brings citizens together, increases mutual understanding and tolerance and boosts confidence to face a world of instability, uncertainty and insecurity in relation to the near future. By providing valid, transparent, clearly-certified qualification which can be easily recognised by employers, mobility also increases the participants\u2019 levels of competitiveness and employability. \r\nThis project will therefore deliver a 13-week mobility programme for 70 young Portuguese citizens who have concluded vocational training, including those from disadvantaged social backgrounds. The project will include language preparation for all participants, adapted to their real communication needs, and will provide specific socio-cultural preparation so as to help develop intercultural competence. The language preparation organised by CEL will be teacher-led and will include the use of our own materials, specifically created for this purpose. At the end of the experience, the participants will be evaluated and given a language competence certificate issued in accordance with the C.E.F.R. for Languages and stating the contexts in which skills have been acquired. Following this preparatory stage, the participants will begin a 13-week work placement experience, seamlessly connected to their existing training path, certified in accordance with national vocational training legislation and clearly indicating the skills acquired and the performance level of each participant. Finally, these several forms of certification will be linked by Europass Mobility certification, clearly indicating to potential employers the content of the work placement and the knowledge and skills acquired, and will therefore demonstrate the capacity of the participant to take initiative in the construction of his own future career.  \r\nThe mobility experiences to be carried out under the terms of this project will occur between Sep. 2015 and June 2016 and will involve 21 partners from 8 member states of the EU, chosen for their proven competence in guaranteeing excellence in mobility and for their specialised knowledge of the specific professional sectors in which the participants wish to pursue their careers.

European Strategies", "North West Regional College", 108823.0, "This project is entitled 'Creative Resources Embedding Awareness Traversing European Strategies' (CREATES) which offers both staff teaching/training and  student mobility experiences in an expansion on a previously funded KA1 VET project called \"European eXperiences for Confidence in Skills and Employability\" (EXCISE) which was very much staff focused. This project progresses the College European Development plan from Phase 2 to Phase 3 on the 5 phase longer term plan.\r\n\r\nThe activities are aligned with the priorities and objects of the 'Smart, sustainable and Inclusive growth proposed in Europe 2020', the ET2020 report and the Rethinking Education communication that underlie the new Erasmus+ programme.  In total 5 curriculum areas across the College's 3 campuses have had input in to the activities for this project and have done so based on the needs of the demographic that we serve here in the North West of Northern Ireland, a region on the periphery of the UK, which yet again is on the periphery of Europe.\r\n\r\nThis College serves a region which has suffered greatly in the current economic downturn and the College catchment area has the highest unemployment claimant rates in Northern Ireland out of all the UK Regions. In January 2015 the Derry City Council (DCC) area had the highest unemployment claimant rates in NI at 5.4%, with Strabane 2nd and Limavady 4th highest (6.8%, 5.3%). The skills mix of the workforce is below the NI average. The DCC area has the youngest population in NI - 40% are under the age of 25.  \r\n\r\nSchool retention rates in the region are a challenge and the College provides bridging opportunities both in the College and community environment particularly to those in the 16-18 age category, with a strong emphasis on essential skills development in literacy, numeracy and ICT and development opportunities through apprenticeship programmes.\r\n\r\nStudents at level 2 and 3 within the college have to date been reluctant to take up placement opportunities overseas.  For many the decision has been based on personal backgrounds where an opportunity like that would be seen to be beyond their means and upbringing.  For others it would be based on a lack of confidence in themselves, the skills that they have acquired and their ability to build on them in a different environment. The majority of our student demographic would fall under the eligibility criteria for widening participation and those with fewer opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis project provides 9 Staff Training, 8 Staff Teaching/Training, 10 VET Traineeships in companies, 6 accompanying staff and 36 Traineeships in vocational organisations within the curriculum areas of Hospitality, Art & Design, Health & Social Care, Entrepreneurship and IT over a two year period. Our partners comprise of 4 vocational organisations and 1 Social Enterprise and are located in the Netherlands, Germany and Finland. The project will provide learning opportunities for all participants to gain wider experience in skills and employability mechanisms used in other countries with a focus on the the non-formal learning and work based learning environment. These activities have three main aims:\r\n1. Increase Employability and Life Skills which will contribute to competitiveness within the European economy.\r\n2. Increase training opportunities for VET learners to link skills from education and training to the needs of employers and the world of work.\r\n3. Update VET professionals' skills and know-how on their working practices and teaching methods.\r\n\r\nThe anticipated outcomes are exchange of learning on skills and employability opportunities that will better inform curriculum development, teaching methodologies and the student experience. For the student participants the opportunity to become role models for their peers within the College and wider community will be exploited to its full potential, to show that barriers only exist for those not willing to challenge the norm.

The program will take place from October to December (2015-2016) and from March to April (2016 and 2017).\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes for participants:\r\n\r\n- Getting a wider profile through the knowledge of a foreign language which will be very useful when entering the labour market.\r\n- Open their minds to new work opportunities by knowing other working realities different to those of the Spanish labour market. \r\n- Knowing how to use new technologies and different than those offered by Spanish companies.\r\n- Make a first experience of community workforce, contributing to his/her personal, social and professional development.\r\n\r\n- Improve knowledge of different cultures and languages of the host countries.\r\n- Get full qualification, acquiring the skills of the FCT (training period in a company) in a foreign company. When applicable.\r\n- Entering the labour market.\r\n- Remove the psychological barrier of fear of the unknown.\r\n\r\nWithin our organisation, we can foster the number of mobilities of people under training and improve their quality throughout Europe, so that there will be an increase in the number of companies that offer qualifying trainings.

For those students who are already certified, they will have a training project similar to the Erasmus+.\r\n \r\nWe can say that what is intended with these mobilities, both for students and for the teachers is:\r\n \r\n-         To improve professional skills.\r\n-         To enhance social skills through teamwork, taking benefit from multicultural and multilingual environments.\r\n-         To advance in the learning of the foreign language, applied to the technical and professional field.\r\n-         To foster an entrepreneurial spirit.\r\n \r\n \r\nFor our teachers, we also intend:\r\n-To increase our management skills concerning projects and international initiatives.\r\n-To increase our didactic resources by comparing other VET systems.\r\n \r\nIn the management of these mobilities, our three partners will be in charge of providing students\u2019 accommodation, their journey to the workplace, the follow-up of the training and the search for companies. Our school will be in charge of organizing the shortlisting of candidates, their preparation prior to the mobility, their insurance, and, of course, the follow-up and assessment which is needed to certify properly.\r\n \r\nIn order to do this, a shortlisting procedure will be done, and it will be based on three aspects: the students\u2019 academic records, their knowledge of the target language and the capability and positive attitude of both students and teachers to carry out the training. As it concerns teachers, we will also appreciate their active participation and involvement in the Erasmus+ project.\r\nAfterwards, there will be a preparatory period to organize the mobility, then, the training period will take place. During this period, the students\u2019 mentors, alongside with the welcoming country\u2019s mentors and the persons involved in the project in both countries, will carry out the follow-up of students. In the case of teachers, it will be the coordinator for Erasmus+ in our school who will assess their training.\r\n \r\nWe consider the participation in the project as beneficial for our students and teachers, and for our school and region in general. It helps us in the short and in the long run to increase our students\u2019 professional horizons, as long as they realise of the very possibility to work, not only in their own country, but also in any other country from the European Union. Finally, these projects help us to increase our educational offer and of course, the people from our region can have a very positive view of our educational centre.", "http://www.northwestacademy.net", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA102-014923_1"], ["0NA", "Boosting Employability: VET Traineeships in Europe", "Foyle International Ltd.", 68282.0, "Centre d'Estudis Sant Francesc is a VET school willing to improve the implementation of processes for better internationalizing its students.

To flank the achievement of these goals we aim to strengthen the competences of the professionals working in schools (particularly at the management level), so they can better aid the young learners to enter the European employment more successfully.An overriding objective of the project is to increase the integration of participants with a migrational background, who are young parents or who are disadvantaged learners into the work force.The following are the main activities we will offer the youths mentioned above:- internships abroad for the youths in their fields- project work abroad for the youths on topics related to participants' vocational fields A majority of the participating youths will be from the following fields: clerical occupations, media, hotel, gastronomy, carpenters/joiners.These main activities will supported by the following flanking activities offered to professionals and student teachers in vocational training centers in Berlin: - Advanced and further training abroad with the topic \u201cprofessionalizing the teacher\u2019s acting in the classroom on the European level aiming to better prepare students for the European job market\u201d.- Professional development training for school management staff regarding \u201cstudents with special needs\u201d.- Training for student teachers with the focus on \u201eLearning from the Best in Europe \u2013 enhancing methodical expertise!\u201d- Training for future school management staff: \u201cHow to successfully develop a vocational training school/institution\u201dOur GoEurope mobility network encompasses 30 different partner organizations in 10 EU countries plus Turkey. All of our partners are specialized in the professional execution of Erasmus+ (formerly Leonardo-da-Vinci)-funded learning stays for youths and professionals in the field of vocational training. The majority of our partners can tap into a network of a several hundred or even a several thousand potential internship companies. They are well connected with the vocational training centers and political institutions in their respective regions. As soon as the decisive parameters of a mobility flow have been defined with our local training institutions the project is actively promoted to the target group and participants are selected from the applicants. As soon as the participants for a particular flow have been secured the partner organization in the host country is commissioned with carrying out the preparations for the flow. The quality of each flow is ensured by a number of measures, e. g. mid-term reports, evaluation meetings, accompanying visits and/or a preparatory visit. The most desired outcome of the stay abroad is always to improve the participants' employability (roughly 10 % of our participants even receive a job offer abroad), improved social integration of participants who are young parents, have a migrational background or learning disabilities, improved proficiency in foreign languages as well as personality development. Furthermore, we intend to create excitement for the European Union in general amongst satisfied participants! All of them can be instrumental in internationalizing their educational institutions. Particularly by helping to create a functional network including the body responsible for the project and local partner organizations.Our network has been growing for ten years now and the long-term effects of our steady growth in terms of quality and numbers of participants are becoming ever more evident. By now 20 Berlin vocational training centers have already appointed an EU-Affairs Representative to manage their collaboration with us. Two vocational training centers now even offer vocational training courses with integrated mobility stays abroad. For our EUROPASS mobility ceremonies we are often honored to have Undersecretaries of State personally handing over the certificates to our proud young participants.A development towards an innovation and internationalization cluster including our local, national and international partners is becoming ever more visible, gaining more and more capacity to establish internationalization.Last but not least around 500 youths come back home every year - excited about their mobility experience abroad.

In the last few years, other vocational schools for social education joined the initiative. All the vocational schools participating in the programme provide state-recognised training for professional educators and those with other relevant professions.  This programme usually lasts for three years, and involves an obligatory internship, the length of which depends upon the requirements of particular schools and councils.Through practical work in social education the pupils should become familiar with different fields of work, and fully embrace practical working conditions in their field of education.  The participants should improve their knowledge, skills and competencies during the training process at school. The results of the internship in the hosting country will be certified and recognised by the sending partner \u2013 German schools or local councils. The learning outcomes will be applicable internationally, and all students will undertake the same exams as their colleagues who served an obligatory internship in Germany. Educators in Germany deal with children and youths with a migratory background on a daily basis. For example: in Berlin the number of kindergartens hosting close to one hundred percent of children with a migratory background is rising substantially. On the other hand, only a small number of educators are experienced in working with migrants or are migrants themselves. The goal of the project is to provide an opportunity for pupils from the aforementioned schools, and other pupils from a relevant educational field, to undertake their obligatory internship abroad. This should nonetheless be carried out according to the compulsory quality standards and educational requirements of the federal states, and recognised as a component of obligatory training.  The support from the Leonardo da Vinci programme should increase the number of pupils who complete their vocational education abroad.In addition to the specified and certified learning outcomes, further qualifications such as intercultural, language and social competencies ought to be acquired throughout the stay abroad.There is a special focus upon the experience of being a migrant, or \u00b4foreigner\u00b4, and working through the issues arising from such a perspective of oneself.This project proposal is addressed to 90 learners in vocational training plus 30 VET experts.", "http://www.foyle.eu", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002936_6"], ["7AL", "Stadt N\u00fcrnberg - Internationalisierung des Beruflichen Schulwesens", "NORTH WEST REGIONAL COLLEGE", 133903.0, "The overall goal of the City of Nuremberg is the europeanization and internationalization of its dual system of vocational training.

The facility sending such apprentices seeks to prepare prospective commercial foreign language correspondents, early childhood educators and medical professionals for the increasing qualitative demands of the employment market through a professional education based on an internationally oriented curriculum. Aspects of European integration and intercultural learning in both theoretical and practical phases of the education are of great importance. There are also high professional requirements for the skilled employees performing the training.  Continuous further education and qualification in this area are extremely important. The project's goals are to acquire language practice, to obtain specific expertise and methodical knowledge and to attain knowledge of socio-economic structures of the receiving country. Of equal importance is the expansion of social and intercultural competences through real work experience abroad and the critical examination of different cultural norms in the workplace and in education.  Excellent preparation of all apprentices for the European labour market is not only a mark of quality for the vocational education facility, it is also a fundamental improvement of apprentices' chances on the labour market at home and abroad.  Profile and number of participants: 31 apprentices and commercial foreign language, early childhood and balneotherapist / medical masseurs and vocational teaching staff. Commercial training participants have the chance to expand their acquired knowledge and skills in a practical setting during a stay abroad and enhance social and intercultural competences. The educational focus for early childhood instructor (kindergarten teacher) training is on enabling language development for children and young people, developing international thinking and expanding intercultural skills.  The exchange project for kindergarten teachers and balneotherapist / medcial masseurs is an interdisciplinary concept that brings together on a bilateral basis people from two different professional fields for two weeks in a training project.  Description of Activities: Stays abroad leading to successful completion of a concrete training module and professional experience in the international field will be conducted for periods of 2 weeks and 12 months between July 2016 and Spring 2018.

Since 2008, we regularly support approximately 100 individual assignments per year. In the year 2011, the mobility certificate for the target group of trainees (IVT) was awarded to our company due to the high quality of our activities. We are working very successfully as a nationwide pool project in the open -flow management. Continuously a high number of trainees is interested in our company\u2019s mobility program. Especially internships in English target countries (UK , Malta)are in high demand. Most of the participants come from the commercial and office sector, but also industry, tourism, hotel and catering services are common branches. In principle, Azubi-Mobil is open to trainees from all kind of different professions. In the project, we work according to the principles of ECVET. (ECVET award 2016)The orientation towards learning outcomes is thus a priority for all our partners. Therefore, in cooperation with the partners we have derived practically applicable, inter-professional and comprehensible units of learning outcome from specific job descriptions. These units are then used as the basis for the learning agreement and the contents of the internship. Clear rules for assessment and a quality-oriented documentation ( europass) have been set up in order to ensure the quality of valid learning outcomes (MoU). Our service is perceived by both the trainees and the training companies (mostly SMEs) with very great esteem and consistently positive feedback. For the majority of the participating sending companies (each having 1-2 trainees) the effort of organizing an individual mobility application would be too high. In addition, many companies confirmed individual competence increase on the part of the trainees. Hence, the opportunity to participate in a mobility program during the company training has now become a very good marketing tool for the companies. Quality, evaluation & recognition of achieved learning outcomes are not only important features in the context of European priorities (ECVET) but they are also the basis for VET mobility to become an integral, integrated part of operational training with corresponding \"training\" quality. Thanks to the positive feedback from our participants, many training organization send on a regular basis trainees with our help abroad. In addition to the application management, we have a very good European network of partner institutions that support us in the active organization and supervision in the destination country. This is necessary, since 80 % of our trainees do not have any contact to receiving companies in the desired hosting country. Together with our partners we organize tailor-made internship positions, take care of travel and accommodation, carry out administration & project management, ensure the proper documentation (Europass, contract, learning agreement) and are for the whole period of mobility available as personal contacts for the trainees.Due to the IVT mobility a growing interest among the training staff (VET staff) arose to get to know the vocational training systems and the receiving organizations of their trainees. Since 2012, we now organize parallel to the trainee program study visits for the target group training staff.Our trips for training staff are just as much in demand as IVT-mobilites.

The vocational training must respond to this development with its interface (function) role bitween the education and employmentsystem. Therefore, the internationalisation of our three vocational colleges (1550 students) is an important goal in the school's development. A learning abroad/internship in other European countries is a particularly effective tool for the students. Especially the importance of vocational education for the social development and the professional  perspective of each individual (every student) is undisputed. To gain intercultural experiences and skills while in school education, to deepen knowledge of foreign languages and to secure a head start when entering the profession is becoming increasingly important for many students. Furthermore, a learning stay abroad encourages andboasts the self-confidence and strengthers the emotional stability.Participants: Per year, of the three vocational colleges, 94 students, 6 teachers/educational staff of the project group and 2 accompaying persons can apply for a scholarship. The students undergo an initial training/schooting with advanced professional knowledge in the following branches: Social & Health System, Nutrition & Home, Medien & Communication (Design Technical Assistant-GTA), the technical school of social work - social education.Activities: The students will complete a four-week intenship with project partners. Health/social/education branch:e.g. childrengarden, special scholls or facilities for disabled people in Finland/Sweden/Denmark. Facilities in Northern Europe especially  practise innovative approaches in the areas of early intervestion, education and inclusion. Countries in Northern Europe promote and practise the early intervestion and inclusion more professionally than other European countries. Medien & Communication (GTA branch): Many countries are very open-minded towards the social media and multimedia education. The GTAs get to know the future-oriented and innovative practises and new techniques through the project partners. They get introduced to the independent project management. The project partners define the project work in advance.Project implementation: The project group of the vocational colleges is responsible for organising the stays abroad. Appropriate project partners in European countries are build up, contractual frameworks (fixed contact, learning agreement/project agreement, support, language course, valuation) are defined. The information seesions for students/parents is followed by the application. The students are selected through an application process. Then preparation seminars follow.

Following the stay abroad the students prepare completion reports and an assessment/evaluation is done. Public relations (press releases, school website, presentation at an open house) complete the project.Results: The students will gather knowledge and experience of other cultures, peoples , nations and behaviors. They can compare the working and living environment in the European area . They will expand their intercultural and social competences and strengthen their own cultural identity. The students will be able to make a more accurate picture of their professional career . The professional perspective is improved and the choice of professional is strengthened.

An essential part of the strategy is the iMovie project (of which the Region is lead partner) aimed at creating a network of \"multi-stakeholder platforms\", public-private partnerships that coordinate mobility flows in and out in a given territory or sector. The strategy counts several Erasmus+ ongoing projects: IeFP+; ITS +; Tecnhnet2020 and ESF projects such as: ITS Europe and Mobility 2020.The project Moving Generation 2020 is part of this development plan, and it gives 130 students enrolled in the fourth year of VET schools in Emilia Romagna, the possibility of doing a 3 weeks internship in line with their study programme in another European country. The students are attending VET schools to obtain a level EQF4 qualification. This target allows maximum capitalization of the experience because students possesses the necessary technical and second language skills to work in a foreign company and reach the learning outcomes expected during the three weeks.OBJECTIVESThe overall objective of the project is to enhance the employability of participants by improving their technical and professional skills in the leading sectors of the regional economy (manufactory and tourism), and soft skills such as: learning to learn, interpersonal skills, cross-cultural, linguistic, and personal autonomy, initiative, problem-solving approach to the workplace, which are the most requests from local companies strongly oriented to foreign markets.ACTIVITIESAfter a phase of information and selection, participants will receive a thorough preparation delivered by schools and Uniser which will cover not only the language aspects but also: practical information, culture, safety at work, adapting to a foreign country and the work environment. Each participant will sign a learning agreement which will specify the objectives, learning outcomes, practical information on the internship\u2019s organization and tasks.During the period abroad, participants will be followed by a tutor in Italy, from a tutor in the country of destination, and a company tutor who will guide them in the learning process. Participants will disseminate their experience though the Uniser\u2019s blog and social medias, this will facilitate the communication peer to peer among young people. Website and social medias will also be used to disseminate the projects\u2019 results and promote the calls for applications to participate in the project.Particular attention will be paid to train teachers in schools how to implement mobility projects and apply ECVET. Two training sessions will be arranged through the project specifically addressed to them. Besides, accompanying persons will be the same teachers, who will have the opportunity to verify the quality of placements in person, and get to know the European partners. This will facilitate the recognition of competences through ECVET and will set the basis for future collaborations in follow-up projects.VALIDATION AND RECOGNITION SKILLSBack to Italy, a follow-up phase will be organized to capitalize the mobility experience thus allowing participants to take full advantage of the internship abroad. Furthermore, the competences acquired by the participants will be recognized thanks to Europass Mobility tools and ECVET. The internship abroad will be recognized as the regular curricular internship foreseen in Italy. Participants will receive the Europass Certificate Supplement together with the qualification in order to give them more opportunities to find a job in the European market. MG2020 will also test the use of Open Badges, an innovative tool for the recognition of competences acquired through non-formal and informal education, which is being developed in the Erasmus+ KA2 project \"European Badges Alliace\" coordinated by Uniser .IMPACTThe project strengthens the cooperation between the main actors of VET sector in a public-private partnership, with the aim of integrating and improve local policies for the achievement of the objectives foreseen in the 2014-2020 programmes, and at the same time attracting private funding for the future, which is the most sustainable way of supporting European mobility.", "http://www.foyle.eu", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-005023_3"], ["0NA", "Roaming", "Foyle International Ltd.", 106691.0, "The project\u2019s aim is to improve personal, civic, cultural and professional growth of the students, through a training path abroad.

The EESC also stated that there is a need of improving the recognition of competences gained abroad and training educators to do this.IGS is working since many years for improving the sense of entrepreneurship in young people through the project \"StudentLab\" carried out in the school of the consortium. The project \"Love4Tourism: Learning Outcomes Via Exchange for Tourism\u201d takes the entrepreneurship education carried out at school into a European dimension, by offering 100  students the possibility of doing a 3-week curricular internship abroad in companies of the touristic sector, in order to develop competences and observe the entrepreneurial models applied abroad. The students attend the 4th year of studies, this allows a maximum capitalization of the experience because they have good knowledge about technical subjects and a basic language skills.OBJECTIVESThe project\u2019s general objective is to foster employability and sense of entrepreneurship of the participants through the acquisition of key and professional competences to successfully achieve the qualification, and specialize further or integrate smoothly into the labor market, perhaps even starting their own business. The project also aims to:- Making mobility a reality of the educational system in Naples;- Increase the attractiveness of technical and vocational education;- facilitate the recognition of gained competences through ECVET;- Strengthening and structuring regional partnerships towards the creation of a consortium for VET mobility  in Campania.ACTIVITIESAfter a first phase of information and selection, the participants will receive a thorough preparation which will cover not only the language aspects but also: practical information, culture, safety at work, adapting to a foreign country and the working environment. Each participant will sign a learning agreement which will specify the objectives, learning outcomes, practical information on the internship\u2019s organization and tasks.During the period abroad, participants will be followed by a tutor in Italy, a tutor in the country of destination, and a company tutor who will guide them in the learning process. Participants will disseminate their experience though a website, a blog and social medias, this will facilitate the communication peer-to-peer among young people. Website and social medias will also be used to disseminate the projects\u2019 results and promote the calls for applications to participate in the project.Particular attention will be paid to train teachers in schools on how to implement mobility projects and apply ECVET. Two training sessions, specifically targeted to them, will be arranged throughout the project. Besides, accompanying persons will be the teachers, who will have the opportunity to verify the quality of placements in person, and get to know the European partners. This will facilitate the recognition of competences through ECVET and will set the basis for future collaborations in follow-up projects.VALIDATION AND RECOGNITION SKILLSBack to Italy, a follow-up phase will be organized to capitalize the mobility experience thus allowing participants to take full advantage of the internship abroad. Furthermore, the competences acquired by the participants will be recognized thanks to Europass tools and ECVET.

The Europe 2020 strategy asks to member states to renew their Education and Training systems in order to facilitate the acquisition of competences for young people, with particular reference to key competences and soft skills which are critical for a smart growth and a knowledge society. Furthermore, these competences contribute to improve the employability of young people as they are getting essential for the internationalisation of companies.

Regarding this aspect, the Region Umbria is supporting the introduction of a systemic approach on European mobility for VET students in upper secondary schools, aiming at integrating mobility in the curricula and encouraging local actors to collaborate to achieve this goal together, by implementing networking strategies and economies of scale.\r\nUmbriaNet is the first result of this approach. The project will offer the opportunity to live a three-weeks work-based learning experience abroad to 120 students from upper secondary schools in Umbria. The participating schools believe that mobility should be an integrated part of the VET courses they offer, therefore they will recognise and validate the competences acquired abroad by students making use of the Europass instruments and ECVET. Thanks to UmbriaNet, the participants will gain competences in cutting-edge sectors of the regional economy such as tourism and manufacturing industry, as well as key competences/soft skills like learning-to-learn, relational, intercultural and language skills, autonomy, entrepreneurship, problem solving, understanding of the workplace environment: all skills mostly required by companies nowadays both in local and european labour markets.\r\nThe UmbriaNet consortium is formed by upper secondary schools, and the Region Umbria itself (the highest policy-maker in the territory), Uniser (a cooperative with 18 years of experience in learning mobility) and it is coordinated by Itaca which represents the link between education and local companies. In fact, Itaca is a consortium of 26 businesses which coordinates different educational activities in local schools. As for the European partners, the project involves 7 partners in 7 countries: Cyprus; France; Lithuania; Poland; Slovenia; Spain; Uk. All partners have shown competence and reliability in previous projects, always providing working experiences in line with the training course/sector of participants, which improves the chances for immediate employability after the qualification.\r\nAfter an information and selection phase, participants will benefit from a thorough preparation, covering language issues, practical organisation, cultural aspects, safety in the workplace, adaptation to a foreign country and to the foreign working environment. Each participant will sign a Learning Agreement, specifying learning objectives, expected results, logistic and organisational details of the work experience.\r\nDuring the project, beneficiaries will be followed by a tutor in Italy, a \u201clogistic\u201d tutor in the country of destination, and by a company tutor who will guide them through their working experience. There will also be a tutor in their schools who will answer all their questions before the departure. Upon return, a follow-up meeting will take place with the support of the schools to make participants reflect on the experience, update their CV and make the most out of their Erasmus+ experience.\r\nUmbriaNet will improve the employability of 120 young people and have an impact on the local educational system. In fact, the project will increase the competences of staff in schools, in order to make mobility easier and more accessible also for those schools that would not have enough resources to deal with it alone. \r\nLast but not least, UmbriaNet represents the beginning of a public-private partnership, aimed at improving local VET policies and achieve the objectives of the 2020 strategies.

International cooperation is a priority area for the school. The school\u2019s main values are formation, human compassion and involvement. By participating in this mobility project, where cultural activities, going to school in a foreign country, staying with foreign families and work in relevant institutions are ingredients, we think that the students will be positively exposed to these values. The general part of the National Curriculum describes how education should contribute in developing the different sides of each human. The content of the mobility project covers this basic principal, which expresses a wide view on education and formation.This year, 2016, 10 students and 4 teachers from the Building and Construction department and 1 teacher from the department of Early years (Children and Young) are going abroad. The next 2 years, it is applied for 60 students and 16 teachers to get the same possibility. In addition, two teachers from other departments will follow language training and will have the opportunity to look for projects that can suit their respective curriculum areas.There are several goals for going ahead with the project. The main goal is to increase the students\u2019 occupational and social skills. By attending courses in a vocational school and a language school, visiting firms within their own vocational areas, interacting with Northern- Irish youths through cultural and social activities and by staying in a private Northern-Irish home, we will strive to reach the goal.The students from the Building and Construction department attend practical classes at North West Regional College and they get English lessons at Foyle International. In some of their practical classes, the students are introduced to bricklaying, painting and wall- covering. These are highly relevant areas, but in which we have low competence in our school.The students at Healthcare and Early Years will partly attend classes at NWRC and partly have training in institutions that are covering their curriculum areas. Some afternoons and / or weekends, the students go on excursions to different spots of historical or cultural interest. Furthermore there will be arrangements like football matches, cinema etc.The base for the students\u2019 evaluation of the project is the planning, tests, interviews, in-depth tasks, reports and presentations. Some of this work will also give a base for the students\u2019 grades.We think that the project will strengthen our students as future participants in an international job marked. Participating in international projects will contribute to make them more confident in what they might meet in their future working life. Having an international perspective will increase the quality of the education.By attending the mobility project and through the learning processes attached to the preparations and evaluation parts, the students will have an insight in the practice of their vocation in another culture. They will also get an understanding of the culture when they stay with Irish families.When the students stay two weeks in an English-speaking environment, they will get some experience with using the English language that will give them an advantage in their further education.

International cooperation is a priority area for the school. The school\u2019s main values are formation, human compassion and involvement. By participating in this mobility project, where cultural activities, going to school in a foreign country, staying with foreign families and work in relevant institutions are ingredients, we think that the students will be positively exposed to these values. The general part of the National Curriculum describes how education should contribute in developing the different sides of each human. The content of the mobility project covers this basic principal, which expresses a wide view on education and formation.This year, 2016, 10 students and 4 teachers from the Building and Construction department and 1 teacher from the department of Early years (Children and Young) are going abroad. The next 2 years, it is applied for 60 students and 16 teachers to get the same possibility. In addition, two teachers from other departments will follow language training and will have the opportunity to look for projects that can suit their respective curriculum areas.There are several goals for going ahead with the project. The main goal is to increase the students\u2019 occupational and social skills. By attending courses in a vocational school and a language school, visiting firms within their own vocational areas, interacting with Northern- Irish youths through cultural and social activities and by staying in a private Northern-Irish home, we will strive to reach the goal.The students from the Building and Construction department attend practical classes at North West Regional College and they get English lessons at Foyle International. In some of their practical classes, the students are introduced to bricklaying, painting and wall- covering. These are highly relevant areas, but in which we have low competence in our school.The students at Healthcare and Early Years will partly attend classes at NWRC and partly have training in institutions that are covering their curriculum areas. Some afternoons and / or weekends, the students go on excursions to different spots of historical or cultural interest. Furthermore there will be arrangements like football matches, cinema etc.The base for the students\u2019 evaluation of the project is the planning, tests, interviews, in-depth tasks, reports and presentations. Some of this work will also give a base for the students\u2019 grades.We think that the project will strengthen our students as future participants in an international job marked. Participating in international projects will contribute to make them more confident in what they might meet in their future working life. Having an international perspective will increase the quality of the education.By attending the mobility project and through the learning processes attached to the preparations and evaluation parts, the students will have an insight in the practice of their vocation in another culture. They will also get an understanding of the culture when they stay with Irish families.When the students stay two weeks in an English-speaking environment, they will get some experience with using the English language that will give them an advantage in their further education.

However, the Agrupamento de Escolas Tomaz Pelayo also defends the principle that all students should have the opportunity of mobility, irrespective of their social or economic background, concerning the importance of these experiences, not only in technical and scientific learning but also in linguistic, cultural and social aspects. Thus, and given the economic situation of the Ave Valley region, most of these students would never have the opportunity to train abroad and live such an enriching experience.    The qualification of human resources and the guarantee of certified professional skills are the current requirements of a society marked by globalization and by scientific and technological progress. Therefore, school must provide an effective response in terms of education and training.Our EDUCATIONAL PROJECT, on page 39, defines \u201cthe transnational mobility as one of the strengths of our educational policy, particularly regarding Trainings\u201d targeting our students in Vocational Courses and \u201clong term local, regional or national partnerships, and more recently international ones, with multiple scientific, political, cultural, social and business institutions\u201d.

Be able to take advantage of previous pedagogical projects and the disseminate information to partner organizations. And also strengthen multi-professional and entrepreneurship skills for both students and teachers. 8. Establishing the international study path and especially the optional course of international studies via long training periods abroad9. Developing an evaluation questionnaire, in order to further develop international studies and thus better meet the needs of students and working lifeWhere and when?The length of student exchanges is usually between 30-60 days, and staff exchanges one week. We aim at carrying out the staff exchanges simultaneously with the student exchanges, so that the students will receive support and guidance also from their home country when doing their international exchange. The exchanges will take place between autumn 2016 and spring 2018. The length and timing depend on each field (and also each individual student), curriculum and schedule. The exchange period abroad will be fully taken into consideration in the student\u2019s degree. This is possible thanks to the international study path. The teachers and other staff members will receive a report of participation. The target countries and the schools, as well as other partners in them, have been chosen so that they support the strategic alignment of Turku Vocational Institute. The partners act responsibly and they have understanding about the Finnish educational system. They are also interested in developing the possibilities for exchanges in co-operation with Turku Vocational Institute. The target countries have been selected from different parts of the European Union.Results 1) establish the course of international studies as part of international study path in as many fields as possible.2) create a Webropol-based questionnaire, which will provide us with information that helps us to further develop our international dimension.3) connect pedagogical projects of Turku Vocational Institute to international exchanges and thus create synergy.4) support multi professionalism and entrepreneurship, which are considered to be key elements in today\u2019s working life, for students as well as staff members", "http://www.nwrc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FI01-KA102-022486_10"], ["7DF", "EUROVOUZELA 3", "North West Academy of English", 85548.0, "Escola Profissional de Vouzela (EPV) started its activity in Ocotber 1991, being exclusively dedicated to teaching and Professional training of youngsters, having graduated already around 5000 youngsters and young adults.The lack of specialized labor in hospitality in the region and the high number of students who left (and leave) early school justified its creation.

Indeed, crafts and companies are now dealing with international exchanges and facing a multinational competition. Qualifications and skills are therefore put into question. In order to contribute to this expansion, it is primordial to provide each apprentice with the possibility to be trained and to work on a European level. It is our duty to offer our learners such a training. Compagnons du Devoir have always given priority to a long life learning and have performed to value on-the-job learning and mobility, mainly through shared experiences, human relations and knowledge transmissions. Long term mobility projects (1 year) have always existed in our association. It is part of our \u201cTour de France\u201d to have a one-year experience abroad. Since 2011, it has become compulsory and more than 5860 of our young professionals have benefitted from such an experience.Since 2004, almost 14100 apprentices have therefore benefitted from a 3 week mobility project in European Union, with 22 countries, owing to our trusted partners. Our experience now allows us to choose our best partners to provide our apprentices quality trainings in any of our 29 trades (industry, construction, building, baking, leather and textiles trades). For 2016-2018, we wish to send again more than 1000 apprentices in gathered mobility projects together with their class and their trade teacher (77 teachers in total), 140 apprentices for a long term (one year), 105 apprentices in a technical training for 2 weeks and 6 trainers for job-shadowing.In September 2009 we managed to officially join in the learning annex of the apprenticeship contract the 3 week mobility project abroad for all our level 4 apprentices. The enhancement of the quality of our project is owing to the developed teaching skills of our partners, who suggest a precise programme compatible with our apprentices\u2019 modules in France, with the specificities of the host country. This approach brings a value to our programmes in France and comforts the employers of our apprentices, worried about this mobility project abroad of their employee. The project will allow our participants to acquire language, intercultural and cross-disciplinary skills. Indeed, apprenticeship and trades are different from one country to another. Travelling is also a way to develop its adaptability and flexibility, two qualities required in the labor market. Our partners involved in our projects are training organizations, companies, social partners, consular chambers and intermediate organisms in 22 countries.

On the one hand, we are referred to as the \"vocational school\", on the other hand, we try to practically prepare our graduates for self-dealing on the labor market in such a way, so as not to let out another unemployed into the labor market in Western Pomerania, where the unemployment rate at the end of the year 2015 was already around 13% and among this there were 11% of young unemployed under 25 (WUP Szczecin).Given the current situation in Poland, but also in Europe, and rather distant visions of any improvement in the situation of young people that only now enter the adult life, we would like to take steps aiming at improving the quality of vocational education in Szczecin, but also in the whole country and restore reputation and good name of practical vocational education as the one that is best to save their graduates from unemployment. In our opinion, but also according to the guidelines of the European Commission, as evidenced by the allocation of greatest funds for the reconstruction of that education and its popularization, since only in the context of science and practical work the needs of the sector can be best understand and best answered. In line with the ERASMUS + VOCATIONAL TRAINING, we want to make as many contacts with entrepreneurs and employers, since they will decide on the employment of our future graduates, so working with them can show us any gaps existing in our education system (in the context of what we can change notwithstanding the core curriculum), which are necessary to patch, in order to ensure a better chances of employment to our students.The project provides for internships trip to the UK for top 40 students of third year in September 2016, and another group of 50 people, also selected among the students of third year in September 2017 in order to give some kind of continuity to apprenticeship outings at our school.When it comes to the needs of the target group of the project, that is the students of our school, the project is an attempt to reconcile them with the core curriculum of vocational training, which must be carried out. Of course, writing a project for our students, we primarily mean:- To facilitate them to create their own career path, by showing various models and standards of work in the tourism, logistic, economic and publicity sectors- Providing students with first professional experience in the sectors in which they will probably pursue their careers- Enhancing the attractiveness of our graduates as employees in the labor market after the completion of the education, thanks to undergoing professional, foreign internship- Improving their language competences in a working environment.At the present stage, we invest our work primarily in our students and in their future, because here we see the greatest need, but apart from that, that the greatest benefits will flow to the students from participation in this project, the school will also gain. First of all, we engage our participants mobility to hold meetings with the other students in the school, to encourage them to work and seek the opportunity to go on an internship abroad. Thanks to that we count, that the increase of motivation will indirectly raise academic performance. Then, after their return from internships, we will engage our students in group work with students who have not gone, to tell them or their experience. In addition, we will organize a meeting with other students in other schools, as well as candidates to our school during the open days for junior high schools, so that the mobility participants could describe their experience during internships and promote the school, and also their future professions..At this stage, the team gains primarily on the implementation of the project, because it teaches how to prepare, and how to implement the project in accordance with the new standards. Moreover, it establishes international contacts with partners from the sectors in which the school is educating, it begins to build its image of an institution, which is familiar with the European projects and is growing rapidly in this field.

Zesp\u00f3\u0142 Szk\u00f3\u0142 Spo\u017cywczych sees the problem of leasing school before its completing and a problem of unemployment among Young people. That is why the school carries out projects which aim at solving these problems and the solutions are part of the European Plan of School Development and are consistent with Strategy \u201cEurope2020\u201d and Strategy of Silesian Voivodeship 2020. Our students at the age of 17-20 are a target group of our two-year project.  There will be two groups of students who will take part in a work placement in Northern Ireland. The first group will consist of 17 students \u2013 cooks from our technical school and two teachers. The second group will consist of 20 students \u2013 cooks from a technical and vocational school and two teachers. Participants of the project will be chosen in a recruitment process. Marks in vocational subjects, English will be taken into consideration. Preparing stage is a very important element of the project. Its aim is to prepare our students to participate in a one-month work placement. Students will participate in an English course, psychological workshop and vocational workshops. Our students will have their work placement in Londonderry in Northern Ireland. Students work traineeship will last for four weeks and they will stay with their Irish host families and work at Irish employers. On Saturdays students will participate in on-day trips to cultural or historical places organized by NW Academy.When we accomplish our project concerning students mobility not only the direct participants will benefit from it but the whole school community. Good Practices Day which is a new initiative in our school which was initiated during a project will serve as a tool to disseminate the results of the project. The initiative will enhance the integration of local school community including students and teachers from vocational schools in our town, employers, and local authorities. It will be a new tradition of constant meetings for vocational environment, local employers and local authorities. The results of the projects will be published on school internet website. The local media will be certainly interested in Good Practices Day.", "http://www.northwestacademy.net", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PL01-KA102-024554_1"], ["7DF", "Pr\u00e1cticas Erasmus+ para estudiantes y profesores del CPIFP Bajo Arag\u00f3n", "North West Academy of English", 23002.0, "By means of this Students and Teachers Mobility Project for learning reasons, CPIFP Bajo Arag\u00f3n from Alca\u00f1iz, aims at improving its educative offer providing formative training in EU companies, more specifically in Londonderry (United Kingdom), Bayonne (France) and Lavelanet (France). Our students in Advanced-level VET courses have been offered Erasmus training period for many years, and it is now our intention to consolidate this training opportunity to Intermediate-level students too, making use of Erasmus+ grants both for teachers and for students in vocational training. In this sense, the Erasmus+ official announcements from 2014 and 2015 have provided us with a useful feedback in the management of these projects. We intend to carry out training mobilities in companies for a period 5 weeks. Altogether, we have ten students, four from them will go to Londonderry, three of them to Bayona and the rest of them to Lavelanet. They are students of Intermediate VET courses in the technical fields of Cars Maintenance, Electrical Installations, IT networks, and Health Care. In theory, our students from Business Administration cannot have access to these grants, they would only be able to access in case the organization company they go with did not carry out their mobility.Due to the characteristics of the partners in our welcoming countries, Bayona\u2019s partner, who belongs to a VET-friend-school, can take in students from Car Maintenance. Lavelanet partner, another VET-friend-school can take in students from Electrical Installations, Health Care and IT. Londonderry\u2019s partner, on his part, is an intermediary partner who can take in our students from all the technical fields. We also intend to carry out 6 training stays of five days each for our teachers, 4 of them in the job-shadowing modality and two for take our students. For these stays, we rely on the collaboration of our three partners. We expect to achieve a double aim with these teacher mobilities: on the one hand, we would like to learn more about the Erasmus+ management from our partners, and on the other hand, we would be grateful to see how the teaching process is done in other countries. Furthermore, we would go there with our students, joining them in their journeys, both to the welcoming country and to the welcoming company. In the case of our students, this training period forms part of their Module Training in the Workplace, which is compulsory to obtain their VET certificates. For those students who are already certified, they will have a training project similar to the Erasmus+. We can say that what is intended with these mobilities, both for students and for the teachers is: -         To improve professional skills.-         To enhance social skills through teamwork, taking benefit from multicultural and multilingual environments.-         To advance in the learning of the foreign language, applied to the technical and professional field.-         To foster an entrepreneurial spirit.  For our teachers, we also intend:-To increase our management skills concerning projects and international initiatives.-To increase our didactic resources by comparing other VET systems. In the management of these mobilities, our three partners will be in charge of providing students\u2019 accommodation, their journey to the workplace, the follow-up of the training and the search for companies. Our school will be in charge of organizing the shortlisting of candidates, their preparation prior to the mobility, their insurance, and, of course, the follow-up and assessment which is needed to certify properly. In order to do this, a shortlisting procedure will be done, and it will be based on three aspects: the students\u2019 academic records, their knowledge of the target language and the capability and positive attitude of both students and teachers to carry out the training. As it concerns teachers, we will also appreciate their active participation and involvement in the Erasmus+ project.Afterwards, there will be a preparatory period to organize the mobility, then, the training period will take place. During this period, the students\u2019 mentors, alongside with the welcoming country\u2019s mentors and the persons involved in the project in both countries, will carry out the follow-up of students. In the case of teachers, it will be the coordinator for Erasmus+ in our school who will assess their training. We consider the participation in the project as beneficial for our students and teachers, and for our school and region in general. It helps us in the short and in the long run to increase our students\u2019 professional horizons, as long as they realise of the very possibility to work, not only in their own country, but also in any other country from the European Union. Finally, these projects help us to increase our educational offer and of course, the people from our region can have a very positive view of our educational centre.", "http://www.northwestacademy.net", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA102-024661_3"], ["7QP", "ALCORC\u00d3N EN EUROPA III", "Com Cubed Ltd.", 95538.0, "The towns of Alcorc\u00f3n, M\u00f3stoles and their immediate surroundings recorded a high rate of youth unemployment which, as is the case with the rest of the Spanish state, is the result of the decline in economic activity in recent years.

The aim of the project is to support the instructors and gastronomy teachers to enable them to improve their professional competencies and therefore teach students on professional European level. We want to open our community to other cultures and increase its mobility. We look for different ways of further education for our members and instructors and gastronomy teachers in the field of gastronomy. This project will enable instructors and gastronomy teachers a contact with real professional language situations in Europe, provide them with new tools and methods of teaching which will be used during professional classes. It will motivate them to learn foreign languages with a focus on professional language. Due to job shadowing work placement participants of the project will know everyday work of their colleagues in gastronomy companies, they will observe work environment, methods and educational teaching skills.  The project will enforce the motivation of the participants to plan their own real development and make them aware of the responsibility for planning their own professional career being part of the idea of all life learning. The participants of the project will know intercultural work environment. The project will enable them to break language barriers, which will affect the practical use of professional gastronomy language in everyday work with students. The project will extend the network of contacts with gastronomy instructors in other European Union countries and also with other institutions, which will increase the mobility and affect the European dimension of our organization. These activities will improve the level of education of professional staff on country level and in Silesian region, which will affect its economic growth and will affect the decrease of unemployment in the future and improve the competitiveness of gastronomy service.

It is essential that this should occur as soon as possible after obtaining professional qualifications. One of the factors that would help in that intention is to provide students with the skills  and competences that are desired by future employers seeking employees who represent a high level of substantive and social skills. The interviews and surveys show that young people have too little professional training  to work in the health care centers with sick, elderly or disabled people, and that is the most wanted. However, the work refers not only to taking care but creating friendly environment, helping sick and elderly people to function properly. One of the innovative therapeutic solutions is creating multisensory surgeons. To create such places it requires  multilevel skills; construction, architectural and Information ones. To learn students how to create such places, it was decided to let them learn  this  type of solutions in Germany and Great Britain. Based on acquired skills,  students will prepare  the multisensory surgeon in the Silesian Health Center in Wodzislaw  \u015al\u0105ski. The project will be attended by 34 students of the construction technician - training in Germany;  and 17 students- IT specialists,  in the UK. During this professional practice the students will become familiar with the design and execution of the workshop - construction technicians, and preparing software for the surgeon \u2013 IT specialists.  The aim of the training is not only to prepare the surgeon, but also the students will prepare workshops for schools  in Wodzis\u0142aw  \u015al\u0105ski district, the curriculum for vocational  education subjects will be extended to the issues learnt during the training within the innovation of teaching in school year 2017/2018.

Therefore the project aims to raise teaching quality.Participation in overseas mobility will result in meeting new persons and establishing international contacts. A stay in a foreign country will heighten the participants\u2019 cultural consciousness and contribute to propagating tolerance and respect for other cultures.The most important purpose of the project is to support the CCE in the area of teacher training and help teachers to create professional structures of organising overseas mobility. The project aims not only to organise one or a few stays abroad, but above all it is meant to launch a long-term strategy of the Centre\u2019s internationalisation through teachers\u2019 overseas mobility. This way the Centre has the chance to be involved in co-operation within the European educational institutions\u2019 network. The project will also contribute to establish good practices in school management, professionalisation of the staff responsible for co-operation with foreign institutions and will result in creating our own instruments to provide the quality of overseas training. All the above changes will help to perfect educational offer and gain recognition as a modern and dynamic institution, which is likely to result in raised interest in the Centre\u2019s offer.For the participants the stay abroad presents, above all, an opportunity to raise and acquire new professional competences in the field of psychology, pedagogy, didactics, teaching methodology, using ICT in the educational process and pedagogical work.", "http://www.northwestacademy.net", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PL01-KA104-025027_2"], ["6RG", "From Disability to Ability", "North West Play Resource Centre", 10678.0, "The project \"From Disability to Ability\" aims to bring together 28 youth workers from Germany, Sweden, the UK, Greece, Serbia, Turkey, the Netherlands, Poland, France and Lithuania in order to discuss methods regarding the skills development and empowerment of young people with disabilities.

The counselling approach and content are meant to transfer beneficiaries a methodology they can rely on beyond the mobility life-cycle, as supportive of their study and job plans after school, with an entrepreneurial approach and a better awareness of their professional behaviour.This sustainability is to be seen in the framework of ISFOL recent Impact study on counselling for mobility which assessed this approach among the 6 National good practices with respect to its potential for quality management, efficacy, transferability and sustainability.3.2 Sustainability is met as long as both the accompaning approach to work of the mobility actions addressed to new graduates in transition from school to the LM  and education to employability for vet learners will keep on attracting the interest of key stakeholders in Vet education and labour policies:40% learner mobility for VET graduates, enhancing internationalisation of accompaining measures of Labour Offices and complementing Youth Guarantee measures for employability60% VET learners, satisfying the increased demand and need for work-based learning and bringing a European dimension in dual education.This attractiveness will be supported by a synergic approach with schools, which EDEU will encourage to- play a facilitating role in the promotion of its public Calls- favour the communication with the beneficiary\u2019s tutor for traineeship so as to finalise the learning programme abroad on the students\u2019 needs and curriculum- to favour the recognition of t his/her  mobility LO within the framework of its credit system.4) SUPPORT TO INNOVATION IN VET  AND ITS COMPETITIVENESS (Internationalisation, allignment of students\u2019 profile to businesses needs, innovation in teaching methodology)4.1 Learners\u2019 mobility will focus on the sectors of  major interest for the economic development of the territory: preferably marketing, agro-food, tourism and hospitality, new technolgies.4.2 The project impacts well on the quality of education and teaching methodologies.

We continue our mobility projects for our students while at the same we accept students and apprentices from our international partners. We aim to increase our efforts to send more teachers abroad in order to develop their international competence and stimulate international cooperation. Concerning A1, we have planned mobility activities for second year students in vocational programs. They are involved in a subject called Prosjekt til fordypning (or In-depth Project, shortened PFO), where they choose competence aims from the third year curriculum in their subjects (curriculum for apprentices, two years in a business). The subject PFO is preferably carried out through training in a business. The competence aims in the subject are personalized and students, in cooperation with their teacher and business representative, identify which aims can realistically be reached through the replacement period. Most curriculums include aims that involve international relations. When we carry out parts of the subject PFO during a stay abroad with training in a foreign business or institution, the students will not only reach the curricular aims, they will also gain much additional competence and experience. The duration of the student mobility is 2 weeks and we wish to use two accompanying persons who share the monitoring task each taking one week, for each group we send.The main activity is to carry out the subject PFO, and thus improve their professional competence, improve their language skills and experience a different work culture. They will improve their social skills and get to know themselves and their fellow students in a different setting. The cultural differences both in work life and leisure between Norway and the country they travel to will help the participants expand their understanding of their own country and people from other parts of the world. There are many subject related features of activities planned for employees who will take part in the project: - Visits in schools, organisations and businesses.- Activities to gain insight in professional education in other countries.- Expansion of our international network. - Gain insight in new working methods, materials and equipment. - Develop the professional skills of participants.- Familiarize with new trends in Europe and promote innovative thinking.- Develop linguistic skills and gain knowledge about foreign cultures. In this application, we are mainly focusing on teachers from the two vocational fields with the longest experience of student mobility, which are Health and Upbringing, and Construction. At the same time we are also exploring the possibilities of sending 2 teachers form both Sales, Service and Safety as well as Technique and Industrial Production.  Health and Upbringing are currently developing a cooperation with a Danish partner (SOSU Sj\u00e6lland) and their network, where teachers and employees from institutions within the fields of health and care will visit each other at their schools and institutions to learn from each other. The project is called Eurocom Smart and the following countries take part: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Germany, Latvia and the Netherlands. Our Construction section have a fruitful cooperation with several partners in Germany. These partners are willing to arrange courses for our teachers. We have expressed our interest in studying the German school system, the cooperation between schools and businesses, and how the schools help students in danger of quitting school. We also want to visit businesses who are advanced in the field of building low energy houses. Houses that consume little energy or actually produce energy.

Hyria was established in August 2009 by merging seven vocational education institutions and adult education centres. Hyria operates in the rapidly growing Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Riihim\u00e4ki region which has nearly 90 000 residents, 34 000 jobs, and 5000 companies of which many operate internationally.  The development of international operations is very important to Hyria and therefore internationalisation is one of the focus points in its strategy and operations. Student and staff mobility have been identified as critical success factors in reaching the objectives set for international activities.  The aim is to increase our students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 professional and international skills by offering them a possibility to participate in the international mobility programs. By enabling our students and teachers to acquire new skills and knowledge the quality of education increases as well as student\u2019s employment opportunities. At the same time, Hyria serves the needs of the area\u2019s working life by producing a highly skilled workforce.  Objectives and expected resultsThe most important objective is to increase the students\u2019 professional skills, knowledge and attitudes by emphasizing the acquisition and development of key competencies of lifelong learning. The exchange period comprehensively enables students to develop the key competencies which are needed for personal fulfilment and development, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment. During the exchange period students encounter new situations; they apply already gained knowledge and language skills in practice; learn to use new technological solutions and platforms while communicating with their teachers, friends and family in the home country; and they compare working methods, the acquisition of technical solutions, the level of sustainable development and legislative issues in the host country. In addition, students are able to develop international and personal capabilities such as cultural awareness, language skills, interpersonal skills, individual growth, independence and the ability to work in a multicultural environment. For teachers the project activities give a possibility to update their professional knowledge and understanding of current requirements of a working life.  With the help of this experience the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 professional identity gets stronger, and they are able to find out more field-specific professional development possibilities. It enriches the education in many ways, as well as encourages students\u2019 to entrepreneurship and language learning. The second objective is to continue the development of international activities at Hyria. This time the development activities are focused on the following issues: - Shifting from short-term co-operation agreements to long-term ones (MOU, LOI)- Creating a centralized mobility process, instructions and orientation to teachers and staff members. - Formalise a model and a structure of an international study path for Hyria\u2019s students. MobilityThis application comprises 42 student mobility covering 25 different vocational qualifications. Principally exchange periods are offered to Hyria\u2019s second or third year students (young), but also to adult students and recent graduates can participate. In 2017 there will be 5 students from fewer backgrounds (economical) selected and granted an additional support for living and cultural expenses.Teacher and staff mobility (20 persons) is connected to work life periods, visiting new partners in Sweden, Italy, Portugal and Poland, and visiting Norway to learn more about revolution of the automobile sector. In the future the majority of cars are assumed to be electric ones, and this change will have an effect on an operation of garages. In Norway every fifth new car is and electric car already now.

The vocational training must respond to this development with its interface (function) role bitween the education and employmentsystem. Therefore, the internationalisation of our three vocational colleges (1550 students) is an important goal in the school's development. A learning abroad/internship in other European countries is a particularly effective tool for the students. Especially the importance of vocational education for the social development and the professional  perspective of each individual (every student) is undisputed. To gain intercultural experiences and skills while in school education, to deepen knowledge of foreign languages and to secure a head start when entering the profession is becoming increasingly important for many students. Furthermore, a learning stay abroad encourages andboasts the self-confidence and strengthers the emotional stability.\r\nParticipants: Per year, of the three vocational colleges, 94 students, 6 teachers/educational staff of the project group and 2 accompaying persons can apply for a scholarship. The students undergo an initial training/schooting with advanced professional knowledge in the following branches: Social & Health System, Nutrition & Home, Medien & Communication (Design Technical Assistant-GTA), the technical school of social work - social education.\r\nActivities: The students will complete a four-week intenship with project partners. Health/social/education branch:e.g. childrengarden, special scholls or facilities for disabled people in Finland/Sweden/Denmark. Facilities in Northern Europe especially  practise innovative approaches in the areas of early intervestion, education and inclusion. Countries in Northern Europe promote and practise the early intervestion and inclusion more professionally than other European countries. \r\nMedien & Communication (GTA branch): Many countries are very open-minded towards the social media and multimedia education. The GTAs get to know the future-oriented and innovative practises and new techniques through the project partners. They get introduced to the independent project management. The project partners define the project work in advance.\r\nProject implementation: The project group of the vocational colleges is responsible for organising the stays abroad. Appropriate project partners in European countries are build up, contractual frameworks (fixed contact, learning agreement/project agreement, support, language course, valuation) are defined. The information seesions for students/parents is followed by the application. The students are selected through an application process. Then preparation seminars follow. During their stay abroad they are accompanied by the project group/person of trust and their local contact (supervision, own facebook group). Following the stay abroad the students prepare completion reports and an assessment/evaluation is done. Public relations (press releases, school website, presentation at an open house) complete the project.\r\nResults: The students will gather knowledge and experience of other cultures, peoples , nations and behaviors. They can compare the working and living environment in the European area . They will expand their intercultural and social competences and strengthen their own cultural identity. The students will be able to make a more accurate picture of their professional career . The professional perspective is improved and the choice of professional is strengthened. Language skills and self-confidence are encouraged. They will change their view on Europe and the European Community. The commitment of the school to praticipate in the program Erasmus+ will be seen positively.\r\nThe educational staff: Learn impulses and appropriate tools for school development, strengthening of the European idea and internationalisation of the vocational colleges, expand intercultural competence and train intercultural sensitivity, international networkling and networking of partners with own school projects (e.g. Fair Trade , UNICEF , worldwide missionary projects SMMP , school against racism), promotion of young professionals.\r\nLong-term benefits: The students gain an edge in the career, it is a gain of experiences, self-confidence is strengthened and advanced language skills shape the future career.

Buildings consume more energy than any other sector of the European economy. It is recognized that they account for around 40% of all energy consumption. The building sector, therefore, offers the largest potential for enerfy savings, which in return will reduce our negative impact on the environment. Based on these considerations, the project \"ETEROB Mobility\" aims, in line with the project LLP-LdV TOI \"ETEROB - European Training Programme on Energy Efficient Renovation of Old Buildings\", to lay the foundation, through the creation of specific paths of WORK-BASED LEARNING (WBL) for students in initial vocational training and recent graduates in CONSTRUCTION, ENVIRONMENT AND LANDSCAPE subjects, for a modernization of the construction sector in the belief that this may be the most immediate and cost-effective way to reduce energy consumption, and to create new jobs and promote economic recovery in the construction industry. Through \"ETEROB Mobility\" the VET School \"Caselli\", the other 9 sending VET Schools and all partners of the Consortium, are therefore intended to provide appropriate competencies in the building eco-friendly sector in order to identify appropriate solutions for energy saving, in compliance with regulations on environmental protection and improve, therefore, the quality of education and vocational training, giving a European dimension to the educational paths and offering, as a result, to the young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their skills curriculum: professionalism in their specific areas of VET (ENERGY, CONSTRUCTION, ENVIRONMENT AND LAND), cultural knowledge and language training.

The data and projections show, however, on the one hand, the expansion of the sector and the tourist attractiveness of the two regions and, on the other hand, emphasize the need to provide trained young staff, highly qualified and able to respond positively to new and high competence requested by the local labor market.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nIn line with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy and ET 2020, WORK AWAY offers young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their curricular competencies: professionalism in the specific sector of TOURISM, soft skills, cultural knowledge and language skills. These general objectives are pursued through a mobility experience which consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 STUDENTS attending CLASSES IV and of 3 months for 80 newly graduated of the 8 participating VET Schools (Technical Institutes for Tourism and Hotel and Catering Schools). The project also promotes the exchange and transfer of good practices in VET by relating our VET system with the training and employment system to other European countries and contributes to the consolidation of the ECVET System.\r\n\r\nACTIVITY\r\n1. Transversal Activities: management and coordination; Dissemination and exploitation of results; Follow up;\r\n2. Mobility Preparation: Plan of communication and cooperation; Recruitment and selection of participants; preparation of participants; Learning plan definition;\r\n3.

The project meets the need to further qualify the human resources involved in the mobility. This will be achieved through a 1-month internship in host organisations  for students in the  field of management /enhancement/promotion of artistic and cultural heritage (museums, agencies of cultural promotion, cultural associations).  This is a developing sector in Europe and,  in spite of the crisis, it can offer new and qualified employment opportunities.\r\nIn fact, thanks to the work placements -in European cities (London, Plymouth, Cork, Amiens, Valencia and Derry) where artistic and cultural heritage are widely enhanced and where the sector is an important employment source-  it is intended to offer an \u201con the job\" learning opportunity   in foreign companies and institutions , in order to integrate students\u2019 school education by ensuring  improvement of their professional and entrepreneurial skills especially in relation to:  1)technical and professional abilities in the specific fields of cultural offer management, enhancement/promotion of artistic/cultural products/services, 2) abilities to find the way through an increasingly open market and  evaluate the opportunities arising from such growing openness; 3) abilities to meet the demanding requirements from users of cultural services/ products; 4) abilities to innovate, diversify and increase performances  of public and private organisations that manage the cultural offer. In order to have a successful project a partnership has been created. It involves regional and transnational organisations committed to the training and professional development of young human resources and to the quality improvement of cultural supply. In fact the partnership includes:institutions, employer associations, companies and non-profit partners that will work together to promote a quality cooperation and the enhancement of knowledges/skills of young people.

One of the sectors that characterizes Italy, and that can be a driver of recovery for youth employment is undoubtedly tourism. Mobility can stimulate the ability to innovate, typical of young people, especially those who have had the opportunity to observe cutting edge practices in other countries.

The expected actions will be focused mainly on the realization  abroad of a learning experience in a company of 5 weeks,  being the first one of preparation and the other 4 of full-time internship. \r\nThe mobility is recognized in the School-Work Alternance system implemented by the schools.\r\nThrough the internship it will be possible to increase competences which are transversally essential: language and digital skills, but also initiative and entrepreneurship spirit, cultural awareness. \r\nDuring the experience, in Italy and abroad, the participants will get to know different \u2018Business storytelling\u2019, told by their protagonists, which will give them the measure of the interweaving of personal, cultural, ethical and structural elements, that contribute to the establishment, running and/or closure of a company.\r\nThis important educational activity will be directed at understanding which key competences, vision and resources are fundamental for the entrepreneurship and ability to run a business by respecting the people and the environment.\r\nThe hosting partners and companies are located in Spain, France, United Kingdom.

Even if there are many national programs to increase the number of young workers (such as Garanzia Giovani or the programme of school-work alternance) more and more youngsters from 15 to 24 are unemployed. In Central and Southern Italy the situation is even worse, more than 60% of them are unemployed. This can be due to the personal situation of disadvantage experienced by many youngsters in our area which lead them to stop their training and educational path.\r\nWe have spent more than ten years working in the management services for people with dasibility, families and children and we propose a project which can enable those young people living in a situation of disadvantage to live a training experience abroad, after having been taught what they need as far as the foreign culture and language are concerned with the aim of giving them a chance of inclusion in the working world. Our objective is to contribuite, through a transnational mobility, to the reduction of the unemployment rate helping and supporting the disadvantaged young in their training process improving their knowledge and skills and streghtening the link between training and work placement. They will acquire a new way of thinking based on openmindedness and on a European perspective.

This application, similar to the other  mobility projects that CENFIM had continuously lead, integrates the same objectives and expectations as always,  which are inherent to this European Initiative: Encouraging the growth of professional and personal skills in trainees, extending trainees perspective in relation to professional practice, and strengthening the social, cultural and linguistic dimension through mobility experience provided in other European contexts , giving them a greater sense of European identity and citizenship and contributing to a greater potentiality for mobility in the European Union.\r\nThis Organization also believes that the opportunity to develop Mobilities in foreign countries reaches two purposes that are of most relevant: first, promote the excellence in learning, by means of enabling merit reward, what would  stimulate a greater achievement from the trainees in the learning process, as it would be applied objective selection criteria (e.g. to distinguish the winners of the internal national competition of professions, which are referred in this application); and, second, enhancing professional skills and providing new opportunities for employment in Europe, although our trainees have full employability, in their professional sector, in Portugal, \r\nConsidering the national dimension of CENFIM (13 training centers across different territorial and industrial areas) and the mentioned number of trainees, this project applies for 30 mobility/internships for periods of four weeks, in seven countries, in various metallurgical and electromechanical sector professional competence, what represents a high level of diversity and we consider a qualitative factor. \r\nWe are aware of the impact that these mobility experience, as many previous Participants witnessed that, have over the local communities in which CENFIM has their training centres, it is imperative that we decentralize this project, i.e., to distribute over various regions of our country, so to spread as much as possible the effect of the impact of these rewarding experience, not only in regard of profession but also of social benefits. \r\nRegarding to Staff it is possible to declare that the purpose of these mobilities will also be focused on the promotion of professional competence, as well as on cultural and social ones, that these contact opportunities with different contexts and European organizations, would provide. More specifically, we intend that these mobilities would contribute to identify different training practices (in management model and in strategies and teaching resources), and to improve the perception of various industrial contexts in the host countries; and their responses for the training requirements. At the organization level, it is intended to gain new and more competences; and to identify new areas of cooperation aimed at project and paths for innovations in the fields of pedagogy, technical skills, and didactic, which could be shared between several Partner entities in the future.   \r\nIt is hopefully that the mobilities of the staff in general would coincide with the first week of the trainees\u2019. This practice has been followed in previous projects and that has proved efficient in the accompanying of the trainees in their first days, in order to help their integration and to deal with some logistic and administrative subjects close to their host Entities. \r\nIt is important to mention that Host Entities that are willing to collaborate in this application are all VET entities with whom CENFIM keeps close relations of cooperation in several previous projects, resulting so  several factors that we consider essential to the quality of Mobility: reliability, availability and professionalism in their tasks; they are entities in the training sector of CENFIM, so they are able to understand and to integrate the suitable activities regarding the professional needs of the Participants; they have, like us, a strong connection with the business sector and with industrial companies, in particular, and this can enable a meaningful part of the trainees\u2019 mobility be on-the-job training (work placements), what we consider very important to enrich the mobilities.", "http://www.northwestacademy.net", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PT01-KA102-035665_5"], ["6JL", "VET, BETTER SKILLS, BETTER JOBS", "Betteronics", 175893.0, "The  \"Vet,better,skills,better jobs\" project was created in response to the need of vocational schools to provide their students the opportunity to expand and improve the quality of their training practices in European companies.

That would allow them to gain valuable work experience that would allow them to be more competitive in the labour market. The project is aimed to give the participant target group the opportunity to acquire new skills through an experience abroad that will enrich them with new working skills, together with a cultural heritage that they will gain through living and working in a foreign country.\r\nThe Spanish consortium is made up of ten high schools of the Valencian Region and ESFMB to act as coordinator and the partners ,(from Ireland, Malta and Portugal have a huge experience in mobilities in their countries.  Through this project, students can integrate into their training practices undertaken as part of the module \"Training at Work\" (FCT).\r\nThe main objective of is that participants develop through training practices in European companies, skills and abilities to complete, in a practical way, the skills already acquired in VET and efficiently incorporate the common European labour market. They need to develop not only specific and technical skills on the specialty they have studied but also other key skills such as cultural, linguistic, entrepreneurship and personal initiative, ability to work in teams and knowledge of other working environments to facilitate insertion in the European labor market, either self-employed or employed by others.\r\nThe main activities carried out by the project partners are:\r\n-Preparation of mobility. Including: Selection of participants, initial assessment of their skills, previous training of participants, logistical and contractual aspects, coordination ... \r\n-Execution of the stay. Starting the program in companies. Mobility also includes cultural activities.\r\n-Evaluation of the participants. The skills acquired during the project will be certified with ECVET and will be defined from an initial evaluation. The activities within the company will aim to achieve these skills and will be customized for each participant. \r\n-Monitoring. Monitoring of the evolution of the participants by the means established in the project will be performed.\r\n-Evaluation of the project. \r\n-Dissemination. Dissemination activities are planned throughout the whole project. A final dissemination conference of the results will be performed.\r\nBesides the impact on the participants, the project will affect the partners promoting European cooperation and rapprochement between business and schools and dissemination activities and mobility itself will create an impact at local, regional and national levels.

This project clearly progresses the NWRC's European Development plan further into Phase 3 on its Phase 5 Plan.   \r\n\r\nThe project is aligned with the objectives of the Erasmus+ Programme in terms of \"equiping young people with knowledge, knowhow, skills and/or competencies.\" The key objectives of E2020 are also relevant in terms of \"addressing skills deficits, technological competition and .... using forums to share best practices, mutual learning and disseminating results\".   All partners are keen to pursue internationalisation within their organisations.  For NWRC, this is now a cornerstone of  the new FE Means Business Strategy for Northern Ireland (January 2016).  \r\n\r\nSeveral curriculum areas will be involved in terms of meeting particular needs of their staff and students.  Students at level 2 and 3 in these areas have to date been reluctant to take up placement opportunities overseas.  For many,  the decision has been based on personal backgrounds where an opportunity like that would be seen to be beyond their means and upbringing or a lack of confidence to travel and work in another country.  The majority of our student demographic would fall under the eligibility criteria for widening participation and those with fewer opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis project provides training for Sport, Motor vehicle, Welder& fabricators, Carpentry, Masonry, Media, Fashion, Early Years, Hair & Beauty, Health & Social Care, Printing, Catering and a large emphasis is placed on students who have special education needs (SEN) and on Essential Skills Literacy & Numeracy.  We have partners across 8 different European countries.  We are collaborating with experienced host partners some we have collaborated on projects beforehand and some new partners which were very successful with excellent feedback from the participants.  All partners have been working with NWRC in shaping and planning the project through preparatory visits and staff exchanges and we are keen to share positive results with all stakeholders in time showing 'growth' for all.\r\n\r\nThe anticipated outcomes are exchange of learning on skills and employability opportunities that will better inform curriculum development, teaching methodologies and assessment practices.  For the students,  there are many opportunities to gain new skills and competences as well as to develop their soft skills such as team-working, confidence and problem-solving.   \r\n\r\nWe also plan, for the first time to implement ECVET principles and use tools and instruments, where relevant,  to improve the quality of placements and make learning more transparent.\r\n\r\n24 students will be travelling to Denmark to re-kinde the partnership and collaboration that was in place with Korsor. on the EXCISE project.   Student participants will be young people with special needs, learning difficulties and disabilities.  \r\nParticipation will provide the students with every opportunity to enhance their potential within a supportive and positive learning environment.

In the light of the expansion of the European market and internationalisation of companies, learning mobility is a key for the improvement of their employability. At the same time, in its strategic framework Education and Training 2020, the EU defines mobility \u201can essential element of lifelong learning and an important means of enhancing people's employability and adaptability\u201d, stating that \u201cperiods of learning abroad \u2014 both within Europe and the rest of the world \u2014 should be the rule rather than the exception\u201d.\r\nIn support to this European framework, the consortium of VET providers applying is willing to  introduce a coordinated approach regarding European mobility for VET students in upper secondary schools, aiming at making mobility a normal part of training curricula and encouraging local actors to achieve this goal together, by implementing networking strategies and economies of scale.\r\nThe project Co.Pro.Mob 2020 fits with the European strategies by offering the opportunity to live a work experience in a EU company abroad of about 5 weeks to 120 students in VET courses of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales province. The mobility will be part of the courses offered by the schools which have joined the consortium, therefore, competences acquired abroad by participants will be recognised in their curricula through the use of Europass and the ECVET. Students in mobility will acquire competences in cutting edge sectors of the regional economy in particular: shipbuilding; constructions and hospitality and catering, but also key competences such as learning-to-learn, relational and intercultural skills, language, as well as autonomy, entrepreneurship, problem solving, understanding of the workplace environment, all of them mostly required by companies nowadays.\r\n\r\nThe consortium is composed by three VET schools representing the in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales province. Alfmed an organisation expert of mobility with many years of experience in the field will share with the consortium all the best practices developed while coordinating KA1 projects.\r\nThe partnership will include 6 partner organisations from 5 EU countries (Italy, Spain, Poland; UK and Germany) which have proven their competences and reliability in previous projects. Besides, European partner organisations have shown the operational capacity needed to find work experiences in line with the training curricula and sector of participants, thus improving the chances for rapid employment after mobility.\r\n\r\nAfter an informative and selection phase, participants will be offered a thorough pre-departure preparation covering language, practical organisation, culture, safety in the workplace, adaptation to a foreign country and to the work environment. Each participant will sign a Learning Agreement specifying objectives, expected results and organisational details of the work experience.\r\n\r\nDuring all their stay abroad, students will be followed by many people: a national tutor, a tutor in the country of destination, a company mentor who will guide them through their learning experience and a mobility coordinator in their school. A follow-up meeting will be arranged after the end of each flow to let participants reflect on the experience and make the most out of their Erasmus+ experience for their future.\r\n\r\nThe project will boost the employability of 120 young people, it is also expected to have an impact on the local educational system. In fact it will improve competences of staff, in order to make mobility easier and more accessible to all those VET providers which do not have the resources or the competences. \r\nLast but not least, the project will represent the beginning of a systemic approach toward internationalisation, aimed involving institutions and local economy in collaborating for modernising the educational system.

It is a strategy characterised by a close cooperation with the local actors such as the Regional Europe Direct, the Region Emilia Romagna, local banks and the regional school office to pursue the internationalisation of the VET provision for the benefit of schools and students. The general objective of this proposal is to increase the employability of students who attend  upper-secondary school and who therefore are next to the transition to the labor market. The specific objectives of this mobility project therefore are the following:\r\n1- To Improve professional competences, key competencies  and citizenship skills in participants\r\n2- To increase language competences and organisational skills of staff\r\n3- Increase the attractiveness and internationalization of VET courses provided in the region\r\n4- Consolidate the networking strategies between institutions, companies and the world of education\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\nThe activities consists in planning, managing and capitalizing transnational placements in European companies for100 students attending the fourth year of upper secondary schools with in the region who will get a EQF4 level qualification at the end of their courses. The mobility will target the most required qualifications in the regional labor market in order to ensure a prompt occupation after he school. These qualifications are related to the different cluster registering higher growth and internationalization rates as well as good hiring rates which are: 1) tourism; 2) ICT and new technologies 3) Mechanic and Mechatronics 4) social economy and third sector 5) art, culture and design. The internships abroad will be recognized by the school and integrated in the compulsory hours of placements that every students must attend according to the Italian law. In this context, the project will also offer 10 \"mobility coordinators\" of schools or organizations working in the field education to carry out a mobility abroad in order to deepen their knowledge on the aspects related to the implementation of mobility and the use of ECVET. The experience abroad will also increase the mutual trust between sending organizations (schools) and the European hosting organizations as well as hosting enterprises that offer placements for the students. The mutual knowledge will facilitate the development of future cross-border initiatives such as for follow-up mobility projects; training programs shared through e-learning and exchange of good practices.\r\n\r\nSELECTION AND PREPARATION\r\nStudents will be selected through public calls published by Uniser and open to students form the whole region. The calls will indicate the criteria for participation and how to apply. The selection will take place in two phases, firstly the interested students will fill out a motivational questionnaire in English and attach the Europass CV on the website www.movingeneration.net which is specifically designed to collect students applications. Students will subsequently participate in an interview with the staff of Uniser who will assess the participant's motivation and language skills.\r\nThe selected candidates will then be inserted pre-departure preparation programme that provides practical and methodological training as well as intercultural training. Language preparation will be provided in accordance with schools during the hours of English, and will focus on the vocabulary to use in the workplace.\r\n\r\nRECOGNITION\r\nAll participating students will be recognized the competences learned abroad thanks to the application of the ECVET device. The project will make use of Memorandum of Understanding and Learning Agreement to ensure that the learning objectives of the qualifications are converted into to Learning Outcomes and Learning Units which can be achieved, verified and validated. Since the mobility be part of the vet course the participants are attending and it will not be extra-scholastic, the hours of internship abroad will be subtracted to those of the compulsory curricular internship. Each student will also be provided with a Europass Mobility to integrate the Europass CV and a Europass Certificate Supplement to ensure that their qualification is more easily spendable on the European labor market.\r\n\r\nACCOMPANYING PERSONS\r\nTarget students of the mobility are composed almost exclusively of minors, therefore accompanying persons are necessary.

This experience is part of the ASL program which has the intention of integrating the experiences of training abroad with national ones through a pedagogical innovation process based on learning from the workplace which, following the EQAVET recommendations for quality in professional training, will lead to the improvement of operational and procedural standards to be diffused as good practices for a fully dual IFP/VET system. The development system will ensure that the alternation of ASL and WBL experiences are integrated in order to provide the student\u2019s course of study with continuity, and where all the expertise acquired from various backgrounds converges.\r\nFor this purpose, a scheduling table has been created with the participation of those responsible for the ASL system from the Institute, the local PMI/SMEs, the Corporations and associations where the students carry out their national internships. This is to create synergy with the productive forces that are they themselves firstly interested in a fruitful encounter between supply and demand and can provide useful information on requests for the foreign partners.\r\nAn adequately trained tutor who is in charge of international internship placements has been appointed to each study course. Specific modules have been collectively planned starting from the professional profile of the participant and the LOs that must be reached by the end of the internship. The certified agencies in the host countries are part of a wide network collaboration that the Institute has created over the years and will guarantee the quality of training, a proper validation process of the qualifications and the start-up for the ECVET procedure.\r\nIn particular, four or five target countries have been defined where the institute has already started profitable partnerships and reliable contacts in the past and with whom to carefully plan the experiences. As for persons accompanying, it is deemed appropriate, if teachers are involved, to have two shifts for the assistance, with the second trip paid by the school. It is also possible to have a form of collaboration with the Faculty of Education that could identify students for whom the tutoring and assistance activities constitute an internship.\r\nAs already announced in the accreditation request, the participants will be selected through a public competition announcement that differs slightly from the one planned mainly for the percentage that each item is allowed (academic performance10%, behavior and personal traits 40%,  first foreign language 25%, second foreign language15%, foreign language certification 10%). This is to encourage students to achieve linguistic certifications and progressively improve language skills, and not to exclude reliable students who do not fall into the category of excellence. The preparation of the participants in the linguistic, technical and intercultural sectors will be particularly accurate. \r\nOur future intention is to consolidate and develop a system for the ASL and WBL projects even through a platform that puts all the local and transnational players involved in touch, in order to share information, forms, experiences and organize video conferences with training sessions by the host country with virtual classrooms. The platform will be constantly in progress and constitute an interesting and flexible database.\r\nIn order to allow the school policy to be more focused on internationalization and open-mindedness, it was considered appropriate to organize English language courses for the institute teachers at basic, intermediate and higher levels. Over the years, the lack of knowledge of foreign languages, in particular English, on the part of the teachers and school staff, has proved to be a weakness that has excluded many school workers from the projecting, implementation and conveying of European experiences. This will no longer be feasible so as to truly create a school with a widespread European vocation and open to the outside world. \r\nFor this school year, students with Special Educational Needs have not been involved as no adequate cases to perform this type of experience have been detected, while it is forecast for the coming year.\r\nThe school has taken steps to widely circulate the attainment of the Mobility Card and diffuse the culture of internationalization at a local level as well.", "http://www.northwestacademy.net", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005957_2"], ["7AL", "Working and Learning Flows", "NORTH WEST REGIONAL COLLEGE", 89866.0, "In the strategy of Kainuu Vocational College internationalization is regarded as an important part of the development work in the college.

Student and staff mobility have been identified as critical success factors in reaching the objectives set for international activities. \r\n \r\n\r\nThe aim is to increase our students, teachers and work life partners\u2019 professional and international skills by offering them a possibility to participate in the international mobility programs. By enabling our students and teachers to acquire new skills and knowledge the quality of education increases as well as student\u2019s employment opportunities. At the same time, Hyria fosters the co-operation with the world of work and serves the needs of the area\u2019s working life by producing a highly skilled workforce. \r\n \r\nObjectives and expected results\r\n\r\nThe most important objective is to increase the students\u2019 professional skills, knowledge and attitudes by emphasizing the acquisition and development of key competencies of lifelong learning.\r\n \r\nThe exchange period comprehensively enables students to develop the key competencies which are needed for personal fulfilment and development, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment. During the exchange period students encounter new situations; they apply already gained knowledge and language skills in practice; learn to use new technological solutions and platforms while communicating with their teachers, friends and family in the home country; and they compare working methods, the acquisition of technical solutions, the level of sustainable development and legislative issues in the host country.\r\n \r\nIn addition, students are able to develop international and personal capabilities such as cultural awareness, language skills, interpersonal skills, individual growth, independence and the ability to work in a multicultural environment. For teachers the project activities give a possibility to update their professional knowledge and understanding of current requirements of a working life.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of this experience the students and teachers\u2019 professional identity gets stronger, and they are able to find out more field-specific professional development possibilities. It enriches the education in many ways, as well as encourages students\u2019 to entrepreneurship and language learning. \r\n\r\nThe second objective is to continue the development of international activities at Hyria. In this time the development activities are focused on the following issues: \r\n\r\n- The current development activities are evaluated and established into practise.\r\n- Mobility statistics will be improved.  The estimated numbers are compared with the implemented ones by departments and target groups.  \r\n- Creating a uniform way to mark the exchange period into students\u2019 transcript of records.\r\n- Shifting from short-term co-operation agreements to long-term ones (MOU, LOI).\r\n- Creating a centralized mobility process, instructions and orientation to teachers and staff members. \r\n\r\nMobility\r\n\r\nThis application comprises 70 student mobility covering 25 different vocational qualifications. Principally exchange periods are offered to Hyria\u2019s second or third year students (young), but also to adult students and recent graduates can participate.

The program is entitled:\r\n\u201eThe other language, the other vision of life\u201d\r\nOur project is supposed to start on 1st June 2018 and last till 31st May 2019.  There are four groups of participants: \r\n\u2022 two German teachers, \r\n\u2022 four English teachers determined to improve their effectiveness and language skills, \r\n\u2022 13 teachers of different subjects divided into two groups and willing to learn English and German. All the participants are scheduled to particular courses in order to match individual needs. Not only do teachers have the chance to develop their skills and use them in practice but also may deepen their knowledge about foreign educational systems and curriculas. It is expected that the participants would improve the quality of their work through new methods and pathbreaking strategies.  The participants of the program are going to spend two weeks in Austria and North Ireland.\r\nThe international project gives the school possibilities of improving teachers\u2019 qualifications, broadening the horizons and knowledge of European heritage.\r\nIt is essential for our professional developement and provides with new opportunities to enhance the effectiveness of teachers\u2019 work.  \r\nThe main aims of the project are:\r\n\u2022 teaching and learning foreign languages as a chance for  more satisfactory and effective work\r\n\u2022 raising teachers\u2019 qualifications and competence \r\n\u2022 encouraging and motivating students to use ICT tools and new innovative methods\r\n\u2022 improving the level of educational process\r\n\u2022 recognizing and respecting cultural differences as well as gaining knowledge about the world and its perspectives\r\n\u2022 arousing students\u2019 motivation and interest in self-educational development\r\n\u2022 exchanging experiences with other educational instututions\r\nAccording to the school strategy, teachers have to focus on their personal development in order to make our school a modern and professional place. We are concerned about new innovative curriculas and methodology as much as learning how to integrate skills and develop linguistics. What is more, teachers are extremely involved into making lessons attractve through creative methods and ICT tools. Due to the program teachers have the possibility to enrich teaching workshop with original   material  and teaching aids. Studying and working abroad means a more efficient use of genuine resoures. Thus, teachers can gain the knowledge  performing different activities through new and interesting teaching strategies. They would possibly learn how to concentrate on specific needs and requirements of particular students but using the knowledge and experience of their foreign colleagues. For that reason, professionalizing qualifications of the staff  is one the advantages of participating in the project. \r\n\r\nCooperation with foreign institutions and sharing and exchanging the experiences with the partners is also a priority. The participants have a unique possibility to learn about the country, its traditions and every day life but on the other hand, they may provide their foreign colleagues with the knowledge about Poland and its heritage. It all could help to create lessons as multicultural as possible. It is positive, travelling and sharing experiences make us open-mined and more tolerant for differences andtheworld itself.

The vocational training must respond to this development with its interface (function) role bitween the education and employmentsystem. Therefore, the internationalisation of our three vocational colleges (1550 students) is an important goal in the school's development. A learning abroad/internship in other European countries is a particularly effective tool for the students. Especially the importance of vocational education for the social development and the professional  perspective of each individual (every student) is undisputed. To gain intercultural experiences and skills while in school education, to deepen knowledge of foreign languages and to secure a head start when entering the profession is becoming increasingly important for many students. Furthermore, a learning stay abroad encourages andboasts the self-confidence and strengthers the emotional stability.\r\nParticipants: Per year, of the three vocational colleges, 96 students, 6 teachers/educational staff of the project group and 2 accompaying persons can apply for a scholarship. The students undergo an initial training/schooting with advanced professional knowledge in the following branches: Social & Health System, Nutrition & Home, Medien & Communication (Design Technical Assistant-GTA), the technical school of social work - social education.\r\nActivities: The students will complete a four-week intenship with project partners. Health/social/education branch:e.g. childrengarden, special scholls or facilities for disabled people in Finland/Sweden/Denmark. Facilities in Northern Europe especially  practise innovative approaches in the areas of early intervestion, education and inclusion. Countries in Northern Europe promote and practise the early intervestion and inclusion more professionally than other European countries. \r\nMedien & Communication (GTA branch): Many countries are very open-minded towards the social media and multimedia education. The GTAs get to know the future-oriented and innovative practises and new techniques through the project partners. They get introduced to the independent project management. The project partners define the project work in advance.\r\nProject implementation: The project group of the vocational colleges is responsible for organising the stays abroad. Appropriate project partners in European countries are build up, contractual frameworks (fixed contact, learning agreement/project agreement, support, language course, valuation) are defined. The information seesions for students/parents is followed by the application. The students are selected through an application process. Then preparation seminars follow. During their stay abroad they are accompanied by the project group/person of trust and their local contact (supervision, own facebook group). Following the stay abroad the students prepare completion reports and an assessment/evaluation is done. Public relations (press releases, school website, presentation at an open house) complete the project.\r\nResults: The students will gather knowledge and experience of other cultures, peoples , nations and behaviors. They can compare the working and living environment in the European area . They will expand their intercultural and social competences and strengthen their own cultural identity. The students will be able to make a more accurate picture of their professional career . The professional perspective is improved and the choice of professional is strengthened. Language skills and self-confidence are encouraged. They will change their view on Europe and the European Community.

The sending institution intends to graduate future skilled personnel in the areas of commercial training and foreign languages, early childhood care and development and healthcare professionals through a vocational education that is based on an internationally recognized core curriculum that prepares them effectively for the increasing qualitative demands of the labor market. An internship at a company or institution abroad therefore plays a very important role in achieving this. European integration and intercultural studies in the theoretical and practical phases of this education are highly significant. The project objectives are the acquisition of language skills, specialized professional and methodical proficiency as well as knowledge of the socio-economic structure of the receiving country. Equally important is the enhancement of social and intercultural competences obtained through real working situations abroad and the examination of cultural differences with respect to working norms and within education in other countries. Proper preparation of all vocational apprentices for the European labor market is a sign of quality for the vocational education institution, as well as a substantial improvement for the apprentice in their employment chances both at home and abroad.  \r\nParticipant Profile and Quantity: In total, 36 students and lecturers in commercial training and foreign languages, early childhood care and development and healthcare professionals take part in the project. By enhancing their social and intercultural competences with experience in a foreign country, commercial training participants can later utilize their acquired knowledge and skills effectively in the professional world. The didactic focus of early childhood care and development education lies in promoting language aptitude for children and youths, shaping international thinking and enhancing intercultural skills. The project also incorporates underprivileged young people. The internship abroad gives them self-confidence and introduces them to new perspectives.\r\nThe exchange program involving students of early childhood care and development and baineotherpy and medical massage students is a two-week interdisciplinary project that brings together learners from two different vocational education programs.  Participants in the program engage with each other on their personal experience obtained while job shadowing during the internship or during practical instruction.  A wider view of Europe and society in general is needed, as well as a greater awareness of the European labor market.\r\nSkilled personnel from all vocational education fields are facing increasing demands in their daily work. Continual further qualification is therefore essential, which means European themes must be integrated into the education curriculum and instruction.\r\nDescription of the activity: From July 2018 to Spring 2020, together with partner-institutions, define goals, organize, supervise and evaluate Internships and exchanges with a duration from two weeks to five months that lead to the completion of a particular stage in vocational education, and the procurement of practical work experience in an international context and an improvement in foreign language skills.  \r\nOutcomes and Effects: Documenting the international learning experiences and internships in project files, publicizing the projects online and at local and regional events. Creating project folders, and internship reports, setting up cooperation agreements with partner institutions, improving the written evaluation of participant performance with a final grade or mark, the attainment of a qualified certificate from the company or institution where the internship takes place, as well as certifying and registering participants in EUROPASS Mobility. \r\nLong-term Effects:  Facilitating and implementing European thinking.

In recent years, several other specialized schools for social education have joined this cooperation.\r\n\r\nBeyond the subject area of \u200b\u200bsocial pedagogy, this project application also extends to the industrial-technical area and thus to dual training. This area is still under construction.\r\n\r\nFor both groups of learners, this project gives them the opportunity to acquire core competencies (social, intercultural, etc.) abroad through 2 to 9-week internships. On the one hand this improves the employability of the learners, on the other hand the socio-pedagogical institutions or the companies where the apprentices work profit from the project.\r\n\r\nThe project will support 15 students from dual training programs who will travel to a partner school in Seville for two weeks, 20 students mostly from dual training will be enrolled in the \"Europe-Kaufmann / Europa-Kauffrau\" module for Funded 4 weeks. 25 trainees from the Fachschulen f\u00fcr Sozialp\u00e4dagogik are supported for the compulsory internship for 9 weeks.\r\nIn addition, 20 teachers / educational staff will be supported for three-day seminars", "http://www.foyle.eu", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004733_5"], ["0NA", "Exchange as Continuation of Training", "Foyle International Ltd.", 183034.0, "The \u201cEfa-SOZ\u201d project has been successfully carried out by Jane-Adam School (JAS) in cooperation with Association for European Training (GEB).

In this framework, the Italian manufacturing production system has, therefore, the need to capitalize on its tradition and industrial vocation and excel in enabling technologies, innovate and diffuse, even abroad, the \"smart factory 4.0\". The definition of the skills profiles and skills required, along with the creation of training paths suitable to bring companies to the digital productive change, are configured, therefore, such as crucial priorities for the Italian manufacturing industry. The joint actions of MISE, MIUR, CNR and the Agency for Digital Italy, as well as regional initiatives such as Smart Specialisation Strategy of Tuscany, confirm this need.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nIn line with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy and ET 2020, the project offers young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their curricular competencies: professionalism in the specific sector (mechanical, mechatronics, electronics), soft skills, cultural knowledge and language skills. These general objectives are pursued through a mobility experience which consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 students attending classes IV and of 3 months (ERASMU PRO MOBILITY) for 80 newly graduated of the 8 participating VET Schools, coming from Tuscany. The project also promotes the exchange and transfer of good practices in VET by relating our VET system with the training and employment system to other European countries and contributes to the consolidation of the ECVET System.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n1. Transversal Activities: management and coordination; Dissemination and exploitation of results; Follow up;\r\n2. Mobility Preparation: Plan of communication and cooperation; Recruitment and selection of participants; preparation of participants; Learning plan definition;\r\n3. Mobility Realization: Internship in the company; Monitoring and tutoring; Project feedback and experience of mobility; Assessment, certification and validation of skills acquired.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY in 4 PHASES\r\n1. MANAGEMENT PLAN AND MONITORING: the project is coordinated by IIS \"RONCALLI\" in close collaboration with othe partners of the Consortium. The Plan is based on the EQAVET quality system and includes specification on: financial arrangements, timing, names of managers / representatives of each organization, responsibilities, roles and tasks, project phases with related milestones, risk management procedures.\r\n2. PLAN OF LEARNING AND EVALUATION: the learning and evaluation plan contains specific references and commitments on transparency and recognition of competences in an ECVET-compatible framework. The documents are: Learning Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The quality of the experience of mobility is controlled through regular evaluation questionnaires filled out by participants, mentors and tutors.\r\n3. PLAN OF COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION: it provides for the involvement of all participants in the partnership with effective tools and rules to maintain a high level of interest on the project.\r\n4. STRATEGIC PLAN FOR DISSEMINATION AND EXPLOITATION: includes phases and methods to be adopted by all partners to disseminate and exploit the project and its results all over the duration and behond.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS\r\na.

They are aged 15 or 16 and will go for three weeks to Tafalla in Spain, in june 2019.\r\nIt is a real advantage for these young people of 16, who change remarkably both personally and in their social behaviour.\r\nFor the first year: a placement abroad is proposed to the students in the Administration,  Social and Sales classes, European section.\r\nThey will go for three weeks to Athlone in Ireland or to Valencia in Spain, in March 2020.\r\n\r\nFor the second year: a placement abroad is proposed to the students of the Admintration, Sales and Social class, European section. They are aged 18.\r\nThey will go for four weeks to Derry in Ireland or to Valence in Spain, in March 2020.\r\n\r\nFor the second year: a placement abroad is proposed to the students of the Catering class, European section. They are aged 18.\r\nThey will go for four weeks to Derry in Ireland or to Huesca in Spain, in May 2020.\r\nThey will go for four or seven weeks to Derry in Ireland or to Valencia in Spain, in October - November 2019.\r\nCommon goals for all our schools in the Administration, Sales, Social and Catering classes:\r\n- Capacity to adapt in a work team, despite differences in sex, culture or social origin.\r\n- Development of open mindedness and initiative.\r\n- Social and professional integration\r\n- Increased confidence and self-esteem\r\n- Learning vocational and language skills\r\n           \r\nFor our students, learning a language and using it in the professional world is essential to continue studying. Mobility is beneficial for professional integration as the businesses value it. Our students experiment supervised mobility, which very often encourages them to do it again spontaneously and so the probability of working abroad is high.\r\nThe benefits of mobility are more than satisfactory, as follows:\r\n    -  Adaptability, analysis abilities, initiative\r\n    -  Greater confidence and self-esteem\r\n    -  Dealing with another language, culture, local gastronomy\r\n    - Ability to cope with a problem\r\n\r\nThe benefits of mobility can be immediate or delayed\r\nFor young vocational students, mobility enhances personal development as they benefit from very rewarding and challenging experiences.\r\nConsequently, they become more involved in their professional or learning  project and they come out of it better and more experienced.\r\nMoreover, the students commonly experience two work placements abroad.\r\nWe intend to make training periods in European countries - Ireland or Spain- a more extended programme.\r\nMobility allows our students to have access to the European job market.", "https://www.facebook.com/galliagh.womensgroup", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-046088_18"], ["0NA", "\"ENVIE DE REALITE : VIVEZ LA MOBILITE\"", "Foyle International Ltd.", 133791.0, "Reunion Island, a French overseas department located in Indian Ocean, off Madagascar, presents a very specific situation with alarming statistics concerning employment. The unemployment rate has been at 22,4 %, which represents 44 % of the young people aged between 18 and 25 years old. The geographic isolation of the island imposes a certain degree of mobility the young people from Reunion.\r\nOur organization, Mission Locale Sud, is aimed at opening the range of opportunities for this target group. Most of young people are under skilled which means that we must be innovative in providing alternative training solutions, through non-formal education, based on experience and hands-on learning. But here on the island, mobility is not easy to organize.\r\n\r\nThe aims of the project are :\r\n- to provide to young people from the island an opportunity of mobility to discover new horizons\r\n- to nurture an open-mind and curiosity which are needed for the job market, here or elsewhere\r\n- to improve their linguistic skills, which are vital for the tourism industry on the island\r\n- to gain experience in the sector as part of a vocational validation project to strengthen their skills.\r\n\r\nThe project called \"Looking for a change : mobility is for you !\", offers to 30 unemployed young people from Reunion, aged between 18 and 25 years old, the opportunity to be trained via an internship in a European firm (Spanish, Irish or British) for 3 or 6  month stay. The project caters for a linguistic preparation, intercultural workshops and vocational issues before departure. The project also caters for a follow up after the mobility to increase the value of this experience. The supervision of the training program, with preparatory priliminary visits and the movement of professionnals guides for assesments, bring garantees of educational quality to the project.\r\n\r\nThe expected impacts, in addition to the advantages for the participants, are to promote the European mobility as a tool for integration and to foster our organisation in the field of mobility and to thus develop new projects.", "http://www.foyle.eu", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-046860_1"], ["0NA", "Avec Erasmus+, j'optimise mes comp\u00e9tences !", "Foyle International Ltd.", 52073.0, "Ici & Ailleurs is a continuing education organization dedicated to international mobility and language learning. Opened in August 2015, its creation is the result of the experience of its two founders in the fields of international mobility, training, pedagogy and integration. Located on the island of Reunion, in the Indian Ocean, we are part of the French ultra-peripheral region of Europe. Reunion Island has a particularly high unemployment rate : 22.4%. The labor market and the supply of training are insufficient to absorb all young people leaving the school system every year.\r\nThe inadequacy of the training offer of the Reunion area makes particularly sensitive the post-baccalaureate orientations. Each year, nearly 500 young people from Reunion find themselves without a post-bac solution and have to wait for the next school year to hope to resume their training. By default, some people take the path to University or start a higher education training which does not motivate them in any way. Many dropouts are to be deplored.\r\nThis experimental project has the primary objective of proposing a support program aimed at facilitating the return to qualified training and entry into the job market via European mobility. It includes an orientation and preparatory course for mobility, a long-term immersion in a company ( about 4 months / ErasmusPro) and a work of recognition of prior learning and profiling.\r\n10 young people, who left the school system in June 2018, and who are not enrolled in qualified training will benefit from this programme. The group will be vocational trainees for the duration of their Erasmus + course.\r\nThe aims of the ErasmusPro project are threefold:\r\n- To strengthen the assets of the public so that they optimize their skills to integrate higher education, qualified training, or directly a through work, alternately or not.\r\n- To make useful this year of \"latency\" or transition, between the school leaving system and a possible return of training in the following year. The discovery of the world of work, let alone in a foreign environment, will help them to validate their project.\r\n- To experiment a project by setting up a management of activities and a very specific and high quality framework to be able to renew and develop these types of opportunities.\r\n\r\nIn this perspective of quality, we built the project by focusing on the quality of learning sought during this long mobility and on the recognition of prior learning. To meet this ambition of quality, we have included in the project: preliminary preparatory visits, a preparation of mobilities and specific learners, guides and tools and measures of assessment of acquired skills.\r\n\r\nThe most desired and expected impact is that learners will benefit from:\r\n- an insertion after this training, either via an entry into qualified training at the start of the 2019 school year, or via the signing of a work contract, alternating or seasonal or with a fixed or indefinite duration.\r\n- a lasting impact on openness to the world that would allow them to easily envisage a new mobility, this time independently and by themselves. \u2013 dynamic mobility that must continue, with the launch of an \"Erasmus + community\".\r\n\r\nIn addition, the project is experimental so its evaluation and results will guide our organization on the development of new mobility projects, as well as strategic partnerships.", "http://www.foyle.eu", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-046878_1"], ["7DF", "Immersing the European working Iife for tomorrow", "North West Academy of English", 94344.0, "CENFIM annually in its training activities handles with about 3.000 young people in qualifications actions (mainly in the field of apprenticeships in alternation training) and technological specialization. This application, similar to other mobility projects that CENFIM had continuously lead, has the same objectives and expectations as always, which are inherent to this European Initiative: Encouraging the growth of professional and personal skills in trainees, extending trainees perspective in relation to professional practice, and strengthening the social, cultural and linguistic dimension through mobility experience provided in other European contexts , giving them a greater sense of European identity and citizenship and contributing to a greater potentiality for mobility in the European Union.\r\nThis Organization also believes that the opportunity to develop Mobilities in foreign countries reaches two most relevant purposes: first, promote the excellence in learning, by means of enabling merit reward, that stimulates a greater achievement from the trainees in the learning process, as it would be applied objective selection criteria (e.g. to distinguish the winners of the internal national competition of professions, which are referred in this application); and, second, enhancing professional skills and providing new opportunities for employment in Europe, although our trainees have full employability, in our professional sector, in Portugal. \r\nConsidering the national dimension of CENFIM (13 training centers across the country  and in industrial areas) and the mentioned number of trainees, this project applies for 34 mobility/internships for periods of four weeks, in seven countries, in various metallurgical and electromechanical sector professional competence, that represents a high level of diversity and a qualitative factor considered by us. \r\nWe are aware of the impact that these mobility experience brings, as many previous Participants witnessed that, over the local communities in which CENFIM has their training centres, it is imperative that we decentralize this project, i.e., to distribute over various regions of our country, so to spread as much as possible the effect of the impact of these rewarding experience, not only in regard of profession but also of social and cultural benefits. \r\nRegarding to Staff the purpose of these mobilities will also be focused on the promotion of professional competence, as well as cultural and social ones, that these contact opportunities with different contexts and European organizations, would provide. More specifically, we intend that these mobilities would contribute to identify different training practices (in management model and in strategies and teaching resources), and to improve the perception of various industrial contexts in the host countries; and their responses for the training requirements. At the organization level, it is intended to gain new and more competences; and to identify new areas of cooperation aimed at project and paths for innovations in the fields of pedagogy, technical skills, and didactic, which could be shared between several Partner entities in the future.   \r\nIt is hopefull that the mobilities of the staff in general would coincide with the first week of the trainees\u2019. This practice has been followed in previous projects and has proved efficiency in the accompanying of the trainees in their first days, in order to help their integration and to deal with some logistic and administrative subjects close to their host Entities. \r\nIt is important to mention that Host Entities that are willing to collaborate in this application are all VET entities with whom CENFIM keep close relations of cooperation in several previous projects, resulting that several factors essential to the quality of Mobility: reliability, availability and professionalism in their tasks; they are entities in the training sector of CENFIM, so they are able to understand and to integrate the suitable activities regarding the professional needs of the Participants; they have, like us, a strong connection with the business sector and with industrial companies, in particular, and this can enable a meaningful part of the trainees\u2019 mobility be on-the-job training (work placements), what we consider very important to enrich the mobilities.\r\nIn order to prepare, monitor and evaluate Mobility, CENFIM has formalized a set of standardized activities and internal procedures, as a result of the improvement of previous experiences in Mobility projects, which are facilitators of the success of these projects, which are in line with the European Commission Recommendation No. 20066/91.", "http://www.northwestacademy.net", null, "erasmus_2018-1-PT01-KA102-046930_5"], ["7AL", "Growing Together - Uraskasvua yhdess\u00e4: ulkomaanjaksoja nuorille, aikuisille ja oppissopimusopiskeijoille", "NORTH WEST REGIONAL COLLEGE", 126798.0, "Who?\r\nGrowingTogether \u2013Erasmus+ -KA1 -project is aimed at Turku Vocational Institute\u2019s students of various fields.

Establishing the international study path and especially the optional course of international studies via long training periods abroad\r\n9. Improoving an evaluation questionnaire, in order to further develop international studies and thus better meet the needs of students and working life.\r\n\r\nWhere and when?\r\nThe length of student exchanges is usually between 30-60 days, and staff exchanges one week (an apprentice student who is also an entrepreneur is able to complete a two-week  long mobility for practical reanosn). We aim at carrying out the staff exchanges simultaneously with the student exchanges, so that the students will receive support and guidance also from their home country when doing their international exchange. The exchanges will take place between autumn 2018 and spring 2020. \r\nThe length and timing depend on each field (and also each individual student), curriculum and schedule. The exchange period abroad will be fully taken into consideration in the student\u2019s degree. This is possible thanks to the international study path. The teachers and other staff members will receive a report of participation. The target countries and the schools, as well as other partners in them, have been chosen so that they support the strategic alignment of Turku Vocational Institute. The partners act responsibly and they have understanding about the Finnish educational system. They are also interested in developing the possibilities for exchanges in co-operation with Turku Vocational Institute.

In this application we are introducing new curriculum areas Beauty and Science and we are re-visiting entrepreneurship. \r\n\r\nEMOKS will provide learners the opportunity to undertake a 2 week mobility period in an European country either in a vocational institutes or within a company.  As the project title suggests the learner will gain opportunities to develop their knowledge and skills through training and assessment in their vocational and professional competences and will enhance their employability skills.  \r\n\r\nThe main development for NWRC in this year's application is the inclusion of ErasmusPRO long term mobilities.  We hope to offer high quality and economically relevant training opportunities to improve the skills level of our students.  The curriculum areas we have selected to pilot this new activity are IT, Creative Industries & Hospitality.  Some of the courses we run in the college in these areas require a compulsory work experience - these can be difficult to secure either through a lack of opportunities in the area or a saturation of the number of placements being sought from companies.  \r\n\r\nWe include ECVET principles into our mobilities, addressing vocational education with an integrated approach, building on relationships with our partners as we develop learning outcomes that meet our learners\u2019 needs and sharing of experiences.\r\nLearner mobility activities will provide European training experiences to students, many of whom have special needs or fewer opportunities who may not appreciate how adaptable their learning needs are within the context of the wider EU.  The training experience will show them that neither their special needs nor Europe places boundaries on the opportunities that are open to them, in an effort to encourage them to continue with the learning and enhance their employability skills.  \r\n\r\nThe College development plan seeks to encourage outward mobility.  Learning ouctomes achieved on these projects will benefit the local economy and work towards the strategies set out by our local council for better education and training of its people to compete in global markets. We want the project to focus also on entrepreneurship, participants will be encouraged to develop these skills and use their skills to drive the economy forward.", "http://www.nwrc.ac.uk", "NORTH WEST REGIONAL COLLEGE", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047390_coordinator"], ["8NA", "EUROVOCATION\u00b418", "Computer Warehouse", 52254.0, "The large majority of the students that are graduated from a vocational training course have the challenge of finding a job.

This element is fundamentally important, since youth is one of the collectives which is suffering most from unemployment (which is maybe the most extended way of social exclusion), fighting also against the inequality gap, strongly installed in Spain from the beginning of the economic crisis.\r\n\r\nFaced with the increase in migration movements during the past years, the aim is also to give support to the integration of youth through giving them opportunities of development quality VETs and the promotion of the values and models of a European citizenship, as another element to achieve via this project. From our point of view this is the best way of showing the EU achievements in the fields of the European rights and freedoms for their citizens, by allowing the new generations to get first-hand knowledge, through a successful program, as is the Erasmus+.\r\n\r\nThe target group of this project will be young adults aged between 18 and 35, already graduated on VET within 12 months before the starting point of the mobilities by any of the formative centers in the Consortium. The total amount of mobilities will be of 36; participants will develop their period of internship within the hosting organisations, already contacted in Malta, United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal and Austria, and there will be a permanent contact between these organisations and the intermediaries in each of the destination countries.\r\n\r\nGiven the great importance of the proposed goals, the organizations taking part of the Consortium will provide the participants with the appropriate tools for acting in the European society in the best way, during the development of their professional training, and also after coming back to Logro\u00f1o.\r\n\r\nThe mobilities imply for these young adults participants in the project, the possibility of experiencing in a direct way the common values to all the Member States of the EU, in which it finds its basis. The internalization of values like tolerance, integration and the opportunities for people in disadvantage is constituted as a success factor in achieving a real European society.", "http://www.derrycity.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA102-048860_28"], ["7DF", "Vocation - Experience - Passion - Opportunity -2", "North West Academy of English", 129829.0, "Zesp\u00f3\u0142 Szk\u00f3\u0142 nr 8 w Szczecinie is applying for the EU project for the second time (vocational education and training funding for learners).

(The CEFR considers this skill at the same level as oral and written comprehension and expression in language teaching. However, there is little literature on the subject compared to the latter).\r\n\r\n\r\n- The international projection of the institution. The EOI Sagunt is part of a national network of public language teaching centres of recognized pedagogical and certification prestige. It is a unique institution at European level, given that there is no similar official institution at this level depending on the different Ministries of Education of European countries. For this reason we believe that we can contribute our experience as an institution and, at the same time, learn from the management and organization of other types of language teaching centres in different European countries.\r\n- In the framework of the management and also of the methodology, a recurring concern of those responsible for teaching adults is the low level of motivation and loyalty, and the high school dropout rate of adults.\r\n- On the other hand, teachers and management teams need to establish European collaboration networks that allow them to approach:\r\n                   -Business\r\n                   -Schools\r\n                   -Social agents\r\n                   -Local authorities\r\nThis will give them the possibility of being in contact with innovative projects, knowing other educational and productive systems, sharing good practices, and knowing the European policies that are being applied, improving the teaching quality that they carry out in the educational centres and helping to combat youth unemployment and early school leaving.\r\nThe project is directly linked to the 2020 strategy and agrees on strategic priorities to help the EU and its member states generate a higher level of employment, productivity and social cohesion.\r\n\r\nFor this we intend:\r\n- to get to know the operation of centres that teach language education in other countries of the European Union\r\n- to get to know the procedures used by other teaching centres and management teams to advise, supervise and evaluate the teaching praxis, which will improve the work they perform in the EOI of Sagunt.\r\n- to know and analyse the relationship between companies and educational centres in other countries of the European Union.\r\n-to establish networks of contacts that allow students and teachers to make training stays.\r\n-to get to know the educational policies and educational systems of the United Kingdom, France and Italy.\r\n-To learn from the different methodologies and language learning strategies used in the United Kingdom, France and Italy.\r\n-To learn from the approach to drop-out of adults in the United Kingdom, France and Italy.\r\n-To learn from the methodological approaches regarding linguistic mediation in the United Kingdom, France and Italy.\r\n-To improve linguistic competence\r\n-To improve ICT competence\r\n-To get to know about the concept of European dimension and Single European labour market.\r\n-To create a network of contacts with entities from other countries for future collaborations.\r\n\r\nThe LANGUAGE LEARNING IN THE EUROPEAN CONTEXT.

The participants come from all different departments of our college which is a pure business and commercial college.      is not an exchange program. We go there for learning purposes and get certificates of the AHK at the end and the title of \"Kaufmann International\".\r\nThe project is run in two flows:\r\n1st flow: 14.05.17 - 03.06.17\r\n2nd flow: 03.06.18 - 23.06.18\r\n\r\n1st flow: 19.05.19 - 08.06.19\r\n2nd flow: 10.05.20 - 30.05.20\r\n   b,  Aim of the project:\r\n        Participants are expected to improve their professional, linguistic, cultural skills.\r\n\r\n2. There is a learning program with our partner institution in Spain (Vic)  for 16 apprentices which takes place yearly. It is especially for freight forwarding, wholesale and industrial clerks. In the ongoing year the financial European support has already been granted till 2019. The flow will take place for the 5th time.\r\n\r\n3. There are 2 apprentices who are doing an additional 2-weeks placement with Schenker in Barcelona. It supplements the course mentioned in No.2.\r\n\r\n4. In March 2018 we organize a teacher training course for 16 teachers of our school. This is a training programme for our coleagues who are also teaching English at our institution. It will take place in the \"European College of Business & Management\" in London and will last for a week A visit is planned to the MidKent College in Kent and we hope that the colleagues can study  the vocational educational  training and apprenticeship of our neighbour country and ameliorate the knowledge about GB. They should also imprive their linguistic competences and get new ideas for didactic methods. We would like to repeat and implement this program and so we apply again for funding to do another flow in the academic year 2019/2020. We also intend to invite colleagues of other schools as well.\r\n\r\nFor the oncoming year we are planning new projects:\r\n\r\n5.We will go to Northern Ireland to Derry with 16 of our colleagues and we will visit the NorthWest Regional Col. in Derry. We hope that there will develop an exchange programme done with techers as lond as this will be possible under the white elephant of Brexit. Northernirish colleagues are kindly invited to come to our school and also visit companies in our area to get to know and learn more about our dual system.\r\n\r\n6. However, we also intend to create a new program for students of our office management department. They should attend school there as well as attending companies to see and to get to know different styles of vocational learning. We do apply for 2 flows - 1 in each year - for a number of 10 students each year. Up to now office management has always been a group which did not participate in any European programs and we would like to change this and integrate them as well and offer them possibilities to experience other cultures and get to know other traditions. We very much hope that we also will be able to host students from the NWRC to create a real exchange of students.\r\n\r\n7. We were lucky to find another new partner in the Netherlands in Alkmaar, the Horizon College. 9 teachers, 7 from our college BS4 and 2 from our neighbouring college 5 are going to Alkmaar in October to prepare a students\u00b4programme together with our partner colleagues. We intend to work out special modules where we can teach the group coming from 2 different countries a common topic which is valuable for both of them. This could be done in the frame of ECVET.\r\n\r\n8.5 apprentices from sales executive will be going to the netherlands to do a three-weeks internship in the Netherlands. Our institution is already hosting 2 students from the Netherlands to help them finding placements in our companies of freight forwarding. Sending apprentices abroad to fulfil placements is new for our school. We haven\u00b4t done this before as companies in the dual system are always reluctant to release staff to be abroad over a longer period of time. However, times have changed in favour of us and more and more enterprises seem to support a three weeks stay abroad. Our partner in the Netherl. is extremely reliable and we are convinced that our program will be successful and it will be expandable and developable.\r\n\r\nUp to now we were lucky to win and add new partnerships and we experienced a high amount of support in doing this.

The proposal is part of the already launched and consolidated process of internationalization that sees the Institutes involved in many projects in cooperation with other schools or public and private organizations, aimed at fostering the European dimension of formal and non-formal learning for an employment policy addressed to the international context.\r\nThe project originates from an analysis of the training needs expressed by the Veneto manufacturing sector in relation to the introduction and progressive affirmation within the production processes and to the organization of work of changes related to Smart Manfacturing.\r\nTo fully exploit the potentials related to the enhancement of the local territory, the Consortium members need to support a new development cycle based on the principles of competitiveness, technological innovation and quality that can only be successful with adoption of a strategy focused on an international vision of the didactic-training actions.\r\nThe project therefore intends to offer an answer to the increasingly urgent challenges that affect the regional territory:\r\n- increasing the technical and professional skills of the new professional profiles required in the Smart Specialization sectors\r\n- contributing to the employability of young people by offering training experiences to develop communication skills in foreign languages and interpersonal skills in multicultural contexts.\r\nThe above is consistent with the Research and Innovation Strategy for the Smart Specialization of the Veneto Region which promotes the development of human resources and their international mobility also through the establishment of skills ecosystems.\r\nIn this perspective, the project aims to provide 131 students with the opportunity to undertake a 4-week period of training mobility abroad recognized as ASL (in line with the provisions of Law 107/15). Technical-technological (Mechanics / Mechatronics, Electronics, Informatics, Logistics) and economic (AFM, RIM and SIA) study curricula are involved and targets industrial profiles and related support services. The destinations in the UK, IE, FR, DE, ES and FI are confirmed and a new country and partner has been introduced in Poland, extending the opening to the East already started in 2016.\r\nThe mobility flows will be preceded by an intense phase of pedagogical and linguistic preparation. The language communication skills will be exercised both in curricular programs and through awareness-raising of the participants towards commitment and self-learning (through the use of the OLS), but alsowith strengthening activities within the educational offer.\r\nThe scouting activity will be carried out in collaboration with foreign partners in the different countries through the involvement of companies operating mainly in Smart Specialization fields belonging to the Consortium's already consolidated network and new companies intercepted also through the CCIAA network abroad.

Included are also 40 staff (in 2017 this was 45 staff).\r\nIn the Erasmunplus guidelines for call 2018 is ErasmusPro described. From the total flow of 420 students, the group of long-term students is 83.\r\nWe want to mention the following developments regarding the mobility of students and staff:\r\n\u2022 The interest in Germany and the German language is increasing: in call 2017 we mentioned 125 mobilities to Germany, in the call 2018 150 students are involved.\r\n\u2022 Rijn IJssel concludes that currently mainly students of level 3 and 4 step forwards to participate in mobility programs. In the perspective of the view of Erasmusplus that all students should be granted the possiblity to participate, a plan has been developed focussing on the group of Social care-students level 2, to develop an Orientation\u2013mobility program. This example of Social Inclusion will be developed together with host North West Regional College (NWRC) in Londonderry. Keypoint will be the workingmethod with tandems of UK and Dutch students while working on Orientation on the professional field of Social care, visit Social care-institutes and follow classes. In the preparation and organisation special attention will be set on an extended preparation program including language and solic guidance during the mobility.\r\n\u2022 The workingmethod of the so-called Language-internship (Taalstage), in which the learning of the language is applied directly to assignments in companies, is successful. It is now applied to programs in the English, Spanish and German language.\r\n\u2022 Rijn IJssel aims to connect staff mobility to support innovation-topics.

In addition, former North-and South-Tr\u00f8ndelag have own strategic documents that underline the work of internationalization in  secondary education and in mobility projects. In the economic plan for Tr\u00f8ndelag county municipality, it says that \"The county municipality will facilitate internationalization to be a tool in the learning work for both pupils and apprentices in upper secondary education.\" Further in the document, Fylkesplan for Tr\u00f8ndelag 2018-2030, Tr\u00f8ndelagsplanen, is referred to as the most important basis for discussing overall goals and strategies for Tr\u00f8ndelag. Internationalization is referred to as one of four main topics in this plan.\r\n\r\nThrough the project MMN, Tr\u00f8ndelag County Municipality wishes to achieve:\r\n- a strong regional approach of internationalization at training offices and World of Work through a strong focus on employee mobility in this project, engage more companies into mobility in order to  get international competence and knowledge of Erasmus + mobility.\r\n- together with actors from the county and tWorld of Work carry out mobility for students, apprentices, vocational teachers, instructors and other professionals associated with vocational education.\r\n\r\nWe wish to ensure that schools, training offices and World of Work  across the former countyes boaders  will increase their competence  about internationalization as a tool in professional training and development of industries.\r\n\r\nThe activity level in the MMN project is otherwise adapted to the new county and is based on charter applications from former North- and South-Tr\u00f8ndelag.

For students, stays will last from 2-4 weeks, while the stays for the apprentices will in most cases last for about 3 months. For students, the placement will be linked to the subject of vocational education, while apprenticeship will be part of the apprenticeship. Employee mobility will vary from 4-6 days.\r\n\r\nOne of the objective of mobility in MMN is to fase for business needs for international competence. Through participation in the project, apprentices, students and professionals will be given the opportunity to increase their competence, both professionally, culturally, linguistically and personaly. These are key values within international competence that are transferable to other situations of life. These experiences will therefore be valuable contributions to the individual's lifelong learning process and useful competence also for fellow students, colleagues and workplaces in their home country.\r\n\r\nAnother objective of the project is to develop further the international work in vocational education and training in Tr\u00f8ndelag, in line with the rest of the planning work in the new county.\r\n\r\nA third objective of the project is to share knowledge about ECVET in the county: utilize several years of experience from the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag county, which is a National ECVET Expert. The use of ECVET tools should give Erasmus Mobility recognition and transfer of learning between different learning environments and across borders and systems in Europe. Ecvet methodology and practical approach will contribute to placement, professional education and high-quality study stays. Through this, Tr\u00f8ndelag county municipality will achieve a strong regional approach in companies for international mobility as approved part of education in Norway with assessed and approved sub-education from abroad.\r\n\r\nThere is a clear expectation that the participants increase their international competence through MMN and that their individual learning outcomes will contribute to internationalization at learning arenas and in companies in Tr\u00f8ndelag.

The students study in the apprenticeship fields of innkeeper and shop-assistant and in the study fields of catering, computer mechanics, and engineering. The project is focused on students developing their professional, linguistic, cultural-social skills, and competencies in the vocational training in the sphere of techniques and services, and equally the project is focused on teachers obtaining new experiences and improving their professional skills.\r\nThe internship will take place in three countries and in four partner organizations. \r\nIn the Czech Republic, The Secondary School Of Hotel Services And Gastronomy in Prague organizes five-week internships for 4 students of the gastronomy field (waiter, cook) in the hotels and restaurants in Prague, and The Secondary Technical School in \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem arranges nine-day mobility for 2 teachers of the technical fields and three week mobility for 6 students of the technical fields who will work in the engineering companies and in companies focused on for a computer service.\r\nIn Northern Ireland, The North West Academy of English in Londonderry secures four-week internship for 6 students. The computer mechanics will participate in the management and maintenance of computers and their networks in the companies. Students of the engineering industry will carry out practice in engineering firms and in machine workshop. Students of gastronomy fields (waiter, cook) will work in restaurants and different departments of the catering industry and shop-assistants in the shop with a wide variety of items.\r\nIn Italy, the partner organization Azzurra cooperative sociale arranges internship for 6 teachers of gastronomy fields.\r\nOpposite plan in the application for the charter we have increased a number of student by 4. There are especially students of engineering fields \u2013 either an apprenticeship tool maker or study field of engineering. Fastened cooperation with The Secondary Technical School in \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem promises high quality practice for our students in its partner firms which our teachers attended within the scope of mobility. We want also our students \u2013 school leavers to take part in mobility. \r\nAccompanying persons take part in all three turns. Most participants will be underage and also there are students who come from social disadvantageous background that is why the presence of accompanying people is inevitable. Parents and also management of school ask for the presence of accompanying people because the school is responsible for its students. Accompanying persons will monitor student practice and solve unforeseen situations, possible discords and requirements which are occurred during the mobility. \r\n\r\nThe main aim of the project is to acquire new professional skills and personality growth for participants in order to improve opportunities to make them useful in the domestic and European labourmarket. Additionally, teachers will receive new experiences, skills for secondary technical schooling and with that they will improve the quality of professional education at our school.\r\nAnother aim of the project is to build up the attraction and sense of technical education,especially for participants of the internship and secondarily for their schoolmates, colleagues, parents and more general public. This is conducted by means of dissemination of project results to motivate the other students, tutors, teachers of vocational practice for lifelong learning to improve the quality of education and their personality growth, and increase attractiveness of fields in the sphere of crafts and services, and to raise credit of The Secondary Comprehensive School Techniques and Services in its region.\r\nThe participants will make presentations in which they will present what professional competencies they got from the mobility. This is done with the aid of various activities and products: brochures, magazines, articles in local periodicals, photography exhibition. We want to motivate other students and teachers for the foreign professional mobility, and also motivate students at primary schools to study at our school.

Hyria operates in the rapidly growing Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Riihim\u00e4ki region which has nearly 90 000 residents, 34 000 jobs, and 5000 companies of which many operate internationally. \r\n \r\nThe development of international operations is very important to Hyria and therefore internationalisation was one of the focus points in its strategy and operations for the period of 2011-2017. In a new strategy internationalisation is not mentioned as a focus point, but it takes in the account of changing needs of workers\u2019 skills and competence due to the e.g. digitalisation, urbanisation, climate change and globalisation. Hyria strategy is not set for the specific timeframe, but it can be modified if necessary due to fast change of the operational environment.\r\n\r\nInternational activities at Hyria are aiming to increase our students, teachers and work life partners\u2019 professional and international skills by offering them a possibility to participate in the international mobility programs. By enabling our students and teachers to acquire new skills and knowledge the quality of education increases as well as student\u2019s employment opportunities. At the same time, Hyria fosters the co-operation with the world of work and serves the needs of the area\u2019s working life by producing a highly skilled workforce. \r\n\r\nObjectives and expected results\r\n\r\nThe most important objective is to increase the students\u2019 professional skills, knowledge and attitudes by emphasizing the acquisition and development of key competencies of lifelong learning.\r\n \r\nThe exchange period comprehensively enables students to develop the key competencies which are needed for personal fulfilment and development, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment. During the exchange period students encounter new situations; they apply already gained knowledge and language skills in practice; learn to use new technological solutions and platforms while communicating with their teachers, friends and family in the home country; and they compare working methods, the acquisition of technical solutions, the level of sustainable development and legislative issues in the host country.\r\n \r\nIn addition, students are able to develop international and personal capabilities such as cultural awareness, language skills, interpersonal skills, individual growth, independence and the ability to work in a multicultural environment. For teachers the project activities give a possibility to update their professional knowledge and understanding of current requirements of a working life.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of this experience the students and teachers\u2019 professional identity gets stronger, and they are able to find out more field-specific professional development possibilities. It enriches the education in many ways, as well as encourages students\u2019 to entrepreneurship and language learning. \r\n\r\nThe second objective is to continue the development of international activities at Hyria. In this time the development activities are focused on the following issues: \r\n\r\n- The evaluation system of international activities will be improved. \r\n- Mobility statistics will be improved. The implemented periods are compared with the estimated ones by departments and target groups.  \r\n- The organisation of international activities at Hyria (better involvement of adult learners).\r\n- Inclusion of international activities into implementation plans of the new curricula.\r\n- Developing an international learning pathway for students.\r\n- Shifting from short-term co-operation agreements to long-term ones (MOU, LOI).\r\n- Creating a centralized mobility process, instructions and orientation to teachers and staff members. \r\n- Updating the programme for international activities. \r\n\r\nAs a result of these activities the mobility periods are implemented according the ECVET procedures, the procedures of international activities are improved, internationalisation at home is expanded, internationalisation is spread into the different departments and students. In addition to that, the transparency of student guidance is improved (blogs as learning diaries) and we have a stronger cooperation with companies. \r\n\r\nMobility\r\n\r\nThis application comprises 61 student mobility periods covering 25 different vocational qualifications. Exchange periods are offered to Hyria\u2019s second or third year students (young), but also to adult students and recent graduates can participate. 5 selected students will receive additional monetary support (exceptional costs) for living and cultural expenses due to the fewer opportunities (economical). \r\n\r\nThe mobility of staff and world of work (22 persons) is connected to teacher/expert exchanges, visiting new partners and work placements for quality reasons. There will be also 4 people invited to teach and guide Hyria\u2019s students of the health care sector.", "http://www.foyle.eu", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FI01-KA116-046772_8"], ["7AL", "2016-1-FI01-KA109-022865", "NORTH WEST REGIONAL COLLEGE", 80187.0, "In the strategy of Kainuu Vocational College internationalization is regarded as an important part of the development work in the college.

T\u00e4m\u00e4 johtui osaltaan uuden organisaation aiheuttamista k\u00e4ynnistysvaikeuksista, ja toisaalta siit\u00e4, ett\u00e4 suurin osa asiantuntijaliikkuvuuksista tapahtui Luksian koordinoimassa Erasmus+ KA2 strategisessa kehitt\u00e4mishankkeessa sek\u00e4 OPH:n tukemien kv-verkostojen puitteissa (KEVA, ChiNet, Kanada-verkosto). Osa viime vuonna haetuista asiantuntijaliikkuvuuksista siirtyy siis ensi lukuvuonna toteutettavaksi. Auto- ja logistiikka-alalla on suunnitelmissa luoda ja kehitt\u00e4\u00e4 uusia yhteisty\u00f6kumppanuuksia. Luksian tavoitteena on lis\u00e4t\u00e4 huomattavasti asiantuntijoiden liikkuvuuksia eri aloilla ja sit\u00e4 kautta innostaa lis\u00e4\u00e4 opiskelijoita kv-jaksoille.

Olemme kuitenkin aloittamassa uusia mahdollisia kumppanuuksia mm. irlantilaisten, portugalilaisten ja espanjalaisten oppilaitosten kanssa, ja asiantuntijajaksot ovat siin\u00e4 mieless\u00e4 hyvin perusteltuja.", "http://www.foyle.eu", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FI01-KA116-046896_9"], ["7DF", "Experi\u00eancias Profissionais", "North West Academy of English", 75790.0, "Abstract\r\n\r\n     The qualification of human resources and the guarantee of certified professional skills are the current requirements of a society marked by globalization and by scientific and technological progress. Therefore, school must provide an effective response in terms of education and training.\r\n      Our EDUCATIONAL PROJECT defines \u201cthe transnational mobility as one of the strengths of our educational policy, particularly regarding Trainings\u201d targeting our students in Vocational Courses and \u201clong term local, regional or national partnerships, and more recently international ones, with multiple scientific, political, cultural, social and business institutions\u201d.\r\n\r\n       The application for the Erasmus+ Program (which was unanimously approved by the Pedagogical Council of  january 7, 2018) aims to create an opportunity window to promote the mobility of students and staff, fostering a culture of tolerance and broadening horizons by the (re)cognition of other realities. However, the Agrupamento de Escolas Tomaz Pelayo also defends the principle that all students should have the opportunity of mobility, irrespective of their social or economic background, concerning the importance of these experiences, not only in technical and scientific learning but also in linguistic, cultural and social aspects. Thus, and given the economic situation of the Ave Valley region, most of these students would never have the opportunity to train abroad and live such an enriching experience.\r\n\r\n      The project \u00abPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES\u00bb presented here, with the activity \u201cVET learners in companies\u201d, will allow students who are in the 12th year of vocational courses a unique experience of Training and simultaneously develop basic language skills for their life path.\r\n       Students who will benefit from this project will be the second or the third year of Vocational Courses (Year 11 or 12 - Level III), of the following Courses:\r\nMechatronics Technician\r\nSecretarial technician\r\nTechnical Industrial Maintenance / Metalworking\r\nElectrical Technician\r\nTechnician of Electronics, Automation and Computers\r\nManagement Technician / Management Support\r\nComputer Systems Management and Programming Technician\r\nThermal Technician\r\nAdmnistrative technician\r\n        The school currently has 320 students in its professional courses, in 9 different courses.

Host organisations are from Spain, Great Britain, Norway, Germany, Malta, Sweden, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands and Portugal. There are 24 teacher mobilities also included from which 14 is responsible teacher for student's training periods, 4 special needs teacher/ accompanying persons and 4 teachers for advanced planning visit.  Additionally, we are applying 4 mobilities in teacher/training assignment for foreign lecturers from partner companies.\r\n\r\nParticipants study vocational basic, further and special qualifications. They practice their professional skills and some basic vocational qualification student will perform a vocational skills demonstration abroad. 2017-1-FI01-KA109-034916 continues Raseko's OPSM projects where students has performed several work-based-learning period abroad and tested skill demonstrations. Raseko will continue testing skill demonstration abroad in this new project. Raseko will test new local offered learning unit for international Work-Based-Learning which is created based on new VET legislation in Finland and also for new Raseko's international strategy where is a aim that all student will achieve one study module when being abroad.  The learning outcomes will be evaluated based on ECVET principals (knowledge, skill, competence and lifelong learning) by the work instructor, student him/herself and responsible teacher (local and teacher from Raseko). Gained non-formal learning will also be recognize into student's studies. In Autumn 2018 we will offer student's own individual study path (international study path) and local offered study module. \r\n\r\nDuring this project Raseko will have ITSLearning e-learning platform for the student's travel, language and cultural training and vocational training before the period, mentoring during the period and a report training after the period.\r\n\r\nThrough this project Raseko will gain, as an outcome, skills demonstration tasks and procedures which will be used when developing internship periods abroad and overall quality of the international activities. Raseko gets information on work practices and work cultures in other countries. Through this project Raseko is able to develop ECVET system with the help of host organisations and will be able to further develop mobility periods for special needs students.
