Against this backdrop, the EU-funded project http://www.compass-iapp.eu/ (COMPASS) (Convergence of magnetics and plasmonics through semiconductors) is developing asers that can be integrated with magnetic recording technology and designing antennae to provide and focus the energy on a range of a few tens of nanometres that causes the material to be heated.\n\nThis heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) approach will enable storage densities of 1 terabit per square inch and beyond.\n\nSo far, researchers have developed innovative semiconductor lasers using etching techniques to integrate the laser mirror on a chip. Optimising the pattern transfer process ensures the smoothness of the mirror, resulting in devices with comparable performance to those not integrated on a circuit.\n\nProject work has also been geared to investigating novel strategies for mirror protection with a focus on atomic layer deposition. The first reliability tests are underway. The laser wafer that comprises many layers of materials with varying optical and electrical properties has been modelled using device simulators. The layer compositions and thickness are optimised for high-temperature operation through detailed simulations.\n\nBased on these designs, researchers have successfully processed and characterised a new laser structure that demonstrated excellent performance in terms of output power at high operating temperatures.\n\nThis breakthrough technology revolutionises data storage by further pushing current capacity limits permitting the scaling of data storage in the \u2018cloud\u2019.

Although they are called storage or memory devices, the functionality of such media is deeply rooted in data access and retrieval for processing.

However, many issues must be addressed before a true THz optomagnetic 'revolution' in magnetic recording and information processing can be achieved. In response, scientists initiated the EU-funded project 'Ultrafast all-optical magnetization reversal for magnetic recording and laser-controlled spintronics' (Ultramagnetron).\n\nInvestigators first sought to develop a fundamental understanding of laser-induced magnetisation reversal in nanomagnets smaller than 300 nanometres (nm). Using this knowledge, they developed ways to control the ultrafast (less than 100 picoseconds (ps)) reversal with spatial resolution or localisation on the nano scale, better than 300\u00a0nm. They then turned to improving the speed of magnetisation reversal to less than 1 ps using ultrafast femtosecond laser control.\n\nUltramagnetron greatly advanced the state of opto-nanomagnetism.
