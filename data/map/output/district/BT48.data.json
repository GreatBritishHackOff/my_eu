The EU Strategy Europe 2020 calls up our country to renew its Education and Training systems, to make young people gain competences that are key to economy and the knowledge society, to improve their employability and become an instrument to enforce internationalisation of companies. One of the sectors that characterizes Italy, and that can be a driver of recovery for youth employment is undoubtedly tourism. Mobility can stimulate the ability to innovate, typical of young people, especially those who have had the opportunity to observe cutting edge practices in other countries. It also gives them skills required by the labor market, however, a common strategy is needed among schools and institutions involved to extend this opportunity to as many students as possible.\r\nIn this framework, the Training Agency of the Chamber of Commerce of Rome \u201cForma Camera\u201d is supporting the introduction of a coordinated approach on European mobility for VET students in upper secondary schools, aiming at making mobility a regular part in training curricula and encouraging local actors to cooperate for achieving this goal together, by implementing networking strategies and economies of scale.\r\nTherefore ETHOS wll offering the opportunity to live a work-based learning experience in a EU company abroad for three weeks to 100 students of upper secondary schools in Rome. The mobility will be part of the courses offered by the participating schools, beneficiaries will be recognized the competences acquired abroad in their curricula through the use of Europass and the ECVET. Participants will acquire professional competences in a regional economy leading sector such as the tourism, but also key competences such as learning to learn, interpersonal, intercultural, linguistic and personal autonomy, initiative, problem solving, and confidence with the working environment: the most requested by the European and local labor market.\r\n\r\nApart from Forma Camera which represents the link between education and local companies, the ETHOS consortium include 4 upper secondary schools in the province of Rome which are acknowledge for their innovative educational programmes and the iMove network, an association generated by the Leonardo LLP network with the same name, which gathers VET mobility consortia across Europe with the aim of sharing a working methodology to reach the 6% target set by ET2020.

The expected actions will be focused mainly on the realization  abroad of a learning experience in a company of 5 weeks,  being the first one of preparation and the other 4 of full-time internship. \r\nThe mobility is recognized in the School-Work Alternance system implemented by the schools.\r\nThrough the internship it will be possible to increase competences which are transversally essential: language and digital skills, but also initiative and entrepreneurship spirit, cultural awareness. \r\nDuring the experience, in Italy and abroad, the participants will get to know different \u2018Business storytelling\u2019, told by their protagonists, which will give them the measure of the interweaving of personal, cultural, ethical and structural elements, that contribute to the establishment, running and/or closure of a company.\r\nThis important educational activity will be directed at understanding which key competences, vision and resources are fundamental for the entrepreneurship and ability to run a business by respecting the people and the environment.\r\nThe hosting partners and companies are located in Spain, France, United Kingdom.

A great emphasis will be given to those skills which lead to entrepreneurship as a key factor in supporting coherent choices in studies and in job applications.\r\n\r\nFor the member schools the project represents a drive for innovation in their education approach: it helps strengthen their internationalisation strategy, ranging from improvements in project management and territorial and Europena networking skills to more professionalism of  their key staff (those in charge of international programmes, twinning, traineeships, career guidance and counselling).\r\n\r\nFor their students the project gives better chances for  international work-based learning and intercultural experiences which help their professional growth and personal empowerment and give them better employability chances.\r\n\r\nFor the Coordinator the project supports its mission, deep-rooted in the mutualistic culture of the co-operative economy and turns into measures for the local community 's sake and for social innovation, with a special care for vulnerable target groups.

Also the staff of our cooperative will be trained both directly and indirectly (collaborating with our partners and developing the project). According to ISTAT data, by the end of 2016 are the young those who face more difficulties in finding a job. In fact in Italy the 39,4% of yhem are unemployed. Even if there are many national programs to increase the number of young workers (such as Garanzia Giovani or the programme of school-work alternance) more and more youngsters from 15 to 24 are unemployed. In Central and Southern Italy the situation is even worse, more than 60% of them are unemployed. This can be due to the personal situation of disadvantage experienced by many youngsters in our area which lead them to stop their training and educational path.\r\nWe have spent more than ten years working in the management services for people with dasibility, families and children and we propose a project which can enable those young people living in a situation of disadvantage to live a training experience abroad, after having been taught what they need as far as the foreign culture and language are concerned with the aim of giving them a chance of inclusion in the working world.

Work placement, company visits related to their lines of study, and interaction with Northern Irish and Icelandic youngsters are important elements to fulfill the goal.\r\nThe students from building and construction attend practical classes at Northwest Regional College and English lessons at Foyle International.

These are highly relevant areas, but in which we have low competence at our school. \r\nStudents at health care and social studies will partly attend classes at NWCR and partly have work placement in institutions that are covering their curriculum areas. Some afternoons and/or weekends, the students will participate in planned field trips, including excursions to different spots of historical and cultural interest. Furthermore, there will be arrangements like visits to the cinema and football matches etc.\r\nStudents of arts and crafts will attend practical classes at the Technical College of Reykjavik, where they will participate in trades like tailoring, gold- and silversmith work and hairdressing. Hairdressing is the only option we offer at Olav Duun upper secondary school, and students will thus get familiar with several interesting career paths within their program at The Technical College. \r\nThe students of Climate, Energy and Environmental work will both participate in practical classes at the Technical College and have work placement and training in local plumbing firms.\r\nA cultural program, where the participants will visit famous attractions in and around Reykjavik will be arranged for the whole group on Iceland.

For Reykjavik on Iceland we apply for mobility funding for 20 students and 8 teachers from the department of arts and crafts. 16 students who study climate, energy and environment and 4 teachers from this line of study will also attend.\r\nThe superior goal for all mobility projects is that students improve their academic, linguistic, cultural and social competence through participation in vocational schools in Northern Ireland and Iceland. Work placement, company visits related to their lines of study, and interaction with Northern Irish and Icelandic youngsters are important elements to fulfill the goal.\r\nThe students from building and construction attend practical classes at Northwest Regional College and English lessons at Foyle International. In some of their practical classes, the students learn bricklaying, painting and wallpapering. These are highly relevant areas, but in which we have low competence at our school. \r\nStudents at health care and social studies will partly attend classes at NWCR and partly have work placement in institutions that are covering their curriculum areas. Some afternoons and/or weekends, the students will participate in planned field trips, including excursions to different spots of historical and cultural interest. Furthermore, there will be arrangements like visits to the cinema and football matches etc.\r\nStudents of arts and crafts will attend practical classes at the Technical College of Reykjavik, where they will participate in trades like tailoring, gold- and silversmith work and hairdressing. Hairdressing is the only option we offer at Olav Duun upper secondary school, and students will thus get familiar with several interesting career paths within their program at The Technical College. \r\nThe students of Climate, Energy and Environmental work will both participate in practical classes at the Technical College and have work placement and training in local plumbing firms.\r\nA cultural program, where the participants will visit famous attractions in and around Reykjavik will be arranged for the whole group on Iceland. Excursions include visit to a power plant, where students receive a thorough introduction to topics such as power generation and renewable energy. There have been conversations already, and we hope to welcome students and teachers from the Technical College to our school on a return visit. \r\nAt both NWRC and the Technical College some of our teachers get the opportunity to be auditors. For teachers, this mean being able to learn new teaching and learning methods in addition to materials and tools of which we have little knowledge. English teachers who participate will have the opportunity to visit both language classes and practical classes. This will be a valuable contribution to the FYR project, a project which aims to make the students understand the value and relevance of learning English preparing for their future professional life. \r\nRelationships across borders is an important goal for mobility visits. For teachers it is both a pleasant and advantageous experience meeting colleagues abroad. In addition, the knowledge they acquire will be a positive contribution to our school.\r\nPlanning, testing, interview, work with extensive tasks, reports and presentations after the stay abroad will provide evaluation basis for both the project and the student grades in different subjects, and will also form the basis for documentation and transmission of experiences in and outside our school. \r\nProfessional life has become increasingly international, and it is our belief that the project will help the students in their future career and make them reliable and independent professionals. Our school's main values are formation, human compassion and involvement. We believe students through mobility projects will be positively exposed to these values. An insight into and understanding of other cultures help to lower leves of conflict and increase tolerance, which will be of importance for our students both professionally and privately.", "http://www.foyle.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NO01-KA102-034003_3"], ["7AL", "Global Opportunities for all (International faglig og personlig kompetenceudvikling, ogs\u00e5 for elever med praktisk tilgang til l\u00e6ring)", "NORTH WEST REGIONAL COLLEGE", 37517.0, "The project is one in a historical line of exchanges between Korsor ProduktionsH\u00f8jskole and North West Regional College in Derry, Northern Ireland.

This application, similar to the other  mobility projects that CENFIM had continuously lead, integrates the same objectives and expectations as always,  which are inherent to this European Initiative: Encouraging the growth of professional and personal skills in trainees, extending trainees perspective in relation to professional practice, and strengthening the social, cultural and linguistic dimension through mobility experience provided in other European contexts , giving them a greater sense of European identity and citizenship and contributing to a greater potentiality for mobility in the European Union.\r\nThis Organization also believes that the opportunity to develop Mobilities in foreign countries reaches two purposes that are of most relevant: first, promote the excellence in learning, by means of enabling merit reward, what would  stimulate a greater achievement from the trainees in the learning process, as it would be applied objective selection criteria (e.g. to distinguish the winners of the internal national competition of professions, which are referred in this application); and, second, enhancing professional skills and providing new opportunities for employment in Europe, although our trainees have full employability, in their professional sector, in Portugal, \r\nConsidering the national dimension of CENFIM (13 training centers across different territorial and industrial areas) and the mentioned number of trainees, this project applies for 30 mobility/internships for periods of four weeks, in seven countries, in various metallurgical and electromechanical sector professional competence, what represents a high level of diversity and we consider a qualitative factor. \r\nWe are aware of the impact that these mobility experience, as many previous Participants witnessed that, have over the local communities in which CENFIM has their training centres, it is imperative that we decentralize this project, i.e., to distribute over various regions of our country, so to spread as much as possible the effect of the impact of these rewarding experience, not only in regard of profession but also of social benefits. \r\nRegarding to Staff it is possible to declare that the purpose of these mobilities will also be focused on the promotion of professional competence, as well as on cultural and social ones, that these contact opportunities with different contexts and European organizations, would provide. More specifically, we intend that these mobilities would contribute to identify different training practices (in management model and in strategies and teaching resources), and to improve the perception of various industrial contexts in the host countries; and their responses for the training requirements. At the organization level, it is intended to gain new and more competences; and to identify new areas of cooperation aimed at project and paths for innovations in the fields of pedagogy, technical skills, and didactic, which could be shared between several Partner entities in the future.   \r\nIt is hopefully that the mobilities of the staff in general would coincide with the first week of the trainees\u2019. This practice has been followed in previous projects and that has proved efficient in the accompanying of the trainees in their first days, in order to help their integration and to deal with some logistic and administrative subjects close to their host Entities. \r\nIt is important to mention that Host Entities that are willing to collaborate in this application are all VET entities with whom CENFIM keeps close relations of cooperation in several previous projects, resulting so  several factors that we consider essential to the quality of Mobility: reliability, availability and professionalism in their tasks; they are entities in the training sector of CENFIM, so they are able to understand and to integrate the suitable activities regarding the professional needs of the Participants; they have, like us, a strong connection with the business sector and with industrial companies, in particular, and this can enable a meaningful part of the trainees\u2019 mobility be on-the-job training (work placements), what we consider very important to enrich the mobilities.", "http://www.northwestacademy.net", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PT01-KA102-035665_5"], ["6JL", "VET, BETTER SKILLS, BETTER JOBS", "Betteronics", 175893.0, "The  \"Vet,better,skills,better jobs\" project was created in response to the need of vocational schools to provide their students the opportunity to expand and improve the quality of their training practices in European companies.

This project clearly progresses the NWRC's European Development plan further into Phase 3 on its Phase 5 Plan.   \r\n\r\nThe project is aligned with the objectives of the Erasmus+ Programme in terms of \"equiping young people with knowledge, knowhow, skills and/or competencies.\" The key objectives of E2020 are also relevant in terms of \"addressing skills deficits, technological competition and .... using forums to share best practices, mutual learning and disseminating results\".   All partners are keen to pursue internationalisation within their organisations.  For NWRC, this is now a cornerstone of  the new FE Means Business Strategy for Northern Ireland (January 2016).  \r\n\r\nSeveral curriculum areas will be involved in terms of meeting particular needs of their staff and students.  Students at level 2 and 3 in these areas have to date been reluctant to take up placement opportunities overseas.  For many,  the decision has been based on personal backgrounds where an opportunity like that would be seen to be beyond their means and upbringing or a lack of confidence to travel and work in another country.  The majority of our student demographic would fall under the eligibility criteria for widening participation and those with fewer opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis project provides training for Sport, Motor vehicle, Welder& fabricators, Carpentry, Masonry, Media, Fashion, Early Years, Hair & Beauty, Health & Social Care, Printing, Catering and a large emphasis is placed on students who have special education needs (SEN) and on Essential Skills Literacy & Numeracy.  We have partners across 8 different European countries.  We are collaborating with experienced host partners some we have collaborated on projects beforehand and some new partners which were very successful with excellent feedback from the participants.  All partners have been working with NWRC in shaping and planning the project through preparatory visits and staff exchanges and we are keen to share positive results with all stakeholders in time showing 'growth' for all.\r\n\r\nThe anticipated outcomes are exchange of learning on skills and employability opportunities that will better inform curriculum development, teaching methodologies and assessment practices.  For the students,  there are many opportunities to gain new skills and competences as well as to develop their soft skills such as team-working, confidence and problem-solving.   \r\n\r\nWe also plan, for the first time to implement ECVET principles and use tools and instruments, where relevant,  to improve the quality of placements and make learning more transparent.\r\n\r\n24 students will be travelling to Denmark to re-kinde the partnership and collaboration that was in place with Korsor. on the EXCISE project.   Student participants will be young people with special needs, learning difficulties and disabilities.  \r\nParticipation will provide the students with every opportunity to enhance their potential within a supportive and positive learning environment.

In the light of the expansion of the European market and internationalisation of companies, learning mobility is a key for the improvement of their employability. At the same time, in its strategic framework Education and Training 2020, the EU defines mobility \u201can essential element of lifelong learning and an important means of enhancing people's employability and adaptability\u201d, stating that \u201cperiods of learning abroad \u2014 both within Europe and the rest of the world \u2014 should be the rule rather than the exception\u201d.\r\nIn support to this European framework, the consortium of VET providers applying is willing to  introduce a coordinated approach regarding European mobility for VET students in upper secondary schools, aiming at making mobility a normal part of training curricula and encouraging local actors to achieve this goal together, by implementing networking strategies and economies of scale.\r\nThe project Co.Pro.Mob 2020 fits with the European strategies by offering the opportunity to live a work experience in a EU company abroad of about 5 weeks to 120 students in VET courses of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales province. The mobility will be part of the courses offered by the schools which have joined the consortium, therefore, competences acquired abroad by participants will be recognised in their curricula through the use of Europass and the ECVET. Students in mobility will acquire competences in cutting edge sectors of the regional economy in particular: shipbuilding; constructions and hospitality and catering, but also key competences such as learning-to-learn, relational and intercultural skills, language, as well as autonomy, entrepreneurship, problem solving, understanding of the workplace environment, all of them mostly required by companies nowadays.\r\n\r\nThe consortium is composed by three VET schools representing the in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales province. Alfmed an organisation expert of mobility with many years of experience in the field will share with the consortium all the best practices developed while coordinating KA1 projects.\r\nThe partnership will include 6 partner organisations from 5 EU countries (Italy, Spain, Poland; UK and Germany) which have proven their competences and reliability in previous projects. Besides, European partner organisations have shown the operational capacity needed to find work experiences in line with the training curricula and sector of participants, thus improving the chances for rapid employment after mobility.\r\n\r\nAfter an informative and selection phase, participants will be offered a thorough pre-departure preparation covering language, practical organisation, culture, safety in the workplace, adaptation to a foreign country and to the work environment. Each participant will sign a Learning Agreement specifying objectives, expected results and organisational details of the work experience.\r\n\r\nDuring all their stay abroad, students will be followed by many people: a national tutor, a tutor in the country of destination, a company mentor who will guide them through their learning experience and a mobility coordinator in their school. A follow-up meeting will be arranged after the end of each flow to let participants reflect on the experience and make the most out of their Erasmus+ experience for their future.\r\n\r\nThe project will boost the employability of 120 young people, it is also expected to have an impact on the local educational system. In fact it will improve competences of staff, in order to make mobility easier and more accessible to all those VET providers which do not have the resources or the competences. \r\nLast but not least, the project will represent the beginning of a systemic approach toward internationalisation, aimed involving institutions and local economy in collaborating for modernising the educational system.

Finland is celebrating its 100 year of independence, and S\u00e1mi\u2019s celebrated their 100 year national day at February 6th 2017. While we were thinking the event venue and theme for the exchange, youngsters thought that none of them has visited Lapland before or they don\u2019t know almost anything about northern part of Finland. Soon the theme of S\u00e1mis and arctic nature was getting its shape as the theme of our exchange. We wanted to get to know S\u00e1mis life, culture and environment of arctic areas. Through the theme of all members of each group get familiarized with unknown and partly discriminated minority and its life and circumstances. It is a good way to polarize different cultures living in the same environment and the meaning of nature and wildlife in different cultures. Each other group contains 10 participants except the group from Finland contains 8 participants, in the age between 14 to 20, and gender balance is almost even between the boys and the girls. Backgrounds of participants has many difficulties: participants or their families run a numerous challenges of both physical and mental health problems, poverty, abuse of alcohol or drugs, imprisonment, broken family relationships and lack of confidence in adults.\r\nThe youth exchange will take its place including the travelling day at July 21th till 30th 2017. The first day we will spend in the capital city of Finland, Helsinki. We will be introducing Finns and Finnish lifestyle. Early in the next morning we will be travelling by plane all the way across Finland to Inari, where we will camp until July 30th. We will be preparing the exchange in advance planning visit in Inari the campsite of Vasatokka at June 16th till 19th 2017. At the exchange we will get to know the S\u00e1mis by meeting S\u00e1mis, their culture, history and nature will be shown to us by visiting the museum centrum Siida and cultural centrum Sajos. We get closer to nature by climbing and hiking at the Otsamotunturi, by kayaking the lake Mu\u0111\u0111us and by the bus journeys till Utsjoki and Teno. Food culture will be shown us and we get to prepare our own S\u00e1mi meal and through the exchange will be eating traditional food. Sevettij\u00e4rvi will take us to see arctic village of Skolts, and we get to experience a bit of reindeer herding. Through the exchange we get to do handicraft from materials of what S\u00e1mis has traditionally used: reindeer bones and skin, and we will be making our own souvenir. Everything we will be experiencing will be documented by every member of the group: pictures will be taken, videos will be shot and notes will be made. By the evening time we will get together and sit down to talk about the day and the group-leaders will be asking more questions about what we have learned. All the conversations and documentation of the exchange will be used afterwards when presenting the exchange and its evaluation to the staff of the organizations. By the presentations we can share what we have learned: we will have exhibitions at the youth centers, libraries and other public places. We can share our impacts with colleagues. The understanding between cultures will be increased and the S\u00e1mis and other minorities\u2019 right could be understood more.

During the preparation phase we will organised an APV meeting between 21-23 July 2017 in order to discuss all the details of the project, to share duties, responsibilities and rules and set the final program of activities. The partner groups comes from 2 parts of Europe, UK from the North-West  and Cyprus from the South-East Europe. Those 2 countries are far away and this project will give a perfect chance to young people to meet people from the other corner of Europe, to discuss common issues, to share ideas, to exchange opinions and to make new friends. \r\n\r\nWe will have lectures, team games, workshops and discussion about all the unique cultures that are included under Europe . We are going to make activities with the aim of knowing Europe : quiz, building maps, sport games, round table, open discussions, presenting traditional histories, workshops and outdoor activities. We will have a special day about mixing cultures and combine people from different background.  The main topic of our exchange is discovering cultures and learn new ethics, arts and traditions. During the project we will try to build bridges between the European Youth and we will promote the volunteering and the values of our common future in Europe. Also during the project we will organize intercultural nights where all the partner groups will present their country, their culture, traditional foods, drinks, music and dances. \r\nThe main objectives of this project is to raise awareness of one\u2019s own identity and culture; with the project we want to mix different cultures and cross borders to other traditions, languages and mentalities by involving actively with group members from partner country. One important part will furthermore be the addressing of prejudice in all kinds of situations and how to fight it.\r\nThrough activities including group work, outdoor activities, interactive lectures, quizzes, games and workshops, the participants will find out more about the factors that may separate us (like nationality, mentality, sexual orientation, background, etc.) and learn how to benefit from this diversity instead of seeing them as obstacles. By getting in touch with the other participants, they will broaden their horizons and improve mutual understanding within Europe.  \r\nGiven the importance of making people realize that we are all members of a large family called Europe, we intend to contribute to making young people aware of their European citizenship. Basic purpose of our project is to promote cultural diversity by developing  intercultural learning. We aim to understand the lifestyle and social background of partner country by looking into the problems and the way of life of youngsters. The project seeks the diversity of ideas, opinions, ethical awareness, and cultural differences of the participants in a unique framework of experience and activities. We shall look for similarities and differences between us. We also aim to familiarise ourselves with each other\u2019s culture.\r\n\r\nDuring the programme, the members of the groups will be spending a lot of quality time together in order to get to know each other and understand each other\u2019s mentality and culture.

The scheduled events and workshops aim to help the participants develop their ability to contact and understand other people of different cultures.

The base of pro-activity and creativity is \"inner leadership\": a strong personality who can carry responsibilities. That \r\nmeans relying on your-self and making conscious decisions based on your own feelings and thoughts. We believe that gaining a \r\ndeeper understanding of \u2018who we are\u2019 is an empowering process which can lead to positive life changes and inner leadership. \r\nEmpowering young people through this process leads to increased entrepreneurial skills. If someone knows himself better, if \r\nsomeone recognizes his/her passions and skills, it's easier to be motivated for and focused on starting a project. It all starts with self-\r\nknowledge, it all starts with your own identity. But there's more! Inner leadership is not enough to turn a project into success. Conscious decisions are not based on your own inner feelings and thoughts, but also depends on what happens around you, in your professional environment and in society in general. Moreover you also need a strong practical approach, and a knowledge of concrete initiatives, ready to use once you're back home.

It is a strategy characterised by a close cooperation with the local actors such as the Regional Europe Direct, the Region Emilia Romagna, local banks and the regional school office to pursue the internationalisation of the VET provision for the benefit of schools and students. The general objective of this proposal is to increase the employability of students who attend  upper-secondary school and who therefore are next to the transition to the labor market. The specific objectives of this mobility project therefore are the following:\r\n1- To Improve professional competences, key competencies  and citizenship skills in participants\r\n2- To increase language competences and organisational skills of staff\r\n3- Increase the attractiveness and internationalization of VET courses provided in the region\r\n4- Consolidate the networking strategies between institutions, companies and the world of education\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\nThe activities consists in planning, managing and capitalizing transnational placements in European companies for100 students attending the fourth year of upper secondary schools with in the region who will get a EQF4 level qualification at the end of their courses. The mobility will target the most required qualifications in the regional labor market in order to ensure a prompt occupation after he school. These qualifications are related to the different cluster registering higher growth and internationalization rates as well as good hiring rates which are: 1) tourism; 2) ICT and new technologies 3) Mechanic and Mechatronics 4) social economy and third sector 5) art, culture and design. The internships abroad will be recognized by the school and integrated in the compulsory hours of placements that every students must attend according to the Italian law. In this context, the project will also offer 10 \"mobility coordinators\" of schools or organizations working in the field education to carry out a mobility abroad in order to deepen their knowledge on the aspects related to the implementation of mobility and the use of ECVET. The experience abroad will also increase the mutual trust between sending organizations (schools) and the European hosting organizations as well as hosting enterprises that offer placements for the students. The mutual knowledge will facilitate the development of future cross-border initiatives such as for follow-up mobility projects; training programs shared through e-learning and exchange of good practices.\r\n\r\nSELECTION AND PREPARATION\r\nStudents will be selected through public calls published by Uniser and open to students form the whole region. The calls will indicate the criteria for participation and how to apply. The selection will take place in two phases, firstly the interested students will fill out a motivational questionnaire in English and attach the Europass CV on the website www.movingeneration.net which is specifically designed to collect students applications. Students will subsequently participate in an interview with the staff of Uniser who will assess the participant's motivation and language skills.\r\nThe selected candidates will then be inserted pre-departure preparation programme that provides practical and methodological training as well as intercultural training. Language preparation will be provided in accordance with schools during the hours of English, and will focus on the vocabulary to use in the workplace.\r\n\r\nRECOGNITION\r\nAll participating students will be recognized the competences learned abroad thanks to the application of the ECVET device. The project will make use of Memorandum of Understanding and Learning Agreement to ensure that the learning objectives of the qualifications are converted into to Learning Outcomes and Learning Units which can be achieved, verified and validated. Since the mobility be part of the vet course the participants are attending and it will not be extra-scholastic, the hours of internship abroad will be subtracted to those of the compulsory curricular internship. Each student will also be provided with a Europass Mobility to integrate the Europass CV and a Europass Certificate Supplement to ensure that their qualification is more easily spendable on the European labor market.\r\n\r\nACCOMPANYING PERSONS\r\nTarget students of the mobility are composed almost exclusively of minors, therefore accompanying persons are necessary. As in previous projects coordinated by Uniser there will be 1 APs every 10 participants,  they will be selected through open calls which will  prioritize teachers' participation.

This experience is part of the ASL program which has the intention of integrating the experiences of training abroad with national ones through a pedagogical innovation process based on learning from the workplace which, following the EQAVET recommendations for quality in professional training, will lead to the improvement of operational and procedural standards to be diffused as good practices for a fully dual IFP/VET system. The development system will ensure that the alternation of ASL and WBL experiences are integrated in order to provide the student\u2019s course of study with continuity, and where all the expertise acquired from various backgrounds converges.\r\nFor this purpose, a scheduling table has been created with the participation of those responsible for the ASL system from the Institute, the local PMI/SMEs, the Corporations and associations where the students carry out their national internships. This is to create synergy with the productive forces that are they themselves firstly interested in a fruitful encounter between supply and demand and can provide useful information on requests for the foreign partners.\r\nAn adequately trained tutor who is in charge of international internship placements has been appointed to each study course. Specific modules have been collectively planned starting from the professional profile of the participant and the LOs that must be reached by the end of the internship. The certified agencies in the host countries are part of a wide network collaboration that the Institute has created over the years and will guarantee the quality of training, a proper validation process of the qualifications and the start-up for the ECVET procedure.\r\nIn particular, four or five target countries have been defined where the institute has already started profitable partnerships and reliable contacts in the past and with whom to carefully plan the experiences. As for persons accompanying, it is deemed appropriate, if teachers are involved, to have two shifts for the assistance, with the second trip paid by the school. It is also possible to have a form of collaboration with the Faculty of Education that could identify students for whom the tutoring and assistance activities constitute an internship.\r\nAs already announced in the accreditation request, the participants will be selected through a public competition announcement that differs slightly from the one planned mainly for the percentage that each item is allowed (academic performance10%, behavior and personal traits 40%,  first foreign language 25%, second foreign language15%, foreign language certification 10%). This is to encourage students to achieve linguistic certifications and progressively improve language skills, and not to exclude reliable students who do not fall into the category of excellence. The preparation of the participants in the linguistic, technical and intercultural sectors will be particularly accurate. \r\nOur future intention is to consolidate and develop a system for the ASL and WBL projects even through a platform that puts all the local and transnational players involved in touch, in order to share information, forms, experiences and organize video conferences with training sessions by the host country with virtual classrooms. The platform will be constantly in progress and constitute an interesting and flexible database.\r\nIn order to allow the school policy to be more focused on internationalization and open-mindedness, it was considered appropriate to organize English language courses for the institute teachers at basic, intermediate and higher levels. Over the years, the lack of knowledge of foreign languages, in particular English, on the part of the teachers and school staff, has proved to be a weakness that has excluded many school workers from the projecting, implementation and conveying of European experiences. This will no longer be feasible so as to truly create a school with a widespread European vocation and open to the outside world. \r\nFor this school year, students with Special Educational Needs have not been involved as no adequate cases to perform this type of experience have been detected, while it is forecast for the coming year.\r\nThe school has taken steps to widely circulate the attainment of the Mobility Card and diffuse the culture of internationalization at a local level as well.", "http://www.northwestacademy.net", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005957_2"], ["7AL", "Working and Learning Flows", "NORTH WEST REGIONAL COLLEGE", 89866.0, "In the strategy of Kainuu Vocational College internationalization is regarded as an important part of the development work in the college.

In close cooperation with partners\u2019 staff, Luksia\u2019s staff training exchanges aim at developing the implementation of the vocational skills performance during the exchange and to increase cooperation on occupational safety matters of students\u2019 on-the-job learning assignment.", "http://www.foyle.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA116-034523_9"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["6PJ", "LEARNING North West", "DERRY YOUTH & COMMUNITY WORKSHOP LIMITED", null, "ESF", 453264.48, 697329.96, "esf_ni_12"], ["0LU", "Active Inclusion", "RCD/4RS", null, "ESF", 594790.32, 915062.0, "esf_ni_21"], ["6PJ", "LEMIS North West", "DERRY YOUTH & COMMUNITY WORKSHOP LIMITED", null, "ESF", 1698556.0, 2613164.0, "esf_ni_50"], ["9LH", "Skills North West (NW)", "TRIAX", null, "ESF", 2066619.0, 3179416.0, "esf_ni_66"], ["6BB", "PROSPER 3", "WOMEN\u2019S CENTRE DERRY", null, "ESF", 783036.0, 1204676.0, "esf_ni_67"], ["7NN", "Kickstart to Work", "DERRY & STRABANE DISTRICT COUNCIL", null, "ESF", 678720.0, 1696800.0, "esf_ni_87"], ["6PJ", "LEMIS North West", "DERRY YOUTH AND COMMUNITY WORKSHOP LTD", null, "ESF", 625658.0, 1564144.0, "esf_ni_88"], ["6PJ", "Learning North West", "DERRY YOUTH AND COMMUNITY WORKSHOP LTD", null, "ESF", 202677.0, 506693.0, "esf_ni_89"], ["0LU", "Active inclusion", "RCD/4RS REUSE WORKSHOP", null, "ESF", 231017.0, 577542.0, "esf_ni_106"], ["6BB", "PROSPER 2", "THE WOMEN'S CENTRE DERRY", null, "ESF", 319238.0, 798095.0, "esf_ni_123"], ["9LH", "Skills 2020", "TRIAX", null, "ESF", 1175886.0, 2939715.0, "esf_ni_125"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["7NN", "DERRY CITY AND STRABANE DISTRICT COUNCIL", 318081.0, "Making the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system (32.04.03.01)", "fts_2017_1042", 2017], ["7AL", "NORTH WEST REGIONAL COLLEGE*", 53340.0, "Erasmus+ \u2014 Contribution from the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) (22.02.04.02)", "fts_2017_22466", 2017], ["7TG", "MODERN DEMOCRACY LIMITED", 164096.0, "Pilot project \u2014 E-voting: making the best use of modern technologies for more active and democratic voting procedures (33.02.77.14)", "fts_2017_37186", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT48"}
