Additional components of the system are a gas processor to clean up the autogas propane fuel plus other equipment for electrical, mechanical and control balance of plant (BOP).  All these components will be constituents of an entire fuel cell power generator which will first be tested in the lab and, after further optimisation and miniaturisation, in an RV platform.  The project is primarily aimed at the RV platform from Autosleepers, an SME based in the UK, but other applications such as boats, ambulances and environmental testing vehicles will also be studied.   Propane was chosen as the the fuel because of its superior energy density compared to hydrogen and methanol, and also because it is the generally preferred fuel for auxiliary systems on RVs, such as cookers, fridges and water heaters.  Autogas propane is widely available at filling stations throughout Europe.  The SOFC was chosen because it can convert propane while also providing low noise, low emissions and heat for hot water supply.\nThe overall objectives are:\nDevelop the fuel cell power supply to fit the RV\nTest the Autogas propane fuel\nStudy the needs of the market to reduce the risks of commercialisation\nImprove the SOFC in terms of materials, lifetime, performance and costs\nInnovate on noise reduction and emissions\nProvide several fuel cells for testing optimisation and proving\nTo test long term durability and cycling for obtaining approvals\nTo disseminate by getting real users to apply the new device and report results across Europe\nImpact will be substantial because the general public will be using these RVs.  Also three special conferences will be organised to disseminate information, ten refereed publications will be submitted and patents will be published on the innovations.", 132453.0, 1895213.0, "SAPIENS", "Novel emissions and noise solutions for mobile homes", "Optimising fuel cell technology can reduce noise and emissions. An EU initiative plans to unveil a portable power solution for powering devices in recreational vehicles (RVs).", "Fuel cells are increasingly being used as auxiliary power units in specialised transportation applications for heating or lighting. In the EU-funded http://sapiens-project.eu/ (SAPIENS) (SOFC auxiliary power in emissions/noise solutions) project, scientists aim to build several microtubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks and integrate them into hybrid power systems. These will form components of an entire fuel cell power generator. Additional components are a battery, a gas processor for fuel clean-up, and other equipment for the electrical, mechanical and control balance of plant (BOP).\n\nUnlike other fuel cells that run on hydrogen, SAPIENS is using the globally available propane that contains more energy and is also suitable for RV appliances. During the first two years, the project drew up the requirements for this fuel cell power generation system, including size, weight, and the mechanical, electrical and data communication interfaces between the power generator and the RV. The interfaces also support camping out in the wild where RVs are not near plug-in power for several days.\n\nProject members modelled fuel cell types such as single microtubular SOFCs, SOFC stacks and BOP in order to optimise system performance. Modelling results provided them with insight into heat transfer and the overall system. Two exhibitions showcased the RV and its fuel cell, which was also highlighted in several conference papers and journal publications.\n\nProject partners defined and developed an integrated fuel cell system. All elements were then validated. They trialled six autogas fuel samples from service stations across Europe and found that propane and other hydrocarbons vary greatly. Cells were tested on propane and yielded positive results for fuel cell performance.\n\nThe integrated fuel cell system will be further tested and optimised in the third and final year of the project.\n\nBy integrating stacks into hybrid power systems, SAPIENS will be able to provide the RV market and enthusiasts throughout Europe with innovative noise reduction and emission options.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2015-09/162514.jpg", "fp7_106589_962174429"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WR12"}
