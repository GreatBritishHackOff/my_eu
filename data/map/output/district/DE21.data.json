There are over 600,000 refrigerated vehicles and containers in Europe and each one wastes thousands of Euros of energy each year due to poor insulation. Likewise, payback on renewable energy systems is compromised by poor thermal storage, reducing their popularity. In short, our members are wasting energy and hence losing money through a lack of optimal insulation. Currently, our options are limited to expensive, high performance materials such as aerogels and vacuum insulation panels, or low-cost but poorly-performing foams. We need a new insulation material that can fill this performance gap, offering high thermal resistance but at a cost close to insulating foams. The HIP project will develop an innovative new class of polymer insulation materials based on high internal phase emulsion templating (HIPE). HIPE materials have been used in other applications but never before for high-performance insulation. HIPE materials allow close control over porosity, pore size distribution and mechanical properties. Because of this, we can precisely engineer the thermal properties of the material within a low-cost manufacturing process. Our objective is to achieve a thermal conductivity of \u22640.015W/m.K at a cost of less than \u20ac500 per cubic metre. Compared to conventional PU foam insulation, the savings will be considerable: Based on our predicted uptake in the refrigerated transport and solar thermal markets alone, the reduced CO2 emission will be over 200,000 tonnes by 2020 and our members will save in excess of \u20ac50 million in energy costs.", 47331.0, 2183624.0, "HIP", "Keeping cool on the cheap", "A brand new class of polymer insulation material called HIP offers high thermal resistance useful for refrigerated transport, heating and cooling installations. Combined with low production costs, this new material improves efficiency of products, installations and processes.", "Over 40\u00a0% of the EU's energy consumption is used for heating/cooling in buildings, hot water, for industrial process heat and heat in the service sector. In Europe, 12\u00a0% of vehicles used to transport goods (e.g. ice cream) are insulated. \n\nThis EU-funded project, http://www.fp7-hip.eu (HIP) , produced a  new class of polymer insulating materialmaterial. The low-cost, highly insulating polymer material is based on high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) templating. \n\nFollowing a review of techniques and formulations of polyHIPEsone formula produced the perfect material for maximum cost savings. The HIP material will last 25 years, has a thermal conductivity of 0.015\u00a0W/mK and costs less than EUR\u00a0500 per cubic metre.\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises benefit from using refrigerated vehicles by reducing fuel consumption without sacrificing payload. The fuel cost savings are typically EUR\u00a04\u00a0000 per vehicle. Because of this new highly insulating polymer material the cost savings are enormous on the 37000 refrigerated containers in the EU.\n\nThe material, complies with the EU Parliament Directive of 2013. Examples of compliance include: using minimal materials, efficiencies created in pumps and solar thermal systems, and reduced emissions thanks to the HIP material's design. \n\nThis product has potential for worldwide use as an effective insulation solution with expected savings of over EUR 50 million just in the EU.", null, "http://www.heatraesadia.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/145859.jpg", "fp7_96236_991760011"], ["6LY", "Fresh Solutions \u2013\u2018A fresh approach to food packaging\u2019", "Four04 Packaging Limited", "Fresh Solutions \u2013\u2018A fresh approach to food packaging\u2019\nWithin the EU post production supply chain, it is estimated that 61.6 Million tonnes (Mt) of food waste is created p.a with\n46.5 Mt/year generated specifically by households . Approximately 60% of household food waste arises from products \u2018not\nused in time\u2019 with a value of more than \u20ac60 billion p.a (\u20ac624/household) the majority of which are short shelf-life chilled\nproducts. Similar shelf life challenges are found within the Retail sector with up to 33% of some fresh produce being wasted\nbefore it even reaches the consumer. Efforts to address this global challenge have centred around innovations that seek to prevent product deterioration and prolonging shelf life. However despite progress in techniques such as Modified Atmosphere Packaging, food waste remains a priority challenge, with the recognition that even a 1 day increase in shelf life could reduce waste levels both in store and home by up to 50% for some products. Fresh Solutions proposed by Four04 Packaging Ltd offers a unique approach to the packaging of perishable food by effectively controlling the detrimental effect of condensation, thermal shock and the respiration rate of fresh produce which contribute to the build-up of moisture in the packs and mould/bacterial growth. It combines an innovative bio-degradable and fully compostable film which allows the moisture vapour transmission rate to be controlled and a novel highly accurate laser perforation system which creates optimum atmospheric conditions within the packaging. The result is the potential to increase the shelf life of fresh produce by 30% \u2013 100% over current packaging techniques as demonstrated by initial UK supermarket trials. Building on this success, this SME I project seeks to further demonstrate Fresh Solutions in the wider EU and U.S markets, helping Four 04 to exploit a Global market for fresh food packaging forecast to reach \u20ac95.91bn by 2020 with a truly disruptive solution.", 44350.0, 63358.0, "Fresh Solutions", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_210402_916627788"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["4TG", "Work.Experience.Development- for You and Europe", "Travena Ltd", 87264.0, "The \"Rudolf Steiner Schulverein im Raum Baden\" is coordinating the project WORK.EXPERIENCE.DEVELOPMENT-FOR YOU AND EUROPE, which offers work placements for approximately 100 pupils aged 15 to 19 of the Waldorf Schools Sch\u00f6nau, Linz, Graz, Klagenfurt, Innbruck and Salzburg.

A crucial research study in eight European countries will gather the accounts of those people who have experienced sexual violence in sport. Based on this and via a collaboration of sport organisations, victim support agencies and universities, a process of reconciliation will be initiated in each country by installing Acknowledgement Forums. The outcomes of the research study and the Forums will be transferred into powerful educational resources for the European sports community, which will be disseminated to a wide range of sport organisations in Europe, enhancing its capacity to combat sexual violence and strengthen the integrity of sport.
