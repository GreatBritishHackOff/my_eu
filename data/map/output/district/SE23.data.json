(III)\u201c  is the continuation of two previous mobility projects with the same name, that the school BBS Melle promotes since 2014. For the first time the school is applying on behalf of a consortium, since in the last two years we have been working more and more intensively together with BBS Wildeshausen and BBS Gesundheit und Soziales in Nordhorn.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration had been preceded by a pool project led by the Jane Addams School and the GEB in Berlin, which BBS Melle used for several years to give students the opportunity to gain professional experience abroad. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the field of social pedagogy, this consortium's project proposal also extends to the fields of economics, administration and agriculture, thus aiming to fund also student in duals vocational training. \r\n\r\nThru this project both groups of apprentices/ students have the chance to experience a vocational training placement in another country, with a length of 9 weeks. Thanks to the time spent in a work place learners will gain real life experience and soft skills, like e.g. social, intercultural, etc. The new acquired skills will boost their employability and the receiving organizations will benefit as well directly from the exchange and work done by the learners.
