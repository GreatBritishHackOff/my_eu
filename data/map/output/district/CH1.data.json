However, there is a high risk that the air quality is reduced. Continued exposure to environments with poor air quality is a major public health concern in developed and developing countries. It is estimated that the pollutants responsible for poor air quality cause nearly 2.5 million premature deaths per year world-wide.

This can only be accomplished by triggering a short-term alarm and its validation as well as the identification of the type of threat.\n\nSince most of the bio sensors available are laboratory bound or require special equipment which needs training as well as experience, new systems are needed.\n\nThe concept of BIO-PROTECT is the development of a fast-alert, easy-to-use device to be applied for detection and identification of airborne bacteria, spores, viruses and toxins . Its technology is based on bioaerosol detection by fluorescence, scattering and background aerosol measurement followed by ionisation of air flow and analysis of the spectrum of relative speed of passage, which, in turns, enables identification of harmful biological agents.\n\nThis device may also be used for controlling potential accidental release of bio-agents from biotechnology laboratories.", 235263.0, 3337840.0, "BIO-PROTECT", "Rapid identification of airborne toxins", "Scientists in close collaboration with technology developers are developing a portable unit to detect and analyse airborne biological agents.

Technology relies on bio-aerosol detection (detection of airborne particles containing or released by living organisms), followed by identification of contents via ionisation and spectral analysis.

The GC-IMS was adapted to separate all types of bio-agents of interest from the aerosol. A combined pre-concentration and pyrolysis unit was also developed, capable of taking a wet sample and preparing it for use with the GC-IMS.\n\nThe BIO-Protect consortium successfully demonstrated the ability of the coupled pyrolysis-IMS system to deliver reproducible spectra from bio-agent samples in the collector.
