Scottish FA/UEFA Pro Licence Coaches candidates (30 places -  Poland)\r\n2. Scottish FA/UEFA Youth Licence  Coaches candidates (50 places - Portugal)\r\n3. Scottish FA/UEFA B-Licence Coaches working within the development of Women's game (23 places - Netherlands)\r\n\r\nThe Scottish FA European mobility projects is a key part of improving the Scottish FA coaches competencies, knowledge, skills and experience which is an integral part of the strategic development of the organisation with regards to quality development and internationalism. The scale of this project, potential learning opportunities and the number of participating organisations, notwithstanding the knowledge and skills gained will have a major impact on the Scottish FA coach and player development pathways. This will result in new innovative and improved ways of cooperating towards key development areas by providing more attractive programmes at the Scottish FA.\r\n\r\nOur proposed mobility project objectives intrinsically link with our long term Football objectives and focus on the continuous development of our coaches gaining accredited qualifications, CPD, enhancing employability and quality and quantity of opportunity, they are as follows:\r\n\r\n- More of our coaches gain UEFA accredited coaching qualifications recognised across Europe and World\r\n- To provide reality based training and learning  which favours learning in game and club context, using knowledge, skills and attitude to deal with realistic situations and problems in football\r\n- Stimulate an attitude of lifelong learning and develop competence through knowledge transfer during practical sessions;  work experience (individual and collective learning); the learning cycle (activity, reflection, theory building and planning) and new concepts \r\n- To expose our coaches to high quality European Football Associations and club structures, coaching methods, philosophies and practice\r\n- To provide further opportunities for employment within the UK and Europe for our coaches through shared learning, skill acquisition and qualifications\r\n- To support the Scottish FA career development employment monitoring tool for participants engaging in mobility projects\r\n- To disseminate European coaching theoretical and practical learning at a National, Regional and Local level through our coaches\r\n- To enhance our player development programme through dissemination of European football structures best practice\r\n\r\nThe Scottish FA carefully chose the project partners through a proven established relationship and indication of their ability to deliver mobility through EU funding and their current membership of UEFA.  In addition, it was essential that the host partners would meet the objectives and outcomes of the Scottish FA mobility project and possess the appropriate expertise required when working with the specific target groups, notwithstanding providing additionality and further benefits to their own organisation. It was also fundamental that the host partner organisations showed extensive experience in European development planning and collaboration but had a similar ethos and value base as that of the Scottish FA.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish FA engagement in European mobility projects and cooperation with international partners aligns with our strategic plan and subsequent objectives to forge long lasting European partnerships for the development of our 'Home of World Class Coaching', the planning as a host city for Euro 2020 and to increase the qualification, skills and knowledge of our coaches through the education of football development practices and structures across Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish FA identify the needs of our coaches through continually reviewing their practice but also the practice of European Football organisations.  The Scottish FA have an ethos of continuous improvement in everything we do and this is achieved and reviewed with our coaches through their CPD planning, evaluation surveys, appraisals and gaps in coaching provision. Through this process identifying key learnings from other European football organisations became very apparent as an important aspect for our coaches to engage with.\r\n\r\nThe impact European mobility projects will have on our coaches is multi faceted but fundamentally it will form part of the assessment criteria of our UEFA licensed coaching qualifications and CPD hours, notwithstanding improve our coaches skills, knowledge and capacity to integrate good practices and new methods into their daily activities.  This will transcend into improved employability and experiences for our coaches engaged in the projects but will also benefit our regional structure and local communities through dissemination of European practice.  The project will benefit 103 of our coaches directly but through dissemination benefit our players, volunteers, students and clubs.", "http://www.scottishfa.co.uk", "The Scottish Football Association Limited", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036169_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "G42"}
