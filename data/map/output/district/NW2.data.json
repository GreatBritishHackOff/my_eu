We want our children to become more globally aware and to have an understanding of different cultures and other education systems. We feel that we can build strong links with a French or Spanish school and look forward to learning lots from our partnership . We would like our children to begin to become more aware of languages and preparing them for ks2 where they will begin to learn languages as part of the curriculum. We plan to use this project to enrich our curriculum and so that teachers can link the curriculum to the children's experience. It is important for us to create international links with our neighboring countries so that as the children learn more they can eventually use the skills they have required and put them into practice. First lead teachers will have improved language skills and leadership of subject and develop the skills to train and mentor other staff. This project will enhance their career prospects and their professional development. Subject teachers Collaborative work in the second year will be about developing international projects, promoting European Dimension and producing material for cross curricula enhancement Inspire pupils because of greater intercultural understanding by teachers and embedding of ED throughout areas of the curriculum eg Geography. The evidence gleaned in terms of needs for growth, development and improvement identified in the European Development Plan will be used  as a guide to review action to  be taken and expected results for school improvement including staff professional development. The Senior Leadership Team, Project Manager and Administrator will set up Learning Agreements with each participant setting them individual targets. The learning agreements will include references to areas for improvement and development resulting from participation in the course. The in-school project management team  will oversee the implementation of project outcomes. Participants will have improved their language competence as measured using the Europass Language Passport Participants will have developed their intercultural understanding of Spanish/French culture and life. Participants, especially those attending the first course, will have enhanced training and mentoring skills and be able to provide leadership in the implementation of the statutory requirement to deliver a language at KS2 The school will have embedded the European Dimension into the curriculum with changes to the curriculum to accommodate this intercultural understanding. Pupils will be inspired to enhance their language learning by having more competent teachers and a real audience for their language learning. They will develop relationships with pupils in Madrid schools, leading hopefully to visits to each other's schools.
