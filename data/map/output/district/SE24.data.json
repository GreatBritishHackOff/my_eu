The off-grid household product is on track to become the most affordable and environmentally friendly method of distilling water from any source. We believe Desolenator can make a major contribution to global drinking water shortages. \nOur team have developed and patented the core enabling technology behind the system \u201cthe desalination engine\u201d.  Our product development strategy involves developing different product variants of this core desalination engine (i.e. a premium product, a low cost unit, a community scale unit and niche market units) so that we can meet the needs of different global markets.  At present, Desolenator do not clearly understand the market definition and user requirements in Southern Europe, and this is the focus of the enclosed Phase 1 Feasibility Study. \n\nWe will work with market research experts to complete this project. The first stage of this plan will involve completing detailed research of market dynamics, water supply and regulatory issues in water stressed Southern European states (Malta & Cyprus). We will then work to identify our customers and understand their needs and purchasing requirements. Finally we will use our results to partner with relevant organisations. \n\nDesolenator can substantially improve the quality of life for European citizens suffering from water stress & contamination issues. Our technology can provide new water supply options to those in need, and completing this project will enable us to reduce stress on aquifers/reservoirs, reduce user anxiety during summer months and decrease dependence on imports. This project provides a stepping stone for our global expansion and job creation aims and will enable us to tackle the global water crisis.", 39838.0, 56912.0, "Desolenator", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_201782_927348519"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0JT", "In/visible cities - International Festival of Urban Multimedia", "198 CONTEMPORARY ARTS AND LEARNING LTD", 148266.0, "In/Visible cities is an international festival of urban multimedia with a widespread and crossborder  approach  which aims to promote the interaction between technological innovation and artistic multimedia  expressions as tool for urban spaces revitalization.The Festival offers installations and multimedia shows, workshops and performances, focusing on  \"visible cities\", as theme for reflection and artistic action, and on \"Invisible Cities\", with their history and their potential for future change.Festival activities take place at the same time in Trieste, Gorizia and Nova Gorica from 4 to 7 June 2015.
