Complex analysis of images from multiple cameras will become the norm in the future, from cars to industrial systems, from smart cities to facility monitoring, aimed at extracting meaningful, context-dependent information.\nToday\u2019s market is dominated by a combination of relatively simple, fixed function, configurable cameras that stream video to PC-based (and in some cases small embedded) gateways. These systems cannot scale beyond a certain size because of power consumption and the aggregate networking bandwidth required to stream videos to servers, where aggregated video analysis is performed. So the trend for visual analytics functions is that they get executed at the edge of these complex vision systems, e.g. in the cameras themselves.\nThe Cognitive and Perceptive Camera Systems (COPCAMS) proposal leverages recent advances in embedded computing platforms to design, prototype and field-test full large-scale vision systems. It aims at exploiting a new many-core programmable accelerator platform to power a new generation of vision related devices (smart cameras and gateways), able to extract relevant information from captured images and autonomously react to the sensed  environment by interoperating at large scale in a distributed manner.\n\nDate of approval by ECSEL JU: 11/07/2016.", null, 10963981.0, "COPCAMS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.asl-vision.co.uk", null, "fp7_111181_983072206"], ["2AQ", "DEvelopment platform for Safe and Efficient dRiVE", "Application Solutions (Electronics and Vision) Ltd", "According to a recent forecast published by ABI Research , a fast growth of the market of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) is foreseen in the next five years. For example, in 2016 the overall annual market for Lane Departure Warning systems is expected to reach 22 million units/year (corresponding to 14,3 billion dollars). This market growth will be possible only through the reduction of costs of components as well as the seamless integration of different functions in the same architecture. Since the market will include also low volume vehicles, there will be also a strong need to reduce development costs. Electric vehicles will be an additional catalyst for the ADAS market. The absence of engine noise requires the introduction of new means to protect vulnerable road users from these vehicles. On the other hand, electric vehicles can easily support (semi)automatic functions (such as parking manoeuvres and Stop&Go).\nTo manage the expected increase of function complexity together with the required reduction of costs (fixed and variable) DESERVE will design and build an ARTEMIS Tool Platform based on the standardisation of the interfaces, software (SW) reuse, development of common non-competitive SW modules,  and easy and safety-compliant integration of  standardised hardware (HW) or SW from different suppliers. With innovative design space exploration (DSE) methods system design costs can be reduced by more than 15%.\nHence, DESERVE will build an innovation ecosystem for European leadership in ADAS embedded systems, based on the automotive R&D actors, with possible applications in other industrial domains.\nSince the purpose of ADAS functions is also to support the driver, an advanced human-centred design strategy will be integrated in the Tool Platform. Therefore, the developed applications will provide natural and friendly  support to the driver, with proper levels of overall functional safety also during complex or emergency manoeuvres.\n-\n-\n-\nVersion approved by the JU on 14/07/2015", 82768.0, 19372210.0, "DESERVE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.asl-vision.co.uk", null, "fp7_104880_983072206"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1UE", "SELEP ERDF Facilitator", "East Sussex Council", "The project will promote uptake of ERDF opportunities, create and support the pipeline of quality project applications; deliver cross-LEP and multi-LEP projects; work closely with the SELEP Growth Hubs and BIS national business support products; assist applicants to ensure project applications are high quality, value for money and impact on relevant SELEP areas; work with the Growth Delivery Team to ensure technically correct information is shared with project applicants; applicants understand rules re publicity etc; and ensure project applications are of appropriate size, scale and ambition and have outputs and results that maximise the impact of ERDF to support Jobs and Growth.", "ERDF", 106748.0, 213497.0, "erdf_england_38"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BN7"}
