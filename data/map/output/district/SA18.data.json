Moreover, coatings for new applications in electronics where current technology cannot meet cost / performance demands will be formulated. Particle and polymer modifications will be developed that optimise the coatings leading to new formulations for the product portfolios of the partner SMEs permitting them conform to EU Directive 1999/13/EC on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds and Directive 94/9/EC for lighting in explosive environments.", 13565.0, 941068.0, "TransCond", "A new era of electrically conductive coatings", "Coatings that conduct electricity historically fall short on ratings of greenness. Innovative eco-friendly alternatives that are also sprayable, transparent and higher performing are ready to blaze a trail to existing and new markets.", "Electrically conductive coatings are employed in a plethora of products from mobile phones and computers to medical, military and aerospace systems. Conventional coatings are very high in heavy metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), both of which are serious health hazards. Development of novel multifunctional polymer coatings with reduced environmental impact was an important objective of the EU-funded project http://www.transcond.org (TRANSCOND) .\n\nResearchers went much further, though, with sprayable, transparent and permanently conductive coatings employing nano-structured carbon and boasting significantly enhanced technical properties. In just two short years, the partners have developed a range of commercially available coatings that can be obtained through links on the project website. In addition, three of the five products are compatible with the EU's directive on technical requirements for equipment used in potentially explosive environments (ATEX Directive 94/9/EC).\n\nThe coatings are largely water-based for a major relief from VOCs. Depending on the application, they are compatible with glass, plastic and/or metal. One transparent coating is designed for displays, protective screens, oven doors and large areas such as flooring. \nIn addition to traditional scientific dissemination routes, three project videos are available on the project website and on YouTube. A LinkedIn group has also been established.\n\nTRANSCOND's highly innovative electrically conductive coatings will help the small and medium-sized enterprises that have been integral in their development expand their markets considerably. The novel functionalities and enhanced properties will help them create new application potential as well, achieving an important increase in competitive position.", null, "http://www.haydale.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20141119135932.jpg", "fp7_100962_964062437"], ["3BL", "\"Design, Manufacturing and Impact Testing of Advanced Composite Materials\"", "Haydale Ltd", "'Carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) are a composite material normally manufactured from a cloth weaved from carbon fibre cloth set within a thermoset resin. CFRP has an extremely high strength to weight ratio and will play a key part in the reduction of weight in aircraft structures and hence emissions. It has been proposed that the use of a nanofilled thermoset resin in the manufacturing of a structural CFRP panel may potentially lead to structural property enhancements (such as impact resistance) as well as to the occurrence of new functional properties (electrical, conductivity, flame retardancy). These enhancements are based on the specific nano filler chosen for the resin production.\n\nThe primary objective of this research project is the demonstration of nanocomposites technology for structural and functional improvements in CFRP panels for use in aerospace applications. Working in conjunction with Haydale, a Welsh SME, two nanocomposite thermoset resins containing carbon nanotubes (CN) and graphene nano platelets (GNP) will be developed. The resin will then be used to manufacture a series of CFRP panels using Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM). The panels will then be impacted and then mechanically tested. An evaluation of the improvement in structural properties will be made and is the primary deliverable of the research programme.'", 57776.0, 124335.0, "CARHAY2011", null, null, null, null, "http://www.haydale.com", null, "fp7_106998_964062437"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["3EL", "Swansea Bay Regional Engagement Team ERDF", "Carmarthenshire County Council", "Working with a range of partners to provide assistance to potential sponsors in developing EU funding proposals which can help meet existing and future opportunities and investments at regional levels.", "ERDF", 469237.0, 631030.0, "erdf_wales_80956"], ["3EL", "Swansea Bay Regional Engagement Team ESF", "Carmarthenshire County Council", "Working with a range of partners to provide assistance to potential sponsors in developing EU funding proposals which can help meet existing and future opportunities and investments at regional levels.", "ESF", 339785.0, 456949.0, "esf_wales_80957"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SA18"}
