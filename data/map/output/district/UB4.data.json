Heinz Company Limited", "Fouling, as defined in this project, is the presence of unintended and unwanted deposits on the inside walls of industrial plant such as pipes, storage vessels, reactor vessels etc. Its occurrence is widespread though all industries, particularly oil and petrochemical pipelines, petrochemical plant, other chemical plant, pharmaceutical production, food processing as well as in plumbing systems throughout the domestic and industrial sector. Fouling shortens the plant life, increases the need for periodic cleaning and pipe replacement. It also causes contamination of the end products which is especially serious when the fouling involves bacterial biofilms and the products are intended for direct human consumption. In addition pipe blockages, deformation, rupture or corrosion cause by a build up of fouling can lead to major incidents such as explosions involving with threats to human life and plant destruction involving loss of product and jobs. In domestic pipes fouling causes taps and valves to seize up and leaks to occur which leads to expensive plumbing costs in replacement parts, high labour costs, expensive repairs from flood damage and disruption to domestic life. ULTRACLEANPIPE offers a novel solution to the general problem of identifying and then removing fouling in industrial plant as well as domestic plumbing. The system prototype will be designed for application to small bore pipes that arise in the food processing and pharmaceuticals production industry as well as in plumbing systems. This focus is taken because (i) small bore pipes are obviously much more prone to than large ones and (ii) contamination of products intended for human consumption is a problem of the highest order. However it is important to emphasise that the ULTRACLEANPIPE principle can be applied to all kinds of fouling in all industry by the use of a range of ultrasonic probe designs and operating frequencies", 17934.0, 1206448.0, "ULTRACLEANPIPE", "Shake it loose", "Sometimes simple ideas are the best ideas. A newly developed clean and green method \u2014 in the form of ultrasonic waves \u2014 removes residue build-up in pipes.", "Fouling deposits can occur in industrial process pipes and domestic pipelines. These deposits are difficult to avoid and pose significant problems. The formation of fouling inside pipes can cause chemical reactions leading to significant operational problems. Effects on the pipe may include corrosion, blockage and, in extreme cases, rupture or deformation. Another concern is that the product carried in the pipe may become contaminated by microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and algae. \n\nUltrasonic detection and removal of fouling inside industrial and domestic pipes (http://ultracleanpipe.com (ULTRACLEANPIPE)) was an EU-funded project that took an old idea used mainly in immersion tanks and improved on it. The team developed a method for cleaning components while still in service. This removes the need for acids and other chemicals while reducing the downtime associated with cleaning cycles. The method saves materials and energy, resulting in a more environmentally friendly cleaning process.\n\nThe developed equipment measures the extent of fouling deposits and removes the deposits ideally as a continuous, in\u00a0situ system. This system reduces costs to EU consumers and makes the EU industry more globally competitive. The need for vast quantities of cleaning chemicals (acids and detergents) is eliminated, as is the excess energy associated with the existing intensive and environmentally unfriendly cleaning process.\n\nULTRACLEANPIPE technology can be applied to domestic systems. It can de-scale pipes and water heating systems, again saving on maintenance and energy costs on a large scale for the individual consumer.\n\nFor the purposes of the project, European industrial and academic partners formed a multidisciplinary consortium.

Demand of long life rigid packing with high barrier properties grows up quickly (around 200.000 Tn are produced annually in Europe). Barrier packages are employed to preserve foodstuffs from environmental agents, so to control the package permeability to gases (O2,N2,CO2) is very important. Furthermore, mechanical and food thermal treatment resistance (pasteurization and retort processes) and food contact grade are also relevant requirements. Due to the nature of plastic materials, only one plastic can not achieve all the demanded requisites, so these packages are made of combining no less than three materials in five layers; a water barrier polymer (outer layers) cheap and with good mechanical properties (PP,HIPS), an oxygen barrier polymer with high cost (EVOH,PVDC,PA) and an adhesive to join both. They are manufactured by a two-step process: Coextrusion to produce a cast multilayer sheet and Thermoforming to process the sheet into shapes. This production technology has the following problems: Co-extrusion: a) Synthetic polymers (mainly EVOH) used as inner layer are very expensive and chemically incompatible with the other layers preventing post-used packages recycling. b) Scrap production reaches at least 10%. Thermoforming: a) High scrap production (up to 40%) due to trims, especially in oval and round forms, and processing problems b) Design limitations: neither complex forms nor uniform thickness, and no high depth of draw ratio are allowed. In order to solve the above problems COBAPACK approach will consist on: a)Using destructurized starch from rich protein plants(a by-product with low cost soluble in water), to replace the synthetic high barrier materials allowing the separation of the different multilayer materials thus recycling 100% the final package b)Using co-injection process, one-step process with minimum scrap losses, savings in energy comsumption and broad design flexibility", 54721.0, 1155571.0, "COBAPACK", null, null, null, "http://www.cobapack.eu", "http://www.heinz.co.uk", null, "fp7_107790_998007393"], ["8EE", "Design and development of REAlistic food Models with well-characterised micro- and macro-structure and composition", "United Biscuits (Uk) Limited", "DREAM a trans-disciplinary partnership involving two multinationals and nine countries will develop realistic, physical and mathematical, food models for use as standards to be exploited across all major food categories to facilitate development of common approaches to risk/benefit assessment and nutritional quality in food research and industry.

To address as wide a range of food products as possible, 4 generic structure groups will be used representing plant-based foods; meat; dairy and bakery products; for each, the most relevant types of products will be selected using criteria including structural characteristics and industrial and societal needs, ensuring that benefits/risks, economic importance and sustainability are taken into consideration. The model development will be conducted in close collaboration with food manufacturers through a specification-based approach. The objective of the mathematical approach is to realise a complete dynamic description of food processing using an innovative strategy exploiting most recent advances in cognitive and complex system sciences to allow the generalised methodologies to be extended to other food products. Models and protocols developed within DREAM will be disseminated by expert partners via existing channels (EFFoST, ETP and national platforms, CIAA and national federations, EFSA, national regulatory bodies) to be used by scientists, SMEs and multinationals to improve nutritional quality and benefit-risk management of the food chain.

The consortium set out to categorise foods into four groups based on their structure: cellulose-based (fruit and vegetables); protein-based (meat); combined gelled, dispersed and aerated systems (dairy products such as yogurts, creams and cheeses); and solid foam (cereal products such as bread).\n\nBy using well characterised, realistic food models, partners aim to translate the research results to mathematical models that can simulate food structure numerically as well as the effect of thermal processes on food or nutrient composition.\n\nThe 'filled cellular solid model' for fruits and vegetables has been based on different varieties of tomato, apple and brassica. Information on the effect of processing of tomato to puree or of brassica boiling on cell lysis and nutrient content has been incorporated alongside microstructure and nutrient content data. Researchers used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry and other spectroscopy methods to obtain this data.\n\nSimilarly, for the 'proteinous cellular network model', proposed models have been designed to evaluate the protein changes induced by heating and to assess which physicochemical parameters are related to protein digestibility.  Knowledge on the mechanisms involved in denaturation and oxidation of proteins during cooking has also been incorporated in this model.\n\nThe consortium has based their dairy product model on a dairy dessert and a cream cheese model. Work on these models has enabled scientists to correlate the surface composition with both temperature and composition. With respect to the 'open solid foams model', various commercial sources of fibre (bread dough, bread and biscuits) have been tested, and testing protocols for rheology, thermal, porosity, colour and status of water have been designed and validated.\n\nDREAM's experimental food models are being assessed for their ability to estimate the bioavailability of nutrients, phytochemicals and toxicants, and for microbial food safety and quality.
