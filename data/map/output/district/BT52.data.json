One major goal of the proposed project is to perform long-term tests with different fuels in an upgraded 1 MWth pilot plant, aiming mainly at optimization of operating conditions and operational reliability. The successful operation of the upgraded pilot will provide the important validation step between the 1 MWth scale and a future 20 MWth scale pilot plant.

Seemingly unrelated events may trigger sudden escalation of unrest in neighbourhoods that have been under social tension for a prolonged period of time. Europe has seen many severe instances of urban unrest in recent times, but also the rapid expansion of new urban environments, and new types of communities due to migration, economic tension and social developments. These developments demand a better understanding of urban security throughout Europe, and more sensible policy development to create safer urban environments, and prevent undesirable security scenarios.\n\n\n\nPolicy makers need to know and understand which factors directly or indirectly impact urban security and safety. This includes an appreciation of security status (such as threat levels and potential for crime) as well as public perception of safety and security. A failure by policy makers to timely recognise and mitigate such threats may allow unrest to develop, and consequently affect the prosperity and functionality of the area. Policy makers need to become aware of the interdependency of factors, and define policy based on that comprehension. However, in reality, most decisions are made on the basis of local, long-standing best practices.

They compared a range of commercially available LED lamps, and investigated various ways to distribute the light, such as lenses and reflectors.\n\nA number of photocatalysts (chemicals that intensify the destructive effects of UV light) were also compared, and researchers chose titanium-based nanoparticles for the prototype purification system. The photocatalyst particles were mounted onto a glass plate in the final reactor.\n\nA small pre-prototype reactor was then built and tested for a week.

Biosurfactants produced by fermentation offer a worthy alternative to traditional surfactants, which are typically derived from non-renewable petrochemical resources and may cause environmental problems due to their ecotoxicity and poor biodegradability. Despite the clear advantages of biosurfactants, their overall use is hampered by the lack of structural variation. This is in sharp contrast to chemically produced surfactants where one can introduce variation by simply changing the building blocks. Structural variation is essential as (bio)surfactants find application in a very broad range of sectors. This project aims to alleviate this fundamental limitation by developing a generic biotechnological production technology for glycolipid biosurfactants. This will in turn significantly broaden the range of commercial biosurfactants, satisfying the need for structural diversity in the market. It is expected that this technology will result in a breakthrough penetration of glycolipid biosurfactants in the overall surfactant market, in this way helping to build the bio-based economy.\nIndeed, biosurfactants are a promising target for the biobased economy as the world surfactant production exceeds 13 Mton/year and is meanly based on petrochemical raw materials.\n\nThe very efficient biosurfactant producing yeast C. bombicola will be metabolically engineered such that all structural parts of the glycolipid biosurfactant molecule can be controlled: fatty acid tail, sugar moiety, acetylation and lactonization.

The use of biosurfactants reduces the environmental impact of industrial processes significantly, yet limitation in the types of naturally occurring biosurfactants impedes more widespread use.\n\nIn order to dramatically enhance the structural diversity of commercially available biosurfactants, scientists initiated the 'New-to-nature biosurfactants by metabolic engineering: Production and application' (http://www.biosurfing.eu/ (BIOSURFING)) project. They engineered the unusual yeast Starmerella bombicola as it is particularly good at producing glycolipid biosurfactants.\n\nDuring the first year, four new strains of S. bombicola were developed and investigated. The modified yeasts' fermentation processes were subject to scale-up and some modifications introduced for an economical yet productive medium, fermentation parameters and to minimise foam production. As new-to-nature compounds have different properties to their natural counterparts, a new technique for product recovery and purification was developed for one particular strain and others adapted accordingly on the basis of tolerable levels of impurity production.\n\nPartners have assessed samples and feedback prompted further modifications.

Considering the rapidly ageing European population and the resulting increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases, there is an urgent need to address the risk presented by nanoparticles towards neurodegenerative diseases. It is believed that nanoparticles can pass through the blood-brain barrier. Once in the brain, nanoparticles have two potential major effects. They can induce oxidative activity (production of Reactive Oxygen Species), and can induce anomalous protein aggregation behaviour (fibrillation). There are multiple disease targets for the nanoparticles, including all of the known fibrillation diseases (e.g. Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases).

Even the most efficient transfer allowed less than 1\u00a0% of the applied dose to reach the brain.
