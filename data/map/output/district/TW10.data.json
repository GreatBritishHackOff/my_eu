The link between metabolic and inflammatory disease is getting stronger, raising hopes for novel therapeutic targets to be exploited clinically. Clinical evidence generated by the Academic partners of the Athero-B-Cell Consortium demonstrates that CVD is associated with pro- and anti-atherogenic B cell responses. We aim to use existing proteomic, transcriptomic and miRNA data generated from large-scale clinical studies in previous EU-funded collaborative efforts to decipher the pathways that favor pro- and anti-atherogenic B cell functions in order to unravel a new set of therapeutic targets and refine potential vaccine strategies for CVD. The selection and validation of targets will be made possible by substantial technological advance achieved by the participating SMEs that are world leaders in the field of bioinformatics, genetic modification including humanised mouse models, and 3rd generation antisense drugs with locked nucleic-acid (LNA) design that are in Phase II human trials.  Academia-led innovation includes high-resolution methodologies such as CyTOF and ImageStream to interrogate available samples from clinical trials and the ability to validate the targets of interest in accredited models of CVD. The validation in vivo and in vitro of such targets will feed into the SME pipeline accelerating the process of drug discovery. The recent clinical success of 3rd generation antisense drugs underscores the advantage of the Athero-B-Cell approach: the seamless transition from validation tools to clinical applications.

The vocational training must respond to this development with its interface (function) role bitween the education and employmentsystem. Therefore, the internationalisation of our three vocational colleges (1550 students) is an important goal in the school's development. A learning abroad/internship in other European countries is a particularly effective tool for the students. Especially the importance of vocational education for the social development and the professional  perspective of each individual (every student) is undisputed. To gain intercultural experiences and skills while in school education, to deepen knowledge of foreign languages and to secure a head start when entering the profession is becoming increasingly important for many students. Furthermore, a learning stay abroad encourages andboasts the self-confidence and strengthers the emotional stability.\r\nParticipants: Per year, of the three vocational colleges, 94 students, 6 teachers/educational staff of the project group and 2 accompaying persons can apply for a scholarship. The students undergo an initial training/schooting with advanced professional knowledge in the following branches: Social & Health System, Nutrition & Home, Medien & Communication (Design Technical Assistant-GTA), the technical school of social work - social education.\r\nActivities: The students will complete a four-week intenship with project partners. Health/social/education branch:e.g. childrengarden, special scholls or facilities for disabled people in Finland/Sweden/Denmark. Facilities in Northern Europe especially  practise innovative approaches in the areas of early intervestion, education and inclusion. Countries in Northern Europe promote and practise the early intervestion and inclusion more professionally than other European countries. \r\nMedien & Communication (GTA branch): Many countries are very open-minded towards the social media and multimedia education. The GTAs get to know the future-oriented and innovative practises and new techniques through the project partners. They get introduced to the independent project management. The project partners define the project work in advance.\r\nProject implementation: The project group of the vocational colleges is responsible for organising the stays abroad. Appropriate project partners in European countries are build up, contractual frameworks (fixed contact, learning agreement/project agreement, support, language course, valuation) are defined. The information seesions for students/parents is followed by the application. The students are selected through an application process. Then preparation seminars follow. During their stay abroad they are accompanied by the project group/person of trust and their local contact (supervision, own facebook group). Following the stay abroad the students prepare completion reports and an assessment/evaluation is done. Public relations (press releases, school website, presentation at an open house) complete the project.\r\nResults: The students will gather knowledge and experience of other cultures, peoples , nations and behaviors. They can compare the working and living environment in the European area . They will expand their intercultural and social competences and strengthen their own cultural identity. The students will be able to make a more accurate picture of their professional career . The professional perspective is improved and the choice of professional is strengthened. Language skills and self-confidence are encouraged. They will change their view on Europe and the European Community. The commitment of the school to praticipate in the program Erasmus+ will be seen positively.\r\nThe educational staff: Learn impulses and appropriate tools for school development, strengthening of the European idea and internationalisation of the vocational colleges, expand intercultural competence and train intercultural sensitivity, international networkling and networking of partners with own school projects (e.g. Fair Trade , UNICEF , worldwide missionary projects SMMP , school against racism), promotion of young professionals.\r\nLong-term benefits: The students gain an edge in the career, it is a gain of experiences, self-confidence is strengthened and advanced language skills shape the future career. Young professionals are encouraged. The students  consolidate their decisions.\r\nPositive image and - so far - unique feature of the three vocational colleges of Walburgisschule Menden SMMP.

The workgroup is part of Elly-Heuss-Knapp's Europe-strategy who is the official coordinator of this application. This regional cooperation is based on the belief that the necessity for a stronger collaboration within Europe is needed, in order to be able to take part in shaping a continuously more globalized world, politically, occupationally, and culturally. Understanding and benefiting Europe as an opportunity: for these purpose our cooperation wants to contribute to. Appreciation for European integration does not develop by itself though nor by talking about it. \r\n\r\nThus the main goals for this project are:\r\no an active citizenship, European consciousness, and democracy\r\no intercultural and cross-generational education and lifelong learning\r\no Institutions and methods of improvement in quality (incl. school improvement)\r\n\r\nOccupational mobility abroad provides unique possibilities, for apprentices, students as well as teachers, to develop their expertise just as competence for methods and social interactions. Consequently, participants further develop personal and organisational skills, which sustainably contributes to a more globalized and modern apprenticeship in the interest of extensive quality development of all participating institutions from home and abroad. Students therefore enhance their national and international employment outlook and make an advance in their professional and personal self-manifestation. This applies similarly for teachers.\r\n\r\nThis application addresses several participant groups: students, teachers, trainers and school staff. Specific attention is put upon the expansion of the group of participants in order to enable not only students and teachers but also staff of the enticing companies and the school as a whole to profit from the school\u2019s international expansion. Thus, the school\u2019s Europe-strategy reaches beyond the school\u2019s boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe mobility of the teaching staff follows a certain standard, which can be adjusted as agreed upon with partner organisations on-site.\r\nIt applies for a 5-day stay (+2 days of travel) at the cooperating school and includes visiting class, communication about subject/topics of their own field, sustainable development, social aspects of everyday surroundings in school, etc. as well as getting in touch with partners of occupational education concerning sojourn of students or teachers in the host country in the future, e.g. visitation of companies etc.\r\n\r\nThe learner\u2019s mobility applies: Partnering companies enable an insight on and participation in diverse and relevant procedures. An example is the business \u201cHofzuckerb\u00e4ckerei Heiner\u201d in Vienna, which allows apprentices in a four-week internship to get in touch with the production of Austrian confection of pastry, dessert, and Viennese coffee specialties. Similar insights on regional and national special features (e.g. the Finnish educational system) will be offered to other participants as well.\r\n\r\nOverall the application applies to 62 participants (31students, 31teacher and school staff). Students are apprentices in the dual system, students of the vocational school, and students in of social pedagogy. In the selection process vital characteristics are personal attitude, expertise, and school performance.\r\nThe teaching staff is composed of teachers, who represent a broad spectrum of occupational (e.g. production technology, consultation and sale, etc.) and non-occupational (English, German, etc.) subjects. Of course the selection of participants follows a standardized set of criteria as well.\r\nThe trainers and School staff are involved for the first time in our international exchange within the framework Erasmus+. \r\nA coaching team, containing of subject teachers, a class teacher and instructors, supervises every outgoing mobility for students. During the period abroad these team members are contact persons and advisors for the students. The accompanied internships are guaranteed by \u201cblended monitoring\u201d. Timely and effective exchange can be ensured. \r\nThe work group at Elly-Heuss-Knapp and Mildred-Scheel-Berufskolleg evaluates individual mobilities as well as the whole project and will discuss its result with apprenticing companies, the principals (school management), teaching staff, school staff and single education sectors. The evaluation takes place according to a quality circle.\r\n\r\nAfter discussing the evaluation results with all the parties involved, recommended standards will be realized with regard to the school`s Europe strategy goals.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003754_14"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TW10"}
