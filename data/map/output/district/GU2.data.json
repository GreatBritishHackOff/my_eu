Crucial in this is the lack of appropriate outcome measures that can robustly identify patient benefit from a specific therapy. The lack of specific and sensitive endpoints to differentiate between responders and non-responders both at the level of pain and tissue structure modification (disease modifying OA drug: DMOAD) has led to trials that included hundreds of patients in each arm with at least 3-years follow-up. Even despite these enormous trials, EMA and FDA have not approved any DMOAD yet. There is a general lack of understanding OA pathogenesis, which appears rather variable and likely reflecting different phenotypes with fundamental differences in disease aetiology, tissue alterations, clinical manifestations (pain/mobility) and disease progression. Although the current mind-set for drug treatment in the field is moving to a more personalized medicine and patient stratification approach, there are no accepted methods or guidelines to classify patients according to their prognosis and differentiate between subsets in terms of diagnosis methodology and treatment plan. The APPROACH consortium brings together a competent and multidisciplinary group of stakeholders that will setup \u2013 for the first time \u2013 a longitudinal cohort based on highly innovative stratification methods that identifies different OA phenotypes and subsequently develop guidelines for differentially diagnosing the right patient for the right treatment.\n\nThe stratified medicine APPROACH \nThe APPROACH consortium brings together a unique complimentary set of skills to develop, validate and link biomarkers with biological processes and clinical end points in OA patient subsets. This will support future regulatory qualification and guide clinical trials for relevant endpoint validation, thereby paving the road for stratified or personalized medicine.

Interviews were conducted with national food authorities, representatives of the food industry and consumer organisations.

Based on the nutritional composition data of these foods, they will further study the healthfulness of foods with and without health claims as well as compare them against criteria in place for assigning health symbols.\n\nAdditional studies that have been undertaken include qualitative research into how consumers use their beliefs about health to interpret health claims and a pan-European survey on the differences in consumer motivation and ability to process health-related claims and symbols.\n\nThe methodological toolbox is currently testing select methods to measure consumer understanding, purchase and consumption behaviour with regards to health claims and symbols.\n\nIn addition to this, the research framework for the empirical investigation of the effect of health claims and symbols on understanding, purchase and consumption is being developed.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common types of arthritis and a major cause of pain and disability in older individuals. OA is expected to place a heavy burden on European healthcare systems, as European citizens grow older. Cartilage damage in OA is detected radiographically by decreases in joint space width (JSW). However, radiographic evidence is seen only after significant cartilage degradation has already taken place. The early stages of the disease may remain latent and asymptomatic for many years. Therefore, there is an acute need for reliable biomarkers and diagnostic tests that can facilitate earlier diagnosis of OA, and inform the prognosis, monitoring and therapeutic strategies for chronic and disabling forms of this disease. However, there is currently a lack of reliable, quantifiable and easily measured biomarkers that provide an earlier diagnosis of OA, inform on the prognostic of the disease and monitor and predict responses to therapeutic modalities. Biomarkers of tissue turnover in joints can reflect disease relevant biological activity and provide valuable information that may be useful diagnostically and therapeutically, potentially enabling a more rational and personalized approach to healthcare management.

To date, there is a limited number of European deployable structures being developed due to the inherit risk, cost and complexity associated with them. In addition, the conservative nature of the space industry combined with the environmental and materials challenges related to the deployment and sustainability of space structures makes the problem even more challenging.

It is based on carbon fibre-reinforced plastic booms with flexible solar cells between them, offering significant weight savings as compared to conventional rigid solar cell arrays. The same boom technology is also being employed in the InflateSail.\n\nThis drag sail consists of an inflatable mast and ultra-lightweight polymer sail, supported by carbon fibre-reinforced plastic booms.

While a mitigation test mission is beyond the financial scope of the present Call, we aim to provide detailed test-mission designs for the most feasible mitigation concepts, facilitating the rapid development of actual test missions at a later stage.\n\nOur project concept includes laboratory experiments and associated modelling to provide the necessary data pertaining to the behaviour of a NEO during a deflection attempt. The experimental results and modelling will help to improve our understanding of the nature of NEOs and allow the feasibility of mitigation techniques and mission designs to be accurately assessed.\n\nOur project includes appropriate partners from established space-faring nations outside the European Union. We propose to formulate a global response campaign roadmap that may be implemented when a serious impact threat arises. The roadmap will consider the necessary international decision-making milestones, required reconnaissance observations, both from the ground and from rendezvous spacecraft, practical prerequisites, such as precise orbit tracking, and a campaign of perhaps several mitigation missions, depending on circumstances.", 81715.0, 4750949.0, "NEOSHIELD", "Protecting Earth from impact threats", "Scientists cannot say when the next major asteroid will hit Earth, but it is certain that it will happen sometime in the future.

It is a major EU-funded initiative that pulls together all the latest science and combines laboratory experiments with computer modelling work. The ultimate aim of this effort is to develop some definitive plan to knock massive asteroids out of their Earth-bound orbit.\n\nAsteroids approaching our planet travel at up to 30 kilometres per second. At that speed, a body with a diameter of only 100 m, could have major consequences for our civilisation. The much smaller asteroid that exploded in 2013 at a height of about 24 kilometres near the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia, with a force nearly 30 times more powerful than the Hiroshima atomic bomb damaged buildings and injured over 1 000 people.\n\nThere are thousands of known NEOs just like that one, leading researchers to posit that a dangerous collision could occur as often as every few hundred years. However, it is possible to stop an asteroid from hitting Earth. The NEOSHIELD scientists and engineers are evaluating promising methods for asteroid deflection, which may simply mean providing a nudge in the right place at the right time.\n\nOne way to do this is to have a spacecraft impact the asteroid and impart enough force to change its orbit. NEOSHIELD researchers are working on finding ways to guide the spacecraft to the moving target at the right angle with the right velocity. Another way is to use the spacecraft's gravitational pull to tow the asteroid into a different orbit. If the asteroid is far away, a tiny tug could be sufficient to cause the asteroid to miss the Earth.\n\nThe most powerful but least appealing technique explored during the NEOSHIELD project relies on explosive power to divert or break up the Earth-bound asteroid. However, breaking up a large asteroid could be disastrous if it were to result in the Earth being showered by many large fragments, instead of impacted by one solid piece. NEOSHIELD scientists use data from asteroid observations, lab experiments, and computer simulations, to find ways to best protect Earth from future devastating impacts.\n\nAt the end of the project, the NEOSHIELD researchers will provide detailed space-mission plans, which could form the basis of a proposal to national and international space agencies for a mission to demonstrate the necessary technology.", "http://www.space.com/14370-asteroid-shield-earth-threat-protection-meeting.html", "http://www.surrey.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/143591.jpg", "fp7_101239_999985223"], ["7XH", "Protecting the health of Europeans by improving methods for the detection of pathogens in drinking water and water used in food preparation", "University of Surrey", "The AQUAVALENS consortium has brought together SMEs, Industries, Universities and Research Institutes with the mission of protecting the health of European Citizens from contaminated drinking water and water used in food processing.

As a result they have various (bio)analytical and technological applications. CPs are easily synthesised, both chemically and electrochemically under mild conditions, opening up vast possibilities for the immobilisation of biomolecules. Immobilisation of antibodies by entrapment within films or by covalent binding on these films permits the straightforward fabrication of biosensors. In electrochemical biosensors, non-specific binding (NSB) of molecules, e.g. proteins in serum, can occur, lowering overall device performance. In the past, surface chemistry has been employed to prohibit NSB on electrodes with sites that do not have antibodies attached. This surface chemistry however, impairs device performance. CPs have inherent dynamic surface properties that can be easily switched upon the application of an appropriate electrical potential. Their ability to be switched between different oxidation states and the associated switch in properties such as doping level, resistance and surface wettability can be controlled by changing the electrical potential resulting in reversible switching. Routes to nano-dimensional CPs, exhibiting markedly improved properties from those of the bulk materials, have been recently developed. We therefore propose to exploit the dynamic chemical nature of CPs to inhibit NSB in electrochemical bio-assays and demonstrate the efficacy of this approach using a simple nanostructured electrochemical prostate cancer diagnostic platform made from conducting polymers.

Scientific partners from 11 European countries, plus partners from Australia and USA, encompassing medicine, nursing, economics, informatics, sociology and policy management, will:\n\u2022\tCategorise the models, and school health and adolescent services.\n\u2022\tDevelop innovative measures of quality, outcome, cost, and workforce of each, and apply them using policy documents, routine statistics, and available electronic data sets.\n\u2022\tAssess effects on equality, and on continuity of care with secondary care.\n\u2022\tSystematically obtain stakeholder views.\n\u2022\tIndicate optimal future patterns of electronic records and big data to optimise operation of the model(s).\n\nThe results will demonstrate the optimal model(s) of children\u2019s primary care with a prevention and wellness focus, with an analysis of factors (including cultural) which might facilitate adoption, and indications for policy makers of both the health and economic gains possible. The project will have a strong dissemination programme throughout to ensure dialogue with public, professionals, policy makers, and politicians.  The project will take 42 months (36 of scientific work plus start up and close), and deliver major awareness and potential benefit for European children\u2019s health and healthy society.", 587921.0, 5778845.0, "MOCHA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.surrey.ac.uk", null, "h2020_193278_999985223"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7XH", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF SURREY", 374798.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.surrey.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF SURREY", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000005_coordinator"], ["7XH", "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "UNIVERSITY OF SURREY", 22166.0, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

Similar trends can be observed in the field of spoken-language interpreting where, alongside traditional onsite interpreting (i.e. where the interpreter and the speakers share the same space), remote interpreting is spreading through the use of telephone and videoconferencing. There is therefore a strong need for updating existing theoretical models of oral discourse and interpreter-mediated communication, and existing approaches to interpreter education. \r\n\r\nThis need becomes even more evident when considering the main pillars of the European Digital Agenda, which include enhancing digital literacy, digital skills and digital inclusion as well as generating benefits for society by drawing on ICTs to reduce energy consumption, support ageing citizens' lives, revolutionise health services and deliver better public services. Remote communication and remote interpreting respond to these pillars directly by reducing travel and fuel consumption; contributing to the inclusion of older people e.g. through remote healthcare; and making public services more efficient, e.g. through the use of remote interpreting services. The use of remote interpreting is also encouraged by Directive 2010/64/EU on the right to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings, which refers to the use of \u201ccommunication technology such as videoconferencing, telephone or the Internet\u201d (Art. 2) to optimise access to qualified interpreters. Remote communication and interpreting open up novel opportunities for gaining access to interpreters and for cross-border communication (including with interpreters). However, in order to develop a consistent approach across all stakeholders involved, the questions arising around remote communication and interpreting need to be addressed at transnational level.  \r\n\r\nAgainst this backdrop, the SHIFT project will create a European network - consisting of universities offering interpreting programmes and of interpreting service providers - whose goal is to develop a comprehensive pedagogical solution for training in remote interpreting at HE level and in Lifelong Learning.  This will be based on a) an in-depth study of orality in remote monolingual communication (English, Spanish, Italian) and remote, interpreter-mediated communication (for Italian<->Spanish, English<->Spanish, Italian<->English), and b) a market analysis to gain an in-depth understanding of the current and future demand for remote interpreting and the educational implications. Given that the demand for remote interpreting is growing especially in public service and business interpreting, where the main mode of interpreting is dialogue interpreting, the project will focus on the teaching of remote interpreting in dialogue situations . \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Develop a theoretical framework for the analysis of orality that focuses on discourse features which are especially relevant in remote communication and for language mediation and interpreting. Building on insights from linguistics and multimodality, a novel approach will be developed to investigate situated orality and describe how monolingual remote discourse unfolds. Particular emphasis will be placed on less studied but highly relevant oral phenomena such as register, speech markers, reported speech, pauses, interactional paralinguistic features (pausing and turn-taking patterns, backchannelling, hesitations, pitch and tone, changes in intonation, speed, pace, prosody, etc.), and related discoursive strategies typical of dialogic interactions; \r\n  \r\n2. Apply this framework to the description and analysis of remote interpreter-mediated interactions;\r\n\r\n3.  Carry out a needs/market analysis to elicit the most pressing knowledge gaps and educational needs in relation to remote interpreting; \r\n\r\n4. Develop a comprehensive pedagogical solution including a methodology and relevant pedagogical resources for remote interpreting, based on the specific features and challenges of remote discourse and remote interpreting and othe outcomes of the market analysis; \r\n\r\n5. Evaluate the pedagogical concept and resources with interpreter trainees and interpreting service provides in different fields of interpreting. \r\n\r\nThe SHIFT project will prove beneficial for trainee interpreters; academic and professional institutions involved in interpreter training; interpreting service providers and users in the public and private sectors. Interpreting students and practising interpreters will be enabled to increase their employability and digital literacy. Interpreting service providers will benefit by having access to a workforce of trained interpreters. Users of interpreting services will benefit from a better quality of service. Academic and professional institutions will benefit from bringing their curricula in line with market needs.", "http://www.surrey.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IT02-KA203-014786_3"], ["7XH", "European Network of Design for Resilient Entrepreneurship", "UNIVERSITY OF SURREY", 561315.0, "Entrepreneurship has been highlighted as a key action by the European Commission as a powerful driver of economic growth, job creation and innovation.

This project has two main objectives:   1. To mainstream gender in the way we teaching EU politics and European integration;  2. To ensure gender is included as a frame of analysis in current research about European politics at times of crisis. As political discourse concentrates on managing on-going crises, gender equality is increasingly seen as a second order issues. However, it is in the context of \u201ccrisis\u201d that the resilience of national frameworks for promoting social justice is tested. The UK\u2019s negotiations for exiting the EU are one of the most significant tests faced by the EU and its commitment to social policies. This project seeks to explore teaching EU studies, and specifically, gender approaches to understanding \u201cthe nature of the beast\u201d at a particularly sensitive time in the history of the organisation. Though this didactic process, students will thus develop critical skills and a more detailed engagement with the process as it unfolds. This will ultimately provide useful insights into the role of teaching methodologies for the development of engaged and critical citizens. Gender silences have become normalized by the failure of most academic research to include women\u2019s perspectives, beyond inclusion as a variable. This \u201comission\u201d only serves to further alienate women as political actors and citizens. Exploring the impact of Brexit on the UK\u2019s social and equality policies and pathways for citizens\u2019 engagement identifies a range of lessons that can be inform future policy at the European and national level.
