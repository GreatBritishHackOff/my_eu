Proteome targets will be focused on five categories of inter-related human proteins involved in signal transduction, cell regulation and cancer, namely protein kinases, SH2 domain-containing proteins, protein tyrosine phosphatases, proteins somatically mutated in cancers and candidate cancer biomarkers. Binders to about 1000 protein targets will be made over the course of the programme. A high throughput, coordinated production pipeline for antigens and binders will be established. Target antigens will be expressed in three forms, as folded full-length proteins or domains, as large peptide fragments (PrESTs) based on low homology to other human proteins and as small peptides, in some cases phosphorylated. Binder types to be generated include affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, recombinant antibody fragments and non-immunoglobulin scaffolds. An important aspect will be the development of highly efficient \u2018next generation\u2019 recombinant selection methods, based on phage, cell and ribosome display, capable of producing high quality binders at greater throughput and lower cost than hitherto. Systems and procedures for thorough binder validation and quality control will be established. The affinity reagents will be applied in advanced innovative and sensitive technologies for specific detection of target proteins and interacting protein complexes in cells, tissues and fluids, for improved understanding of protein function and new classes of diagnostic assays.", 325315.0, 12186751.0, "AFFINOMICS", "A protein affinity pipeline", "European researchers are building a database of functional proteins and their specific binders. With widespread applications in characterisation of the human proteome, biotech and biomedicine, the scope of the AFFINOMICS project is enormous.", "Proteins define the structure and function of any living organism. They are also crucial for the development of future therapies. Analysis of the proteome, or entire set of proteins produced by an organism, is an extremely complex and labour-intensive task. One of the important steps is to target proteins through systematic generation of binders.\n\nBy generating the reagents that bind proteins, the http://www.affinomics.org (AFFINOMICS) project aims to advance methodologies for proteome-related analysis of cell signalling and cancer intervention. This 5-year project, involving 20 participants from 8 EU countries, initiated the proteome-wide binder collection. The ultimate goal is to create an efficient pipeline for target (antigen) and immunological binder production, validation and quality control.\n\nAFFINOMICS focuses on characterisation of proteins involved in signal transduction pathways in normal and cancer cells, where the current need for specific, quality binders is especially great. Thus, proteins controlling the homeostasis of protein phosphorylation (protein kinases, SH2 domain-containing proteins and tyrosine phosphatases) as well as cancer biomarkers are of particular interest.\n\nAs the project draws to a close after four years, the partners have produced close to 500 full-length proteins and protein domains. Protein antigens include protein phosphatases, protein kinases, nine metabolic enzymes, ubiquitin pathway enzymes and cancer biomarkers. Specific binders contained over 1\u00a0000 rabbit, mouse and rat monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, nanobodies and scaffolds. The characterisation of the generated binders includes affinity control and a variety of protein microarrays. In addition, the methods for improved throughput of recombinant binders by ribosome and phage display have been developed.\n\nAll novel protein and binder information is included in the project database portal http://www.proteinbinders.org (Protein Binders), with a current listing of 1\u00a0400 target proteins. The AFFINOMICS approach to signal transduction and cancer will enable biomarker discoveries along with enhanced understanding of how signalling complexes become dysfunctional.", null, "http://www.paratopes.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/155633.jpg", "fp7_94419_959286448"], ["2EZ", "Optimizing drug safety monitoring to enhance patient safety and achieve better health outcomes", "Elliot Brown Consulting", "'Medicines are one of the most common health interventions. Expenditure on pharmaceuticals range from 10\u201320 % of all health expenditure in rich countries & from 20\u201360 % in poor countries. Knowledge of appropriate & safe medicines has grown. But the incidence of medicines adverse effects remains high. In a UK study 6.5% of hospitals admissions were related to an adverse drug reaction (ADR). And as many as 10% of hospital admissions may result in death or disease due to errors, half of which may be avoidable. There are gaps in what we know. But even where there is sufficient knowledge, brokering of that knowledge is insufficient. There is a clear & present need to build a network of stakeholders in patient safety, to strengthen information & share the evidence towards actionable learning.   The EC Work Programme for 2007\u20132008 relating to health calls for projects that 'advance the applications of evidence based medicine in Europe'. This proposal will respond to that call by strengthening what we know about medicines,  sharing that knowledge, & putting that knowledge to use, to reduce patient deaths & adverse effects due to medicines. Specifically, building patient safety networking to:  1. support & strengthen consumer reporting of ADRs & adverse events  2.  expand the role of national pharmacovigilance centres to prevent medicine-related adverse events  3.  promote better & broader use of existing pharmacovigilance data for patient safety 4. develop additional methods of pharmacovigilance to complement data from spontaneous reporting systems.  Achieving these objectives will help build the scientific basis needed for making informed policy decisions on disease prevention & therapy, & management of resources for health. In particular achieving these objectives will help to identify best clinical practice, to understand decision-making in clinical settings in primary & specialized care & to foster  application of evidence-based medicine & patient empowerment.'", 19923.0, 1905532.0, "MONITORING MEDICINES", "Strengthening pharmacovigilance", "Strengthening pharmacovigilance", "'Optimizing drug safety monitoring to enhance patient safety and achieve better health outcomes' (http://www.monitoringmedicines.org (MONITORING MEDICINES)) was designed to learn more about the underlying reasons for adverse reactions to medicines. The project also aimed to reduce patient deaths and negative health impacts from undetected medicine safety problems.\n\nSpanning 4 years, the project included a consortium of 11 partners from Africa, Asia and Europe. During that time, the partners strived to coordinate and encourage greater involvement of all stakeholders. The result was innovative solutions that otherwise might not have been explored. \n\nThe project focused on four areas: supporting and empowering patients in reporting medicine-related problems; strengthening the role of pharmacovigilance centres; making better use of existing data; and improving pharmacovigilance systems by developing additional data collection methods. \n\nProject members accomplished many of the original goals. The team produced a handbook, published by the World Health Organization (WHO), on how to establish systems for consumer reporting of ADRs. In addition, practical tools for web-based reporting were developed and implemented. \n\nTo improve current pharmacovigilance efforts, guiding principles for detecting, analysing and preventing medication errors were established. MONITORING MEDICINES then encouraged national pharmacovigilance centres to use the information collected to deepen their understanding of adverse incidents. One aspect of this work included developing methods for identifying sub-standard products.\n\nAnother goal was to help health care workers and the public retrieve information about ADRs related to HIV/AIDS treatment. By merging HIV ADR data from several sources into a common database, the team was able to develop tools for estimating ADR risks of individual patients. The project also developed methods for detecting problems with drugs for malaria and tuberculosis. \n\nMONITORING MEDICINES has laid the foundation for more work in this area.
