Nacelles and pylons will be included to accommodate two turbofan simulators which are to be supplied by DNW/ONERA.  A set of wings will be produced which will have removable leading edges and trailing edge flaps. This will allow a wide range of configurations to be investigated, including clean, take-off, landing and airbrakes on/off.  A modular empennage will also be produced. These items will be designed to interface with the remainder of the model which will be provided by a partner independent of this CFP.  The resultant model will be tested in a low speed wind tunnel at atmospheric pressure to investigate two topics. Firstly, the effectiveness of the empennage in shielding engine noise, and secondly the assessment of wing aerodynamic efficiency together with low speed take-off and landing performance and handling qualities. A large number of steady and unsteady probes will be installed in the model. Kulites \u00ae will be mounted in the thin nacelle and empennage.  These will be supplemented by gauges on the empennage to measure loads.\n\nAircraft Research Association (ARA) proposes to apply its extensive experience in wind tunnel model design and manufacture.  ARA will lead the programme of work with manufacturing support provided by Future Advanced Manufacturing Ltd (FAM).  ARA and FAM have worked closely on many wind tunnel model programmes, producing high quality models to exacting tolerances and demanding timescales. Over many years, ARA and FAM have established reliable working practices, innovative technical solutions to challenging requirements and effective project control and management processes. ARA and FAM will apply this expertise to the requirements of this new call to ensure that all aspects of the model are achieved in the required timescale and budget.\n.'", 239292.0, 1076818.0, "LOSPA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.futuream.com", null, "fp7_104825_983304424"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9JW", "Erasmus+ Realgymnasiet, Nyk\u00f6ping", "Gloucestershire Animal Welfare Association & Cheltenham Animal Shelter", 45715.0, "Realgymnasiet have had several earlier experiences of projects within the Leonard da Vinci program and we have been very pleased with the advancements our students have made during these projects.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project it to, by offering international apprenticeships, increase the employability of the student after graduation from Realgymnasiet in Nyk\u00f6ping. By participating in the project the student will have the opportunity to express him- or herself in speaking and writing, reflect over his or her personal development, gain an organizational ability, the power of initiative, language skills and trade knowledge.\r\n\r\nVia this project we will be able to offer internships (APL) at work places with vastly different contexts that what is available in Sweden. This will also develop our school. A third objective is to use the partners in the upper secondary foundation subjects by using them as real examples in order to increase the global awareness of the student.\r\n\r\nThe project is on a two year basis.\r\nThe biggest effect will be felt by the individual students who have had their employability increased by having had their network expanded, their globally aware trade knowledge developed, advanced their personal development, gained a cultural perspective etc. In addition to this, the school will also be affected in a positive way when the project is integrated in the general education. The project will also take off some of the pressure from the internships supplied by local businesses.\r\n\r\nIn the long-term we hope that this project will help us develop good relations with our partners and that it will increase the global perspective in our teaching and education today and in the future. We hope that this project will work to counteract youth unemployment by forming young adults who are sought after by the trade and who have an expanded cultural awareness in society.", "http://www.gawa.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA102-034320_2"], ["0LH", "Melting pot", "Community Mentoring and Support CiC", 11869.0, "Our social center implements popular education activities for all audiences. Our structure is located in the heart of a political district of the city. One of the major tasks of our youth center is to enable our public to overcome the social handicaps linked to our environment through leisure activities. In order to do this, the Youth Projects Department, financed in part by the Departmental Social Assistance for Children, provides support for adolescents from vulnerable neighborhoods, dropping out of school or in social or integration difficulties, around the concept Project, with non-formal education as a tool.\r\nMoreover, we also have as mission as an actor of popular education, to offer our publics key to understanding the world. We therefore need to make young people understand the opportunities and importance of European integration in their daily lives.\r\nThis project is also part of a particular context marked by a lack of knowledge of the European Union and the values of defends and a rise in euroscepticism and withdrawal.\r\nWe see that the young people we work with on a daily basis are not insensitive to these arguments.\r\nAfter a first visit to Italy, a few days in Lisbon and a visit to San Sebastian (European Capital of Culture in 2016), the dynamic was born.\r\nIn 2017, a stay will be organized in England during the holidays of April, which will be financed by the youth projects scheme 64.\r\nIn order to go further in this discovery, these young people wish to organize a European exchange based on combating stereotypes, promoting our cultural diversity and living together. Indeed, the impact of the rise of radicalization in our society is a brake on living together. This is why these young people wish that through this Melting pot, we will bring to light another way of seeing Europe.\r\nThis stay will be built using inclusive and cooperative games in order to allow each participant to find his place in this group. The Youthpass will also allow them to discover what non-formal education has for all of us and how to value it. The challenge is for these young people to be part of a process of action and take the means put at their disposal by the European Union to extend this exchange.\r\nTo build this project, we ask each group to come up with a video presenting the stereotypes we have towards each other. The idea is that at the end of this exchange a new video is realized around what looks like us.\r\nWe also wish to rely on the discovery of our respective gastronomies which can be a good pretext at convivial moments and the idea of doing together.\r\nThrough sporting activities we want to bring these teenagers to surpass themselves, to become supportive and to help each other.\r\nThus this project helps to develop living together through a European identity.\r\nThat is why, since last year, our structure has chosen to guide a part of youth activities towards the discovery of Europe. Based on a micro-pavement made by teenagers about simple questions about the functioning of this European union, we found that both young people and adults did not know how many countries constitute the European Union, Its history and even less its functioning.\r\nFollowing this experience, young people gathered to set up a program of activities around the discovery of Europe.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-2-FR02-KA105-013069_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "GL51"}
