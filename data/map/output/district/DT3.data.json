Within this new approach high precision process techniques for advanced dry fibre placement (AFP), infiltration (RTI/ RTM) and curing will be developed in order to maximize process efficiency at reduced costs and production time due to less material consumption, higher reproducibility, less energy, less waste and less rework.\nIn detail, innovative online process monitoring systems, probabilistic process simulation methods as well as a new method for in-situ structural evaluation of resulting composite properties will be developed, followed by a new knowledge-based method for in-situ process adjustment with respect to initial structural requirements. In this novel way, the required structural performance of the final composite product can be linked and assured during every manufacturing step, yet serving qualification issues at the earliest stage. Advanced characterization and testing techniques will be utilized and tailored to evaluate the process efficiency for required product quality by focussing on process robustness and throughput rate. Hereupon, the reduced carbon footprint is evaluated during manufacturing and in-service.\nThe resulting economic benefits of the ECOMISE approach will be evaluated and demonstrated by pilot implementations for industrial use-cases, considering particularities for volume part (automotive), large part (aeronautic) and thick complex part (marine) productions. Here, a significant impact is expected for SME and industry end users and suppliers of composite structures as well as of facilitators providing measurement systems and software solutions.", 280103.0, 4194648.0, "ECOMISE", null, null, null, "http://www.ecomise.eu/", "http://www.looptechnology.com", null, "fp7_108977_952296143"], ["4BG", "Integration of Security Technology Supply Chains and Identification of weaknesses and untapped potential", "SOLLERTA Ltd", "Security is one of the highest goods of mankind for which it is worth to make available the most advanced technologies in order to protect it. This achievement is a great challenge, realizing diversity of technologies applied for security and the tremendous resources to provide it all over Europe. The Security sector is widely recognised as a key asset for the future of Europe and World. Security is a concern for everyone. New ideas and developments are needed to improve the research capabilities of the actors involved and to improve the security of European citizens in general. However, Security is also by common standards a very unusual business requiring specific rules, namely: it works on very long lead times, requires huge capital sums for developing its products and research and also requires a strong relation between all the organisations involved in the area. Europe needs to invest in Security targeting at the Industrial and research communities in order to address today\u2019s and future challenges in this specific Sector, especially with respect to society and its political, demographic, social and economical evolutions. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to build and maintain a highly competitive environment and this is only possible if the full integration of business processes across enterprises (involving key suppliers, usually SME) throughout the entire supply chain is achieved. In order to accomplish this to the maximum extent, the SecureCHAINS project will take the necessary steps to review the present status, scrutinize available resources and initiate a dialogue with the stakeholders and integrators of the security \u201cbig projects\u201d. With this project we will have a clear picture of the technological capabilities in Europe regarding in particular the SME potentials to deliver the most advanced technologies to the integrated projects.", 72678.0, 928113.0, "SECURECHAINS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.sollerta.com", null, "fp7_94425_995670081"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DT3"}
