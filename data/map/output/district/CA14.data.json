The development will contain a dedicated meeting room facility, with dedicated shared facilities provided for a photocopier, other office equipment and kitchen facilities to assist new incubator companies. This will allow the existing ERDF Cumbria Growth Hub (CGH) to offer advice to potential business start-ups as well as giving continued advice to the occupier businesses.\n\nThe project will be delivered by Allerdale Borough Council (ABC) as the client/sponsor. ABC will be responsible for obtaining all the necessary statutory consents for the project including the land, environment and planning.\n\nABC will procure a design and build contract to construct the managed workspace using their in-house procurement team who will align the internal process with ERDF procurement guidelines.\n\nReedlands Road is in Workington, Cumbria. The general area is known as Clay Flats and is an established employment area with a range of older industrial estates and retail warehouse outlets. Whilst vacancy rates are high, this is largely due to the unsuitability of premises and there has been no development to deliver modern start-up units for a number of years.  There is also a lack of \u2018churn\u2019 in the market as growing businesses are reluctant to move due to a lack of move-on space. ABC have commissioned a Market Needs Analysis which will conform current stock condition and supply as well as demand for new start-up space which will provide useful evidence to support this application.\n\nThe development of the units will create opportunities for new business start-up and existing businesses currently situated elsewhere who are looking to expand and grow into larger premises. The development will also assist with giving business incubation advice by working in partnership with the CGH.\n\nThe project is dependent on the receipt of ERDF funding. ABC own the site and it is anticipated that all statutory approvals and the procurement of tenders can be completed to take advantage of any ERDF award with an immediate start on site following acceptance of any ERDF offer of assistance. This can be achieved by August/September 2017.\n\nThe completed project will deliver a mix of modern starter units and grow-on space which will provide accommodation for new ERDF eligible business start-ups and growing indigenous companies who have outgrown their existing accommodation.
