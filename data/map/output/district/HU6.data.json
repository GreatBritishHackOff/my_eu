These cells are localised within the myofibre basal lamina and are activated upon muscle damage, they proliferate and differentiate to replace the damaged muscle. Satellite cells are the key rate-limiting step for successful repair and the transcriptional cues that emanate from the skeletal muscle to activate regeneration are unclear. Thus, discovery of key molecules that regulate satellite cell activation will accelerate the ability to stimulate muscle repair. Estrogen related receptors (ERR isoforms \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3) are a sub-family of orphan nuclear hormone receptors that have been identified as major regulators of cellular and mitochondrial metabolism. Skeletal muscle-specific overexpression of ERR\u03b3 has been shown to drive metabolic and angiogenic muscle reprogramming in both health and disease. This project will test the hypothesis that targeting ERR\u03b3 in skeletal muscle will improve the myofibre regenerative capacity via satellite cell recruitment and secretion of growth factors. Identification of the underlying mechanisms will provide new knowledge that can be exploited to develop new therapeutic avenues for promoting satellite cell recruitment and myofibre regeneration in terms of injury or degenerative conditions like ageing and muscle wasting disorders. The hypothesis will be tested by addressing the following specific aims: 1) To establish the satellite cell proliferation and differentiation profiles in ERR\u03b3 transgenic muscles at baseline and in response to acute eccentric exercise. 2) To investigate the effect of ERR\u03b3 on satellite cell recruitment in response to muscle injury. 3) To determine the interplay between muscular revascularisation and reparative myogenesis by ERR\u03b3. 4) To determine whether an AAV-mediated ERR\u03b3 delivery increases satellite cell recruitment and improves muscle integrity.'", 81496.0, 81496.0, "MUSTEMERR", null, null, null, null, "http://www.hull.ac.uk", null, "fp7_191389_999903743"], ["7RX", "High spatial and temporal resolution Ocean Colour coastal water products and services", "University of Hull", "The HIGHROC (\u201cHIGH spatial and temporal Resolution Ocean Colour\u201d) project will carry out the R&D necessary for the next generation coastal water products and services from ocean colour space-borne data, giving an order of magnitude improvement in both spatial and temporal resolution and thereby opening up new applications and strengthening existing ones.

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. Standard therapy entails administration of chemotherapeutic agents, but not all NSCLC cases respond.\n\nAs an alternative to chemotherapy, targeted inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is used in patients with mutations in the EGFR gene. These mutations cause a constant activation of the receptor, thereby leading to uncontrolled downstream signalling and cell division. For this purpose, prompt analysis of EGFR mutations in exons 18\u201321 in the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor is a prerequisite for initiating therapy in NSCLC patients.\n\nCurrent polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods necessitate biopsy samples and are sometimes inconclusive due to the poor quality of the isolated DNA. As an alternative to tumour-based assays, scientists on the EU-funded http://www.lungcard.eu/ (LUNGCARD) project propose a blood-based test for genotyping the EGFR gene. The test will be performed as an automated process that contains a microfluidic chip and a bio-analyser.\n\nThe system is designed to process blood and perform EGFR genotyping in one single step. Circulating tumour cells are captured from blood, DNA is extracted and amplified. Subsequently hybridised with gold nanoprobes for mutations encountered in exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene.
