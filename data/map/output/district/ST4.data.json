Improved success rates for apprentices in being admitted to the first team ranks are anticipated, while improved academic attainment and European work experience will improve employability in secondary careers for those not fortunate enough to make the professional grade. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsequently this project will prioritise the following specific objectives :\r\n\r\n1. Improved physiological development of participants via the implementation of innovative training regimes as a direct result of structured Erasmus+ mobility programme.\r\n\r\n2. Skills and technology transfer between the Academy mobility apprentices and players in Europe.\r\n\r\n3. Improved employment rates for mobility participants in professional football careers.\r\n\r\n4. Improved linguistic skills for participants and an awareness of the cultural diversity within another European country.\r\n\r\n5. Increased maturity and sense of initiative.\r\n\r\n6. Increased self-empowerment and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n7. Enhanced intercultural awareness.\r\n\r\n8. More active participation in work and social environments.\r\n\r\n9. Enhancement of soft skills.\r\n\r\n10. Increased motivation both on and off the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Hungarian partner is fully committed to this Erasmus+ project, having successfully hosted participants in recent years from a variety of European countries under the Lifelong Learning Programme. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung people in the UK are, in the main, rather parochial in nature and exhibit a reluctance to undertake occupational mobility. This is particularly so with young people who have poor records of academic achievement or are socially disadvantaged. At present, fewer than 1% of persons under the age of 21 in the UK will undertake a work-related mobility placement. This project will directly address this national shortcoming and will contribute to the Lisbon and Europe 2020 Strategies. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootball clubs are fairly unique entities in the access to the media of publicity and this will prove an excellent dissemination vehicle to encourage other young people to seek out mobility opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStoke City FC\u2019s dissemination activities will be complemented by our Hungarian partner, who will actively participate in the dissemination processes by issuing press releases to local media throughout the mobility. Friendly matches played by the participants against host opposition will be publicised in the host region and attendance by local spectators  and vacationing Stoke City FC supporters will be actively encouraged.", "http://www.stokecityfc.com", "Stoke City Football Club Limited", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000580_coordinator"], ["4EG", "European Mobility as a Catalyst for Coaching Success", "Stoke City Football Club Limited", 18022.0, "Coach education is one of the most important duties of Stoke City FC Academy. Improvement of coaching skills through European interaction and exchange of innovation, coupled with enhanced employability for all mobility participants is central to this Erasmus+ application under Key Action 1.\r\n\r\nUnemployment rates for professional football coaches remain above the national average with 26% of coaches being unemployed at any given moment (UEFA, 2010). Mobility will provide VET Staff participants with additional European skills to reduce the risk of subsequent unemployment and improve job security and career progression.\r\n\r\nThe 35 participants in the VET staff mobility category will all be VET professionals drawn from three distinct categories:\r\n\r\n1. Coaches employed by Stoke City FC who are employed on a full-time basis at a variety of levels, from schools football to elite youth development coaching. Mobility will enhance personal skills via exposure to innovative Spanish coaching skills at the Olivanova regional centre in Spain where they will study innovations in player development pathways at Levente FC, Villareal FC and Valencia FC.\r\n2. Elite Academy coaches, having achieved UEFA A, B, or Pro Licence standards. These participants generally have aspirations towards coaching at first team level. This group will comprise both male and female participants and will involve mobility to study coaching structures at Real Madrid.\r\n3. Community  and grassroots coaches employed by Stoke City FC who are involved in community work and health education in the local area will travel to Benfica FC in Lisbon to examine community initiative in Portugal aimed at increasing participation rates and retention rates in men\u2019s and women\u2019s football.\r\n\r\nThis project will raise the importance and status of youth and talent development in England, in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s football, and this remains the key to future success. This can only be achieved if football builds on the large numbers of children and young people, male and female, participating in the game at grassroots level and community level, and this project will directly address these key issues. This area of talent development is where our more successful European partner nations have a greater comparative competitive edge over England.\r\n\r\nWork programmes for women\u2019s football coaches will place a strong emphasis on studying how young talented female players are identified at the earliest opportunity and how that talent is supported and sustained through the community and grassroots infrastructure in the European partner countries. These studies will be crucial to the employability of the participant coaches but will also be pivotal in increasing participation rates in women\u2019s football in England. These mobility outcomes will have a significant impact on the restructuring of Stoke City FC regional talent identification programmes in women\u2019s football.

These experiences are sources of inspiration for new ideas and projects enabling them to think outside the box.The mobilities also offer our teaching staff and learners the opportunities to see things from a different angle in order  to expand their  perspectives and to review their judgmental opinions on other countries and their home country. In a networking world especially this aspect is of utmost importance.Last but not least, all our participants will improve their knowledge of English during the mobilities by the practical use of the language.Furthermore, the international exchanges promote the social skills, networking and our learners'  job opportunites on a global scale,  their entrepreneurial spirit in terms of prospective careers as freelancers and their motivation to participate in the active life in Europe.Moreover, we consider the further training activites of our educational institue as a strategic instrument for the qualification of our staff and for making internationalisation a focal point of our educational culture.

GTI has a proven track record of collaboration and partnership to meet local, national and European needs. The provision of student & staff mobility opportunities across the EU will remain a core activity of the Erasmus+ program at GTI. GTI\u2019s international strategy is based on three key elements:(a) Participation of VET learners in companies(b) Participation of Staff - accompanying persons and work shadowing(c) Hosting of VET teachers and learnersThis application is for: Activity A1 Flow 1-17: 81 participants from each of the ten GTI departments will be involved.Activity A2 Flow 1-17: 32 accompanying staff Activity A3 Flow 1-4: 22 staff on work shadowing placements to shadow staff in similar roles in colleges around Europe to examine best practice and to actively include what is learnt into teaching & learning at GTI. Staff will be asked to disseminate knowledge at staff meetings.Developments: For our KA1 application we have added five new partners to our project. The new partners will allow us for the first time to send students from our healthcare department at GTI. We will also send staff members to work shadow nursing and healthcare teachers in SwedenChanges of Scope of the mobility flows: We are involving staff from our engineering and healthcare departments. This is a new development for our Erasmus+ project. We have added new partners to this KA1.Need for Accompanying Persons:The first accompanying person will travel out with the participants and spend the first week with the group. The second accompanying person will travel out in the final week to evaluate performance and goals achievement and bring the group back to Galway.The role of the accompanying person is extremely important to GTI and the project participants. 1) To co-ordinate and to guide the activities of the participants in the initial training period2) To supervise and to control the work/training plan of the participants3) To evaluate the activities after the first week and suggest alterations should this be required.4) To help to the participants in the resolution of problems or difficulties5) As some of the participants will never have traveled outside of the country before, they will possibly be anxious about traveling. The accompanying persons will help settle them in.6) There will be a mixture of applicants from different socioeconomic backgrounds \u2013 the staff from GTI will assist them settling in to a different culture. All concerns will be dealt with in situ.\u2022  As a mentor \u2013 students traveling for first time to work in Europe will more than likely hope they have someone they can speak with in relation to the role they are expected to perform. \u2022 As a support person \u2013 the students may look to someone to ask for help when it comes to accommodation or travel issues to and from the workplace. While a certain degree of maturity and workability is expected from all learners there should be a support person there in order to listen to the student when required.\u2022 As a negotiator \u2013 an accompanying person may often be the liaison person required if a situation arises that can only be dealt with by a person they are familiar with. For example, if the group dynamics in the apartment are proving to be a challenge, the accompanying person may be able to assist with a supportive voice and presence.\u2022 As a personal and social contact \u2013 this can prove very useful for the shy student for whom traveling away from home may be a daunting and new experience and it is often where younger participants may need a lot of support.Evidence of the success and necessity of  accompanying persons in Finland and Turkey (from previous projects):Finland: Students on the art course have traveled to Finland for the last three years. Up to 12 students are involved and they are not all placed in the same centre, many of the centres are at least an hour train journey up to a maximum of a six hour train journey. It is not always possible to plan in advance for every contingency. The issues have dealt with in the last number of years range from lost baggage needing to be forwarded to a variety of destinations, delays in students being met at arrival, difficulties purchasing tickets for onward journeys due to changes in transport systems and  problems with the accommodation. These issues are all solvable without much difficulty if there is someone there with some local knowledge and experience. In the last number of years we have had applications from students with Asperger's, who are deaf or have had other disabilities. These students need varying degrees of assistance and may need specialised professional assistance. The range of ages of students is quite wide, ranging from 18 years old up to 50- 60 years old.
