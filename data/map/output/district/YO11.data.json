It aims to develop an online sensor that will detect oil contaminants in all its forms (liquid, aerosol and vapor) with an extremely high sensitivity in accordance with ISO-8573 Class 1 standards. The lack of any reliable, highly sensitive, online sensor system has forced critical industries to rely on manual sampling and laboratory analysis which is labour intensive, inefficient, and cannot guarantee the conformance of the compressed air system to mandatory or industry adopted regulatory norms.  The sensor system will benefit a large category of industries that require high purity compressed air including, hospitals, pharmaceutical, automotive, chemical, textiles, electronics, clean rooms and other related industries. The ability to detect contaminants online, will significantly enhance the capabilities of these companies to guarantee the quality of their products and eliminate a number of risks and civil liabilities that are associated with non-conformance.\n\nTo achieve the project results, a consortium of 3 competent SMEs with an interest in the area of sensor development partnered with 3 leading research partners for the development of this project proposal. The major requirement for the sensor element is extremely high sensitivity, repeatability, robustness to interference, and stable calibration. It was decided after much deliberation that optical spectroscopy is the most promising technology for the development of such a sensor. We have dedicated 3 work packages (WP4, 5, and 6) for the development of 3 key components that are vital for the development of the sensor - namely development of the sampling system, development of the optical spectroscopy unit and development of electronics and software. The entire project will deliver a marketable sensor system in 2 years.", 208548.0, 1174329.0, "DOCA", "Sensing oil in compressed air", "Compressed air is often called industry's fourth utility after electricity, natural gas and water. Novel monitoring technology will now make sure the air supply is not contaminated with oil, a common and problematic condition.", "When compressed to a smaller volume, air attains higher-than-atmospheric pressure that makes it useful in many industrial and domestic applications. Compressed air generates force per unit area that can be used to impart motion in pneumatic tools. It can also atomise or spray substances such as automotive coatings, provide aeration for oxidation in pharmaceutical processes or clean electronics during production. Compressed air is extensively used in the health sector.\n\nThese and other high-end applications require very-high-purity compressed air. Oil contamination is a pressing problem and there is currently a lack of any reliable, highly sensitive, online sensor system to deal with it. EU-funded scientists are providing the much-needed solution with a new real-time sensor system through the project 'Detection of oil in compressed air (DOCA)' (http://www.docaspec.com/ (DOCA)). It will detect oil in all its forms (liquid, aerosol and vapour), ensuring compliance with regulations and eliminating the risks and liabilities associated with non-conformance.\n\nInvestigators have chosen optical spectroscopy as the sensor technology. It is the most promising technology to guarantee extremely high sensitivity (meeting ISO-8573 Class I standards of air quality), repeatability, robustness to interference and stable calibration. The sensor platform will consist of three units: the sampling system, the optical spectroscopy unit, and the electronics and software.\n\nThe sampling system has been designed and allows for non-invasive monitoring of oil contamination in compressed air flow. The optical sensor unit, based on photoacoustic spectroscopy, has been finalised and fulfils the requirements for a Class 1 sensor, a sensitivity of better than 8 ppb. The photoacoustic technology relies on the emission of sound (a pressure wave of thermal expansion) in response to absorption of electromagnetic energy (light). It is relatively simple and inexpensive yet highly sensitive. The associated electronics including software has also been finalised as a separate unit. A patent has been filed.\n\nThe DOCA technology for online and real-time identification of oil contamination in compressed air will have major impact on both the costs and effectiveness of monitoring. A commercial product is expected to follow shortly after completion of the project.", null, "http://www.castlegroup.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/153873.jpg", "fp7_104716_956398176"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2AG", "European WBL paths for quality professional training in tourism", "Crown Spa Hotel", 481272.0, "BACKGROUND\r\nThe tourism industry is a key sector of the EU. It is, in fact, over 10% of EU GDP (including the linked industries) and employs 9.7 million people and 1.8 million companies. In our country, the industry has, as a whole, about 191.000 businesses and, on 31st  December 2015, 886.000 employees, while in the two regions covered by the project (Sicily and Calabria), between 2015 and the third quarter of 2016, employment in the tourism sector has recorded an average increase compared to 2013-2014, by 3.8% in Sicily and 2.7% in Calabria. The data and projections show, however, on the one hand, the expansion of the sector and the tourist attractiveness of the two regions and, on the other hand, emphasize the need to provide trained young staff, highly qualified and able to respond positively to new and high competence requested by the local labor market.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nIn line with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy and ET 2020, WORK AWAY offers young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their curricular competencies: professionalism in the specific sector of TOURISM, soft skills, cultural knowledge and language skills. These general objectives are pursued through a mobility experience which consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 STUDENTS attending CLASSES IV and of 3 months for 80 newly graduated of the 8 participating VET Schools (Technical Institutes for Tourism and Hotel and Catering Schools). The project also promotes the exchange and transfer of good practices in VET by relating our VET system with the training and employment system to other European countries and contributes to the consolidation of the ECVET System.\r\n\r\nACTIVITY\r\n1. Transversal Activities: management and coordination; Dissemination and exploitation of results; Follow up;\r\n2. Mobility Preparation: Plan of communication and cooperation; Recruitment and selection of participants; preparation of participants; Learning plan definition;\r\n3.

PLAN OF COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION: it provides for the involvement of all participants in the partnership with effective tools and rules to maintain a high level of interest on the project.\r\n4. STRATEGIC PLAN FOR DISSEMINATION AND EXPLOITATION: includes phases and methods to be adopted by all partners to disseminate and exploit the project and its results all over the duration and behond.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS\r\na. The development of highly specific and innovative skills in the tourism and catering sector;\r\nb. More competitive and greater employment opportunities in the labor market for the participants;\r\nc. The development and innovation of VET systems.\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\nThe project includes a significant impact on the VET Systems through: learning outcomes achievement of participants to mobility; skills acquired from the staff involved in the project; recognition of skills in an ECVET-compatible framework. It represents also an added value and development opportunity for the participating organizations, which will consolidate a new training segment to complete the technical and vocational education and answer the demand of enterprises of high professional skills.\r\n\r\nLONG-TERM BENEFITS\r\nIn the long term, thanks to the dissemination tools developed and to the size and importance of the consortium, it is expected to have a multiplier effect both regionally, and at national and EU level and the orientation of public policies on the base of the results of the project, using in addition, as a standard model, all procedures and best practices developed within the Project.", "http://www.crownspahotel.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005725_8"], ["2AG", "Rete Nazionale Istituti Alberghieri e Macroregione Adriatico-ionica: sfide e obiettivi comuni di un piano integrato di sviluppo territoriale per il Turismo", "Crown Spa Hotel", 565724.0, "The RENADRION Project is born and implemented in a dual context:\r\n1) the NATIONAL NETWORK OF TOURISM and CATERING SCHOOLS (RENAIA) of which the 15 institutes involved are members, including the Leader, IPSSEOA \"CORNARO\", who also holds the Presidency and that is the reality more representative in Italy, in terms of membership, of the education and training offer in the hospitality and catering industry;\r\n2) the European Strategy EUSAIR (launched by the EU Commission in June 2014) that aims to increase the attractiveness and competitiveness, in terms of tourism, of the ADRIATIC-IONIC REGION, supporting the development of coastal, maritime and inland tourism, through the improvement of the quality tourism services and promoting economic prosperity and social development through the growth of the professions and the creation of new jobs.\r\nIn line with these strategies and objectives, RENADRION proposes, therefore, to offer to 120 STUDENTS (of which 12 are disabled and / or with special needs) in initial vocational training of the fourth year and 90 recent graduates young people of 15 the VET Schools involved, including the Lead School, the opportunity to perform a mobility experience of European level of the duration of, respectively, 4 weeks and 3 months. All participants attend or have just finished (from no more than one year) a vocational  and training path in the field of tourism services and who will carry out the relevant professional work experience abroad.\r\nRENADRION intends, therefore, offer young people experience in companies of their field of study that includes the ability to deal with the language skills possessed and the acquisition of specific job competencies. It aims, in particular, to align the learning outcomes achieved in the education and training path with the needs of the labor market in the field of promotion and management of tourism and enhance the knowledge of the development strategies adopted in other contexts in the field of interest, using the internship experience as a fundamental part of the training.\r\nAmong the general objectives of the project:\r\n- Promote lifelong learning as a right of the persons to increase and update their skills, abilities and knowledge in formal, non formal and informal learning contexts;\r\n- Promote the transparency of learning and compliance training to the needs of businesses and professions in order to facilitate the meeting between demand and supply of labor and increase the productivity and competitiveness of the production system;\r\n- Enlarge the marketability of qualifications at national and EU level in order to facilitate geographical and occupational mobility also in terms of the internationalization of businesses and professions.\r\nMobility experiences will increase also the soft skills of the participants, such as the spirit of initiative, adaptability and the ability to relate and interact with cultural backgrounds different from their own.\r\nThe transparency of learning in the tourism sector will be guaranteed, finally, through ECVET and the establishment of a partnership able to work on mutual understanding on units of learning outcomes and method of evaluation, validation and recognition of knowledge, skills and competencies achieved by participants in mobility.\r\nThese, therefore, the expected impacts:\r\n- The development of specialized skills of the target groups involved (210 young students and recent graduates);\r\n- Set up of training models and tools of innovative value;\r\n- Diffusion of results and training models between stakeholders in the macro sector concerned and in the VET systems;\r\n- Make available the results and training models for institutions and professionals of local/regional level.\r\nThe project can therefore be considered exemplary, being integrated into the strategic development of each partner in the consortium, as well as transferable outside of it, for different reasons:\r\n- It represents the effective realization of a model of WORK BASED LEARNING with a system of actions aimed at specific training, but also at the global growth of the person. It provides continuous and active involvement of all the figures of the project staff and supervised by trainers and mentors; activities of support and mentoring; teaching and training methods based on the involvement, participation, the high integration between theory and practice, the development of practical skills immediately spendable, the validation of acquired skills;\r\n- It lays a system of midterm and final means to monitor the progress in terms of learning achieved by the participants, as well as its evaluation, validation and certification.", "http://www.crownspahotel.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005892_12"]]}}, "outwardCode": "YO11"}
