Waste2Go will valorise this heterogeneous material that has significant socio-economic costs. It will involve the innovative transformation of  over 55% of MSW, the biogenic fraction, into renewable chemicals, advancing beyond current approaches to bio-refining which employ crop derived feedstocks. A cascade approach will be adopted to maximise value. Annually >180 million tonnes of MSW are discarded in the EU27, (in excess of 1kg per citizen every day). Waste2Go will develop technologies to improve waste management and increase value (social, economic & environmental). This will be validated as Best Available Technology (BAT) by recognised LCA experts. It will extend beyond the state-of-the-art in enzyme based technologies for fine-tuned biomass processing and combine them with intelligent techniques for MSW fractionation and downstream processing. It will unlock economic value from MSW and reduce its serious environmental impacts. MSW will become a sustainable source of raw materials for the chemical industry, replacing fossil sources. It will advance leading EU expertise in:\n1) Enzyme research, on rapid and controlled substrate digestion;\n2) Bioprocess engineering and;\n3) Advanced purification techniques, to maximise value.\nThis project will improve the competitiveness of SMEs in the waste management sector; a sector with the highest proportion of SMEs and the lowest proportion of valued added of any EU industrial sector, although worth over \u20ac100 billion p.a. and employing over 1.2 million people.\nThe consortium involves five SMEs, two research institutes and one multinational company providing market pull. The EU chemical industry is the world\u2019s largest, with sales of \u20ac526 billion, a trade surplus of \u20ac47 billion and employing over 1.15 million people.", 147256.0, 3677307.0, "WASTE2GO", "Turning waste into high-value chemicals", "Researchers are transforming municipal waste into renewable chemicals to unlock economic value and reduce environmental impact.", "More than 180 million tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) are discarded in Europe every year. One way to reduce environmental impact and add economic value is to develop innovative ways to convert this waste stream into useful, renewable products.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.waste2go.eu/ (WASTE2GO) project aims to develop and verify technologies that can transform more than 55\u00a0% of MSW into a source of sustainable, high-value chemicals.\n\nAs such, researchers have developed novel enzyme-based systems to digest, or breakdown, MSW. These enzymes are now produced in large volumes to facilitate small-scale digestion trials.\n\nThe project also introduced two novel engineering systems that are designed to effectively handle solid waste products. The aim is to successfully extract valuable chemicals at every stage of the digestion process.\n\nThis technology has already exceeded current approaches to biorefining, which use crop-derived feedstocks. Once complete, WASTE2GO will help strengthen Europe's leading position in innovative enzyme technology, while easing the environmental burden of MSW.", null, "http://www.chemoxy.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/155689.jpg", "fp7_105478_953340057"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TS3"}
