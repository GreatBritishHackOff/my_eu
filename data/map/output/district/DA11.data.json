In the last decade, Federated e-Infrastructures have evolved from a set of ad-hoc academic services to a European scale resource for the science and technology sector.<br/>ITSM approaches (like ITIL or ISO/IEC 20000) provide sets of processes and good practices, widely used in the commercial sector, that are used to build business and service provisioning models, structure business and management activities, and define, agree and operate services based on binding, well-understood agreements (service level agreements, SLAs) or contracts.<br/>FedSM will act in a way analogous to commercial ITSM consultancy, engaging with three 'client organisations':  two National Grid Infrastructures and the European Grid Initiative, which are all part of the project consortium and committing to adopting an ITSM approach.  FedSM will analyse their specific situations, provide new models for their processes and support them in assessing and implementing this new ITSM approach. To this end, FedSM will focus on (1) supporting the definition and implementation of business models, services, processes and a proto standard for Federated Infrastructure ITSM, (2) building up ITSM knowledge in the 'client organisations' through professional training and internationally recognised certification, and (3) consulting the 'client organisations' in defining their specific requirements for automated solutions and selecting adequate tools.<br/>FedSM will not be limited to supporting the involved 'client organisations' in implementing ITSM. Based on the client-specific ITSM programs and the lessons learned, a generic conceptual framework for implementing ITSM in Federated e-Infrastructures based on different business models in the areas of Grids and federated clouds will be developed.", 139843.0, 976212.0, "FedSM", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_104760_999636702"], ["0HJ", "Financial Study for Sustainable Computing e-Infrastructures", "Emergence Tech Limited", "Over the last ten years the European countries and the EC have made significant investments in e-Infrastructures for scientific computing, notably High Throughput Computing (HTC) and High Performance Computing (HPC) services. Their contribution in pushing the European research towards a leading position in addressing global challenges has been validated by a growing number of research initiatives, most notably the ESFRI projects. Sustainability of such services is crucial, as the research supported by them is more and more crucial for European competitiveness \u2013 and sustainability can be planned better if the costs are known. The emerging commercial offerings (Cloud-based HTC and HPC solutions) pose additional challenges and opportunities for sustainability. They represent new ways of explicit monetisation of computing and open the way to new business models (e.g. service fees or of lease industrial resources). The upcoming next framework programme and broader EU policies depend on more careful impact assessment, which requires accurate cost estimates. Similarly energy saving and green computing will be increasingly relevant, and project results will also allow estimating potential benefits in these areas. It is thus vital to understand the cost of the dedicated computing related e-Infrastructures, as expressed by EGI and PRACE initiatives. The calculation of such costs is not trivial; keeping detailed accounting data for the evolving mix of capital (hardware) and operational (personnel, energy) expenditures is only one of the challenges. The scope of the e-FISCAL proposal is to analyse such costs, facilitated by national entities (NGIs and HPC centres), compare them with equivalent commercial leased or on-demand offerings and provide an evaluation report. The execution of the survey builds on a small-scale survey conducted by the e-IRGSP2 project that proved the complexity of the issue and provided tacit knowledge valuable for the e-FISCAL project.", 78237.0, 325500.0, "e-FISCAL", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_99706_999636702"], ["0HJ", "Service Delivery & Service Level Management in Grid Infrastructures", "Emergence Tech Limited", "Service Level Management (SLM) is considered a vital discipline in the management of today's information technology infrastructures. The widespread and commonly approved international standard for IT Service Management, ISO/IEC 20000, describes the objective of Service Level Management as follows: To define, agree, record and manage levels of service. All of these aspects are crucial when bringing the new e-Infrastructure technologies, processes and services to new user communities. Only by having a framework for establishing a common understanding of these four aspects of the services provided and used, can the e-Infrastructure maintain a sufficient 'customer satisfaction' on sustainable level.<br/>However, SLM has not been successfully implemented and deployed in any of the next generation IT infrastructures (e-infrastuctures). To remedy this situation,  grid environments are seen as a very promising starting point. By establishing grid-wide service catalogs and service agreements between customers and a virtual grid provider, grid services can be delivered in a more deterministic fashion. As the cross-organisational collaboration models are evolving rapidly in the Grid domain through the EGI initiative, gSLM project can act as a crucial enabler for the application of grid technology and the grid concept in general also in environments where predictable service utility and warranty are seen as significant requirements.<br/>The goal of the proposed gSLM project is to bring together European experts from the grid and service management community and promote the development of SLM solutions that are well tailored to the requirements of and operational conditions in the e-infrastructure service provision today and in the future.", 124188.0, 515952.0, "gSLM", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_95672_999636702"], ["0HJ", "e-Infrastructures Reflection Group Support Programme 2", "Emergence Tech Limited", "The e-Infrastructures Reflection Group Support Programme 2 (e-IRGSP2) project provides full support to the work of the e-Infrastructures Reflection Group (e-IRG). The e-IRG has been instrumental in the development of the policies and documenting the best practices, producing five white papers and a roadmap presenting the consensus of the leading European Grid and networking infrastructure experts. The e-IRGSP2 uses the experiences of the previous support action (e-IRGSP), combined with an in-depth analysis of the evolution of the e-IRG itself, to plan for an optimal support strategy. The activities of the project are based on supporting the process of the e-IRG, modelled as an iterative repetition of four phases: (1) Studying the state-of-the-art and best practices, (2) Creating scenarios based on the data (white papers and roadmaps), (3) Establishing consensus about the actions needed (e-IRG recommendations) and (4) Engaging with the necessary stakeholders. The support is based on three services: Secretarial support, which is involved in all of the activities. Its role is central in enabling e-IRG to study the state-of-the-art and engage with the necessary stakeholder groups through communication and dissemination support.
