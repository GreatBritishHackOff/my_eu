In the last decade, Federated e-Infrastructures have evolved from a set of ad-hoc academic services to a European scale resource for the science and technology sector.<br/>ITSM approaches (like ITIL or ISO/IEC 20000) provide sets of processes and good practices, widely used in the commercial sector, that are used to build business and service provisioning models, structure business and management activities, and define, agree and operate services based on binding, well-understood agreements (service level agreements, SLAs) or contracts.<br/>FedSM will act in a way analogous to commercial ITSM consultancy, engaging with three 'client organisations':  two National Grid Infrastructures and the European Grid Initiative, which are all part of the project consortium and committing to adopting an ITSM approach.  FedSM will analyse their specific situations, provide new models for their processes and support them in assessing and implementing this new ITSM approach. To this end, FedSM will focus on (1) supporting the definition and implementation of business models, services, processes and a proto standard for Federated Infrastructure ITSM, (2) building up ITSM knowledge in the 'client organisations' through professional training and internationally recognised certification, and (3) consulting the 'client organisations' in defining their specific requirements for automated solutions and selecting adequate tools.<br/>FedSM will not be limited to supporting the involved 'client organisations' in implementing ITSM. Based on the client-specific ITSM programs and the lessons learned, a generic conceptual framework for implementing ITSM in Federated e-Infrastructures based on different business models in the areas of Grids and federated clouds will be developed.", 139843.0, 976212.0, "FedSM", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_104760_999636702"], ["0HJ", "Financial Study for Sustainable Computing e-Infrastructures", "Emergence Tech Limited", "Over the last ten years the European countries and the EC have made significant investments in e-Infrastructures for scientific computing, notably High Throughput Computing (HTC) and High Performance Computing (HPC) services. Their contribution in pushing the European research towards a leading position in addressing global challenges has been validated by a growing number of research initiatives, most notably the ESFRI projects. Sustainability of such services is crucial, as the research supported by them is more and more crucial for European competitiveness \u2013 and sustainability can be planned better if the costs are known. The emerging commercial offerings (Cloud-based HTC and HPC solutions) pose additional challenges and opportunities for sustainability. They represent new ways of explicit monetisation of computing and open the way to new business models (e.g. service fees or of lease industrial resources). The upcoming next framework programme and broader EU policies depend on more careful impact assessment, which requires accurate cost estimates. Similarly energy saving and green computing will be increasingly relevant, and project results will also allow estimating potential benefits in these areas. It is thus vital to understand the cost of the dedicated computing related e-Infrastructures, as expressed by EGI and PRACE initiatives. The calculation of such costs is not trivial; keeping detailed accounting data for the evolving mix of capital (hardware) and operational (personnel, energy) expenditures is only one of the challenges. The scope of the e-FISCAL proposal is to analyse such costs, facilitated by national entities (NGIs and HPC centres), compare them with equivalent commercial leased or on-demand offerings and provide an evaluation report. The execution of the survey builds on a small-scale survey conducted by the e-IRGSP2 project that proved the complexity of the issue and provided tacit knowledge valuable for the e-FISCAL project.", 78237.0, 325500.0, "e-FISCAL", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_99706_999636702"], ["0HJ", "Service Delivery & Service Level Management in Grid Infrastructures", "Emergence Tech Limited", "Service Level Management (SLM) is considered a vital discipline in the management of today's information technology infrastructures. The widespread and commonly approved international standard for IT Service Management, ISO/IEC 20000, describes the objective of Service Level Management as follows: To define, agree, record and manage levels of service. All of these aspects are crucial when bringing the new e-Infrastructure technologies, processes and services to new user communities. Only by having a framework for establishing a common understanding of these four aspects of the services provided and used, can the e-Infrastructure maintain a sufficient 'customer satisfaction' on sustainable level.<br/>However, SLM has not been successfully implemented and deployed in any of the next generation IT infrastructures (e-infrastuctures). To remedy this situation,  grid environments are seen as a very promising starting point. By establishing grid-wide service catalogs and service agreements between customers and a virtual grid provider, grid services can be delivered in a more deterministic fashion. As the cross-organisational collaboration models are evolving rapidly in the Grid domain through the EGI initiative, gSLM project can act as a crucial enabler for the application of grid technology and the grid concept in general also in environments where predictable service utility and warranty are seen as significant requirements.<br/>The goal of the proposed gSLM project is to bring together European experts from the grid and service management community and promote the development of SLM solutions that are well tailored to the requirements of and operational conditions in the e-infrastructure service provision today and in the future.", 124188.0, 515952.0, "gSLM", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_95672_999636702"], ["0HJ", "e-Infrastructures Reflection Group Support Programme 2", "Emergence Tech Limited", "The e-Infrastructures Reflection Group Support Programme 2 (e-IRGSP2) project provides full support to the work of the e-Infrastructures Reflection Group (e-IRG).

The internationalization of the techniques and tools used in schools would allow teachers to implement a more attractive teaching method, able to enhance socio-affective skills, to intercept different cognitive styles, to focus on the difficulties of each student in order to reduce the percentage of school dropouts, as required by the ET2020 strategic framework. \r\nThe project revolves around the issue of school dropout, which is a multidimensional phenomenon that goes beyond the school context itself and that depends also on the adolescent\u2019s life and social environment. The framework of the context refers to users with low rates of study motivation and high levels of school dropout in an area at high social risk in which the school discomfort can no longer be considered as an emergency, but actually as a structural feature of the training system and this calls for a new revision. A training course led abroad would enable teachers, through their comparison with colleagues from other countries, to acquire new group class management techniques in order to detect and prevent the phenomena of school drop-out, which undoubtedly represents an element to counteract.\r\nThe teachers that will take part in this project are highly motivated to increase their  didactic, methodological, linguistic  competencies as well as ICT abilities, in order to improve the educational offer of that the Institute, promoting this project, is able to deliver.\r\nThe main aims that the project is going to pursue are the following: \r\n- to explore, develop and evaluate the best practices resulting from the cooperation of a large group of teachers and educators;\r\n- to attend English language courses in order to reach level B2 in anticipation of a possible CLIL course;\r\n- to acquire language skills in L2 for professional debates and prepare more interesting teaching materials and tools able to adapt to different learning needs;\r\n-to reduce the level of early school drop-out;\r\nThe number of participants will be of 15 people, and they will be selected among the teaching and management staff of the Institute and the group will live an experience functional to the improvement and strengthening of their competencies within the partner institutes in United Kingdom, which are, more precisely, the Conlan School in St. Asaph and the Tellus Education Group in Plymouth, coordinated by T.E.E.P. \u2013 Training Education and European Project. \r\nThe activities planned and offered by the Institute are the following:\r\n- statistical analysis of cohorts, analysis of the criteria of selection of those students resulting more at risk; \r\n- use of active listening techniques and peer-tutoring so as to identify difficulties and/or criticisms;   \r\n- personalized interventions;\r\n- feedback and evaluation results.\r\nThe need to evaluate students\u2019 performance, along with the implicit/explicit expressions of discomfort is not new, but the methodological tools of research characterizing this project are innovative, based on a \u201cpreventive approach\u201d and connected to aspects of both statistical and psycho-pedagogical nature. \r\nThe project will monitor the impact on the general didactic activity of the institute and will evaluate whether the training activities carried out abroad will have triggered the change and innovation desired.
