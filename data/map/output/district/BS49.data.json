The bottlenecks arise from the present lack of up-scalable processes that can meet the needs for nanomaterials in PV applications, and the lack of relevant equipment and industrial lines. In order to remove these bottlenecks, the main objectives of NanoPV are: 1) To develop technologies that can increase the efficiency and reduce the processing cost of existing silicon solar cell technologies using nano-scale effects provided by nanomaterials to above 20% for wafer based and above 15 % for thin film silicon based solar cells at a processing cost for modules well below 1 \u20ac/watt. 2) To design and to fabricate low cost solar cells entirely from nanomaterials by using nanostructures. An efficiency of above 10 % at processing costs well below 1 \u20ac/watt is targeted with potential of further significant improvements in the future. 3) To develop up-scalable cost effective processes and equipment in order to implement both enhanced standard solar cells and solar cell based on nanomaterials as well as related modules to existing pilot lines. 4) To create new market opportunities for the industrial partners. Nanotechnology will be applied for both already existing conventional Si solar cells (wafer and thin-film based) and for advanced solar cells entirely based on nanostructures. The main scientific efforts will be on understanding and exploitation of such nanomaterials as i) 0D quantum dots, nanocrystals and nanoparticles, ii) 1D nanowires and nanorods, and iii) 2D nanomaterials such as ultrathin layers. A large number of specialised technologies will be applied in the project. Therefore, in order to ensure successful completion, a comparatively large consortium of 9 complementary research partners and 3 industries has been assembled.", 192390.0, 4344450.0, "NANOPV", "Cost-effective, high-efficiency solar cells", "Harvesting the Sun's virtually limitless supply of energy is an incredibly sustainable way to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.

The EU-funded project 'Nanomaterials and nanotechnology for advanced photovoltaics' (http://www.sintef.no/Projectweb/nanoPV/ (NANOPV)) addressed current bottlenecks in production with large-scale processes and equipment for production of PVs from nanomaterials.\n\nThe consortium studied a large variety of such materials from zero-dimensional quantum dots, nanocrystals and nanoparticles, to 1D nanowires and nanorods and even 2D ultra-thin nanolayers. In addition to materials' development to enhance efficiency, scientists developed cost-effective large-scale processes and equipment for integration into existing pilot and industrial production lines.\n\nNanomaterials can significantly enhance efficiencies by making better use of the electromagnetic spectrum, taking advantage of a broader range of available wavelengths. More than 20 % energy conversion efficiency was targeted for wafer-based Si devices and more than 15 % for epitaxially grown thin-film Si solar cells. Scientists also assessed low-cost solar cells produced entirely from nanomaterials.\n\nOf the more than 50 materials tested, 9 were integrated in wafer-based Si devices and 11 in thin-film Si solar cells. Enhanced conversion efficiency was seen in some cases. A database of the most promising candidates has been created and several were chosen for optimisation within the project.\n\nFor instance, the team optimised fabrication of solar cells with Si nanorod/nanowire structures. This resulted in thin film solar cells of high efficiency (10 %) that can be produced cost effectively at industrial scale. In addition, incorporation of Si-based nanolayers into Si-based solar cell structures resulted in high conversion efficiency for both wafer-based (> 20 %) and epitaxially grown thin-film (~ 15 %) architectures.\n\nNANOPV demonstrated the feasibility of high-efficiency, low-cost PV devices using nanomaterials.

For a successful and broad penetration of LEDs into the general lighting market two key factors are required: high efficiency and low cost. Two new disruptive technologies based on nanostructured semiconductors are proposed to address these key factors. A novel epitaxial growth technique based on nanorod coalescence will be explored to realize ultra-low defect density templates which will enable strain-relieved growth of LEDs and thus achieve higher efficiency. The second highly innovative approach is the growth of directly emitting Gallium nitride based nanorod structures. These structures are expected to produce exceptionally high efficiency devices covering the whole visible spectrum and even phosphor-free white LEDs. Significantly, our new nanostructured compound semiconductor based technology will enable LED growth on low-cost and large-area substrates (e.g., Silicon) as wafer bowing will be eliminated and thus lead to a dramatic reduction in production costs.

One idea worth investigating is the use of nanorods, or more specifically of nano-structured gallium nitride-based semiconductors to create clean and inexpensive lighting.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'Smart nanostructured semiconductors for energy-saving light solutions' (SMASH) aimed to use these nanorods to upgrade existing LED technology. It worked on resolving structural, optical and electro-optical properties in LED structures, based on passive nanorod templates and on nanoemitters, to develop the appropriate chips for this innovative technology.\n\nIn more technical terms, the project examined the relationship between the physical structure of the rods and the electronic band structure. It looked at carrier transport through the nanorods and studied their optical properties, investigating as well the device properties of nanorod LEDs. This also involved work on design aspects of the LEDs, particularly the electronic model, electroluminescence spectrum and optical model.\n\nIn addition, the project team made progress regarding scalable materials technologies based on nanorod coalescence on sapphire and silicon substrates. A major part of SMASH's work focused on building optimal nanoemitters, i.e. fabricating arrays of nanoLEDs with broad emission. This enabled the team to make significant progress in furthering front-end and back-end processes related to the LED fabrication value chain.\n\nSMASH lastly advanced processes for nanorod template fabrication and for the eventual manufacture of LEDs.

While the presence of photovoltaic (PV) devices on the market has increased dramatically, large-scale household systems are still not commercially viable.\n\nThe key to solar energy deployment on a large scale will be new technologies for higher energy conversion efficiency and lower production costs.\n\nMost PV devices in use are based on single- or multi-crystal silicon (Si). Emerging technologies are based on thin films, materials created by the growth of various species on a substrate. European scientists sought to develop materials and processes for high-throughput, cost-effective production of thin-film solar cells.\n\nWith EU funding of the 'Thin Si film based hybrid solar cells on low-cost substrates' (Thinsi) project, scientists are developing solar cells with structures similar to those of conventional bulk crystalline Si wafers but using a low-cost Si substrate to substitute the Si wafer.\n\nThe substrate will be made from inexpensive materials using state-of-the-art ceramics technologies (powder-to-substrate concept yielding wafer-equivalent technology) and inexpensive processes developed by the project consortium.\n\nInitial work focused on obtaining Si powder of desired purity, crystalline structure and particle size for use in the spark plasma sintering (SPS) method. Optimisation of the SPS process resulted in fabrication of dense and highly conductive Si substrates.\n\nScientists have also conducted extensive investigations regarding Si layer deposition on the substrates. The properties of such layers are currently being studied. Reference solar cells on both crystalline and thin-film substrates have been fabricated and efficiencies evaluated and compared.
