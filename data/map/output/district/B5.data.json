They investigated a number of oils to be used in the spray quenching process. The selection of candidates was complicated by a number of factors, including the high temperatures to be withstood. This meant that substances with low flash points (temperatures at which they can be ignited in air) such as mineral oil were unsuitable. The team finally determined that synthetic esters were the best candidates and selected one with high flash point, high self-ignition temperature, inertness and safety. \n\nScientists also conducted thermodynamic analyses of spray quenching and developed a test rig to evaluate both the nozzle design and the spray quenching thermodynamics.

Since 2013, the proven impacts of its programmes have been replicated and disseminated across a network of like-minded community basketball organisations in the UK (The BME Coaches Consortium).\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe Birmingham A's and the SCS community programmes are  fundamental to providing young people, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, with enhanced competences that create a desire for lifelong learning. As a result of the economic downturn, and the refugee crisis that has seen increased intolerance and social exclusion within disadvantaged communities, opportunities for young people to acquire the competences that will enable them to participate effectively in society are increasingly scarce. This project will seek to address these issues through the delivery of 4 overarching strategic objectives: \r\n\r\n1. Via the delivery of a range of targeted formal and non-formal training interventions, evidence a direct impact on 60 vulnerable and disadvantaged young people aged 14-16 years old, living in some of the most economically deprived areas in each of the partner countries.\r\n\r\n2. Facilitate the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into the Birmingham A's and SCS community programmes and the young people they target.\r\n\r\n3. Expose participants to the European opportunities in both sport and other careers so these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.\r\n\r\n4. Embed lifelong learning principles into the training and development programme and working cultures in order to equip participants with the aptitude and skills to pursue employment, either within sport or outside of it, throughout their career.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\n60 participants will be selected from the 1000+ (male & female) young people undertaking programmes within each of the project partners during the 2017/18 academic year.

We actively support these international mobilities, not only in Europe but also in developing countries.  The objective is to create more awareness of the growing globalisation and the  impact it has on our lifestyle and the economic development in Europe and beyond. We want to make them realize that a united Europe and a good cooperation between the member states are crucial for a stable economic Europe.  Especially in view of countries leaving the European union and the rise of the populist parties.\r\nWe aim at offering challenging education in general, not only by creating an international programme of Excellence for our VET+ students of level 4EQF but also for developing the talents of our students of level 2 EQF, with a socially challenged background by offering them a placement abroad. \r\n\r\nOur continuous goal is to maintain the high standard of QUALITY OF PLACEMENTS abroad by using solid and renomated training companies,  by consulting the Dutch recognition organisation SBB, the intermediate organisations in the host country and by using the network of our educational partners abroad . This is safeguarded by agreements with companies in the context of EQF and the new Qualification files of the Dutch government and by usung Learning Agreements, ECVET,  MOU, Europass and other instruments for agreements on content, monitoring, validation, recognition and evaluation of the experiences abroad. They are the key for a succesful study period or a project abroad. \r\n\r\nSpecial attention will be paid to our LEVEL 2 EQF STUDENTS of Facility Management and Care taking, (SOCIAL INCLUSION GROUP)  the socially challenged group of youngsters who we offer a placement of 3 weeks  abroad for their personal growth en to improve their position on the labour market. \r\n\r\nProfessionals are going abroad for sjobhadowing , training courses and workshops in order to find new teaching methods and to describe Learning Units and Learning Outcomes for ECVET matters in collaboration with our international partners . Teachers will focus on curriculum comparison.  Personal and PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF TEACHERS is becoming increasingly important in relation to Excellence and quality control. Master Studies with an international scope are stimulated by the Management \r\n\r\nWe will continue to gather information on SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP, the new approach of empowering students. Students of level 4+ EQF  need to focus on a more personified and individualized career path to reach personal goals.  Communication skills, using English in a natural setting, meeting young people in other countries, being part of their peer-to-peer training in social entrepreneurship is a good source for empowerment.  Developing personal leadership in a programme of excellence enables them to follow a path of growth, on a multisectoral level.\r\nOur objective is to empower students in realizing a fulfilling, satisfying, fruitful life and career, either in Europe or in our region .\r\nTeachers and students wil be trained abroad within the companies involved. This enables students to develop the 4  Binckley 2020 competences of 21st century skills : creativity, critical thinking, communication and collaboration.  This training enables students to start up companies while studying.  \r\nThe collaboration with Higher Education students will be extented within the proposed KA2 project Claim your Future.
