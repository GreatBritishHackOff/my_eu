They investigated a number of oils to be used in the spray quenching process. The selection of candidates was complicated by a number of factors, including the high temperatures to be withstood. This meant that substances with low flash points (temperatures at which they can be ignited in air) such as mineral oil were unsuitable. The team finally determined that synthetic esters were the best candidates and selected one with high flash point, high self-ignition temperature, inertness and safety. \n\nScientists also conducted thermodynamic analyses of spray quenching and developed a test rig to evaluate both the nozzle design and the spray quenching thermodynamics.

XABEC is the coordinator of the mobility strategy of InnMain, including 18 institutions from 12 EU countries. \r\n\r\nThe project name is representative of the spirit behind the proposal: an authentic \"catalysis\".

The departments are the catalyst of all those \"reactions\" generated by means of students and teachers' mobilities.\r\n\r\nAfter three years of team work, a tool based on \"Common Units of Learning\" has been developed. The online tool fill the need for professionalism in the preparation of the MoU between institutions (www.topomost.es). The MoU sets the basis for the preparation of the specific activities to be undertaken in a school during the period of mobility. Activities must be measurable and capable of recognition and validation by the sending institution, which fully agrees with our \"ProjectX\". (www.projectxone2one.eu). Since ProjectX do not require an overall match in academic level or programs, mobilities of teachers, to exchange ProjectX implementation between institutions is a medium-term goal. Thus national education systems are respected and the ordinary rhythm of classes is not disturbed.\r\n\r\nCaLoReT 2015 has three objectives:\r\n\r\n1.- TEACHERS. \r\nConstitute International Technical Departments, based on common knowledge areas. Departments gather teachers of similar subjects, from whom proposals of students and teachers' mobilities, may arise in the future. From such departments will naturally arise interesting strategic partnerships for academic innovation. To achieve this goal 11 meetings have been scheduled in 11 different countries. Xabec organizes the meeting in \"Human Factors\" and attends 9 more meetings. Xabec teachers who will use mobilities for this call are the Heads of Department and, in some cases, will travel with a collaborator.\r\n\r\n2.

STUDENTS.\r\nAnd 6 students will travel to four schools for a \u201cProjectX\u201d previously agreed and validated by both institutions (sending and receiving) with assessment and validation of learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe most important result is the consolidation of InnMain European network. All of the partners are well-known: we have worked together in the past in TOI projects, or associations. And, of course, with some we already have positive experiences of mobilities.\r\n\r\nMobilities of both teachers and students will have their prior preparation: Technical Departments have a script supervised by the Executive Board of InnMain, and students will be prepared according to standard procedure established by Xabec's Internal Rules of procedure.\r\n\r\nXabec has a International Department that will be the one responsible for the administrative management of the entire project (see presentation: http://www.xabec.es/xabec-internacional.php).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expected impact on Xabec environment will be very important: \r\n- firstly, teachers are going to be involved with the international department. This sets a new challenge on continuous improvement and extra motivation to improve language skills.\r\n- In the students, because the mobilities of ProjectX will not break the ordinary rhythm of classes and do not require  a high level of knowledge in foreign languages. This has already gotten the attraction of our students, increasing the number prospective students who wish to have an international experience.\r\n- In companies related with Xabec because they ask for students with social and international skills.\r\n- In the Valencian and Spanish society in general, because we honestly think that this experience can be put as an example of good practice.\r\n- And at European level, we hope to keep increasing the number of schools participating in this project, with this tool and methodology.\r\n\r\nAs a final summary we can say that CaLoReT 2015 reflects a desire to consolidate the international dimension we want for Xabec, in the context of InnMain European network: a reliable and stable network, with a strategy perfectly aligned with the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy.", "http://www.sccb.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA102-013718_4"], ["5SL", "One Voice", "African Cultural Exchange Ltd", 20305.0, "'One Voice' is an exchange between Untold, a group of young people in Amsterdam, passionate about dance and music, who despite barriers of language and culture will unite together in an exploration of culture and ACE Youth, a group of young people from Birmingham.

Developing personal leadership in a programme of excellence enables them to follow a path of growth, on a multisectoral level.Teachers and students wil be trained abroad within the companies involved. This enables students to develop the 4  Binckley 2020 competences of 21st century skills : creativity, critical thinking, communication and collaboration.  This training enables students to start up companies as start-ups or pop-ups while studying.  As part of that process we will also focus on Job-carving, former jobs defined in a new way and transferred into  new settings. That requires new curricula and new training methods which will be , developed  in collaboration with our international partners.Our partners will be triggered to implement the newly developed methods in their own region in order to inspire young  people starting their own businesses.2. Quality of  workplacements. Our continuous goal is to maintain the high standard of qualilty of our placements abroad by using solid and renomated training companies,  by consulting the Dutch recognition organisation SBB, the intermediate organisations in the host country and by using the network of our educational partners abroad . 3. Special attention will be paid to placement for our level 2 students, the socially challenged group of youngsters who we offer an experience abroad in order to improve their position in the labour market. 4. ECVET and EQF :   Description of Learning Units and Learning Outcomes by the educational team at Friesland College in collaboration with our international partners remains one of the objectives of this project.  The MOU, Europass and other European instruments for agreements on content, on monitoring, validation, recognition and evaluation of the experiences abroad are still in progress of developing. They are the key for a succesful study period abroad. 5. Focus on professionals in training in view of our Programme of Excellence which had been developed this year. Excellent students require excellent professionals. Extra material will be offered in the programme and therefore professionals will go abroad in order to find new teaching methods The exchanging of teaching methods,  training,  job- shadowing and intercultural sensitivity with foreign colleagues will contribute to a broader view on cultural values. The teachers are in their turn  enabled to pass these values on to their students.

Especially in view of countries leaving the European union and the rise of the populist parties.\r\nWe aim at offering challenging education in general, not only by creating an international programme of Excellence for our VET+ students of level 4EQF but also for developing the talents of our students of level 2 EQF, with a socially challenged background by offering them a placement abroad. \r\n\r\nOur continuous goal is to maintain the high standard of QUALITY OF PLACEMENTS abroad by using solid and renomated training companies,  by consulting the Dutch recognition organisation SBB, the intermediate organisations in the host country and by using the network of our educational partners abroad . This is safeguarded by agreements with companies in the context of EQF and the new Qualification files of the Dutch government and by usung Learning Agreements, ECVET,  MOU, Europass and other instruments for agreements on content, monitoring, validation, recognition and evaluation of the experiences abroad. They are the key for a succesful study period or a project abroad. \r\n\r\nSpecial attention will be paid to our LEVEL 2 EQF STUDENTS of Facility Management and Care taking, (SOCIAL INCLUSION GROUP)  the socially challenged group of youngsters who we offer a placement of 3 weeks  abroad for their personal growth en to improve their position on the labour market. \r\n\r\nProfessionals are going abroad for sjobhadowing , training courses and workshops in order to find new teaching methods and to describe Learning Units and Learning Outcomes for ECVET matters in collaboration with our international partners . Teachers will focus on curriculum comparison.  Personal and PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF TEACHERS is becoming increasingly important in relation to Excellence and quality control. Master Studies with an international scope are stimulated by the Management \r\n\r\nWe will continue to gather information on SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP, the new approach of empowering students. Students of level 4+ EQF  need to focus on a more personified and individualized career path to reach personal goals.  Communication skills, using English in a natural setting, meeting young people in other countries, being part of their peer-to-peer training in social entrepreneurship is a good source for empowerment.  Developing personal leadership in a programme of excellence enables them to follow a path of growth, on a multisectoral level.\r\nOur objective is to empower students in realizing a fulfilling, satisfying, fruitful life and career, either in Europe or in our region .\r\nTeachers and students wil be trained abroad within the companies involved. This enables students to develop the 4  Binckley 2020 competences of 21st century skills : creativity, critical thinking, communication and collaboration.  This training enables students to start up companies while studying.  \r\nThe collaboration with Higher Education students will be extented within the proposed KA2 project Claim your Future. They will  be involved for guidance of our students and for research matters. \r\n\r\n\r\nApart from the above mentioned topics , this project will focus  on the effect of CAPITALS OF CULTURE 2018 : Leeuwarden and Valletta (Malta) on the cultural diversity, economic situation of the regions involved and labour markets. The mobilities will increase, including incoming students . \r\nA large number of students and a few young entrepreneurs support the projects of Leeuwarden 2018.  Previous capitals of culture will be involved in this project. There is an intensive collaboration with the internal training company of the Friesland College: Leeuwarden 2018 Do it!  (http://www.frieslandcollege.nl/leeuwarden-2018-do-it.html)\r\nWith MCAST and other institutes and companies on Malta, we have an extensive exchange of knowledge, experiences and good practices in the field of culture,  clean energy, water management and entrepreneurship.", "http://www.bridgingtothefuture.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA116-035096_6"], ["5SU", "Learning from Best Practice: Modernizing and Improving VET in Limerick and Clare Education and Training Boards\u2019 (LCETB ) Further Education and Training Division", "South & City College Birmingham", 33397.0, "The title of this project is Learning from Best Practice: Modernizing and Improving VET in Limerick and Clare Education and Training Boards\u2019 (LCETB) Further Education and Training Division.

"CONTEXT\r\n\r\nBirmingham A's Basketball Club  is the largest community interest basketball club in the UK, . Since 2013, the proven impacts of its programmes have been replicated and disseminated across a network of like-minded community basketball organisations in the UK (The BME Coaches Consortium).\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this project is to further enhance and improve the vocational training and development of students at the consortium partner Basketball Academies, which provide the opportunity for talented athletes to develop their skills in a professional basketball environment whilst also achieving vocational qualifications. Working with Pro Sports Academy in Malta, the project will also aim to provide greater exit and progression opportunities for students upon completion of the Academy programme. The project will have 3 overarching strategic objectives: \r\n\r\n1. Enhance the vocational training programmes and learning performance of participants through the delivery of high quality work placements that meet vocational learning outcomes of their vocational qualifications.\r\n\r\n2. Enhance the employability of participants through the development of life skills and exposure to European progression opportunities in both sport and other careers.\r\n\r\n3. Facilitate the exchange of European best practice through the transfer of training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into both the consortium Basketball Academy programmes and students.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\n60 participants will be selected from the circa 218 (male & female) students undertaking the Basketball Academy programme at consortium partner organisations in the 2017/18 academic year. These students are selected primarily on the basis of their basketball ability & therefore incorporate a wide range of academic abilities, socioeconomic circumstances and ethnic backgrounds.\r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe majority of the work placement activities will take place at Pro Sport academy facilities, including:\r\n-  Technical sessions to address the defined sports performance targets. \r\n- Observation of games v high quality Maltese National U18 youth teams.\r\n- Daily feedback and evaluation sessions to confirm goal setting/reflection.\r\n\r\nPro Sports Academy has outstanding links at a local, regional and national level which will enable the consortium to enhance the work placement activities of participants. For example:\r\n- Access to high quality local and regional basketball clubs with activities to include training sessions and games at world class training facilities.\r\n- A visit to the Maltese Basketball Federation to undertake work placements & observe the professional practices and explore exit pathways.\r\n- Observation of a live Maltese professional basketball fixture\r\n- Observation & Sharing of a best practice via two month staff training abroad \r\n\r\nMETHODOLGY\r\n\r\nOur Project Manager, Nigel Hanson, is a qualified PRINCE2 practitioner and we will therefore use PRINCE2 methodology to ensure the effectively delivery of the all aspects of the project, including:\r\n\r\n- Clear definition of the project team's individual ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES in order for them to effectively manage the project.\r\n- A three-stage QUALITY MANAGMENT process (Planning, Assurance, Control) to address key quality and management issues throughout the life-cycle of the project.\r\n- A detailed PROJECT WORK PLAN outlining the steps required to develop the project activities and PRINCE2 techniques that should be used.\r\n- A COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT STRATEGY clarifying the project stakeholders, the key information required by each and the timescales for delivery.\r\n- Clear guidelines with regard to how the project will be MONITORED & EVALUATED at each stage.\r\n\r\nIMPACTS\r\n\r\nThe impacts on participants are expected to include:\r\n- Achievement of recognised vocational qualifications. \r\n- Development of life skills and experience that can be utilised throughout participants' education and careers.\r\n- Enhanced cultural and linguistic skills, facilitating openness to new opportunities both in the UK and Europe.\r\n- Improved knowledge and understanding of the European opportunities in sport and other careers.\r\n\r\nThe impacts on B-MECC expected to include:\r\n- Enhancement of the Basketball Academy programmes both in terms of improved technical sporting quality of students and coaches, and also student achievement rates. \r\n- Implementation of best practice across the Academy programmes and also the wider activities.\r\n- Improved exit and progression opportunities for students, both within sport and outside of it, and in the UK and Europe.", "http://www.babasketball.co.uk", "Aston Athletics Basketball Club Community Interest Company", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047309_coordinator"], ["5JU", "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY", 126080.0, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

Presently we focus on increasing  the number of students and professionals going abroad and on receiving more students from our \r\nEuropean partners, not only for VET but also for Adult Education. Our strategic partnerships strenghten the bond with our partners abroad. Curriculum comparison and exchange of good practice enriches our educational programmes.  Students share their experiences with peers and on social media and their enthousiasm make them the best Ambassadors for Europe. We want our students to get acquainted with European values and to get used to working with people from different cultures.  Internationally compent students also means focus on Internationalisation at Home. Workshops, cross-sectoral projects and choice modules International 1 and 2 are already part of the curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe quality of our placements abroad remains one of our goals. Therefore we use solid and renowned training companies recognised by SBB. This is safeguarded by agreements with companies in the context of the new Qualification files of the Dutch government. In the Learning Agreements of Friesland College (i-BPV) content, monitoring, validation, recognition and evaluation of the experiences abroad is described. \r\n\r\nThe realisation of ErasmusPro placements for apprentices is a new challenge.  Some of the education programmes will investigate the possibilities for students with an employee contract to go abroad for a special training for at least 3 months.  That requires consultation with employers.  For that reason, we will apply for some Advanced Planned Visits.(APV) \r\n\r\nWe will give attention to the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018  for those countries that  joined this initiative.  An assignment will be incorporated in the choice module International 2 (Working abroad) as well as an elaborate preparation for their period abroad.  \r\nModern Language choice modules,  in view of the professional context, can be considered as a new element in the Erasmus+ grant allocation. \r\n \r\nDeveloping SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP, the new approach of empowering students of level  4+ EQF.   Communication skills, using English in a natural setting, meeting young people in other countries, being part of their peer-to-peer training in social entrepreneurship are themes within this programme. Developing personal leadership in a programme of excellence enables them to follow a path of growth, on a multisectoral level. Teachers and students will be trained abroad within the companies involved.  This training enables students to start up companies while studying.  The collaboration with Higher Education students will be extented. They will  be involved for guidance of our students and for research matters.\r\n\r\nWe continue our social inclusion project for our 2EQFstudents of Facility Management and Care taking,  the socially challenged group of students who we offer a placement of 3 weeks  on Malta for their personal growth and for improving their position on the labour market. This group will be accompanied by 2 professionals. An elaborate selection procedure and extensive preparation is part of the allocation proces. \r\n\r\nInternationally competent students demand international competent teachers. Personal and professional development  is becoming increasingly important in relation to Excellence and quality control and in view of their role as Ambassador.  The professionals are well aware of the importance of their input and influence on the educational programmes.\r\nImproving the educational proces and stimulating new innovative approaches in education  within Europe through curriculum comparison,  exchanging of good practice, jobshadowing,  workshops are part of the assignments for our staff. They will also be involved in describing Learning Units and Learning Outcomes for ECVET matters.  The difference in educational systems in Europe remains a challenge.\r\n\r\nLeeuwarden and Valletta (Malta) are the Capitals of Culture 2018.  Sharing our experiences of the effect on the cultural diversity, economic situation of the regions involved and labour markets is one of the goals we want to achieve.   A large number of students and teachers support the projects of Cultural Capitals.  The number of  outgoing and incoming students from countries involved increase enormously.  Friesland College has  full heartedly committed to joining  the festivities and supporting the activities and international cooperation. In this call attention will be paid to sharing our experiences with  students and professionals in Plovdiv (Bulgaria) and Matera (Italy), the capitals of culture in 2019.", "http://www.bridgingtothefuture.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NL01-KA116-038728_8"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["5JU", "STEAMHOUSE", "Birmingham City University", "STEAMHouse is a demand-led demonstrator showing how the Arts can be combined with Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEAM) to generate innovative products and drive economic growth.\n  The project will support innovation in the Priority Growth Sectors identified in the LEPs Smart Specialisation Strategy  (Advanced Manufacturing, Low Carbon, Health and Creative & Digital);  will accept challenges in fields connected to the eight great technologies identified nationally; and meets the priority identified in the ESIF Strategy to strengthen collaboration between elements of the innovation ecosystem and between sectors. \n\nThe project offers good value for money and compares favourably with the programme benchmarks.", "ERDF", 1764000.0, 3528000.0, "erdf_england_196"], ["5JU", "Higher Level Skills Match (HLSM) Project", "Birmingham City University", "The HLSM Project provides a strategic response to the range of higher level skills challenges set out in the GBS LEP Skills for Growth Call for Investment Priority 2.2.
