This will be followed by a home hospitality phase with their choice of cultural visits and the joint organisation of a Czech/ UK Cultural Day in the coastal town of Littlehampton in order to help promote a positive communal experience and combat some of the zenophobic attitudes towards the Eastern European immigrant population in the town.  This project should have the result of increasing the participants own personal and social development, give them a great sense of achievement and widen their horizons which will help with employment and further education prospects in the future.  Previous participants in a similar project have gone on to participate in further international volunteering projects and developed their skills and experience to become leaders, providing opportunities for more young people to develop in the same way.", "http://www.girlguiding.org.uk", "Girlguiding Littlehampton District Ranger GuideUnit (Senior Section Unit)", "erasmus_2014-3-UK01-KA105-012101_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BN17"}
