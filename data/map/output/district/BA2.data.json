Chiral compounds can exist in the form of enantiomers, which have similar physicochemical properties but differ in their biological properties and, therefore, in their potency, toxicity and biodegradation. Because of the most of studies on chiral pharmaceuticals do not explicitly account for individual stereoisomers, they implicitly and incorrectly assumes that enantiomers have identical environmental behavior.

However, this cell transplantation approach has given inconsistent results, with some patients doing extremely well and coming off anti-PD medication for years, whilst others have shown no or only modest clinical improvements, and in some cases also developed severe, off-state graft-induced dyskinesias (GIDs). The reasons behind this heterogeneity of outcomes, and the emergence of GIDs in particular, need to be better understood, not least in the perspective of the rapid advances that are now being made in the development of stem-cell based therapies. There is therefore an urgent need to revisit the trials that have already been done with fetal VM tissue in PD patients, with the expectation that a critical reassessment can form the basis for an optimised and more standardised procedure that will translate into more consistently efficacious transplants with minimal side-effects. Over the last two years a group of international experts, including the key investigators of the previous European and North American trials, has been re-examining the outcome of these trials as well as reviewing the results obtained from recent and ongoing animal experimental studies, and identified a number of weaknesses that may explain the inconsistent outcome in previous trials. As a result of these discussions, the group has agreed to join forces in a new round of experimental work and cell therapy trials in PD, based on a new jointly developed protocol where all these factors are taken into account.

Importantly, the ratio of DA to serotoninergic neuron is kept in favour of DA which minimises the risk of GID.\n\nTo aid information exchange and optimisation of future research, Transeuro set up a foetal tissue dissection database.

This host difference between the two strains is considered to be an evolutionary adaptation of B.anthracis. An ancestor of B.cereus at some point during evolution must have acquired the mammalian virulence regulator AtxA which allowed it to infect and replicate in mammals. \n\nStudying the evolution of B.anthracis is therefore important for understanding the biology of this pathogen and finding ways to counteract its impact.

This strain is an intermediate of B.cereus and B.anthracis and contains both mammalian and insect virulence factors.\n\nThe G9241 strain showed the same ability to infect insects as B.cereus, indicating that the mammalian virulence factors did not interfere with the insect homologues. Even when the activity of the mammalian virulence regulator AtxA was abolished, there was no interference in terms of insect infection. \n\nThe G9241 strain resembled B.anthracis in its ability to resist lysing or phagocytosis by human immune cells, a feature attributed to genetic differences. Indeed, genomic comparison revealed that numerous B. cereus virulence genes were either mutated or absent in strain G9241. These observations suggested that mutations in these multiple virulence genes may have conferred an evolutionary advantage to G9241 in its transition from insect to mammalian pathogen.\n\nThe knowledge of the molecular biology of B. anthracis virulence could lead to improved future treatments or vaccination against anthrax.

To counter this phenomenon, the EU continues to regulate tobacco use in its quest to alleviate the tobacco disease burden and save lives. Against this backdrop, the EU-funded project 'Pricing policies and control of tobacco in Europe' (PPACTE) worked to produce new policy recommendations intended to improve the market regulation of tobacco products. It aimed to help achieve more effective and equitable control of tobacco in Europe.\n\nThe project investigated the effectiveness of tobacco taxes and pricing policies for controlling tobacco by surveying 18\u00a0000 people across Europe. In addition to examining industry's influence on tobacco taxation and analysing specific cigarette markets in Europe, it modelled the impact of tobacco policies in 15 EU countries.\n\nStudies show that tobacco taxation improves public health by discouraging people from smoking and by reducing consumption among those who already do smoke. The project team looked at how tobacco tax directives could address the availability of cheap and ultra-low price cigarettes, considering the large price discrepancies among EU countries as well.\n\nTo address these concerns PPACTE produced a handbook on 'The effectiveness of tax and price policies for tobacco control'. The handbook covers topics such as tobacco industry pricing, price-related marketing and lobbying strategies, tax evasion, and the health and economic impacts of tobacco taxation.\n\nIn addition, the team conducted an econometric analysis of demand for tobacco, processing datasets from different EU countries in a more consistent manner. The study estimated price elasticity of demand for selected tobacco products and looked at whether cigarettes, pipes and hand-rolling tobacco are substituted for each other. It evaluated the impact of non-price policies on consumption and looked at how demand for tobacco products can be controlled by price measures.\n\nAfter modelling future scenarios of tobacco control policies and their impacts, the project obtained a much clearer picture of the tobacco landscape. It also evaluated the influence of and impact on the tobacco industry in the face of tobacco taxation, which helped improve policy analysis and produce viable policy recommendations.\n\nOverall, the project's models have shown that smoking among young people declines more than among adults as a result of tax increases. This is the main reason why taxes continue to reduce adult smoking rates over time. Substitution of hand-rolling tobacco for cigarettes and switching from more expensive to cheaper brands have also been factored into the project's studies, as has the impact of illicit tobacco trade.\n\nAll these findings and guidelines will undoubtedly help protect Europeans against the hazards of smoking.

Testing on animal models of hearing loss should reveal the feasibility of such an approach and facilitate further development and commercialisation of promising results.\n\nResearchers first focused on producing and characterising cell clones for the EC device. Genetically engineered cells derived from ARPE-19, a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line showed excellent neurotrophic factor expression and tolerance to electrical stimulation.

They developed and trademarked an experimental set up called MotoRater for standardised testing of skilled locomotion in rodents. Animal models were used to identify and characterise the cellular properties of excitatory central pattern generator (CPG) neurons, such as EphA4, involved in locomotion.

Proprioception helps sense limb movement and location in space without visual cues. Researchers developed the transsynaptic virus method for selective visualisation of neurons directly connected to motor neurons.

This observation, that physiological angiogenesis proceeds in response to solid-phase cues motivates our approach, namely creating bioactive resorbable materials as scaffolds that contain bound molecular signals to induce physiological angiogenesis in situations of tissue repair and regeneration.

The loss can be gradual, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, rapid as in stroke, or intermediate as in the delayed neuronal loss after stroke. Following damage, the nervous system is able partially to compensate through the formation of alternative connections and pathways, a process known as plasticity. Adults are therefore able to regain considerable function after stroke, and to compensate for the synapse and cell loss of Alzheimer\u2019s disease until it reaches a critical level. Children undergo a period of enhanced plasticity in most parts of the CNS at the end of development, known as critical periods. During these periods their ability to compensate for damage to the CNS is in many cases much greater than in adults. The overall concept behind this application is that restoration of the function in neurodegeneration can be achieved through plasticity (the formation of new functional connections, withdrawal of inappropriate connections, modulation of synaptic strength). Promoting increased plasticity in selected parts of the adult nervous system back to the level seen in children is a powerful method of enhancing recovery of function in animal models. Plasticity-promoting treatments could therefore be beneficial in a wide range of conditions that damage the CNS.

The first challenge focuses on the quest for justice in contemporary peace processes, which has become increasingly apparent as several violent conflicts and wars are distinguished by gross human rights violation and ethnic cleansing. The second challenge concerns the quest for durable peace. Several contemporary conflicts tend to resist negotiated settlement.

The third challenge relates to the quest for effective strategies, particularly concerning the involvement of international actors in peacebuilding. JAD-PbP is convinced that the only way to address these challenges is through an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on insights in peace and conflict research, international law, political science and international relations. JAD-PbP has four core scientific objectives: (1) Enhance theoretical and methodological conceptualisation of just and durable peace (2) Analyse legal and democratic accountability of peacebuilding strategies, including mapping international law and norms on the use of force for humanitarian reasons.

It is able to resolve frequencies differing by 0.2% over 130 decibels of intensity. To achieve this feat the ear combines different strategies which we will implement in sensors of unprecedented sensitivity. The ear uses the power of Brownian noise in the cochlear fluid to enhance the detection of weak periodic signals. Each frequency is analyzed by specialized auditory hair cells which have different lengths and use a property called negative stiffness to enhance detection sensitivity. The incoming fellow has recently proposed a theoretical scheme for amplification by negative stiffness which he has demonstrated using a bench top experiment. Through a series of recent papers, the host group has conceived and studied a biomimetic neuron which sums and thresholds electrical pulses. In particular, the neuron demonstrates the amplification of useful signals by random noise using a property known as stochastic resonance. The present project will integrate artificial hair cells with semiconductor neurons to deliver highly sensitive, low power, scalable mechano-electrical transducers. We will study the amplification properties of the hair-neuron system. We will then integrate artificial hairs on neurons to make an artificial cochlea of microscopic size. We will fabricate hairs of different length/diameter aspect ratio to detect specific audio frequencies and code the sound intensity in the firing rate of the neuron. This fellowship will thus prepare the next generation of hearing aids, hydrophones and voice recognition systems by incorporating advances in non-linear physics and nanoscience in our cochlear sensor.

This complex process is governed by a network of transcription factors, such as PAX3 and SOX10 and mutations in these genes have been associated with developmental syndromes. Waardenburg syndrome (WS) and Hirshsprung disease are examples of these neurocristopathies and patients suffer symptoms ranging from sensorineural hearing loss and pigmentation defects to intestinal aganglionosis. Over 50 case studies of WS have been reported in Europe and the incidence is estimated to be 1 in 42 000 people. Recent investigations into the molecular basis of WS have failed to identify genotype-phenotype correlations between gene mutations and symptoms, likely due to the in vitro nature of these studies. It has therefore become clear that new tools are needed to better understand the genotype-phenotype relationship in neurocristopathies in an in vivo context. The SOX10mutants project proposes to address this using a novel zebrafish rescue assay to investigate the effects of SOX10 mutations on the development of cell types deriving from the neural crest.

To investigate error as a source of novelty I shall consider whether expression piggy-backing (expression of a gene affecting its neighbors) forces rewiring of gene networks. Importantly, I shall translate our new understanding to enable better diagnostics and improved therapeutics. I shall develop a much-needed computer package to identify candidate disease-causing synonymous changes. In addition, knowing how synonymous sites modulate splicing will allow me to design better intronless transgenes. Transgenes must also be inserted in genomic regions immune to piggy-backing.

We have chosen a 24 months project due to the landscaping world having its most interesting activities in spring which leaves us with too short a time to communicate and evaluate results if chose a 12 months project. The aims of the project are - To improve the level of key competences and skills of students: communication in foreign languages, basic competences in science and technologies, and here to be precise the landscaping technologies ... (key competences for lifelong learning) and to improve the learning practices. - To raise awareness on European diversity and cultures, with a fifth destination Malta. - To improve the teaching practices as well as the skills of the staff. - To give an international dimension to our school- To enhance the relationship between the world of education and the labor market, abroad through our partners as well as in France, through our local partners.

Belgium for its cultural diversity and the opportunity it offers for students with huge language problems to experience an international mobility nonetheless, Poland and Romania for their diversity and the awareness on European diversities and similarities. Malta has been chosen for the different natural environment and English language.

It is less than our previous year due to lower number of registrations. Staff mobility : In the previous project, we are sending 3 members of staff to partner organizations (companies and VET school) in England, Poland and Belgium as asked by the staff. We plan to do the same amount of staff mobility for this project as discussed with enthusiastic staff. We will keep accompanying people for Romania ( as no staff project is yet organized), Poland and Malta, as a new destination,  for the beginning of the stays, and England because we take care of the meetings with partner organizations.
