The project positions itself at the pre-competitive intersection of optical fibre sensing and integrated optics. It aims at developing a flexible and stretchable foil in which all necessary optical sensing elements can be integrated; that if relevant to the application can include optical and electrical powering as well as onboard signal processing and wireless communications; that can be wrapped around irregularly shaped objects; that will allow quasi-distributed sensing. To do so the sensing elements in PHOSFOS will rely on special highly birefringent micro-structured optical fibres (MSF) and polymer optical fibres (POF) with fibre Bragg gratings. The silica fibres will be designed to exhibit almost zero temperature sensitivity whereas POF fibres will be used for their very specific property that their length can be stretched up to 300 % before breaking. The optimal Bragg grating writing technology in these fibres, both silica and POF, will be developed. PHOSFOS will focus on embedding these into the sensing skin and on the optical coupling/interfacing to the peripheral opto-electronics and electronics. PHOSFOS will end with 2 proof-of-concept demonstrators, a first targeting structural health monitoring of civil engineering structures, the second aiming at the automotive industry.", 56088.0, 2138933.0, "PHOSFOS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_86613_999589754"], ["7FA", "Geohazards: Risk Assessment, Mitigation and Prevention", "Itasca Consulting Ltd", "This proposal aims to provide a step change in terms of our capacity to assess and predict risks due to geohazards (landslides and rock slides, earthquakes, floods).  This is necessary in order to make built environments and infrastructures resilient to the increasing threat of natural hazards due to the expanding size of European cities and urban centres, increased use of infrastructure, and the effect of increased climatic variations. To achieve this we will bring together the complementary expertise of world leading academic groups in geotechnical, geoenvironmental and seismic engineering, soil and rock mechanics, seismology, hydrology, geology together with private engineering software companies.  \nThe goals of this proposal are: i) to investigate the key physical-mechanical aspects of major geohazards (landslides, earthquakes, floods) with a multi-disciplinary approach in order to bridge the current gaps in knowledge and enable a step-change in the current capabilities of risk assessment, prevention, and mitigation; ii) to generate new approaches to predicting geohazards by creating an international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral group which will combine existing knowledge to generate new research methodologies and applications by enabling knowledge exchange among researchers with expertise in complementary research fields; iii) to train several Early Stage Researches (ESRs) during their stay at the host Institution who will form the next generation of researchers for academic and industrial applications; iv) to improve the current normative standards and codes ruling geohazard prevention; v) to provide a competitive edge to European engineering software companies modelling geohazards.", 41033.0, 1779337.0, "GEO-RAMP", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_194352_953862596"], ["0NA", "An Innovative ICT Solution for Providing Bespoke Safety and Health Training to Workers in the Construction and Transportation Sectors.", "The Severn Partnership Limited", "An ICT solution for repurposing digital data available from Building Information Modelling (BIM) in order to improve Safety & Health (S&H) training and implementation. Every year, thousands are fatally injured and millions are seriously injured in accidents occurring in the workplace. The risk to workers is significantly higher in the construction and transportation sectors.\n\nBIM captures all digital data relevant to a building or piece of infrastructure over its lifetime. The use of BIM is becoming mandatory for public procurement projects in Europe and will generate a wealth of digital data. This presents a major opportunity for disruptive business ideas and we have identified the possibility to repurpose this data so that we can provide interactive and context-relevant S&H training via 3D applications.\n\nWe, Severn Partnership, want to carry out a feasibility study around our concept for repurposing data from BIM. We will develop an application to deliver S&H training to railway workers. It will employ pedagogic strategies in a games environment to demonstrate enhanced learning. We will test it in a classroom environment with real learners and benchmark it against current methods of teaching (presentations, course notes, Q&A). \n\nThe feasibility study will explore the market landscape across different sectors utilising BIM, especially within construction and transportation. A survey of executives from industries in these sectors will identify operational requirements. This will aid the creation of an exploitation strategy and business plan.\n\nThe overall aim is to develop a new ICT service that improves the effectiveness of S&H training and ultimately saves lives by preventing accidents in the workplace.", 35902.0, 51289.0, "SEEABLE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_196661_942592457"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SY3"}
