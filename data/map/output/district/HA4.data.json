A liquid system should ideally allow resources including bandwidth, storage and processing to be used by any application, whether they are contributed by network operators, data centre operators or end systems. Resources form a shared pool and applications can scale up and down in multiple dimensions (storage, processing, bandwidth and energy usage) as needed, in a continuous effort to enhance the users' experience as measured in terms of key metrics such as delay and battery life.The main objective of Trilogy 2 is to unlock the value inherent in joining up the pools of liquidity in the Internet. The project will develop more mature liquidity mechanisms addressing the underlying reasons why today liquidity fails to join up across providers, layers and resources. Trilogy 2 will deliver mechanisms for creating liquidity across different types of resources, including cross layer liquidity, cross provider liquidity and cross resource liquidity. In addition, in order to allow the different stakeholders to be willing to create such liquid pools of resources, Trilogy 2 will also provide the means to control the created liquidity though the means of incentives, information exchange and enforcement tools.

Further applicability of VirtuWind solution in other industrial domains will bring multifold benefits in their communication networks.\n\nThe VirtuWind consortium consists of strong industry and academic partners covering the whole value chain of programmable networks.

It supports some of the most important Internet services such as search, social media and user generated content sites. However, the lack of transparency regarding tracking techniques and the type of information companies collect about users is creating increasing concerns in society. Software tools for implementing total mitigation (e.g., ad blocker or cookies blocker) have been released to block any transfer of information from end users towards the online advertising ecosystem. A massive adoption of these tools by end users may cause disruptions in the digital economy by affecting the online advertising sector and leading to consequences such as losing of a large number of employments.\nTYPES aims to cope with this challenge by defining, implementing, and validating in pre-market status a holistic framework of technologies and tools that guarantees both transparency and privacy preservation, gives the end user control upon the amount of information he/she is willing to share, and defines privacy-by-design solutions. In particular, these tools should enable the end user: i) to configure the privacy settings so that only the information allowed by the end-user is collected by online advertising platforms; ii) to understand the flow of their information within the online advertising ecosystem and how it is being used; iii) to detect episodes of information collection occurring without consent and identify the offender; iv) to know the value of their data. \nTYPES will demonstrate solutions that protect user\u2019s privacy while empowering them to control how their data is used by service providers for advertising purposes.

Recent advances in IoT semantic interoperability provide a sound basis for implementing novel cloud-based infrastructures that could allow testbed-agnostic access to IoT data and resources. FIESTA will open new horizons in IoT experimentation at a global scale, based on the interconnection and interoperability of diverse IoT testbeds. FIESTA will produce a first-of-a-kind blueprint experimental infrastructure (tools, techniques and best practices) enabling testbed operators to interconnect their facilities in an interoperable way, while at the same time facilitating researchers in deploying integrated experiments, which seamlessly transcend the  boundaries of multiple IoT platforms. FIESTA will be validated and evaluated based on the interconnection of four testbeds (in Spain, UK, France and Korea), as well as based on the execution of novel experiments in the areas of mobile crowd-sensing, IoT applications portability, and dynamic intelligent discovery of IoT resources.  \nIn order to achieve global outreach and maximum impact, FIESTA will integrate an additional testbed and experiments from Korea, while it will also collaborate with IoT experts from USA. The participation of a Korean partner (based its own funding) will maximize FIESTA\u2019s value for EC money. Moreover, the project will take advantage of open calls processes towards attracting third-parties that will engage in the integration of their platforms within FIESTA or in the conduction of added-value experiments.
