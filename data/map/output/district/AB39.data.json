The four SME partners in the consortium seek R&D expertise to develop a novel milling concept for European barley, to produce barley kernels/fractions with a higher level of health components than barley from conventional milling. This potentially opens new markets for the milling industry. It will also increase their milling capacity, reduces waste and create a competitive advantage in terms of diversifying milling and bakery product ranges. Finally it creates opportunities for equipment manufacturers to sell more monitoring and milling systems.\n\nThere are three main objectives in the BARLEYboost project: 1) To develop monitoring tools for analysis and control of the barley pearling process (during milling), for flour quality analysis, and for end product quality. 2) To develop an innovative barley milling process to enrich different grain tissues and health component. 3) To develop new food products by using barley fractions with proven health claims.\n\nThe research work will be carried out on behalf of the SME's by Nofima, VTT and INRA. The SME's in the consortium includes the milling company, Stangeland M\u00f8lle in Norway, the two bakeries, R\u00e5de Bakeri in Norway and Pats in Estonia and the ingredient supplier Macphie in Scotland.

An EU initiative is utilising new technology and innovative techniques to increase the availability of healthy foods made of this food grain.", "EFSA's health claims concern increasing daily consumption of fibre from barley, especially beta-glucan. Barley typically has the highest beta-glucan content, prompting the food industry to produce new products with ingredients from barley grain that are rich in this fibre component. However, it can be difficult to preserve beta-glucan in the grain during traditional milling procedures. As a result, a lot of barley must be eaten to achieve the desired health benefits.\n\nWith EU funding, the 'Boosted barley utilisation and consumption in the EU for better health' (http://www.barleyboost.eu/ (BARLEYBOOST)) project aims to create products with high beta-glucan content that consumers will want to buy.\n\nTo achieve this, project members have begun developing a monitoring tool and new milling technology. These are designed to isolate beta-glucan and record its content in barley and introduce methods for innovative product development.\n\nDuring the first reporting period, project partners delivered reports on barley quality properties and the most optimal milling technology. They also analysed the market potential of health-promoting products.\n\nBarley grain tissues were isolated and various samples underwent laboratory testing. This has led to the creation of a method to assess grain tissue amounts. A web-based method is also being planned. In addition, a prototype milling technology has been developed.\n\nBARLEYBOOST intends to get consumers and agro-food producers to see the economic, nutritional and health benefits of beta-glucans. The development of related cutting-edge technology will also optimise barley mills throughout Europe.

These include sponge-like sorbents that absorb oil, dispersants that chemically break down oil, and microorganisms that biologically degrade oil by consuming it as an energy source.\n\nThe latter process is known as biodegradation or bioremediation. The EU-funded 'Integrated biotechnological solutions for combating marine oil spills' (http://www.killspill.eu/ (KILL.SPILL)) project aims to find such viable solutions to oil spills using both established and novel methods.\n\nWhile dispersing or collecting/skimming the oil is the first response following an oil spill, KILL.SPILL products are intended for longer-term actions across a range of conditions. Researchers have thus far advanced novel hydrocarbon-detecting biosensors that monitor the efficiency of oil-degrading bacterial communities, and development of bioremediation agents (biosurfacants for bio-based dispersants, microbial\u2013chemical combinations for integrated bioremediation agents).\n\nThey have also isolated bacterial strains from marine, terrestrial and industrial environments to study their oil-degrading capabilities. Systems in development include bacteria adapted to the high pressures of deep-sea environment (in high pressure bioreactors), oil-degrading microorganisms with high tolerance to environmental stresses, and microbes that degrade oil in ocean floor sediments under anaerobic or aerobic conditions.\n\nKILL.SPILL's versatile range of tools will cover gaps in current approaches to cleaning up oil spill disasters, with applications for first response, follow-up and monitoring.

The European SMEs in this sector are under increased pressure to increase efficiency due to rising crude oil prices. In addition, there is the EU legislation on Total Allowable Catch or minimum landing sizes and the threat to close areas to fishing and aquaculture  in order to recover stock, due to environmental effects of inefficient fishing which could have socio-economic effects on our community. Our need as representatives of the SME industry is to increase efficiency and safety in fishing and aquaculture as well as reduce the environmental effects. We recognise the need for a technology that will enable fishers to preserve the quality and freshness of fish, reduce trawling times and avoid problems caused by overfull trawls. Trawls are the most commercially used fishing method. It is very large and expensive with typical cost up to \u20ac135,000. A fishing vessel dragging the conical shaped net through water consumes a large amount of energy and with fuel being the most expensive expenditure, fisheries are fast becoming unprofitable.

Plagued by increased costs, inefficiencies in stock management, overfishing, lack of innovation and increased competition, the Europe lingers in the background of this business sector. \n\nAn exciting innovation, the http://smartcatch.pera.com (SMARTCATCH) project,  funded by the EU has revolutionised fishing gear for trawl nets. A non-contact stress sensing system for mooring rope applications and potentially fishing is good news in storms and dangerous currents. \n\nPrevention of loss or damage to farmed fish stocks has economic implications. The fewer fish to sell equals lost revenue to the fish farmer and more imported fish. This new system will reduce the loss of escapees and minimise the negative environmental impact on the genetic diversity and local marine environment.\n\n\nThe researchers used techniques to join the Nitinol wire to form a continuous loop. They also used other methods, the most common being various welding techniques, soldering, mechanical connections and adhesives. For a marine envrironment signal detector, SMARTCATCH identified electromagnetic induction technology design parameters.\n\nThis new technology will also enable fish farmers to preserve the active fishing gear on boats. Trawling is the most commercially used fishing method. These large and expensive nets range from \u20ac1 350 to \u20ac40 000 per net for a boat up to 20m. The Smartcatch system could potentially increase the efficiency of fishing fleets with the developed alternative techniques for integration of the Nitinol wire into rope systems. Extensive research was done to test corrosion, jointing techniques and electrical performance. \n\nThe initial focus solved problems with the more manageable smaller ropes of aquaculture installations and mooring rope applications.  Solutions here can be scaled up to the trawler net ropes and other applications.\n\nSMARTCATCH technology promises to upgrade quality and freshness of the catch and reduce trawling times. Reducing stress and load on fishing gear will cut costs of fuel and increase the lifetime of fishing equipment.

Their biologically produced counterparts (i.e. bio-surfactants and bio-emulsifiers) offer more green sustainable alternatives. This has led to a number of manufactures, looking for ways to increase competitiveness through searching for underexploited sources such as the marine environment. Our objectives are to develop (1) innovative approaches in discovering, characterizing and producing novel marine-derived bio-surfactants from a large bacterial collection (greater than 500 strains) housed at Heriot Watt University, originally isolated from various coastal and open ocean waters around the world, (2) novel, economic, and eco-friendly end-products with commercial applications in order to replace synthetic counterparts, and (3) to demonstrate the functionality of new product development for commercial exploitation. Our collection consists of novel bacterial species, originally isolated for their ability to degrade oils, with proven promise in this respect.
