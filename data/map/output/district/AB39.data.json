The four SME partners in the consortium seek R&D expertise to develop a novel milling concept for European barley, to produce barley kernels/fractions with a higher level of health components than barley from conventional milling. This potentially opens new markets for the milling industry. It will also increase their milling capacity, reduces waste and create a competitive advantage in terms of diversifying milling and bakery product ranges. Finally it creates opportunities for equipment manufacturers to sell more monitoring and milling systems.\n\nThere are three main objectives in the BARLEYboost project: 1) To develop monitoring tools for analysis and control of the barley pearling process (during milling), for flour quality analysis, and for end product quality. 2) To develop an innovative barley milling process to enrich different grain tissues and health component. 3) To develop new food products by using barley fractions with proven health claims.\n\nThe research work will be carried out on behalf of the SME's by Nofima, VTT and INRA. The SME's in the consortium includes the milling company, Stangeland M\u00f8lle in Norway, the two bakeries, R\u00e5de Bakeri in Norway and Pats in Estonia and the ingredient supplier Macphie in Scotland.

An EU initiative is utilising new technology and innovative techniques to increase the availability of healthy foods made of this food grain.", "EFSA's health claims concern increasing daily consumption of fibre from barley, especially beta-glucan. Barley typically has the highest beta-glucan content, prompting the food industry to produce new products with ingredients from barley grain that are rich in this fibre component. However, it can be difficult to preserve beta-glucan in the grain during traditional milling procedures. As a result, a lot of barley must be eaten to achieve the desired health benefits.\n\nWith EU funding, the 'Boosted barley utilisation and consumption in the EU for better health' (http://www.barleyboost.eu/ (BARLEYBOOST)) project aims to create products with high beta-glucan content that consumers will want to buy.\n\nTo achieve this, project members have begun developing a monitoring tool and new milling technology. These are designed to isolate beta-glucan and record its content in barley and introduce methods for innovative product development.\n\nDuring the first reporting period, project partners delivered reports on barley quality properties and the most optimal milling technology. They also analysed the market potential of health-promoting products.\n\nBarley grain tissues were isolated and various samples underwent laboratory testing. This has led to the creation of a method to assess grain tissue amounts. A web-based method is also being planned. In addition, a prototype milling technology has been developed.\n\nBARLEYBOOST intends to get consumers and agro-food producers to see the economic, nutritional and health benefits of beta-glucans.

In addition, there is the EU legislation on Total Allowable Catch or minimum landing sizes and the threat to close areas to fishing and aquaculture  in order to recover stock, due to environmental effects of inefficient fishing which could have socio-economic effects on our community. Our need as representatives of the SME industry is to increase efficiency and safety in fishing and aquaculture as well as reduce the environmental effects. We recognise the need for a technology that will enable fishers to preserve the quality and freshness of fish, reduce trawling times and avoid problems caused by overfull trawls. Trawls are the most commercially used fishing method. It is very large and expensive with typical cost up to \u20ac135,000.

This is part of our School Improvement Plan this year, and will remain on the plan until 2020 when we hope to have this embedded across the school in line with Scottish and Aberdeenshire initiatives.  In our local authority, primary schools work with their area schools network to allocate languages for P6 and P7 to ensure an even spread of learners with experiences of the modern foreign language they will learn in S1 and 2 at their academy.  Therefore, in our network, because the languages taught in S1 are French and Spanish, half the P6s and 7s should receive French language tuition, and half Spanish.  Newtonhill School must teach and learn Spanish, and we are very keen to do this to a high standard, but none of the staff have any knowledge of Spanish.  We have more than 380 pupils at Newtonhill School, and we aim to provide high quality learning and teaching experiences for all children across the curriculum.  We would like to bring the Spanish learning and teaching experiences up to the high standard we expect in other curricular areas, and so asked for staff volunteers to attend the LFEE Spanish Immersion Course in Malaga during this year's summer holiday.  We are applying for funding for 4 staff with a view to these staff:\r\n\r\nsharing and/or developing a range of resources and training/support activities;\r\npresenting these to staff in our own school and other schools in our cluster network;\r\nleading department and whole school assemblies, including parent assemblies, with Spanish theme or some Spanish content;\r\nworking with staff across the authority to share their experiences to inspire and motivate across Aberdeenshire and/or Scotland;\r\ndevelop existing and create new links with classes in Spain so that learners across our school have experience of an etwinning project or similar, in order to promote global and particularly European citizenship;\r\nworking in school and beyond to create manageable, sustainable but high quality short-, medium- and long-term planning of the teaching and learning of foreign languages, developing contexts suitable for all ages across primary school.\r\n\r\nHigh quality training and resources are desperately needed.  The immersion course will be a continuation of short upskilling courses in Spanish language, and will come after a year of a \"toe in the water\" approach to teaching Spanish across the school.  We have already initiated some very small-scale etwinning projects with schools in France and Spain, which has made us appreciate how advanced in foreign language learning similar-aged children are in Europe.   \r\n\r\nWe are trying to adopt a whole school cross-curricular approach to learning and teaching modern foreign languages at Newtonhill.  Getting started on the etwinning website has made it apparent to our staff what opportunities there are to teach languages and ICT together, through use of the twinspace, digital photography and film-making.  We share our learning with our parents and the wider school community through Twitter, and will go on to incorporate our Spanish language learning on our Twitter feed, starting with the children putting on an example of good pronunciation of our \"Spanish of the Week\".  Staff who have volunteered to attend the immersion course include 3 members of the management team, 2 of whom are at least 50% class committed.  We feel this is beneficial as it ensures that the embedding of MFL teaching in Newtonhill School is coming from school leaders who are in a position to change and improve school planning, resources, budgeting and provision of Career-Long Professional Learning opportunities to reflect our whole school needs, and to benefit staff who were not free to volunteer to attend the immersion course this summer.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to run European projects in various classes across the school each year, both through etwinning and in more traditional ways.  As previously mentioned, we are trying to work in line with local and national guidelines to plan and teach Spanish to at least P1-3 this year.  This will be extended over the next 2 or 3 years to include P4-7, again in line with local guidelines in order to try and meet national priorities by 2020 of providing the learning and teaching of an L2 (which of course for us is Spanish) to the whole school, and experiences of other languages to P5-7.  Staff will incorporate their development in learning and teaching Spanish into their yearly Career-Long Professional Learning requirement, and will be supported through this by a series of planned courses and events run in conjunction with Aberdeenshire development officers.

From 2020 every child is entitled to learn a first additional language from primary one and a second by primary five. This is known as the '1+2' Initiative. \r\n\r\nAt Dunnottar school we have a very enthusiastic team of practitioners with a broad range of experience and varying levels of competency in modern languages who are committed to embedding the 1+2 approach in their daily practice. However, it is felt by many colleagues that they have a need to up-skill their own competence in language learning and teaching. We believe that an immersion trip, like the one being offered by Erasmus+, will benefit all practitioners because not only will it improve their language competences but it will bring a vital authentic cultural dimension to their teaching of languages; a dimension that it is simply not possible to achieve from UK based Continuing Lifelong Professional Learning alone. \r\n\r\nWe are a forward thinking and progressive school and we are keen to add a European/International dimension to our curriculum. Oil and Gas has been the primary industry in the North East of Scotland for many years now. As such, the  demographic in this part of the country is relatively broad, with many nationalities represented. We are keen to build on this and demonstrate to our young people the many benefits of learning another language and of international travel. We feel that an experience such as the one offered by Erasmus+ will support us in this endeavour. \r\n\r\nSeven members of staff from Dunnottar School have applied to take part in the LFEE Immersion trip to France in July 2017. They include teachers from the infant, middle and upper school, as well as a Pupil Support Assistant who works with several classes across all stages in the school. The participants have a broad and varied level of language competence and all are committed and enthusiastic practitioners who are very keen to develop language learning at Dunnottar. Only three of the seven applicants have visited France before and they strongly believe that an immersion trip of this nature and quality will equip them with the skills and experience necessary to bring language learning to life in their classrooms. \r\n\r\nFor participants, the Immersion course will serve to improve their methodological expertise in the teaching of French to our young learners. They will gain a broader and deeper understanding of how language is taught and developed in European countries, as well as improving their own competence, confidence and performance in the French language. This up-skilling will enable our staff to embed languages in their daily classroom practice with increasing confidence. Furthermore, It is felt that participation in the Erasmus+ experience will provide participants with greater cultural awareness of contemporary France, thus giving their teaching an authentic dimension and 'bringing to life' the learning of languages within our school setting. \r\n\r\nUpon their return from France, the staff members involved will be invited to share their experiences at authority, cluster and school level. Aberdeenshire Council runs regular 1+2 Inservice Training Days, attended by colleagues from all over the authority. Previous participants in the LFEE Immersion trips to France and Spain have shared their positive experiences of the course at these events. It is envisaged that our very enthusiastic team will do likewise. Furthermore, we propose to make use of GLOW (The Scottish Schools Intranet) to share our learning and experiences with colleagues from across Scotland. \r\n\r\nWe are confident that our team will grasp this incredible opportunity with both hands and use the experience gained to develop themselves as classroom practitioners and leaders of language learning while, at the same time, instilling in our young people a love of languages, an appreciation of the opportunities that language learning can bring and a desire to develop themselves as global citizens.", "http://www.dunnottar.aberdeenshire.sch.uk/", "Dunnottar Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035920_coordinator"], ["2TD", "Immersion Training", "Mill O'Forest Primary School", 10087.0, "Five staff from our primary school will attend primary immersion courses provided by LFEE Europe, spending one week in either France or Spain.

Vocational Advancement Service (BFW) of the Construction Industry Association of Berlin-Brandenburg, a provider of educational services in Germany. Six RMMT students of finishing work and construction will go there to master dry wall assembly and to learn about the latest finishing materials in the large and well-equipped workshops.\r\n3.

One RMMT teacher will accompany the students to learn more about the education programmes and innovative teaching methods in Bulgarian vocational education, as well as to visit the students at their internship places.\r\nHaving summed up the results of the previous projects, the experience of the participants, their professional development and contribution to RMMT education process, we decided to continue cooperation with the other six partner organizations, as with reliable and sustainable collaboration partners, corresponding to both the aims of the project, and the school internationalization strategy.\r\nIn the process of experience exchange in the partner organizations, RMMT teachers will continue to explore how new IT programs are introduced in the education process in other European countries, and how learning activities are adjusted to the needs of potential clients / customers. The length of students\u2019 mobility is mostly 30 days, which meets RMMT internship requirements. Specifying vocations, the number of participants, and the partner organization, we take into account the students\u2019 needs, their strengths and weaknesses in the particular vocation, and skills they are supposed to have by the next school year.\r\nTo promote a faster and more successful entering the European labour market for the school leavers, we decided to involve in long-term internship (6 months) four RMMT former students who have just finished the school and who will go to Hungary and Italy. \r\nThe mobility to MICHAEL school (Czech Republic) will require an accompanying person for several reasons.
