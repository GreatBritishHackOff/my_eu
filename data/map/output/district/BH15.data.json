Sheet Metal Fabrications Limited", "POWERAMP will design, manufacture, prototype, and validate through real world pilots energy harvesting speed bumps that capture energy from vehicles that pass over the ramps. Emplaced in areas where speed must be controlled, safety must be increased, or where vehicles must come to a stop, such systems leverage gravity and the kinetic energy of thousands of kilograms moving at high rates of speed to produce energy. Breaking technological barriers associated with patent protected background, POWERAMP will enable the associated SMEs to obtain systems that produce 35kW of continuous power in moderate traffic conditions. This is the equivalent of 200m2 of solar panels or one moderate sized windmill for a footprint of approximately the size of a car and at a fraction of the cost. As such, POWERAMP will provide an enabling technology for Europe to meet its energy and emission reduction goals. POWERAMP will also provide a tool to increase the safety of pedestrians at crossing areas and construction workers at worksites through controlled speed, powered signs, and safety lighting. Europe currently has approximately 8000 pedestrian fatalities on its roadways each year. Similar to wind, solar, or hydro, POWERAMP will pioneer a new sector of clean energy production - roadway energy harvesting, and will change how we think about roads and how they are integrated into the built environment. A wave of new applications will become possible and an entire job sector will be created.", 6160.0, 1281853.0, "POWERAMP", null, null, null, null, "http://www.mvm.co.uk", null, "fp7_96093_985332403"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1AB", "Huelva Experiencias Basadas en el Empleo: Mobility", "FIRST DIRECT ACCOUNTING LTD", 85691.0, "The County Council of Huelva with 7 Vocational Training Centers in the province of Huelva apply the  current HEBE Mobility project as a Consortium. As part of a broader and longer-term strategy seeks to respond the unemployment levels in the territory and the lack of learning opportunities that will enable students at this level to acquire basic skills and competences in the current open and Europeanized work environment where more and more qualified staff are being demanded.\r\n\r\nHEBE Mobility, will give 20 middle-level FP students the opportunity to complete their full-time Work Center Training module for three months in an English or Italian Company. All the students who will participate in the mobilities are students from the different regions that make up the province. A great impact is expected in the province that promotes other initiatives and projects our education and quality training in Europe by consolidating transnational cooperation networks between the Partners in this proposal and strengthening the commitment to EU values.\r\nHEBE Mobility consists of 3 different phases that together make up the whole trajectory of the proposal from its origin and until its long-term impact.\r\nPreparation. The project has been designed by all the partners in the prior months to the presentation. For this purpose, regular meetings have been held as well as frequent emails and calls. Once approved, the planning is finalized and the activities of preparation of the mobilities are initiated, such as the signing of different agreements with all the partners, the dissemination of the program, the concretion of other European companies, the elaboration of the bases of the selection process, among other.\r\nExecution. In this phase the mobilities are executed and the students carry out the Training in Work Centers. Parallelly, follow-up activities of the sending Centers and the County Council of Huelva are carried out with the host companies and the intermediary partners.\r\nMonitoring and evaluation. These aspects will be present throughout the project. For this purpose a follow-up commission will be created, which will be in charge of developing the activities intended to supervise all phases of the project from its beginning to its completion and beyond In order to evaluate the impact in the medium and long term.\r\nDuring these mobilizations, students not only will carry out the practices but also live in a foreign country where they will be daily in contact with other customs and cultures, encouraging among them respect, tolerance and interculturality; improving their skills in other languages and developing skills and competences such as self-esteem or autonomy.", "http://www.firstdirectaccounting.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-036473_4"], ["1HZ", "Lifeboat Crew Exchange Program", "RNLI", 10353.0, "Search and rescue (SAR) at sea is carried out free of charge for the one who is in need. Social changes have resulted in more and fewer volunteers with maritime background. It is important to emphasize the practical training of volunteers and the dissemination of knowledge of those who are experienced maritime SAR in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe project is designed to develop the skills of volunteers in maritime survival, whether in a daily life or practice, and decrease the number of maritime casualties. It can be done by holding the two lifeboat crews weeks where experienced SAR people from volunteer organizations in Europe are invited to participate. Where they will undergo training and learn from each other new methods and mechanisms of search and rescue at sea. During these two weeks we can train 14-16 crew members of rescue vessels from each participating country.\r\n\r\nProject manager will be installed to oversee the implementation and will work closely with other project managers cooperation between the companies.
