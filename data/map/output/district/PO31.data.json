Circular business models, based on leasing or providing functionality rather than products, often called Product Services Systems, are widely seen as a way how business can create sustainable jobs and growth. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) and McKinsey calculated that circular business will create billions of value. This opportunity has become an important development area for researchers engaged in the sustainability, engineering and design and business fields. \nSeven top universities well embedded in the EIT KIC Raw materials, supported by the EMF, their CE100 network and various companies propose here a multi-disciplinary approach to ensure a range of research perspectives are included across the circular field. 5 main areas of research are relevant to understand how to create such business models. \n\n1. Businesses and business models: how to stimulate circular provisioning? \n2. Supply chains: how to organize supply and delivery chains for circularity?\n3. Users: how to motivate stimulate circular consumption?\n4. Design: how to design circular value propositions?\n5. Systems: How to ensure economic and environmental benefits can support for change to circularity?\n\nWe choose these areas as our main Work Packages, and appoint PhD students in each of these areas with as main goals:\n\n1. Create new business model innovation across Europe that helps to support the economy while at the same time reduce ecological burden\n2. Create a new, sustainable and cross-disciplinary network of trained experts who will have the skills, qualifications, and professional connections to drive future innovation. \n3.

Within educational levels offered, becomes relevant in the last three years (with the addition of the Centre of Buitrago) the number of students of Medium and High Vocational Training.\r\nThere are 8 schools along the Community of Madrid, with 18 different fields offered in Las Suertes, Guadarrama, Las Rozas and Buitrago del Lozoya. In the current social context, the cooperative is investing on professional quality training to enhance employability.\r\nThe European experience of our students will strengthen and enhance their skills. GSD has an Employment Network for subsequent employment (\u2018\u2019Red de Empleo GSD\u2019\u2019.)\r\nWe have participated in European programs for years, in order to develop work experience for students in High and Medium Vocational Training, testing the positive impact of it in both the students and the institutions involved and throughout the Cooperative.\r\nThe demand from students interested in participating has increased. In the past (and this current course) we have managed European FCT students without a scholarship, leading us on this occasion to increase the number of places.\r\nFor this proposal, 21 students of Medium Vocational Training from the fields of Administration, Computers, Electronics, Cooking, Forestry, Automotive, Technician in Machining and Physical Activities of our centres, between 18 and 23 years old. Their low cultural profile and their individual characteristic requires to improve their self-esteem and abilities, allowing them to cover the gap that separates them from the work market.\r\nThey are generally people who have not travelled much, they need linguistically and cultural enrichment.\r\nKnowledge of a foreign language as a personal skill would be an important tool for their future profession, making them more competitive and boarding their opportunities to work in other European countries.\r\nAll the staff from the Cooperative is fully involved. The educational community will participate in conducting and broadcasting the project.  \r\nOngoing activities are defined by their own training programs of each field, and adapted to the company where the student will develop its practice. \r\nTo carry out this project a cooperative methodology has been used, integrating the stated needs of the students, the chances of having quality partners, the personal interests of the students, and the ability and knowledge of teachers and tutors who design and manage the programs. All these together improve management skills and relationship of all parts involved. Moreover, the fact of using English as the language of all documents generated, improves language skills of the participants.\r\nThe phases of the project are:\r\n-Prior information and publication of call\r\n-Selection process of participating students.\r\n-Process matching companies to candidates.\r\n-Implementation of Agreements; trip preparation.\r\n-Preparation of participating students (languages and cultural info)\r\n-Development of mobility and Vocational Practices.\r\n-Verification of Vocational Practices documentation and conduction of internal assessments.\r\n-Completion of final report to the National Agency. (SEPIE)\r\n-Broadcast of results and experience.   \r\n\r\nThe Project is developed with the aim of improving the skills of these future professionals and, therefore, improving their employability. \r\nThe Project is developed with the aim of ensuring that participants have a clear sense of \u2018\u2019before and after\u2019\u2019.
