Circular business models, based on leasing or providing functionality rather than products, often called Product Services Systems, are widely seen as a way how business can create sustainable jobs and growth. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) and McKinsey calculated that circular business will create billions of value. This opportunity has become an important development area for researchers engaged in the sustainability, engineering and design and business fields. \nSeven top universities well embedded in the EIT KIC Raw materials, supported by the EMF, their CE100 network and various companies propose here a multi-disciplinary approach to ensure a range of research perspectives are included across the circular field. 5 main areas of research are relevant to understand how to create such business models. \n\n1. Businesses and business models: how to stimulate circular provisioning? \n2. Supply chains: how to organize supply and delivery chains for circularity?\n3. Users: how to motivate stimulate circular consumption?\n4. Design: how to design circular value propositions?\n5. Systems: How to ensure economic and environmental benefits can support for change to circularity?\n\nWe choose these areas as our main Work Packages, and appoint PhD students in each of these areas with as main goals:\n\n1. Create new business model innovation across Europe that helps to support the economy while at the same time reduce ecological burden\n2. Create a new, sustainable and cross-disciplinary network of trained experts who will have the skills, qualifications, and professional connections to drive future innovation. \n3. Create new links between industry and academia in training ESRs to develop new approaches to PSS which will help orgs to compete, create growth and innovation.", null, 3483649.0, "CircEuit", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org", null, "h2020_205515_951356019"], ["7DA", "integrated Smart GRID Cross-Functional Solutions for Optimized Synergetic Energy Distribution, Utilization  Storage Technologies", "Minus7 Limited", "inteGRIDy aims to integrate cutting-edge technologies, solutions and mechanisms in a scalable Cross-Functional Platform connecting energy networks with diverse stakeholders, facilitating optimal and dynamic operation of the Distribution Grid (DG), fostering the stability and coordination of distributed energy resources and enabling collaborative storage schemes within an increasing share of renewables. \ninteGRIDy will: \na) Integrate innovative smart grid technologies, enabling optimal and dynamic operation of the distribution system\u2019s assets within high grid reliability and stability standards\nb) Validate innovative Demand Response technologies and relevant business models\nc) Utilize storage technologies and their capabilities to relieve the DG and enable significant avoidance of RES curtailment, enhancing self-consumption and net metering\nd) Enable interconnection with transport and heat networks, forming Virtual Energy Network synergies ensuring energy security \ne) Provide modelling & profiling extraction for network topology representation, innovative DR mechanisms and Storage characterization, facilitating decision making in DG\u2019s operations\nf) Provide predictive, forecasting tools & scenario-based simulation, facilitating an innovative Operation Analysis Framework\ng) Develop new business and services to create value for distribution domain stakeholders and end users/prosumers in an emerging electricity market.\n\ninteGRIDy will impact on: \na) operations by reconfigurable topology control & supervision \nb) market by providing new services \nc) customer by enhanced engagement through DR mechanisms \nd) transmission by novel forecasting scenarios for the MV/LV areas \ne) part of the production incorporating innovative storage targeting the optimum use of RES\nf) environment by CO2 reduction\ninteGRIDy approach will be deployed and validated in 6 large-scale and 4 small-scale real-life demonstration covering different climatic zones and markets with different maturity.", 328209.0, 13817726.0, "inteGRIDy", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_207020_936099277"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["7BX", "ELLEN MACARTHUR FOUNDATION TRADINGLIMITED*EMF", 278.0, "Other management expenditure (07.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_25935", 2017], ["7BX", "ELLEN MACARTHUR FOUNDATION COMPANYLIMITED BY GUARANTEE*EMF", 630.0, "Supporting better environmental governance and information at all levels (07.02.03)", "fts_2017_67390", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "PO31"}
