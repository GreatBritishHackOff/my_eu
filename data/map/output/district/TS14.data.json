All four training providers  are based in Portugal's vibrant and historic capital Lisbon.\r\n\r\nThe Stockton trainees  will undertake four week internships in one of the following :\r\n\r\n*8 Business trainees will undertake placements at Garbags. Garbags products are made from materials that were originally used to hold coffee, pet food, milk, juice and potato chips! \r\n\r\n*8 Business trainees seeking careers in retail will carry out their internship at Apaixonarte.  Apaixonarte is a versatile shop / gallery area that creates and hosts objects with a variety of textures, colors,materials, shapes and functions.\r\n\r\n*6 Tourism and Sports trainees will undertake placements at Bike a Wish. Bike a Wish provide bike rental services in Lisbon. \r\n\r\n*8 Tourism, Business and Sports trainees will also undertake placements at hotels belonging to the Pestana hotel group. Emphasis will be put on students undertaking their internships in customer facing roles. \r\n\r\nSplit across 2 academic years (15 vocational graduates per year) the participants will have the opportunity for a vocationally relevant and practical work placement experience in Portugal, something that they have limited or no access to in the College's local vicinity due to the lack of a well developed tourist industry, and which will add significant European value to their UK learning and achievements. The project will not constitute part of the standard curriculum, but will be added value subsequent to the completion of their Level 3 course, forming a transitional period to work or to further/higher education.  \r\n\r\nThe main aims are that the participants  will:\r\n\r\n- work in a customer oriented organisation as a super-numerary member of staff, guided and mentored by a dedicated local trainer provided by the host partner, and undertake tasks that are relevant to their studies previously undertaken in the UK, and to their future career choices. \r\n\r\n- learn sufficient conversational and vocationally specific Portugese to enable them to cope with daily working life;\r\n- gain a first experience of living and working in another country, including learning about a new culture;\r\n- improve their soft skills such as self-confidence, working with others, communication skills, self-esteem and independent living skills.\r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes include:\r\n\r\n- participants who are 'work ready' with practical experience of working in the industry most closely related to their studies in the UK;\r\n- young people with enhanced 'soft skills' making them more employable across a range of jobs in the UK\r\n- a CV enhanced by working in another country, thus demonstrating independence and good communication skills;\r\n- a Europass certificate\r\n\r\nOther possible outcomes include:\r\n\r\n- offers of work from Portuguese work placement providers;\r\n- progression to appropriate and relevant HE provision.\r\n\r\nThe mobilities will take place in 4 week blocks commencing at the beginning of July 2017 and again in July 2017, with a group of 15 participants on each occasion. Concentrated cultural and linguistic preparation will take place during June 2017 and June 2018.\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipants will also be assessed on their key vocational competencies whilst on placement by the host partner and will be issued with a certificate by the host partner hotel group, recognising and logging the specific skills acquired, in addition to the completion of the Europass Mobility, CV and Language Passport documents.\r\n \r\nYoung people with disabilities have always been actively encouraged and supported to participate in the previous projects, in line with the College's stated policies on inclusion, and this policy will continue in VIP17\r\n\r\nVIP17 is positively endorsed by the College SMT, which has developed an international strategy to provide maximum exposure for learners to both work and life experiences outside of their home country, and ultimately to produce active European citizens.", "http://www.stocktonsfc.ac.uk", "Prior Pursglove and Stockton 6th Form College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-035414_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TS14"}
