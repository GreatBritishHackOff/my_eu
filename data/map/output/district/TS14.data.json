Split across 2 academic years (8 vocational graduates per year) the participants will have the opportunity for a vocationally relevant and practical work placement experience in Spain, something that they have limited or no access to in the College's local vicinity due to the lack of a well developed tourist industry, and which will add significant European value to their UK learning and achievements.

The idea for the  project stems from the beneficial teaching and learning experiences gained by staff who have participated in the  Comenius/Leonardo projects and also the new Erasmus plus KA1/2. Although these project were and are student based staff supporting the students gained valuable experience and new ideas from working with partners from other European countries. The college has a international policy that anticipates further growth in European projects and the participation of members of the teaching staff in this is important in the context of deeper Europeanisation of the college. During the last 10 years the college has found participation in European projects an effective way of overcoming the marginalisation caused by both the peripheral location of the town of Stockton on Tees and also the socio economic inequalities  of the towns demographics.After careful selection and preparation, a cohort of teachers will travel to Cyprus to gain expertise in the following 2 areas; \u201cInteractive media for \u201cinteractive\u201d teaching and learning\u201d and \"Project based teaching and learning\" This will be done through the completion of a 5 day intensive course. Both these areas ofter opportunities for fairly rapid classroom deployment. A clear objective will be to develop skills, techniques and tools that can be disseminated rapidly to the whole of the body of teaching staff. A second objective will be to support the colleges reputation as an international college with a strong focus on deeper European partnership. This project offers the opportunity to undertake CPD in a  partner country married to the possibility of forging new partnerships. During the project support will be provided by a dedicated international manager and the input of the head of college CPD. In total, some16 teachers will simultaneously attend 2 different training courses. The teachers will undergo a selection process based on the likely benefits to the individual teachers both in terms of their own professional development (inputs) and also significantly on their ability to disseminate the projects technical and also valorise the European aspects of the project with particular emphasis on the building of links and partnerships with colleagues from across the European Union(outputs). ResultBy the end of the project 16 teaching or support staff  will have undergone training in a European context. They in turn will have disseminated new skills and techniques to the remainder of the teaching and support staff. This will in turn lead to the rapid deployment of a number of new new teaching tools, skills and techniques. A further positive outcome will be the development  of new links and partnerships with EU partners.", "http://www.stocktonsfc.ac.uk", "Prior Pursglove and Stockton 6th Form College", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023683_coordinator"], ["6BU", "VIP(Vocational Internships in Portugal) 17/18", "Prior Pursglove and Stockton 6th Form College", 88058.0, "VIP17 (Vocational Internships in Portugal) follows on Stockton Sixth Form College's successful Leonardo da Vinci Mobility projects in 2010-2011 and 2013-2015 and Otra Vista3 from 2016-2017 when valuable lessons were learnt in relation to mobility project management, which have informed this application.\r\n\r\nThe project will send 30 young people at the end of studying full time towards a Level 3 vocational qualification in either Business Studies, Sports Studies or Travel & Tourism to four diverse training providers facilitated by our host intermediary partner Euroyouth.
