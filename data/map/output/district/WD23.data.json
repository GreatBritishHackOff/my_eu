This additional year is going to be split into modules to come to an improved individualization of teaching and learning.\r\nMany studies, e.g. the new Jako-o-Study 2014, show  a distinct dissatisfaction with the G8-system and all the dishonored promises that the political parties imposed on themselves when changing from G9 to G8.\r\nNone of the involved groups: students, parents, teachers, the educational unions as well as the receiving institutions like universities and academies of applied sciences, are able to recognize the formerly paraphrased outlines of that success model.\r\nThe consequences of this critically monitored reforming process are an increased number of early school drop outs, diffuse education biographies and an uncertainty felt by nearly everyone involved in the process. The background of that failed educational reform is where our \u201cOption 10+\u201d starts.\r\nThe aims for the students are amongst others:\r\n- reducing the number of school drop outs,\r\n- increasing competences on all levels necessary for higher education,\r\n- sovereignty and self confidence  for their personal plans for the future,\r\n- preparation for a successful life after leaving the school with the Abitur. \r\nFor the teachers the main aims will be:\r\n- improving the methods being used in classrooms,\r\n- modifying the traditional role of teaching,\r\n- benchmarking.\r\nThe aims for the organization/school are amongst others:\r\n- responsible handling of the educational biography of the students\r\n- enhancing the school's performance by reinvigorating good methods and by new implementation of constructive elements,\r\n- pedagogical diversity and potentials of education,\r\n- schools as a room of new learning experiences including non formal education such as special projects,\r\n- evaluation of educational biographies (G8 in the classical way versus G8 with the inclusion of the year 10+ as a modified way of learning).\r\n\r\nThere will be ten colleagues taking part in the training activities. Concerning the organization of teaching in modules we will send two colleagues to Iceland and Estonia for learning and training how to implement and modify the systems for the needs of our school (especially year 10+). Two colleagues from the school\u2019s management team will work together with members of the school management teams of the Belgian, Scottish and Estonian school for evaluating and guiding the process. Six teachers from the departments of social sciences, natural sciences and the artistic department will go to the partner schools in Scotland, England, Hungary and Belgium for team teaching experiences and to improve their linguistic skills in the subject they will be teaching  bilingually at our school. They will work on joint projects with their respective partners.\r\nTogether with our partners we will develop a program sequence which will be constantly evaluated. By using the GAP analysis readjustments will be made if necessary. It is of great importance for us that our partner schools will also benefit from the joint activities and that we as a group of European schools work towards the same standards. \r\nAfter the realization of the project we expect for the participants an improvement of their linguistic, organizational, methodical and digital competences. A further enhancement of the competences of teachers and students will be achieved by working with cross curricular and bilingual approaches in the modules.\r\nThe  participating teachers will be the multipliers for new methods and teaching approaches and thus all teachers will benefit from the implementation of a new role model for teaching. The results achieved for year 10+ will improve teaching at all ages in our school.\r\nWorking together with partner schools from all over Europe will not only allow a view beyond one\u2019s own nose but it will also bring Europe and European cooperation as a real and joint experience to everyone involved in the project. The results of the project will become part of the school\u2019s curriculum and thus be available in the future for all colleagues. We\u2019ll attach special importance to a sustainable development beyond the completion of the project for collaborating with our partner schools.\r\nThe focus is on a creative interpretation of educational barriers also defined as curricular guidelines;\r\nwe are discussing open and self defined arrangements for times and locations of education. The schools will be moving towards opening themselves in the direction of think tanks for innovative ideas and learning  and we are discussing the core of education,  the development of the system immanent power of self education of our students beyond the existing educational structures. Thus we will release the creativity and the innovational potential  within a successful and future orientated European Union.", "http://www.stmargaretsbushey.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE03-KA101-013251_2"], ["3DA", "Experiencias europeas", "St Hilda's Educational Trust", 9133.0, "The CEIP Virgen de la Pena school is located in an area  with a  high tourist volume during  the Summer months. For this reason we have a huge diversity of all different nationalities together with many students from low income parents. Objective. Our project arose from  our reflection of the immediate needs of our school to improve students performance, avoid absenteeism and provide a better future for them. Our school has a large diversity of students from very  low income families. Our goal is : -To improve our linguistic key competition by promoting teaching of foreign language  and diversity of languages.-To improve and learn by means of observation and formation of courses for teaching and learning of the ANL (CLIL)-To promote the ample European vision of language methodology for the teaching and learning of languages.-Training in techniques to resolve conflicts in the classroom and increase motivation. For that reason we have contacted two schools in United Kingdom who are experts in achieving previous projects in this area : Learning in the woods, to increase motivation and emotional and intelligent courses which follow our aim. Description of Activities -2 teachers will participate in a period of observation in St Hilda\u2019s School, in Bushey, UK where they have a great experience in motivational techniques for study and resolution of conflicts ofchildren in 1st grade which would link to our raised target of 10 days ( In October 2016 )- 1 teacher will participate in a course of Methodology CLIL  (Semana Blanca 2017)- 1 teacher will participate in a course of study of motivational techniques for students  and resolution of conflicts (Semana Santa 2017)-2 teachers will participate in a period of observation of 10 days at Bradshaw Primary School in Warrington UK, who has the experience of the Methodology CLIL and therefore accomplishour requirements to meet our goal. (October 2017)  Method The two teachers would need to travel to the said schools where they will participate in the courses. (Dublin and Plymouth) The methodology of the 2 observation periods (job-shadowing)  will consist of observing the way this method is used and the tools and techniques used during the activities to improve the performance of the students using motivation and resolving conflicts together with putting into practice the method CLIL. Results and predicted impacts With this project we are confident and hopeful that we can obtain results that will correct and improve the needs of our teachers to serve our students and therefore improve their motivationwhich would at  the same time decrease absenteeism,  to improve the techniques to avoid conflict together with an increase in the qualifications of our teachers to be able to impart las ANLin their formation of the CLIL methodology.", "http://www.sthildas-school.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA101-023897_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WD23"}
