Wind energy is the cheapest and technologically most straightforward way to generate the majority of this energy. As a result for this the amount of wind energy installed in the EU is predicted to increase from its current level of 56,000 MW to 300,000 MW by 2030, equating to the installation of over 80,000 wind turbines. Due to the very large radar cross section of the turbines and the motion of the rotating blades, these turbines have a detrimental effect on civilian radar navigations systems and there is growing concern about the potential problems which wind turbines may have on passenger safety. Due to space limitations, wind turbines are increasingly being located in areas close to the main shipping lanes and aviation flight paths and wind farm planning applications are increasingly being rejected. As a result of the radar interference issues, wind energy companies are desperately looking for a solution. Although both electronic radar solutions and the use of Radar Absorbing Materials (RAMs) coated onto the turbines have been considered, no cost-effective solution has as yet been produced. Current RAMs are far too expensive and their performance is not sufficient for wind turbine applications. The proposed \u2018OSGRAM\u2019 project will develop an innovative continuous process for the production of intrinsically conductive polymers (ICPs) whose radar absorbing properties can be accurately tailored. The ICPs will be used to produce a multilayer RAM that can achieve radar attenuation of 20dB  in the S- and X-bands and which can be applied to wind turbine towers, nacelles and blades with a weight of <4kg/sq.m and a cost of 125(Euros)/sq.m.  This will allow our SME consortium to develop world-leading RAMs, giving us global market leadership and leading to sales in excess of 80 million Euros 5 years after the project ends and increase profits across the consortium.", 98422.0, 1059925.0, "OSGRAM", "Decreasing wind turbine interference with traffic control radars", "Wind turbines have come under scrutiny lately for their interference with civilian radar, thus impeding their installation. EU-funded scientists developed novel materials to minimise interference and pave the way to achieving ambitious EU goals in the field of renewable energy sources (RES).", "The EU has targeted a 20\u00a0% contribution of RES to overall energy supply by 2020 and 100\u00a0% by 2050. Wind turbine installations are increasingly contributing to energy supply in the EU. However, the large size of the turbine blades and their rotational motion has a detrimental effect on civilian radar, raising concerns about the safety of aircraft and marine navigation in the neighbourhoods of onshore and offshore wind farms.\n\nThe EU-funded project http://www.osgram.eu (OSGRAM) developed a novel radar-absorbing material (RAM) that is more cost effective and better performing than current RAMs. To achieve this, scientists exploited an intrinsically conductive polymer (ICP), polyaniline. The key to achieving related goals was in the development of a continuous polymerisation process (continuous oscillating baffled reactor (COBR) technology) never before achieved with polyaniline. Enhanced control of polymerisation enabled scientists to tailor its properties for radar absorption at frequencies used by air traffic control and marine navigation. Preliminary tests demonstrate promising microwave absorption and attenuation in the frequency bands of interest. The innovative RAMs can be utilised in the tower, nacelle (housing the gearbox, generator, drive train, etc.) and the blades themselves.\n\nOSGRAM technology is poised to help wind farm stakeholders gain approval for their installation applications, increasingly near main shipping lanes and flight paths due to space limitations.

It will develop a group of novel insulation materials which exhibit these desirable properties in industrial products by combining clay-nano-composites with supporting additives.

The CITYLAB objective is to develop knowledge and solutions that result in roll-out, up-scaling and further implementation of cost effective strategies, measures and tools for emission free city logistics in urban centres by 2030. The project focuses on four axes for intervention due to their present and future relevance and impact related to topic MG-5.2 objectives: 1) Highly fragmented last-mile deliveries in city centres; 2) Large freight attractors and public administrations; 3) Urban waste, return trips and recycling; 4) Logistics facilities and warehouses. CITYLAB will i) improve basic knowledge and understanding on areas of freight distribution and service trips in urban areas that have received too little attention; ii) test and implement 7 innovative solutions that are promising in terms of impact on traffic, externalities and business profitability and have a high potential for future growth; and iii) provide a platform for replication and spreading supported solutions. The core of CITYLAB is a set of living laboratories, where cities work as contexts for innovation and implementation processes for public and private measures contributing to increased efficiency and sustainable urban logistics. Linkages will be established between the different living labs for exchange of experiences and to develop methodologies for transfer of implementations between cities and between companies. This process will be supported by a strong research team. The outputs from the living labs will include best practice guidance on innovative approaches and how to replicate them.

Safety of workers with Down syndrome (SD) and more generally of  workers with intellectual disabilities is something even more specific and fundamental. Until now just some countries have already dealt with this subject and there are no European guidelines avaliable. This is the reason why the Italian Association of people with Down syndrome (AIPD), which has a long-time experience in the field of job placement of its members, has recognised the need to face such an issue. \r\nTwo UK associations made them available for an exchange of experience and a face to face training to AIPD staff.

They have been selected among others because of their multiannual experience in dealing with safety at work for this pscific target of would - be workers. \r\n\r\nThus, if the general objective of the project is to increase job placement rate of people with DS, the specific purpose is the awareness raising and the acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitudes of 5 educators of AIPD staff about safety issues related to people with Down syndrome at work.  Two participants are part of the staff working at AIPD's headquarters (one belonging to the international relations office and one being the person in charge of all job placement actions within the association).
