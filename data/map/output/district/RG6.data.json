The COMBACTE-MAGNET consortium brings together 5 pharmaceutical industry partners and 36 academic partners, and is a true nexus of world class researchers from 10 European countries with expertise in (i) designing and executing observational and interventional studies related to antibiotic\u2010resistant bacteria; (ii) conducting high\u2010quality research in the epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of infections caused by MDR\u2010GNB, (iii) identifying novel biomarkers in critically ill patients; (iv) performing Phase I PK/PD studies; (v) performing Phase 2 studies enriched for PK/PD endpoints; and (vi) performance of large definitive Phase 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) for regulatory purposes. The two European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) project sponsors, MedImmune and AiCuris, will provide all required study\u2010related expertise in clinical development of monoclonal antibodies and antibiotics with MEDI3902 and AIC499 plus BLI as Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs), respectively.

Despite the many different theoretical perspectives on interest, however, previous studies hold a common assumption that interest promotes learning by increasing positive motivational commitment to a task (i.e., motivational benefit of interest). Going beyond this assumption, the current project points to the possibility that there is another hidden, non-motivational benefit of interest on learning, and proposes the novel hypothesis that interest can directly consolidate learning without being mediated by any motivational or attentional processes. The proposal will examine this direct consolidation hypothesis of interest using a multidisciplinary approach, combining behavioural, neurological, and metacognitive perspectives. Study 1 will behaviourally test the direct consolidation hypothesis using a new methodology: post-encoding motivation manipulation. I expect that interesting events will enhance long-term learning, even for the interest-irrelevant materials that are presented prior to the interesting event.

The method we will develop here combines projection operator techniques and simulations within a nonequilibrium thermodynamics framework. Novel, thermodynamically guided simulations will allow us to identify building blocks of the macroscopic model and thereby establish the macroscopic constitutive equations in a thermodynamically consistent form. The systematic coarse-graining approach is therefore well-founded and applicable to a wide variety of systems. The systematic nature of the proposed method allows us to investigate different levels of coarse graining where different amounts of information are kept in the coarser model. For each of the coarse-grained models we will determine their range of validity and thereby identify the appropriateness of the chosen level of description. The result of these works is a hierarchy of models - a truly multi-scale modelling of the system - which includes only the relevant set of variables needed on the chosen level of description.\nWe will develop and illustrate the method for the important case of polymeric and anisotropic fluids like liquid-crystals and ferrofluids. Many concepts of soft matter physics have been established for these systems. Moreover, transport and flow properties of polymeric and anisotropic fluids are also very interesting for industrial and food processing, as well as in biological environments.

While it is often related to the level of sensory input, this relationship is not linear.  The relationship between sensory input and pain can be modulated by the central nervous system based on various sensory, cognitive and affective factors. Individual differences in the capacity to modulate pain centrally have been associated with chronic pain symptoms as well as the onset of chronic pain following surgery (Arendt-Nielsen & Yarnitsky, 2009).   What is suggested is that the ability to modulate the relationship between sensory input and pain perception (hereafter referred to as \u201cmodulatory capacity\u201d) may be a stable, trait-like and clinically relevant individual difference variable that underlies the ability to dynamically and adaptively adjust pain based on the immediate context.\n\nThe goal of the research proposed here is to find reliable markers of modulatory capacity at the level of the brain using in vivo neuroimaging techniques.  In collaboration with Dr. Tom Johnstone (the scientist supervising the project) I have developed a parametric technique for analyzing how the brain instantiates the perceptual transition from innocuous to painful levels of sensory input (Johnstone et al, 2012).  We were able to predict the non-linear transition from innocuous to painful perception with high accuracy based on activation in regions such as the periaqueductal gray that have previously been implicated in central modulation of pain.\n\nThe research proposed here, to be performed at the University of Reading, aims to find clinically applicable biomarkers for modulatory capacity.

These compounds are being tested alone or in combination as incorporated into dairy-, bakery- and egg-based products. This should help determine optimal combinations for new BEFs within these three different food matrices.\n\nSo far, the researchers have evaluated all 45 BEFs (three per food matrix, five types of enrichment per food) for in vitro digestibility, consumer acceptance and shelf-life. Results were loaded into a specially designed database to aid choosing the best product formulations (one in each food matrix, enriched with five combinations of bioactives) for pilot scale production; testing in three pilot intervention studies is currently underway. The most effective BEF from each matrix will then be tested in a multi-centre, double blind, and placebo-controlled intervention trial.\n\nIn parallel, the researchers are using two cell model systems \u2013 adipocytes (fat cells) and liver cells (hepatocytes) \u2013 to determine the effect of DHA, BG and AC alone and in combination on biochemical pathways involved in the development of MetS. In particular, they assessed the effects of BEFs on fat cell differentiation and function based on lipid accumulation and metabolism, expression of specific markers and secretion of adipokines and cytokines.

Dynamical aspects, which involve the atmospheric circulation, have received much less attention. However regional climate, including persistent climate regimes and extremes, is strongly controlled by atmospheric circulation patterns, which exhibit chaotic variability and whose representation in climate models depends sensitively on parameterised processes. Moreover the dynamical aspects of model projections are much less robust than the thermodynamic ones. There are good reasons to believe that model bias, the divergence of model projections, and chaotic variability are somehow related, although the relationships are not well understood.

The crops produced during these trials are being used throughout this project  for plant breeding, agronomic, nutritional and anti-parasitic studies. An important aim is to provide plant breeders with guidelines and tools for selecting new legume varieties with better nutritional and anti-parasitic properties.\n\nResearchers tested the effects of drying and ensiling on the nutritive value of these  crops. They all produced good-quality silages.\n\nLEGUMEPLUS also investigated the tannins produced by two of these plants, and developed methods for purifying these tannins for nutritional and anti-parasitic studies in the laboratory. Tannins are antioxidant compounds that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ruminant livestock farms (i.e. nitrous oxide, and perhaps also methane). They can also control gastro-intestinal parasites, which cause large economic losses across the world, because many parasitic worms have become resistant to synthetic veterinary drugs.\n\nTherefore, trials also tested whether feeding legume forages to ruminants affected the growth of four common intestinal parasites. Tannins had significant effects on the parasitic larvae in the laboratory environment and we are keenly awaiting the results from the feeding trials.\n\nIn the next phase of the LEGUMEPLUS project, scientists will look at how the tannins in these forages influence the quality of meat, cheese and milk and reduce total worm numbers in animals.

This prioritization process is especially important when encountering a situation or stimulus which is important for survival and feeling emotional arousal. However, there is surprisingly little consensus about how emotional arousal influences top-down prioritization. Building on our recent model, the proposed project addresses the novel hypothesis that emotional arousal influences top-down prioritization by enhancing the processing of important information (target enhancement) and suppressing representations of distracting information (distractor suppression). To test this hypothesis, I will examine the effects of arousal for target enhancement and distractor suppression separately by using both behavioural and neuroimaging methodologies. In addition, the proposed project will include both younger and older adults to characterize the age-related changes between emotional arousal and top-down prioritization. Relative to younger adults, older adults typically show selective deficits in distractor suppression with preserved target enhancement processing. Thus, examination of the effects of arousal in older adults should provide insights into whether emotional arousal can facilitate target enhancement independently from distractor suppression.

However, these models exhibit a disturbingly wide range of projections of future climate change even when forced by the same greenhouse-gas scenarios, especially when examined at the regional scale. This model divergence is presumably related, at least in part, to systematic model errors in the large-scale fluxes of heat, moisture and momentum that control regional aspects of climate.

The main objective of the EU-funded 'Seaweed derived anti-inflammatory agents and antioxidants' (SWAFAX) project was to explore methods for extracting polyphenols from the seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum. The goal was to derive bioactive compounds from seaweeds for application in food and health and wellness products.\n\nOptimisation of the extraction methods led to a food-grade SPE containing a mixture of different molecular weight polyphenols. When tested on lymphocytes in vitro, this SPE exhibited substantial bioactivity and protected cells against DNA damage. It also demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity by reducing pro-inflammatory while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines.\n\nA human intervention study was conducted which entailed the consumption of one SPE by healthy volunteers. After an 8-week period, participants showed reduced levels of oxidants in their blood plasma and lower levels of DNA damage. Despite the inter-individual variation in absorption and metabolism of the polyphenols, there was an overall beneficial effect which could be translated into preventive measures against many degenerative diseases. \n\nExploitation of the SWAFAX SPE project could find a number of commercial applications with significant financial benefit for the implicated SMEs.

A novel aspect is that LIBERATION considers  above- and below-ground ecosystem services simultaneously and analyses synergies and trade-offs between different ecosystem services. Using this modelling approach we will analyse which on-farm management practices and spatial configuration of semi-natural habitats optimizes yield and which optimizes farm income.

Unfortunately, most studies involving CT and animal feeds have been carried out ignoring the great structural diversity that exists among plants and have led to contradictory findings. Plants produce a wide range of different tannins, and tannin composition can differ enormously between plant species, varieties and plant parts. Therefore, investigations into the beneficial or detrimental effects of tannins need to consider all aspects of their structural variation in order to allow conclusions that are scientifically sound. The scientific community urgently requires sound data in order to select plants with desirable tannin properties and to generate sustainable, high quality animal products. This research project seeks (1) to analyse tannin contents and structures in a model plant species (Salix spp.) within a unique and genetically well-characterised germplasm collection; (2) to investigate relationships between tannin structure and their biological effects for ruminant production and health; (3) to identify the genetic traits that control tannin structural features and their bioactivity. If successful, this project will generate a scientific breakthrough in terms of tannin traits that should be evaluated and selected in future research programmes in order to improve the sustainability and quality of ruminant production systems. Results from this research will contribute to developing a basis for improved and more sustainable feeding systems for ruminants in the EU and facilitate application of the results to other CT-rich plants.", 154647.0, 154647.0, "TANNIN STRACTURE QTL", null, null, null, null, "http://www.rdg.ac.uk", null, "fp7_94953_999984156"], ["6AH", "Neural substrates of emotion regulation across the lifespan", "The University of Reading", "The ability to appropriately and successfully regulate emotion is a vital component of mental and physical health.

Such individual differences are characterised by differences in the recruitment of brain regions underlying emotion regulation, particularly medial areas of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala, and in their downstream effects on mental processes, physiology, and behaviour. The aim is to study the neural mechanisms that characterise the ability of individuals to respond adaptively to negative events, and how these mechanisms may change across the lifespan.

Measures of physiological responding to emotional stimuli will allow the assessment of individual variability in emotional reactivity in a first session, and functional brain imaging measures will be acquired in a second session while performing emotion regulation tasks. We predict that individuals who successfully regulate their emotion show patterns of reduced amygdala and increased ventromedial PFC activation. We further predict that brain activation patterns shift across the lifespan from more dorsolateral PFC to medial PFC when participants voluntarily regulate their emotion, and when controlling for emotional reactivity.

I will use process-based models with global palaeodata syntheses to address four specific challenges to our understanding of past and future climate and environmental change: \n(1) How does vegetation respond to rapid climate change and what are the consequences of this response for climate?\n(2) To what extent does increasing CO2 enhance tree growth or competitive fitness, and how does this translate into changes in ecosystems and ecosystem services?\n(3) How does the terrestrial biosphere respond to changes in climate variability and the prevalence of extreme events?\n(4) How does the land surface affect regional climates, and why do models persistently fail to predict these effects accurately?\nIn addressing these challenges, I will deliver public-access data sets, model outputs and comparison tools so the strengths of the palaeorecord can be exploited by the wider global change commun", 2176768.0, 2176768.0, "GC2.0", null, null, null, null, "http://www.rdg.ac.uk", null, "h2020_204486_999984156"], ["6AH", "Causality Relations Using Nonlinear Data Assimilation", "The University of Reading", "A major problem in understanding complex nonlinear geophysical systems is to determine which processes drive which other processes, so what the causal relations are. \n\nSeveral methods to infer nonlinear causal relations exist, but often lead to different answers, often perform hypothesis testing on causality, need long stationary time series, can be misleading if an unknown process drives the processes under study, or, if a numerical model is used, reflect model causality instead of real-world causality.

The main research question addresses whether EO is able to provide reliable estimates of anthropogenic heat flux spatiotemporal distribution, at local and city scales. URBANFLUXES will investigate the potential of EO to retrieve the anthropogenic heat flux, as a key component in the urban energy budget and by developing a method capable of deriving it from space. The objective is to develop a method that could be used operationally in the near future, when observations with adequate temporal resolution become available. URBANFLUXES EO-based approach will be easily transferable to any urban area and capable of providing anthropogenic heat flux benchmark data for different applications, including climate models to assess the implication of the anthropogenic heat on the Earth system; building energy models to characterize buildings-to-atmosphere/soil/water heat exchange pathways; and decision support systems for urban sustainable planning and mapping of emissions related to energy consumption. URBANFLUXES is therefore expected to prepare the ground for further innovative exploitation of European space data in scientific activities (Earth system modelling and climate change studies in cities) and future and emerging applications (sustainable urban planning) by exploiting the improved data quality, coverage and revisit times of the Copernicus Sentinels data. The Copernicus observations have the potential to reveal novel scientific insights, related to monitoring the anthropogenic heat flux in cities, at both local and regional scales, generating new EO opportunities.
