However despite these growth rates, the proportion of RES used for domestic heating and hot water is still under one percent. The main barrier is the high equipment and installation cost of the technology. In addition solar thermal yields cannot always be optimally utilised in existing hot water and heating systems. This is due to the limited size and operating temperature range of conventional thermal energy stores. Increasing the contribution of RES will also necessitate larger thermal stores, which is often difficult due to space and cost constraints. Although higher density Phase Change Materials (PCM) show promising results, they have not been proven to deliver real improvements in domestic applications. In PipeStore, we propose to develop a modular and low cost thermal storage technology, based on a \u2018pipes-in-a-pipe\u2019 configuration that can contain a range of PCMs. These will have different melting temperatures, enabling the storage of lower grade thermal energy. This will increase the effective utilisation of a typical solar system by up to twenty percent. Furthermore, a novel actuation and control system will facilitate the use of supercooled PCMs. This will be enable optimal energy storage with a controlled rapid thermal discharge. PipeStore can be scaled and customised to suit any RES in any property. The technology can be positioned in a loft, between walls or in a garage etc. This means that buildings with space limitations can also benefit from RES. The market for thermal storage relating to RES is currently \u20ac500 million in the EU and is expected to expand at a rate of at least ten percent per year. Our aim is to capture a five percent market share by 2020 which will be worth \u20ac40 million per year.", 244944.0, 824655.0, "PIPESTORE", null, null, null, "http://www.pipestore.eu/", "http://www.newwaveinnovation.com", null, "fp7_107652_984860401"], ["0AU", "Development of an expansion valve to reduce energy consumption of cold vending machines and small commercial refrigeration systems", "New Wave Innovation Limited", "The European Vending Association (EVA) is composed of 20 national associations, who represent Europe's SME industry of machine and component manufacturers, suppliers of commodities (ingredients,  confectionery, soft drinks) and operators.  Our chilled vending sector is heavily based on older HFC refrigerant technology.  In contrast Japan has embraced natural refrigerants and is the leading manufacturer of CO2 and HC vending machines. As a result, our industry needs to innovate and develop advanced components and systems, to remain competitive and provide cost effective, energy efficient products. Small refrigeration systems as used in vending machines use capillaries as the expansion device, however they do not enable optimal operation over the range of refrigeration loads. Away from design point load, coefficient of performance drops due to sub-optimal filling of the evaporator. More advanced control systems may be introduced by replacing the capiliary with an expansion valve, however for refrigeration systems in the 50-250W capacity they are challenging to manufacture cost effectively, due to small orifice sizes. As a result the Expand project will develop a low cost expansion device for HC and CO2 refrigerants together with a control system that  will enable efficient modulation of refrigeration system capacity in relation to load.  This will enable cumulative energy consumption savings of 25% for the cooler in relation to present HFC systems, thus regaining a technological lead for the European vending industry.

With 1 million ULDs around the world worth over 900 million Euros, they are a crucial element of the global aviation industry. For example, in 2009, 80 million tonnes of air cargo was carried by the existing ULD fleet. However, 26 million tonnes of this cargo (33%) was transported on passenger aircraft and industry experts agree that air cargo is the weak link in the supply chain. Considering the potential security problems around the global air cargo supply chain, there is an urgent need to review and improve existing technological solutions. Over the last 20 years, incremental improvements have primarily focused on weight reduction, which has resulted in compromised security within the supply chain. The research and development of the SAFEGUARD technology will result in a step change improvement in the security of air cargo supply chain, in addition to large economic savings and logistics improvements for airlines. The proposed technology will overcome the existing security concerns in the supply chain, as well as reducing the ULD weight, minimising supply chain imbalances for ULD availability and the current high maintenance requirements.

To begin, the eight-member research group reviewed existing technological solutions for improving aviation cargo security without increasing weight. Objectives included developing a prototype of a lightweight, hard-sided ULD having a stacking density greater than 4:1.\n\nThe project also planned to simulate a sealing system, based on electronic locking technology and including radio frequency identification (RFID). The two-year project concluded in September 2013.\n\nAfter a phase of preparatory research, the project pursued three avenues of technical development. These were: design and optimisation of a folding polymer-reinforced ULD; development of a prototype electronic sealing system; and exploration of power harvesting.\n\nThe project pursued an advanced nesting concept, leading to patentable improvements to ULD design. The new concept yields a stacking ratio of 3:1, which addresses the global imbalance of ULD availability. The use of reinforced polymers reduces weight of the secure design while also reducing maintenance costs. \n\nTeam members also studied RFID systems, focusing on international legislation, approved products and transmission protocols. A comprehensive analysis of regulations and technical criteria resulted in the decision to adopt a multi-frequency approach. The multiple frequencies available for listening and response mean a design able to be used anywhere.\n\nThe project team also developed a handheld reader with integrated Wi-Fi and 3G connectivity. The device allows RFID tracking information to be exchanged and stored. The ID information interfaces with a project-developed on-board locking system, which includes a new 12C protocol integrated by project partners. The hand-held device uses an electronic Dallas iButton key for users not wishing to establish an RFID system. Power optimisation tests were performed to increase battery life.\n\nThe group also developed a passive energy-harvesting device, incorporating information tracking and security sealing applications.

So far commercial refrigerators have remained outside EC legislation. However, this is likely to change as it is now generally accepted that commercial refrigerators offer significant potential for energy savings. A recent working document for the implementation of the Ecodesign Directive outlines several legislative options that will encourage and mandate significant energy efficiency improvements for beverage coolers.  Compared to similar sized domestic refrigerators, the energy consumption of commercial beverage coolers can be over 3 times higher, even after allowing for increased heat loads, due to use of glass doors, for example. This is the result of a combination of factors such as: i) lack of legislation and standardization; ii) user requirements in relation to pull down (cooling rate of products within a set time frame), which means that the refrigeration system of most coolers is significantly oversized; iii) the fact that the large majority of equipment owners do not operate the beverage coolers and hence do not pay for operating cost. This means that cost and design are the most important drivers and not efficiency. We aim to overcome these barriers by development of unique technology that makes effective use of phase change materials (PCM) within beverage coolers. This will allow downsizing of the cooling system, thereby significantly increasing energy efficiency. It is our aim to achieve a 75% saving compared to a base case cooler. The market opportunity will be worth at least \u20ac700 million per annum in Europe alone.

Now, the project 'Development of a highly efficient, innovative beverage cooler' (ICOOL) has advanced a new refrigerator system that enables energy savings of about 80\u00a0%, with minimal impact on design and manufacturability.\n\nKey to the efficiency of the new system is the use of phase-change materials (PCMs) that provide a thermal buffer. Such materials allow for the storage and release of large amounts of energy by melting or solidifying at certain temperatures.\n\nThe technology, dubbed iCOOL, also makes use of a down-sized cooling system, and features improved lighting and insulation. Yet another advantage is that this new approach does not affect the time needed to cool down warm drinks.\n\nRegarding software, the consortium developed an intelligent control system to manage the PCM buffer so that extra cooling capacity can be provided as needed. The refrigerator systems are equipped with appropriate sensors to enable tight control.\n\nThe cooler consumes just 1 kilowatt-hour per day. Per refrigerator, this translates into a carbon dioxide emission saving of over 600\u00a0kg per year, and a cost saving of over EUR\u00a0300 per year.\n\nCommercialisation of the new technology is next on the agenda, so the ICOOL small business partners are exploring private investments and other funding models.", null, "http://www.newwaveinnovation.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/145861.jpg", "fp7_100445_984860401"], ["0AU", "An all-encompassing, intelligent safety and asset management system for highway maintenance", "New Wave Innovation Limited", "Road maintenance is one of the most dangerous occupations in Europe. Despite stringent health & safety standards over 50% of UK road workers reported a near miss with a vehicle and the large majority of injuries or fatalities occur within designated safety areas. These safe zones are either protected by positive protection systems such as concrete barriers or soft barriers such as traffic cones. The latter are mainly used for temporary works. In such a scenario cones may be the only protection a road worker has from traffic. Due to the maturity of Europe\u2019s road network and the rapid deterioration as a result of heavy traffic and weather conditions, temporary road work is increasing. In addition to concerns about safety, preparation of these temporary barriers is a major drain on resources. As a lot of roadwork is carried out at night, barriers are equipped with lanterns. These are typically powered by disposable batteries which only last a short period of time and have to be changed frequently. The Safelane consortium have successfully developed  a wireless perimeter protection system that detects an impact to a temporary barrier. However,  there are several significant technical hurdles that currently prevent the development of a system that can be applied to every road maintenance scenario. In Safelane we propose to develop an all-encompassing system including; a Smart re-chargeable lantern battery with integrated wireless impact sensor; a Smart alarm base station capable of receiving alerts from individual impact sensors, to warn the workforce; and a device management system enabling road maintenance contractors to effectively manage temporary work sites via a web based graphical user interface.

Such barriers are not ideal for safety and are also not cost effective, requiring as well adequate lighting as much roadwork is done at night.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'An all-encompassing, intelligent safety and asset management system for highway maintenance' (http://www.safelane.fp7.co (SAFELANE)) is helping to bolster safety and safeguard the lives of road maintenance workers.

It is bringing cost efficiency and reliability to roadwork sites, in addition to avoiding use of millions of batteries that end up in landfills or that are destined for recycling. SAFELANE is also integrating its safety system with current road maintenance and management computer networks and systems in order to achieve more cost savings and better reporting of incidents.\n\nAlready, the team has enhanced the Intellicone technology with improved data-logging mechanisms and sensors for vehicle impacts. It conducted trials and observed the results using high-speed video and impact sensor data. The team also built mechanisms to detect deliberate and malicious removal of the cones to minimise vandalism and enhance safety. \n\nTest results demonstrated the benefits of the Intellicone Safelane technology in reducing risk and strengthening safety. Work is continuing on specifications and design of the smart battery and mass-induction system based on wireless charging technology. \n\nWhen the project results are fully exploited, Europe's roads stand to become safer and more secure.

A growth in single occupancy, an increase in multi-dwelling buildings (flats) and a fall in household floor space have all driven an increase in the purchase of combined washer-dryers, growing at 9% p.a.\n\nHowever, washer-dryers are inefficient, using as much as 50% more energy to wash and dry a load than separate systems. This is a concern both for energy consumption and cost for the user - estimated 15 million washer-dryers consume 18 TWh of electricity worth \u20ac300m and indirectly emit 10,000 tonnes of CO2 each year. As well as energy efficiency, washer-dryers also have practical limitations. Due to the small drum size of the machine compared to a dedicated tumble dryer, it is not possible to dry a full wash load in one go, adding to cost and significantly reducing convenience.\n\nLoWash will address these issues by creating a highly energy-efficient machine capable drying a complete wash load without user intervention. It will achieve this by combing an innovative hydraulic load balancing drum with a unique passive/active heat pump drying chain to create a washer-dryer capable of washing and drying a complete 7kg load without removing any of it from the machine.

A load of 7\u00a0kg will be washed and dried without a human opening and closing any doors or carrying out other operations.\n\nTo date, research shows the load-balancing system must be capable of detecting out of balance forces and offsetting the off balance rapidly due to the high-speed spinning action. The drum redesign incorporates these key concepts. The heat pump closed loop air drying system, successfully modelled and simulated, receives a signal to start itself.\n\nCertain features of the design are still under development.
