However, the take-up of simulation software by SMEs has until now been low due to high barriers of entry that include hardware prices, licensing costs and technical expertise. The CloudSME project will develop a cloud-based, one-stop-shop solution that will significantly lower these barriers, provide a scalable platform for small or larger scale simulations, and enable the wider take-up of simulation technologies in manufacturing and engineering SME's. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will support end user SME's to utilise customised simulation applications in the form of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) based provision. Moreover, simulation software service providers and consulting companies will have access to a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution that enables them to quickly assemble custom simulation solutions in the cloud for their clients. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will be built on existing and proven technologies provided by the project partners and partially developed in previous European projects. Building on existing technology will enable the project to deliver its results quickly. The project consortium includes experienced partners, incorporating 12 SME's, from cloud hardware and platform providers, to simulation software providers, end users and technology integrators. To guarantee greater impact of the developed solution, additional use-cases will be provided by a further 10 partners following an open call after the first year of the project. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will dramatically change the way in which manufacturing/engineering SME's utilise simulation solutions today, and will provide new business opportunities not only to end-user SME's, but also to simulation software and cloud service providers.A typical experimental scenario in the project is based around an insole design simulation program developed by one of the partners, used for designing tailored insoles for sports footwear and for people with foot problems. The end user company in the project has patented a method for scanning feet in 3D and the experiment will involve linking this to a cloud-based version of the simulation software to design insoles and simulate the interaction of feet and insoles. In turn, this design is loaded into a CNC machine to manufacture the insoles. The aim of the cooperation is to establish a portal through which scans can be uploaded to the cloud-based software service which then validates the scanned image to produce the design. The experiment will explore the extent to which the service supporting the lifecycle of tailored insole production can be achieved. This will immediately lead to extensions of the software for checking images within other industries unrelated to the footwear business.", 31885.0, 4193116.0, "CloudSME", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_109223_936998176"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2LL", "DEES - Digitale Bildung an europ\u00e4ischen Schulen", "The King's School, Worcester", 32701.0, "During the DEES Project (Digital Education for European Schools) 28 teachers of the \u00d6kumenischen Domgymnasiums Magdeburg (\u00d6DG) aim to visit the following 5 partner schools: Worcester (England), Istanbul (Turkey), Konnevesi (Finland), La Havre (France) und Pisa (Italy). \r\nDuring these visits, teachers from the \u00d6DG will shadow colleagues for one school week to learn and develop skills within digital education. Collaboratively, they'll observe school practices for more than 700 school hours, talk to colleagues and exchange experiences and ideas.\r\n\u00d6DG teachers will participate both in school life and work for one week, to obtain knowledge about other European partner schools involved in the project. Their learning focus will be on digital education - observing how it is taught and used in lessons. This acquired knowledge will later be reflected upon and critically discussed with other colleagues at the \u00d6DG, before making comparisons with the existing digital education programme at each school.\r\nThe reason for this critical reflection and comparison is so improved learning methods may be implemented and utilised within digital education programmes. Before, after and during the project, a questionnaire will be distributed to investigate teachers\u2019 attitudes towards teaching and learning methods used in digital education. \r\nIn regards to points made in the ICILS (which affirms that Germany is below average in its use of digital education as a learning method), teachers of the \u00d6DG wish to strengthen the implementation of digital education, to improve standards and increase Germany\u2019s position.\r\nThe results of the project will not only be discussed with the faculty, but also with parents and the partner schools.

The students come from diverse social extraction families: some with university education, others with socio-economic and cultural deprivation situations, ethnic minorities and immigrants. About 22% of the students suffer some type of problem such as school truancy, behavior problems, school mismatch, etc. Our center has for years applied an integrated curriculum that fuses the contents of the British National Curriculum and those of the Spanish Curriculum, derived from the signing of the Agreement between the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science and the British Council. Our aim of center when requesting this action of mobility for 2 years is to promote the enthusiasm of the teachers to continue forming and improving their linguistic and methodological competences to enhance our teaching quality. The objectives set for this purpose are: * To improve linguistic competence through observation and training activities in a more globalized educational and cultural context. * To deep in the knowledge of tools and methodologies that favor the integration of non-linguistic contents using a foreign language as Vehicular language * Know and compare educational models to improve our teaching work and achieve successful teaching-learning experiences, in which students enjoy learning and develop attitudes of acceptance and respect for others, promoting interculturality in our center. The application of new technologies in our teaching practice to motivate students and make them participants in their learning process * Exchange educational experiences with teachers and students of the visited center promoting interculturality through new technologies. The students and teachers the consciousness of belonging to the EU as a site for personal and work development. Our team member in this project consists of 19 teachers of Infantile and Primary Education with different level of linguistic competence, that go from A1 to C1 of English. Through this project we have proposed to work a set of activities such as participation in language training courses, CLIL methodology training courses and new technologies, training courses in Montessori methodology and a jobshadowing process in 3 centers in 2 countries (UK, Denmark). The methodology to be followed throughout the project will be based on experience and direct observation to foster the critical spirit, and will be carried out in a cooperative way  by the whole cloister. This will be achieved through language courses, focused on a communicative approach, and jobshadowing, with which we will cover aspects such as school organization, curriculum, space distribution, ... To take to the classroom everything we learned will use one Methodology based on meaningful learning, starting from the level of knowledge of our students and progressively moving towards more complex learning. It will also take into account the principles of educational intervention (socialization, globalization, family-school collaboration, motivation, intuition, autonomy, ability to learn to learn ...) Achieving the proposed objectives will have a short, medium and long impact Term of the entire Educational Community. In this way the teaching staff will improve the linguistic competence,  we will deep in the new methodologies mentioned above and we will boost the team work, which will result in an increase of the motivation and the improvement of its working system. The improvement of the linguistic competence of the teaching staff will revert to the students, who will participate in active and more motivating methodologies that will imply a greater involvement in their learning process in addition to a greater knowledge of the European dimension and an intercultural reinforcement that will broaden their horizons. In the Center, the Language Program will be strengthened, the team work of the faculty will be strengthened, sharing its knowledge with the rest of the teachers and drawing common lines of work for the application of such learning, thus revalorizing the concept of unity and the image of the Center on the outside. Long-term benefits: create a Strategic Action Plan in the methodological scope with objectives and deadlines for its achievement; Improved English proficiency; Intercultural knowledge or exchange; Awareness of the European dimension and identity; Of continuing teacher training beyond the framework of the project itself and participation in future European projects.", "http://www.schoolswire.org/public/george678.html.nocache", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-036419_3"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1RS", "BRITISH SECURITY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION LTD*", 638.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_18568", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "WR1"}
