However, the take-up of simulation software by SMEs has until now been low due to high barriers of entry that include hardware prices, licensing costs and technical expertise. The CloudSME project will develop a cloud-based, one-stop-shop solution that will significantly lower these barriers, provide a scalable platform for small or larger scale simulations, and enable the wider take-up of simulation technologies in manufacturing and engineering SME's. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will support end user SME's to utilise customised simulation applications in the form of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) based provision. Moreover, simulation software service providers and consulting companies will have access to a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution that enables them to quickly assemble custom simulation solutions in the cloud for their clients. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will be built on existing and proven technologies provided by the project partners and partially developed in previous European projects. Building on existing technology will enable the project to deliver its results quickly. The project consortium includes experienced partners, incorporating 12 SME's, from cloud hardware and platform providers, to simulation software providers, end users and technology integrators. To guarantee greater impact of the developed solution, additional use-cases will be provided by a further 10 partners following an open call after the first year of the project. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will dramatically change the way in which manufacturing/engineering SME's utilise simulation solutions today, and will provide new business opportunities not only to end-user SME's, but also to simulation software and cloud service providers.A typical experimental scenario in the project is based around an insole design simulation program developed by one of the partners, used for designing tailored insoles for sports footwear and for people with foot problems. The end user company in the project has patented a method for scanning feet in 3D and the experiment will involve linking this to a cloud-based version of the simulation software to design insoles and simulate the interaction of feet and insoles. In turn, this design is loaded into a CNC machine to manufacture the insoles. The aim of the cooperation is to establish a portal through which scans can be uploaded to the cloud-based software service which then validates the scanned image to produce the design. The experiment will explore the extent to which the service supporting the lifecycle of tailored insole production can be achieved. This will immediately lead to extensions of the software for checking images within other industries unrelated to the footwear business.", 36705.0, 4193116.0, "CloudSME", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_109223_937778153"], ["3JU", "Cloud Orchestration at the Level of Application", "Outlandish Llp", "SMEs and public sector organizations increasingly investigate the possibilities to use cloud computing services in their everyday business conduct. Accessing services and resources in the cloud on-demand and in a flexible and elastic way could result in significant cost savings due to more efficient and convenient resource utilization that also replaces large investment costs with long term operational costs. On the other hand, the take up of cloud computing by SMEs and the public sector is still relatively low due to limited application-level flexibility and also security concerns. The Cloud Orchestration at the Level of Application (COLA) project aims to increase the adoption of cloud computing services by the above mentioned two strategic target communities. Typical industry and public sector applications require resource scalability and efficient resource utilization in order to serve a variable number of customers with dynamic resource demands, and to suitably optimize resource consumption and costs. However, the dynamic and intelligent utilization of cloud infrastructure resources from the perspective of cloud applications is not trivial. Although there have been several efforts to support the intelligent and coordinated deployment, and to a smaller extent also the run-time orchestration of cloud applications, no comprehensive solution has emerged until now that could be applied in large scale near operational level industry trials. The overall objective of the COLA project is that by building on and extending current research results, it will define and provide a reference implementation of a generic and pluggable framework that supports the optimal and secure deployment and run-time orchestration of cloud applications.

Transgender people in Lithuania face many challenging situations due to the legal and social environment in the country. Regarding this, Lithuania has a lot of room for improvement in the case of legal gender recognition, gender reassignment treatment, etc. The fact that Lithuanian legislative system does not recognize the legal category of \u201cgender identity\u201d, cause discrimination of transgender people, which is often not punished. Therefore, in 2015, LGL association initiated campaign focused on transgender issues and noticed the lack of a strong and empowered transgender community.\r\n\r\nThis project is focusing on transgender community empowerment, but not forgetting about LGBT* community as a whole. Apart from creating empowered LGB and transgender community this project\u2019s objective is to increase the visibility of transgender people in LGBT* movement in Lithuania and at the same time raise awareness about diversity in the community. Having in mind that the sustainable change reacting directly to the needs of the target group is coming from the members of this group, this project intend to focus on empowering community from bottom-up approach. \r\n\r\nThroughout the years of implementing EVS project LGL observed that presence of an international volunteers is essential in LGBT* community for the purpose of building and empowering young people to be more active.

If only it was this simple though.  With so many young people competing for the same jobs, a university degree is simply not enough anymore.\r\n\r\nWe have identified that with the pressures of schools and universities, young people are no longer trying to discover and develop their natural talents.  They don\u2019t explore their given talents and try to fit within the norms of modern education.  Studies have shown that some people are better equipped, mentally and physically, for certain jobs, so should this not be the focus of their education and training?  \r\n\r\nThis youth exchange will address the subject of youth unemployment from the viewpoint that we need to understand our natural skills and develop these so that we can overcome unemployment by being the best version of ourselves that we can be.  We will explore the hidden talents that we have and see how these can be used to make us more employable and also to help us find the best jobs based on these talents.  We will look at our options when it comes to education, and if we already have an education, see how we can combine our education and our talents to explore our options of the labour market, its needs and how our talents, skills and education can meet these needs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above we will also explore the labour markets of our countries and those of the EU, to understand what they need and how we can fit into these needs so that we can increase our chances of employment by meeting the needs of the labour markets.\r\n\r\nThis youth exchange will address the challenges of young unemployment in the partner countries with an emphasis of creating better understanding of our hidden talents and understanding the needs of the labour markets and creating a bridge between the two in order to turn young people into skills and employable youth.  \r\n \r\nIn order to achieve these goals the activities foreseen for the project are vital, non-formal and informal methodologies are used to achieve these goals.  \r\n\r\nDiscussions are used to allow participants to share knowledge, ideas and experiences with each other.
