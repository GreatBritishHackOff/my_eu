It will integrate available global earth observations (EO), in-situ datasets and models and will construct a global water resources re-analysis dataset of significant length (several decades). The resulting data will allow for improved insights on the full extent of available water and existing pressures on global water resources in all parts of the water cycle. The project will support efficient and globally consistent water management and decision making by providing comprehensive multi-scale (regional, continental and global) water resources observations. It will test new EO data sources, extend existing processing algorithms and combine data from multiple satellite missions in order to improve the overall resolution and reliability of EO data included in the re-analysis dataset. The usability and operational value of the developed data will be verified and demonstrated in a number of case-studies across the world that aim to improve the efficiency of regional water distribution. The case-studies will be conducted together with local end-users and stakeholders. Regions of interest cover multiple continents, a variety of hydrological, climatological and governance conditions and differ in degree of data richness (e.g. the Mediterranean and Baltic region, Ethiopia, Colombia, Australia, New Zealand and Bangladesh). The data will be disseminated though an open data Water Cycle Integrator portal to ensure increased availability of global water resources information on both regional and global scale. The data portal will be the European contributor to the existing GEOSS water cycle platforms and communities. Project results will be actively disseminated using a combination of traditional methods (workshops, papers, website and conferences) and novel methods such as E-learning courses and webinars that promote the use of the developed dataset.", 111639.0, 9126154.0, "EARTH2OBSERVE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_111322_986455566"], ["1ED", "NAture Insurance value: Assessment and Demonstration", "Ambiotek Community Interest Company", "NAIAD aims to operationalise the insurance value of ecosystems to reduce the human and economic cost of risks associated with water (floods and drought) by developing and testing - with key insurers and municipalities - the concepts, tools, applications and instruments (business models) necessary for its mainstreaming. We will do this in detail for 8 demonstration sites (DEMOs) throughout Europe and develop tools and methods applicable and transferable across all of Europe. \nThe assumption is that Natural Assurance Schemes can reduce risk, especially to drought and flooding, and this risk reduction can be assessed and incorporated within insurance schemes. \nNAIAD\u00b4s conceptual frame is based on three pillars:\n(i) to help build a resilience approach to risk management through nature based solutions, \n(ii) the operationalisation and testing of scientific methods using a source-to-sea in DEMOs,\n(iii) the uptake of nature based solutions that are cost-effective and provide environmental, social and economic benefits.\nTrans-disciplinarity and stakeholder engagement are at the core of NAIAD for two reasons: first, because the conceptual and assessment methodologies combine physical, social and cultural and economic aspects, integrated into tools and methods but second, and most importantly \u201croad tested\u201d and validated with the stakeholders and end users themselves at the DEMOs. \nNAIAD will contribute to providing a robust framework for assessing insurance value for ecosystem services by (i) enabling full operationalisation through improved understanding of ecosystem functionality and its insurance value at a broad range of scales in both urban and rural context; (ii) making explicit the links between ecosystem values and social risk perception; and (iii) the application of developed methods and tools in water management by relevant stakeholders, especially businesses, public authorities and utilities.", 98793.0, 4432562.0, "NAIAD", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_206403_986455566"], ["2AD", "Submersible vessel used for multi-purpose sub-aqua applications to enhance marine life,environment conservation and structural integrity of offshore installations.", "Scubacraft Limited", "Scubacraft has been developed with the explicit capability of being able to be a submerging vessel with the carrying capability to hold vital equipment to be used to perform testing and sampling.  The vessel\u2019s design has the optimum on-board capacity to carry up to three people, and designated space specifically created for the cargo of detection equipment, sensors and other kit. Introducing patented technology, Scubacraft will become the state of the art technology for use in underwater industrial applications for the energy industry sector, specifically offshore inspections for wind turbines. The applicability of Scubacraft can also be adopted for marine conservation and search and rescue operations. The current state-of-the-art method for performing underwater inspections uses divers to manually carry equipment to the inspection site and then perform the inspection. Scubacraft can revolutionise this way of inspecting by transporting a team of divers and equipment directly to the inspection site quicker, thereby creating a larger window of opportunity for the inspection to be performed, maximising inspection efficiencies and enabling earlier defect detection of structural integrities.\n\nThrough this feasibility study, Scubacraft Ltd will undertake full market analysis to establish the potential for exploiting this technology into wider markets on a global scale. The current NDT inspection market indicates a projected growth rate, up to 2017, of $5.5bn. This will be the primary market which Scubacraft Ltd will seek to launch Scubacraft into thereby creating a leading edge standard in how underwater inspections are performed with greater efficiency, creating economic savings for operators and enhancing maintenance schedules. Through the feasibility study, potential market sectors and customers will be assessed and identified as the opportunity for Scubacraft to be adopted by a wider range of industrial and social operators is significant.", 42724.0, 61034.0, "Scubacraft", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_204274_921443159"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SS9"}
