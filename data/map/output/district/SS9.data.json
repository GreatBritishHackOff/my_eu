It will integrate available global earth observations (EO), in-situ datasets and models and will construct a global water resources re-analysis dataset of significant length (several decades). The resulting data will allow for improved insights on the full extent of available water and existing pressures on global water resources in all parts of the water cycle. The project will support efficient and globally consistent water management and decision making by providing comprehensive multi-scale (regional, continental and global) water resources observations. It will test new EO data sources, extend existing processing algorithms and combine data from multiple satellite missions in order to improve the overall resolution and reliability of EO data included in the re-analysis dataset. The usability and operational value of the developed data will be verified and demonstrated in a number of case-studies across the world that aim to improve the efficiency of regional water distribution. The case-studies will be conducted together with local end-users and stakeholders. Regions of interest cover multiple continents, a variety of hydrological, climatological and governance conditions and differ in degree of data richness (e.g. the Mediterranean and Baltic region, Ethiopia, Colombia, Australia, New Zealand and Bangladesh). The data will be disseminated though an open data Water Cycle Integrator portal to ensure increased availability of global water resources information on both regional and global scale. The data portal will be the European contributor to the existing GEOSS water cycle platforms and communities.

The vessel\u2019s design has the optimum on-board capacity to carry up to three people, and designated space specifically created for the cargo of detection equipment, sensors and other kit. Introducing patented technology, Scubacraft will become the state of the art technology for use in underwater industrial applications for the energy industry sector, specifically offshore inspections for wind turbines. The applicability of Scubacraft can also be adopted for marine conservation and search and rescue operations. The current state-of-the-art method for performing underwater inspections uses divers to manually carry equipment to the inspection site and then perform the inspection. Scubacraft can revolutionise this way of inspecting by transporting a team of divers and equipment directly to the inspection site quicker, thereby creating a larger window of opportunity for the inspection to be performed, maximising inspection efficiencies and enabling earlier defect detection of structural integrities.\n\nThrough this feasibility study, Scubacraft Ltd will undertake full market analysis to establish the potential for exploiting this technology into wider markets on a global scale. The current NDT inspection market indicates a projected growth rate, up to 2017, of $5.5bn. This will be the primary market which Scubacraft Ltd will seek to launch Scubacraft into thereby creating a leading edge standard in how underwater inspections are performed with greater efficiency, creating economic savings for operators and enhancing maintenance schedules.

Darlinghurst is a larger than average sized academy in a predominately working class area of Southend with 680 pupils and 80 staff. \r\n\r\nOverall, pupil mobility is higher than the national average.   Though the percentage of pupils with special educational needs and or disabilities is below average, general pupil mobility is higher than national expectations with a rising roll of families moving into the area.  Intentional links, language learning, Global links and Outdoor Learning have been strongly embedded in to our school as a way of encouraging the raising of our educational standards and engaging with our pupils.\r\n\r\nAt our recent Ofsted inspection, Outdoor Learning was identified as one of strengths of the school.  We need to build upon this by up-skilling more teachers to be able to have the knowledge and experience to teach strong Outdoor Learning lessons which inspire our pupils and bring to life the creative curriculum our pupils need. \r\n\r\nDuring our 2 year project, we intend to send 12 key Learning Leaders (6 each year) on training in Spain and  Denmark to learn new methods and experience a different education context-- in order to compare, contrast and evaluate best practice.
