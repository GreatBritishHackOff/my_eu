This will be achieved by improving knowledge and technological skills, needed to survive in a tough global competition and to provide innovative products.  This is particularly important as the technology gap between larger and smaller European yards has increased significantly over the last decades.\nIn the technical part, the project will develop, test and validate smart technology solutions, comprising the optimum between design, equipment and work organization. All solutions shall address the specific needs and challenges of the target group, which have been clearly identified in the proposal. Seven key Technology Areas and related innovative ideas have been identified, which represent critical processes from design through production to repair and conversion. These solutions will be adapted and documented in a Technology Catalogue. The most promising solutions will be selected to build, test and validate at least six physical mock-ups, which will be demonstrated to the European maritime community, represented by a User Group. Technical developments will be accompanied by the elaboration of innovative business models, productivity and environmental assessment, the development of training schemes and a sustainable innovation network in close cooperation with European associations.\nThe project comprises 17 partners from 9 European countries with SME shipyards and technology providers in a leading role.\nWhile improving the technology level of small and medium sized companies, the project will contribute to the overall competitiveness of the EU maritime sector, sustaining the wide network of large and smaller companies.

Focusing on passenger ships, ferries and mega-yachts, the results will to a large extend be applicable also to other ships. A holistic life cycle performance assessment on ship level will guide the technical developments on system level, clustered in System Groups. The results will be integrated in 3 virtual show cases (ship concepts) demonstrating technical solutions as well as life cycle impact compared to current designs. Optimization tools will be developed and applied in a cooperative process proving feasibility, adaptability and efficiency to future commercial applications. The estimated overall impact of BESST will result in a reduction of life cycle cost of about 120 M\u20ac per PanMax ship and a reduction of CO2 emissions by 12% per ship and year, just to mention a few key figures. The key areas of technical developments include: \u2022 Space Optimisation and Easy Maintenance \u2022 Improving Payload to Gross Tonnage Ratio \u2022 Cost Efficient Building Processes and Refurbishment \u2022 Improved Energy Efficiency and Reduced Emissions \u2022 Noise and Vibration \u2022 Improved Reliability through Model-Based Design and Condition Monitoring \u2022 Optimization of Logistic Chains \u2022 Improving Safety and Security The consortium is formed by 8 leading EU shipyards.

Introducing innovative materials and technology into the design of new ships to enhance competitiveness is very complex. It is often not clear if, how and by whom these novel systems or materials can be repaired in case of damage.\n\nWith the support of EU funding, the http://www.throughlife.eu/ (THROUGHLIFE) project was established to develop and validate new approaches for improved energy efficiency and through-life asset management. Close collaboration with industry stakeholders ensured identification of both the most relevant areas for improvement and the potential market scenarios to be addressed. For selected application scenarios, the consortium investigated promising new technologies and developed new business models to support market introduction through reduced uncertainty and risk regarding hidden costs.\n\nScientists assessed the use of composites in a river cruiser sundeck to reduce weight and thus fuel consumption. A full-scale demonstrator proved the technical feasibility regarding strength and resistance to deflections. A life-cycle assessment produced promising outcomes. Despite significantly higher investment costs, the fuel savings and reduced maintenance contribute to an overall reduction in operational costs throughout the life cycle.\n\nSelf-healing anti-corrosion coatings in ballast water tanks and anti-abrasive coatings for certain cargo spaces were also developed and tested. They showed excellent potential to reduce maintenance and replacement of components and demonstrate high potential for actual implementation.\n\nIn the ballast water tank application, a condition monitoring system exploiting fibre optic sensors was also investigated to detect corrosion and optimise scheduling of maintenance. The sensor system could easily be extended to other structures subjected to changing internal or external conditions. Life-cycle performance analyses were conducted for all technologies to determine the ability to meet THROUGHLIFE objectives.\n\nThe THROUGHLIFE project addressed the most important concerns of stakeholders regarding increasing costs associated with a shipping vessel's life cycle.
