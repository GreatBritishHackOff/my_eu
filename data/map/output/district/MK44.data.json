Because of the high water content of this material, energy can only effectively be gained through biochemical conversion. The approach best suited to this is anaerobic digestion where yields of 400-450 m3 methane per kg ODM can be achieved. The research explores the ways in which this energy potential can be realised through effective collection, pre-processing and optimisation of the fuel conversion technology, and considers how integration of these aspects with improving conversion efficiencies can maximise the net energy gains. It expands our rapidly-developing fundamental knowledge of syntrophic anaerobic microbial interactions, and applies this to the manipulation of reactor conditions in order to achieve stable operating conditions at high loading rates and volumetric efficiencies. It considers methods of upgrading the gaseous fuel product to extend the range of end user applications and the scales at which this technology can be exploited. It takes into account issues of biosecurity when using this material, and quantifies the environmental benefits associated with nutrient recycling which contribute significantly to indirect energy gains. The research combines techniques of waste audit, feasibility study, laboratory scientific investigation, technical-scale trials, plant monitoring, process modelling, life cycle assessment and energy footprinting in order to deliver recommendations for the valorisation with maximum benefit of this energy source as a second-generation biofuel.", 177129.0, 3942798.0, "VALORGAS", "Food waste to biogas", "Food waste from homes and restaurants makes up a large fraction of municipal waste. An EU-funded project used state-of-the-art technology to recover and reuse this material.", "The project, 'Valorisation of food waste to biogas' (http://www.valorgas.soton.ac.uk/index.htm (VALORGAS)) , took advantage of fuel conversion technology to recover a second-generation gaseous fuel product. The project was able to overcome many challenges related to collection, handling, pre-treatment, and the anaerobic digestion (AD) of food waste.\n\nResearchers set out to evaluate the efficiency and yield of food waste collection scheme. They also determined the energy and carbon footprint of the conversion process. Finally, they wanted to better understand how AD works.\n\nThe work began with data collection of food waste in selected regions in Europe. A small project was also conducted in India. The aim was to gain information about the properties of food waste and to identify any regional differences. The team then conducted a survey on food waste collections and carried out case studies on appropriates scales for AD in public and private communities. \n\nThe project resulted in an increase in biogas production. This product may be used in combined heat and power plants and as a fuel for vehicles. Throughout the project, the team considered biosecurity issues and quantified the environmental benefits of nutrient recycling.\n\nThis research has the potential to help the EU meet its long-term energy goals. By overcoming many problems associated with the AD technology, the team has opened the doors to more widespread use. In India, the work resulted in 22 recommendations for the development of small-scale biogas upgrading for the bottling industry. \n\nThe data characterising food also has tremendous value. The information can help with planning for waste-processing facilities. Furthermore, the research and findings have contributed to the development of European guidance in the field of energy and the environment.", null, "http://www.greenfinch.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/146204.jpg", "fp7_94057_990367964"], ["3UP", "Development of a Smart Integrated Miniaturised Sensor System for analytical challenges in diagnostics, industry and the environment", "Unipath Limited", "The widespread availability of smart miniaturised systems is limited by the inability to integrate a sufficient number of functionalities into a single device at low cost and high volume using traditional production technologies. Organic, flexible and printed electronics (OFPE) offers this possibility. However, it too must overcome some significant challenges relating to device interfacing and fabrication. Key among these is the availability of subsystems (sensors, displays, power and circuitry) suitable for integration through OFPE, as well as the ability to combine these components through compatible processes.<br/>SIMS will develop a smart, miniaturised sensing system through the integration of a nanosensor, printed low cost display, mobile phone interface and printed battery with organic circuitry. Integration will take place on a single substrate employing photolithography, screen and ink jet printing and lamination.<br/>SIMS will be a platform technology. Its broad potential, including industrial and environmental monitoring, will be illustrated through the sensitive detection of hydrogen peroxide. However, due to the scale of the diagnostics market and its relevance to the partners, SIMS will focus on the quantitative measurement of cholesterol.<br/>SIMS will be low cost, disposable, and free from instrument calibration and maintenance. It will vastly expand the opportunities for distributed testing, creating new markets through innovative retailing opportunities.
