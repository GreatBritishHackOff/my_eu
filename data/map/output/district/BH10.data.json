CAD (Computer Aided Design) and CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) systems enable all kinds of mold and laying plan studies to be done in the field of clothing production technology. The CAD-CAM system has been in operation for more than 20 years in our country, but it has not been very popular in the first years due to the high cost and the complexity of the time modelists. However, nowadays CAD-CAM system has become preferred both in national and international standards and in quality production. Although the system is expensive and costly, it has become a system that is frequently used in national and international industrial establishments due to its long-term time, cost, profitability and ease of use.\r\n\r\nThe general objectives of our project can be summarized as follows; To increase the export value of the country by increasing the added value created in the clothing sector, to increase awareness of the information and technology and to increase awareness in this field, to improve the curriculum which is already carried out and to be educated and to conform to the EU standards, to define the needs and dynamics of the EU clothing sector as practical, Positive impact on the economy of the country by increasing the cultural interaction of the clothing sector and positively influencing this learning, by ensuring that the EU technological solutions differ from our own curriculum and that these solutions have a positive impact on the production quality and production rate and by increasing the awareness of the production technology in the clothing sector in the EU and Turkey. .\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, the specific objectives of our project include: The training of our trainers in the EU standards and the development of the teaching and learning abilities of the participants, the improvement of the research and development skills of the participants, the extraction of the language competencies to the required levels, the designing of different patterns and the modeling in the advanced level, and the training of the created model to more qualified personnel in the CAD- To increase the quality of the project, to improve the areas that can be developed by examining the EU standards.\r\n\r\nWithin the scope of the project, participants will be selected in accordance with mobility activities.
