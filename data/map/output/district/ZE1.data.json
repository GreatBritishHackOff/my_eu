This project brings together a network of partners to broaden and develop the audience to Viking heritage and its sites across Europe.  These partners are already members of the Destination Viking Association which will take forward the results of the project.The Follow the Vikings project is a multi-faceted project to promote, celebrate, transfer knowledge and skills and facilitate the exchange of tangible and intangible cultural material relating to the Viking World.  The objective of the project is to make the transnational Viking heritage accessible and understandable to a world-wide audience.The project has several key components:1. Audience Development \u2013 through a variety of means including the use of new technologies (e.g. social media, mobile applications, website)2. Building Competence in Business Models - through sharing best-practice throughout the project and expert advice at a seminar on business development3. Strengthening the International Network - build a wider network among professionals and institutions working with the dissemination of Viking heritage, by investigating the ways of presenting Viking heritage to the public to create a better visitor experience4. International Touring Event - Promote interest in Viking heritage and heritage tourism by organising a travelling group of Viking actors and artists to Viking markets and similar events throughout Europe.The project will create a large and lasting network among cultural actors involved in the preservation, presentation and marketing of Viking heritage throughout Europe and further afield. The project will also support an intensified exchange of knowledge and experience between these actors, as well as supporting the creation of joint transnational presentations and products on Viking legacy.", "http://www.shetlandamenity.org", "SHETLAND AMENITY TRUST", "creative_559679-CREA-1-2015-1-UK-CULT-COOP2_coordinator"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0LY", "Primary Teacher Language Immersion Training", "Sound Primary School", 7553.0, "We are the largest primary school in Shetland with a school roll of 366 (including Nursery).  We hope to send 5 members of our teaching staff on a six-day language immersion training course in Salignac, France which is run by Language for Education for Europe.  \r\n\r\nOur school has embraced the changes in national policy on modern languages and has had a rethink of our school's aims and objectives for Global Learning and we are now teaching French from Primary 1 to Primary 7 as well as German in Primary 6 and 7.  As part of our school and local authority's strategy for '1+2' implementation we are in line with the current strategy whereby pupils must leave school having studied one first language plus two other modern language . In order to do this effectively we need staff who are confident enough in these subjects and able to teach it to younger pupils than we have taught before. We have already begun working with the local authority to invest in resources to help staff with this such as Power Language and Linguascope but this immersion training will increase our staff capacity to make the best of these resources.\r\n\r\nThe aims of the course are for the participant staff to gain language competency and improve their teaching skills. This course will help the teachers embed languages as part of everyday school routine and open up opportunities for promotion of global citizenship which is a key part of our curriculum. On return, our participant teachers will share their experience with the rest of our primary staff through CPD opportunities and events we have planned for the coming school year as well as publicising their experience and promoting our links and modern language teaching to the wider community through school newsletters and local media.\r\n\r\nThe members of staff going on the mobility have been chosen based on their engagement with global learning and modern languages and by the fact that they wish to increase their competency in French so that they can teach all ages and stages and we feel they need more experience and ideas on how to integrate modern languages in other ways and into the curriculum.    \r\n\r\nWhile the national policy makes this training more essential, this course is is also part of our school strategy for learning globally.   We have also expanded our international links this year and are part of Shetland's first Confucius Hub which demonstrates our passion for looking at the world around us. We are also a  UNICEF Rights Respecting School.   We have made links with a school in Villeneuve-Loubet and are sharing ideas on how we promote environmental responsibility through effective teaching and learning.", "http://www.sound.shetland.sch.uk", "Sound Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035450_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["0HB", "Shetland Fuel Poverty Service", "Shetland Islands Council", "The operation will provide support to low income households in Shetland aimed at reducing household energy bills and increasing the warmth of homes.", "ESF", 60000.0, 120000.0, "esf_scotland_145"], ["0HB", "Financial Health", "Shetland Islands Council", "The operation will provide personalised support to participants in low income households to reduce levels of debt and increase capacity to manage monthly household budget.
