However, this innovative solution is present in only a few cities and at best in the starting phase in other European cities. Its full potential has not been achieved in any European city. \nCityChangerCargoBike (CCCB) aims to change this and increase and accelerate take-up. CCCB will take the very best cargo bike implementation examples, contexts and expertise in Europe and profit and learn from them in order to transfer these on a large scale and in the best way possible to new cities and contexts - in CCCB's forerunner cities, in the follower cities and beyond. \nCCCB is based on the huge potential of cargo bikes to replace: \n- 23 - 25% of the commercial deliveries in cities\n- 50% of the commercial service and maintenance trips\n- 77% of private logistics trips (shopping, leisure, child transport)\nFurther, cargo bikes bring with them a whole new bicycle culture: new fashonable multi-purpose cargo bike designs, cargo bike shops, new logistics concepts. Stationary cargo bikes can quickly be transformed to mobile street furniture and then even fulfil a place maker function. \n\nCCCB has the following objectives: \n- Raise awareness among the relevant stakeholders: public, private and commercial sector. \n- Utilise innovative tools for the take-up and scale-up and transfer between forerunner and follower cities: e.g. peer-to-peer exchange.\n- Establish favourable framework conditions for cargo bike use.\n- Achieve wide roll-out and transferability through Forerunner cities, Follower cities (within the consortium) and External follower cities.\n- Reduce congestion, emissions; increase safety; increase public space and improve public space usage.", 211111.0, 3412339.0, "CityChangerCargoBike", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_215999_916822176"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["4SQ", "Flowery Fields does Spanish", "Flowery Field Primary School", 18709.0, "Flowery Fields is a well above average sized three form entry primary school that has seen rapid growth over the last two years with pupil numbers increasing from 418 to 680. \r\n\r\nThe number of teachers and support staff has grown significantly also and many of these new staff require intensive language training.\r\n\r\nThe school is located in an area of significant disadvantage. The proportion of disabled pupils and those with special educational needs is above the national average. In some year groups it is much higher than average.\r\n\r\nThe character of the school has undergone a rapid change and our community boasts 18 home languages drawn from across Europe and the wider world. \r\n\r\nThe school has recently converted to Academy status and joined the Enquire Learning Trust, providing a renewed impetus to school improvement and development.\r\n\r\nWe have already taken part in a successful Erasmus+ project and the benefits to staff and pupils have been great. We now want to build on this achievement. We have continuously evaluated the outcomes of our project and have identified clear needs to build on our success and reflect the changing profile of our school.\r\n\r\nOur whole staff team; Governors, Heat teacher, teaching, support and finance staff, contributed to the successful execution of our last project, and will bring these skills to our second project.\r\n\r\nWe have many new staff members who know about our previous project and are keen to benefit from the opportunity to develop their professional profile and teaching skills.\r\n\r\nWe want to offer further opportunities to these staff and those who were unable to participate first time round to develop their skills in terms of language, cultural knowledge and understanding of how to successfully teach languages.\r\n\r\nThere is a great sense of enthusiasm and energy among our staff, and previous participants have continued to develop their Spanish in their own time. We need to allow them to further consolidate their learning, taking part in a higher level courses to further boost their progress. \r\n\r\nWe propose a two-year project involving the whole school which will lead to improvements in the teaching and learning of languages, embed of the international dimensional across the school, and contribute towards our ethos of celebrating languages and cultural diversity.\r\n\r\nOur new project would include 28 staff training mobilities in Spain. Courses have been carefully selected based on their ability to meet our school\u2019s needs. They involve a mix of intensive language learning, cultural activities, language teaching methodology and pedagogy, spending time in Spanish schools, networking and discussion sessions.\r\n\r\nBy involving all staff groups, we will continue to embed languages across the school to embed a truly whole school approach, permeating every aspect of our curriculum and school life.\r\n\r\nOur previous project had a huge impact on our school, our staff\u2019s confidence and our pupils\u2019 experience. As a result, we have improved teaching, increased intercultural knowledge, developed links with Spanish schools and passed on outcomes to colleagues within our school and network. We believe that it is essential that we continue to build on the success of the first project to sustain and further extend its impact.\r\n\r\nFrom our first project we have established robust communication, dissemination and evaluation processes and these will be maintained.\r\n\r\nIn our previous project all participants were involved in developing languages in the school, disseminating the knowledge and skills they have learned through the training programs and sharing best practice. Our MFL coordinator has developed a training programme to offer to schools within our cluster. This has been shared with other MFL coordinators through network and twilight training meetings, providing increased subject knowledge and access to resources. As a result of this work a local school is now teaching Spanish throughout their school. \r\n\r\nIn the long term, we will be able to evaluate the success of our project through working closely with our secondary school. They will receive our children into year seven and will give us feedback about children's attainment when they arrive. We envisage that their experience of learning Spanish in our school will lead to greater uptake of languages in secondary school and beyond.", "http://www.floweryfieldschool.org.uk", "Flowery Field Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035429_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SK14"}
