The volunteers will be fully integrated into the activities of the hosting organisation and will be given the opportunities to focus on elements that most interest them and to develop new skills, experiences and knowledge that will enhance their employability and personal professional development.\r\n\r\nVolunteers will be encouraged to bring ideas and opinions from their countries of residence to the UK to share with each other, to break down international barriers, as well as take new ideas back to input into their society, thereby creating a wider European Community.\r\n\r\nAlongside their project work, the volunteers will also attend common days each month where they can share their experiences and participate in workshops and training focusing on diversity, racism, xenophobia, migration and active citizenship. Through the common day activities, the volunteers shall obtain tools and knowledge that they then bring back into the communities they are volunteering in to actively promote diversity and create more welcoming and open minded communities in South Wales.
