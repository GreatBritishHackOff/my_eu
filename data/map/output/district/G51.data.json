The project will deploy Pre-commercial Procurement (PCP) to create step-change innovations in mobile patient ICTs in order to empower patients enabling patient-centric care, using mobile devices and converging interoperable platforms. No current or future market solution exists as it would require cooperation of health administrations and providers across multiple nations. The consortium consists of three procurers introducing the innovation into their territories, Catalonia, Scotland and Southern Denmark and three vendor independent non-profit associations gathering a significant broad range of organizations and enterprises.The project aims 1) to establish an agreed PCP process across Europe and 2) to use the developed PCP process to run a call for tenders for the development of mobile eHealth services. This service will include an app to coach patients with heart failures enabling education, motivation, remote monitoring and other functionalities, integrating and coordinating care provided by a hospital and the primary care physician. This app will be innovative, fully integrating the app in the regional public health systems and can be prescribed by GPs. These services will be implemented in open platform infrastructures that will make the app platform-agnostic, suitable to any smartphone and any participating operator. This will demand the collaboration of operators and software integrators to bid for the tender. The vendor associations will act as catalyst to encourage their member enterprises to participate in the bid fostering the development of open platforms and interoperable solutions, AQUAS will assess the clinical adequacy, while the three procuring authorities will contribute with solid knowledge of innovative clinical paths and their strategic plans.", 472448.0, 2958712.0, "UNWIRED Health", null, null, null, null, "http://www.nhs24.com", null, "fp7_189009_961006452"], ["1HD", "A wireless network with autonomously powered and active long range acoustic nodes for total structural health monitoring of bridges", "International Design Engineering and Services Limited", "Wireless sensor networks have been identified as a research priority by the European Technology Platform on Smart Systems Integration (EPoSS). Recognising this, the SME's in this Project are seeking EC funding to develop a prototype wide-area wireless sensor network with autonomous nodes containing non-destructive (NDT) sensors, for structural health monitoring (SHM) of large structures, specifically bridges and vessels in petrochemical plant. They have formed a consortium with expertise in a range of technologies needed to optimise solutions and develop this innovative new product.\nThe aim is to develop an NDT node that is autonomous and self-configuring for optimal performance, and requires no maintenance over its operating life. The nodes will be packaged for reliable operation in hazardous environments and will rely on energy harvesting to provide long-term power supply. The wireless communications will allow simple place-and-play usability. The NDT techniques to be implemented are long range ultrasonics for global monitoring of a structure, ACFM for local surface corrosion and cracks, pulse-echo ultrasonics for internal corrosion and tip diffraction ultrasonics for internal cracks.

When these bridges age, however, they become more dangerous as corrosion and cracks make their appearance, requiring constant monitoring and maintenance. Developing new wireless technologies may facilitate the task of monitoring significantly and could help prevent disasters that arise from collapsing bridges.\n\nThis was the aim of the EU-funded project 'A wireless network with long range acoustic nodes for total structural health monitoring of bridges' (http://www.wi-health.eu (WI-HEALTH)) . The project worked on replacing periodic inspections with ongoing monitoring through a permanent network of sensors. Such a system is much lighter and more energy efficient than existing solutions for monitoring the health of such structures.\n\nMore specifically, WI-HEALTH developed wireless networks that combine long-range ultrasonic and acoustic emission monitoring in autonomously powered nodes to detect bridge defects such as in welded plate structures. It also developed software to drive the structural health monitoring system to identify defects using advanced trend analysis and data processing. Further work involved studying sensor operation, wireless communication systems and renewable energy power options.\n\nAfter intensive field trials, the project team demonstrated that the system is much more efficient and sensitive than other technologies, showing that defects less than 6\u00a0mm deep can be reliably detected.

In theory, we know very well how we should prevent, detect and mitigate domestic violence. However in daily practice this is often not taken into account. Also, there is less research on the factors that escalate family and partner conflict into high impact domestic violence. IMPRODOVA will focus on the police side of the gap between what we know and what we do, but will also include the aspect of police co-operation with other first responders. Why, in practical police work, is domestic violence often regarded as a low priority problem? Why is the reporting rate by victims low? What are the human factors that define effective response and best practice police work in networks of other first line responders, e.g. health practitioners, schools, and youth services?\nPolice frontline responder interviews expanded by fieldwork observation data will be weighed against intermediate and top police leadership expertise collected in the partner LEA's. The influence of human factor variables in frontline operations will be investigated, and the parameters of risk assessment, also of medical practitioners, will be established and compared. Training and study materials with a special focus on scenario-based learning modules will be designed to address the barriers to better domestic violence policing. IMPRODOVA will reach out across the boundaries of first and other relevant responders by disseminating the field research findings to other professionals and representatives of domestic violence prevention and mitigation.

In particular, we will include recent work on domain adaptation, translation into morphological rich languages, terminology management, and semantically enhanced machine translation to build reliable machine translation for the health domain.

These forms of advanced content will also be used to link archaeological objects stored off-site in museums with their original site context, by allowing visitors to experience and virtually interact with the object directly on site.
