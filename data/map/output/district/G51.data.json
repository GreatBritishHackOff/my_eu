No current or future market solution exists as it would require cooperation of health administrations and providers across multiple nations. The consortium consists of three procurers introducing the innovation into their territories, Catalonia, Scotland and Southern Denmark and three vendor independent non-profit associations gathering a significant broad range of organizations and enterprises.The project aims 1) to establish an agreed PCP process across Europe and 2) to use the developed PCP process to run a call for tenders for the development of mobile eHealth services. This service will include an app to coach patients with heart failures enabling education, motivation, remote monitoring and other functionalities, integrating and coordinating care provided by a hospital and the primary care physician. This app will be innovative, fully integrating the app in the regional public health systems and can be prescribed by GPs. These services will be implemented in open platform infrastructures that will make the app platform-agnostic, suitable to any smartphone and any participating operator. This will demand the collaboration of operators and software integrators to bid for the tender.

The project worked on replacing periodic inspections with ongoing monitoring through a permanent network of sensors. Such a system is much lighter and more energy efficient than existing solutions for monitoring the health of such structures.\n\nMore specifically, WI-HEALTH developed wireless networks that combine long-range ultrasonic and acoustic emission monitoring in autonomously powered nodes to detect bridge defects such as in welded plate structures. It also developed software to drive the structural health monitoring system to identify defects using advanced trend analysis and data processing. Further work involved studying sensor operation, wireless communication systems and renewable energy power options.\n\nAfter intensive field trials, the project team demonstrated that the system is much more efficient and sensitive than other technologies, showing that defects less than 6\u00a0mm deep can be reliably detected.

Adjuvant staff, many of whom are ex-Scottish FA education and mobility employees, are now involved in the delivery, assessment and management of circa 250 Modern Apprentices employed by the Scottish professional football clubs who are undertaking the SVQ Level 3 qualification, Achieving Excellence in Sports Performance.\r\n\r\nFor those intent on a career in professional football, the path starts at the age of 16, when clubs offer apprenticeships to their most promising young players. Although aspects of the two-year training programme have changed significantly, the goal remains the same: a professional contract.\r\n\r\nHowever, the statistics are damning. The Premier League and Football League advise that between 60% and 65% of the 700 or so apprentices taken on each year are rejected at 18. Even half of those who do win a full-time contract will not be playing at a professional level by 21 years of age (source: PFA). Effectively, this means that five out of every six players who start an apprenticeship will not be playing football for a living five years later.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation reports published by a number of organisations (Scottish FA, Celtic FC, Aberdeen FC) have unequivocally shown that participation by young apprentice players in a European mobility programme can boost their chances of being offered a professional contract. Celtic and Aberdeen FC have reported that almost 30% of mobility participants subsequently went on to play first team football \u2013 an unprecedented success rate. This recent (2015) club data confirms that European mobility undertaken by apprentice players can profoundly affect their chances of becoming professional footballers. Both of these clubs went on to report that mobility also had a marked effect in boosting employment rates in other industries for those mobility participants who were not offered a professional contract. Consequently, the anticipated  impact of this mobility project will be to significantly increase the skill sets of the mobility participants which will improve their prospects of being offered employment as a professional player on completion of their apprenticeship. Those participants who are not offered a professional contract will benefit from increased employability in alternative career pathways due to the transferable and interpersonal skills acquired as a direct result of their mobility experience.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this mobility project will be to provide a work experience abroad that not only enriches apprentices\u2018 professional and academic lives, but will also promote openness, adaptability and flexibility, and enhance language learning, intercultural skills, self-reliance and self-awareness.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal objectives of this project is to use the competencies and life skills acquired through mobility to enhance the future employability of participants, whether that be as a professional football player or an alternative career path.

Research suggests that a police service that ethnically reflects the community that it serves can convey a sense of equity to the public; especially to minority communities themselves.   Without such representation we risk community conflict and tensions arising from actions and policies perceived to be discriminatory on the basis of ethnicity.

This will all be coordinated through our International team.\r\n\r\nIt is expected the project will benefit volunteers, partners and beneficiaries. Through unique intercultural experience, volunteers will learn about the beneficiaries, new cultures, reflect upon social changes that will impact them, gain new skills, knowledge and experience, improve their personal pathways, be inspired to continue volunteering and make a difference in communities and maintain links in the UK. Receiving Organisations will benefit as volunteers bring cultural diversity, interests and skills, enabling them to encourage beneficiaries to become more informed and aware. Sending Organisations will meet their objectives of sending volunteers to a different country to have intercultural experience. Beneficiaries will become more aware of community cohesion through being inspired to take an active part in their communities and accessing social, leisure, educational and outdoor activities.
