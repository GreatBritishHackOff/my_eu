Entrepreneurship meant as a basic skill is the leit motif of our strategic plan and it will be the goal of the whole plan of activities. Other objectives are:\r\n- offering quality and variety to our teaching offer; offering job opportunities; orienteering to career; improving a sense of European and global identity; promoting innovation at school; improving linguistic competences to overcome linguistic and cultural borders; promoting mobility in Europe and in the world and allow success into the more and more fast-moving and demanding job market   \r\n- creating an updated learning environment to enable self-discovery and fulfilment, to create interest and awareness implementing CLIL methodologies; implementing a EU dimension in the school curricola and of the credit transfer system like  ECVET e EUROPASS\r\n- developing competences and skills in using new media in students and staff to fill in the gap between the teachers' and the digital natives' worlds, by creating a common language; facilitating learning with diversified paths, overcoming borders and obstacles.\r\nAccording to the VET Mobility Chart, the number of  beneficiaries will be 60 students attending the 4-5 class (catering, tourism, administration and marketing) and recent graduates of our school. The group includes disables, disadvantaged students and with learning difficulties. First learners will improve their competences in foreign language used abroad and will attend a pedagogic/professional training; after they will do a 4-week work placement to develop their field competences with a focus on fusion food and catering/tourism trends and social marketing. We will take advantage of ErasmusPro to offer 3-month mobilities to 2 recent graduates to give added value, develop job specific skills thus boosting their employability.   \r\nGiven the large number of mobilities, they will be no more restricted to excellence but offered in a systematic way to all students with good behaviour, increasing motivation and promoting school success as planned in our school mission. Our school will gain an international dimension and will convey good practises in the area. \r\nStudents will be accompanied by 1teacher given the large number of minors and disadvantaged students+ 1 extra for fluxes with  students with special needs.  \r\nThe staff mobilities will be 25 (management and school staff) to offer wider opportunities to develop competences, overcome disaffection and spread passion for teaching. The mobilities will be concentrated on jobshadowing, workshops, courses about foreign languages,  new teaching tecHniques, CLIL and exchange of good practises.\r\nOn the return, the students will organise an event to put into practise the new skills gained: the cooking team will prepare fusion dishes, the bar/service team will serve fusion cocktails and arrange new setting up,  the hospitality team will think about a suitable welcoming while the marketing staff will plan a marketing campaign to launch the event on the social media. The guests will be local authorities and representatives of local associations to give visibility to the project. The staff  will spread the new methodologies learnt in their department and in the whole school and will put into practice their new skills in their classes. Everybody will  update learning paths and will spread an international dimension at school, a dynamic, motivating climate to get success and personal fulfilment\r\nAccording to the internationalisation process, the network has been reinforced: we have chosen to keep the partners we trust and that are located in strategic markets  as well as to keep the prestigious cooperation we have with overseas partners, especially due to the project topic. We have added 3 prestigious partners: a 5-star hotel a London icon, a starred restaurant in Copenaghen and a refined restaurant in the heart of London.\r\nIndeed we believe that training should be opened to an international market to mirror the multicultural, global composition of our society. These partners give added value to our project and will let learners widen opportunities and perspectives and will offer unique trainings in destinations that are among the top-world and in luxury accommodation like the 5-star holiday resort in Turks and Caicos and Lagham Hotel.  Besides they will allow job shadowing, exchange of good practise to the staff with high quality schools/companies in the world.  The mobilities will be at some partners but all the network will cooperate in the project's dissemination and success.\r\nWe will offer mobilities in the various foreign languages studied in our school.", "http://www.locandaottoemezzo.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA116-006642_1"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["7EP", "FILM REPUBLIC SALES LTD", 5033.0, "MEDIA -programme \u2014 Operating transnationally and internationally and promoting transnational circulation and mobility (09.05.01)", "fts_2017_28586", 2017], ["5HN", "THE LOKAHI FOUNDATION LBG*", 324022.0, "Cooperation with third countries to advance and promote Union and mutual interests (19.05.01)", "fts_2017_34349", 2017], ["6AB", "EVOLVED EVENTS LTD", 24734.0, "Communication of the Commission Representations, Citizens\u2019 Dialogues and \u2018Partnership\u2019 actions (16.03.01.04)", "fts_2017_63867", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "W8"}
