Glottalization ceases or modifies phonation by compressing the vocal folds. In German, an abrupt glottalized onset to phonation is frequent in front of word-initial vowels. In English this is less frequent and more likely to occur at phrase boundaries. The interplay between external-sandhi and glottalization is not clear: glottalizations are supposed to take place in absence of external sandhi, but articulatory gestures related to both phenomena can co-occur.\nI will build on my previous work on glottalizations, which showed the extent to which word boundary glottalization is transferred in language learning and actively used in perception. External sandhi, which is more common in English, can be \u201cblocked\u201d by glottalization: so English-accented German will be compared to English. Acoustic analysis will be accompanied by articulatory analysis in order to detect a possible co-occurrence of both phenomena. Perception experiments with manipulated speech will be carried out with native English and German listeners, to test the influence of glottalization and of external sandhi on word recognition and on the perception of phrase boundaries.\nThis is the first extensive investigation of the interplay between external sandhi and glottalization in relationship with prosodic boundaries by means of articulatory, acoustic and perceptual analysis.", 168179.0, 168179.0, "TRASANGLOTT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.qmu.ac.uk", null, "fp7_187763_986460416"], ["6UU", "Innovative Social and Employment Policies for Inclusive and Resilient Labour Markets in Europe", "Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh", "The INSPIRES project aims to contribute to resilient and inclusive labour markets in Europe.

In order to do so, it analyzes in-depth the evolution of labour markets policies, employment policies and social policies.

This report gives an analysis and assessment of labour market resilience in 29 European countries. Objective data and regression analyses assessed national differences in responses to the financial crisis both between and within countries for the different vulnerable groups.\n\nThe report sheds light onto cross-country differences in the labour market resilience of the total population and offers insight into the different vulnerable groups in Europe. Many factors contribute to labour market resilience. These factors change over time and vary across the different vulnerable groups. Another discovery from the research is that youth and migrants were the most vulnerable groups across Europe in the aftermath of the recent crisis, both in terms of the highest increases in unemployment rates and the risk of poverty and social exclusion.\n\nNine country reports have been finalised, the final 2 are due in month\u00a020. The most important dissemination activity in the first reporting period has been the creation of the INSPIRES website and the creation of a dissemination plan.

The primary goal is to foster the personal development and social skills of all students and to increase their self-confidence by overcoming language barriers or insecurity through teamwork and mutual support. The long-term goal is also an increase in intercultural and foreign language skills, an important prerequisite for peaceful coexistence and future work in Europe. In addition, the trainees and vocational students gain an insight into the professional life of another European country, which increases their future career opportunities.\r\nVocational mobility in Europe and intercultural experience in the service sector in connection with the training and practice of social skills due to the teambuilding of higher-performing and weaker students offers young people the opportunity to gain experience abroad. It also lays the basis for a lifelong willingness to learn in an international context. At the same time, the chance of obtaining a school degree as well as the successful participation in professional and social life should increase for all pupils participating in the project. The project strategy is thus closely linked to the fields of action agreed as part of the qualification initiative for Germany \"Advancement through Education\". The stay abroad should strengthen the responsibility for one's own learning processes and encourage professional development as well as personal development. Moreover, improvement of linguistic and communicative ability, but also of \"soft skills\" such as empathy, teamwork, leadership and dedication, will benefit the participants in their further professional career and private life.\r\nThe selection of students who are interested in the project takes place via the successful participation in a mandatory working group \"Professional English\". By means of a coordinated, individualized learning plan focusing on vocational training as well as concentration on the development of individual strengths and differentiated performance feedbacks the educational success of pupils of different talents is promoted by a teaching, which does justice to the heterogeneity of the student body. During this process, the participants get to know each other and with the help of the teacher, the tandems of higher- and lower-performing students are formed.\r\nThe project is aimed at vocational students (catering, hospitality, hairdressing, nutrition, education and health). It is designed to enhance the competences of trainees and vocational students by practising a European foreign language in a professional context and by experiencing interculturality whilst being introduced to vocational training in both countries. \r\nDue to the support offered through the tandems, lower performing apprentices or students who might not have thought about a practical experience abroad are motivated to participate in this project and learn to expand their professional and foreign language skills as well as their self-confidence. \r\nAt the same time, teachers participating in this mobility project will be trained as multipliers to bring newly acquired professional knowledge and acquired foreign language skills into our school life. This serves the intercultural exchange in the education system or the internationalization of the vocational training at the Alice-Salomon Vocational College in accordance with the European Development Plan. A long-term goal is the implementation of a professional bilingual teaching (CLIL) in all vocational subjects at the Alice-Salomon Vocational College as well as the establishment of a long-term partnership or the establishment of an exchange program with Edinburgh College for further professionalization.\r\nThis project has an impact -beyond the Alice-Salomon Vocational College- on the surrounding cities of the region. This was demonstrated by the positive response of chambers, guilds and employers in the field of hospitality and health care to whom this project was introduced. With the help of this project they hope to increase the attractiveness of the professions in the service and health care sector and gain access to qualified trainees with pronounced social and professional competences. The \u201cRuhrgebiet\u201d and Bochum in particular, which are undergoing structural changes, can only profit from this project which could be used to strengthen and support the successful management and outcome of qualified students and trainees.", "http://www.confluencescotland.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004884_1"], ["6UU", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "QUEEN MARGARET UNIVERSITY, EDINBURGH", 31808.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.qmu.ac.uk", "QUEEN MARGARET UNIVERSITY, EDINBURGH", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-046963_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EH21"}
