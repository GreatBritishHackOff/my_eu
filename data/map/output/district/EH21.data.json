Glottalization ceases or modifies phonation by compressing the vocal folds. In German, an abrupt glottalized onset to phonation is frequent in front of word-initial vowels. In English this is less frequent and more likely to occur at phrase boundaries. The interplay between external-sandhi and glottalization is not clear: glottalizations are supposed to take place in absence of external sandhi, but articulatory gestures related to both phenomena can co-occur.\nI will build on my previous work on glottalizations, which showed the extent to which word boundary glottalization is transferred in language learning and actively used in perception. External sandhi, which is more common in English, can be \u201cblocked\u201d by glottalization: so English-accented German will be compared to English. Acoustic analysis will be accompanied by articulatory analysis in order to detect a possible co-occurrence of both phenomena. Perception experiments with manipulated speech will be carried out with native English and German listeners, to test the influence of glottalization and of external sandhi on word recognition and on the perception of phrase boundaries.\nThis is the first extensive investigation of the interplay between external sandhi and glottalization in relationship with prosodic boundaries by means of articulatory, acoustic and perceptual analysis.", 168179.0, 168179.0, "TRASANGLOTT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.qmu.ac.uk", null, "fp7_187763_986460416"], ["6UU", "Innovative Social and Employment Policies for Inclusive and Resilient Labour Markets in Europe", "Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh", "The INSPIRES project aims to contribute to resilient and inclusive labour markets in Europe. It comparatively assesses the resilience and inclusiveness of labour markets in European countries, it identifies innovative policies that have contributed to resilience and inclusiveness and it analyzes strategies of policy learning that facilitate the development and transfer of these innovations within and across European nation states. In order to do so, it analyzes in-depth the evolution of labour markets policies, employment policies and social policies. Moreover, it qualitatively and quantitatively assesses the labour market position of vulnerable groups from 2000 onwards. INSPIRES covers eleven countries from all European welfare traditions: Mediterranean, Eastern-European, Anglo-Saxon, Scandinavian and the continental regimes. The consortium consists of a multidisciplinary team of leading European scholars that focus on the labour market, employment issues and social policies.\nThe INSPIRES project aims to accumulate practice-oriented knowledge on the factors that positively and negatively affect resilience and inclusiveness. It seeks to explain differences within and between countries, and within and between the labour market positions of different vulnerable groups on the labour market. INSPIRES intends to isolate the impact of national policies from the structural demographic, social and economic characteristics on labour market resilience. Building upon this analysis, it tries to identify processes of policy learning and innovation that occur in the interactions between policy makers, politicians, non-profit organizations, trade unions, business associations and other stakeholders at the European, national and regional level.

This report gives an analysis and assessment of labour market resilience in 29 European countries. Objective data and regression analyses assessed national differences in responses to the financial crisis both between and within countries for the different vulnerable groups.\n\nThe report sheds light onto cross-country differences in the labour market resilience of the total population and offers insight into the different vulnerable groups in Europe. Many factors contribute to labour market resilience. These factors change over time and vary across the different vulnerable groups. Another discovery from the research is that youth and migrants were the most vulnerable groups across Europe in the aftermath of the recent crisis, both in terms of the highest increases in unemployment rates and the risk of poverty and social exclusion.\n\nNine country reports have been finalised, the final 2 are due in month\u00a020. The most important dissemination activity in the first reporting period has been the creation of the INSPIRES website and the creation of a dissemination plan. In the next stages of the project, INSPIRES will identify which policies and institutional conditions play a role in the explanation of these differences.\n\nBuilding on the completed research, the project continues by identifying the processes of policy learning and innovation. Interactions between policymakers, politicians, non-profit organisations, trade unions, business associations and other stakeholders at the European, national and regional levels are the next focus.
