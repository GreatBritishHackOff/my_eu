This section includes students from the first and final level of the \"Professionnal Baccalaur\u00e9at\". It counts twelve students per level and to five or six students not belonging to the european section. The project was built around the idea of European citizenship, from the professional field in order to allow the students to improve their linguistic and professionnal skills and to initiate the participants to a professional mobility in Europe. \r\nThe goals of this project are clear and with precise results. \r\n-The \"Professional Baccalaur\u00e9at\" with the specific European mention will allow students of this section to be able to adapt to the international labour market and will contribute to the integration of the students in the professional fields linked with tourism and with international commercial activities in the \u00cele-de-France area (EuroDisneyland Paris resort, Val d'Europe and Aeroville shopping centres and Paris particularly attractive to foreign customers).\r\n-This project will allow  students to improve the english language enriching the professional english language particularly linked to their courses. \r\n-The students wil be able to develop and experience their capacity to adapt themselves in a foreign and new environment and to improve their self-esteem. \r\n-This program will incite students' curiosity and will provide them the possibility to improve their capacity to exchange and communicate with local participants such as people in the professional workplace and with their host families. \r\n-To promote the European section getting Europass diplomas via Mobility Tool and mobilities outside the European section. \r\n-The students will truly be able to experience and practice their roles as European citizens. \r\nThe mobility of the students will be organised and supervised by TESTENGLISH which has a lot of reliable experience in this field. The students will be placed in different companies and they will be welcomed by host families in Galway in Ireland in 2018 and 2019. \r\nThis project has started in 2012 and has included main activities connected with the highlight being the mobility of the participants at the heart of a foreign country. \r\nThe results will be evaluated quantitatively using official evaluation rubriques. Upon their return the students will be qualitatively evaluated by the specific European exam and the \"Professional Baccalaur\u00e9at\" and with the results  of the final evaluation given by the partners. \r\nThis project will help the students to continue to a higher level of education and it will allow them to integrate better on a professional level. Finally the project will be promoted through different activities such as : exhibitions and other functions.", "http://www.testenglish.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-035626_3"], ["4HT", "La mobilit\u00e9 dans l'Union Europ\u00e9enne dans le cursus de Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel:  un enrichissement culturel et professionnel.", "TESTENGLISH LDT", 5585.0, "Camille Claudel vocational high school located in Mantes la Ville, in the Ile de France region welcomes over 900 students and adults in initial and continuing education in the fields of hotel and catering, sales and trade, administrative services and personal assistance services.\r\n\r\nWe have been involved in European projects for more than 15 years as  we want to offer our students  a valuable training programme through English and Spanish European sections. Based on requests from local professionals, there is an obvious need to train young people able to meet their expectations in terms of professional and linguistics skills. This training programme allows to introduce a European dimension to their training through cultural and eductional projects.\r\n\r\nThe language modules paired with a tailored vocational training allow each student  to  develop linguistics skills and acquire a know-how which can be put on use both locally and internationally.\r\n\r\nOur ambition is to support and help motivated sudents who are often former drop-outs and from underprivileged backgrounds. We want to make them progress by offering them a tailored programme and a complete preparation for their mobility abroad. The courses provided are adapted and can be in a form of role-plays based on a professional context, a cultural immersion through various projects and actions ( The European Week, conferences, English theatre groups, theme dinners, etc) as well as a linguistic reinforcement to ease their integration within their host family abroad and to enable them to be self reliant once there. \r\n\r\nThe issues of this mobility programme are to strengthen the students\u2019self confidence, to  open them to a European and citizenship dimension, to make them independent, as well as to improve their professional and linguistics skills. \r\n\r\nMore specifically regarding the mobility itself, we expect from the students to fully commit themselves in their company as well as within their host family. These objectives are regularly followed up by the student, the on-site service provider, the company supervisor, and the French teacher. \r\n\r\nAs regards the project final aim, we expect from the students to validate their acquisition of skills by obtaining the European degree of the \u00ab Baccalaur\u00e9at \u00bb\r\n\r\nWe offer 41 students the opportunity to do an internship abroad either in Ireland or Spain which can be for them a powerful professional lever or an encouragement to go abroad and find job.\r\nMoving abroad for some or continuing their studies for others. All these European-oriented projects  contribute to give added value to the work done by the students and the participants during the mobility, to develop partnerships with institutions and convey a dynamic image of the school.", "http://www.testenglish.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036175_2"], ["4HT", "La consommation et la citoyennet\u00e9 dans les pays europ\u00e9ens de la mobilit\u00e9", "TESTENGLISH LDT", 16270.0, "TRADUCTION ANGLAIS\r\nProject Background:\r\n\r\nThe orientation of our vocational high school towards trade in a broad way, meets the demands of our labour pool employers for whom the knowledge of professional and cultural practices as well as the proficiency of a foreign language are real assets, given the ever-increasing number of customers and foreign users.\r\nCompanies are looking for professionals, whether they are sedentary or itinerant sellers or reception agents, who are able to welcome and advise clients, to develop a customer base and build loyalty with demanding customers. Our students have a low level of proficiency in languages, and even if they are trained in professional skills, they are not prepared for this transnational evolution. They are concerned about dealing in an unknown environment that will require them to adapt to the new situations.\r\n\r\nOur objectives:\r\n- Have our young Europeans follow a training course in a European Union country as part of their school curriculum;\r\n- Motivate our students, give them confidence and make them aware of the need to plan positively for the future;\r\n- Make the European citizenship concept grow in our young\u2019s mind;\r\n- Develop: knowledge (for passing the exam), skills and know-how (for successful integration into working life) and existential competences (for a smooth adaptation to social life).\r\n- Encourage exchanges and build a network of partners with businesses and schools;\r\n- Encourage further studies for our students in Europe;\r\n- Improve our students\u2019 employability.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of the participants:\r\n\r\n- 21 students from European section: a group of 5 students targeting Spain, a group of 4 targeting Portugal and a group of 12 students targeting English-speaking countries. Our specificity is to unite, in a single section, students preparing the 3 BTEC offered in our educational institution: Sales, Retail and Customers Relationship, that\u2019s why we set up cross-cutting projects.\r\n\r\nDescription of the activities:\r\n\r\nOur activities are spread throughout the total duration of the project:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Professional activities:\r\n- IN A EUROPEAN CONTEXT:\r\n- Introduce oneself; find out more about companies and their trade environment; characterize the customer reception procedures.\r\n- Welcome the clients and provide customer care, inform, advise, direct, and find out the needs of the client. Present a commercial offer; close the sale and make the customer want to come back .\r\n- Study a brand trade policy; identify recruiting procedures in Europe; applyfor a job, attend job interviews,  report on one\u2019s mobility abroad.\r\n- Study consumer\u2019s rights in the relevant European countries and the European institutions\r\n- Understand the concept and the impact of citizenship\r\n\u2022 Cultural activities:\r\n- Visit:\u201cla Maison Jean Monnet\u201d; theatrical play in English; eTwinning projects;  the Immigration Museum visit.\r\n- Study of the European institutions (visit of the European Parliament); the Europe Day Celebration; participation in the European Youth Parliament activities.\r\n- Cultural visits during the mobility.\r\n\r\nThe activities carried out enable to raise the student\u2019s awareness of the professional environment in a European context. In addition, cultural activities help to raise awareness of the European citizenship concept and develop their citizenship spirit at a European level. We have also chosen, in agreement with the education inspector, to make our students work on a topic directly related to the diplomas prepared and common denominator of the 3 BTEC frames of reference:  THE RIGHT OF CONSUMERS AND THE CITIZENSHIP in Spain,UK,Portugal and France.\r\nAll activities are managed with the assistance of the entire educational team (teachers and administrative staff) to develop common progressions and overall consistency in their implementation.\r\nImpact and expected results:\r\nThis project will allow students to discover that business practices are based on customs and lifestyles that differ according to countries. Mastering these cultural and professional aspects and foreign languages is not only the guarantee of a better professional insertion but also constitutes an additional factor to exam success. To encourage and motivate foreign language learning is a factor of employability and a way to fight against discrimination within the higher education curriculum. For our targeted public, the importance of developing this learning motivation through linguistic strengthening and cultural outings thus makes sense. Our goal is to create a network in order to create ties with other schools and companies to develop common work projects.\r\nPotential long-term benefits:\r\n- Sustainable transnational partnerships\r\n- Hiring from partner companies\r\n- Further studies abroad with partner institutions", "http://www.testenglish.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036614_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "GY1"}
