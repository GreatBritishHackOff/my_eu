Everything fits into the economic crisis coming out context that will shoot up the labor market demand and the specific skills required by employers.\r\n\r\nConsortium\u2019s schools are facing two major risks of the labor market:\r\n- The skill-mismatch between specific and transversal competencies of students that are coming out from the scholar training and labor market demanded skills\r\n- The mismatch between the demand and offer of occupation in the administrative and commercial sector.\r\n\r\nConsidering these criticalities, this consortium has defined the following objectives:\r\n- Strengthening student\u2019s motivation and orientation into labor market, through internships abroad;\r\n- Develop the recognition and validation of learners' Learning Outcomes with ECVET;\r\n- Projecting to the foreign, territorial limits of carrying out the training programs, in order to improve school-work combination\u2019s capacity and skills, as the recent Law 107/2015;\r\n- Promote students\u2019 personal growth through discussion and widening of cultural horizons, social and human rights;\r\n- Strengthen linguistic and multicultural skills of learners;\r\n- Provide a European awareness and education to internationalization to students and school staff;\r\n- Expanding labor market\u2019s knowledge, through a varied awareness, diverse and transnational;\r\n- Enhancing training quality, by identifying an inner linguistic competencies development plan, to include in training programs;\r\n- To develop, considering the large number of the consortium, a collective consciousness on practical work placements abroad, involving local and international companies, civil society, policy makers and public bodies;\r\n- Improve the ability to ensure internships abroad in a cohesive and efficient manner, sharing good practices, creating a complementary skills and contacts system, centralizing services related to the organization and management of mobility;\r\n- Strengthen transnational relations numbers and quality of this consortium, developing new contacts and new opportunities for cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe project will last 17 months (from 01/09 / 20167al 31/01/2019) and includes two activities:\r\n1) Mobility of 80 students and 15 teachers per placement abroad, divided into five flows of 1 month each.\r\n2) Mobility of 20 Neo-graduates for internship abroad divided into four flows of three months each.\r\nAmong the students will be included at least 24 (30%) students with fewer opportunities and 10 students with special needs (DSA and BES).\r\n\r\nThe mobility will be organized in three periods (May 2018, June / July 2018 and September 2018). In the first two periods there will be two flows of students for each of them, in the last period there will be the mobility of the last flow of students and 4 flows of Neo-graduates.\r\nMobility\u2019s results will have an impact on a wide actors category:\r\n- Students, that will improve their transversal and professional competencies and will be more competitive on labor\u2019s market.\r\n- Staff, which will improve their competencies, being active member of school modernization, improving the didactics and finding new job\u2019s motivation;\r\n- Schools, which will modernize and internationalize their traing offer and will increase their validation and appeal.\r\n- Firms, which will satisfy their demand in terms of number and competencies.\r\n- Indirect beneficiaries, with dissemination activity, which will benefit by peers experience\r\n- Other stakeholders, that will benefit of new consortium competencies in terms of new relations and future projects.", "http://www.athwalresourcing.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005919_10"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WV5"}
