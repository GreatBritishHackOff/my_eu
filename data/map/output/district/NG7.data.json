ACP can improve current and future health care decision making, provide patients with a sense of control, increase adequate symptom control and improve quality of life.\nThis project aims to study the effects of formalized ACP on symptom burden and quality of life of patients with advanced cancer. In a phase III multicentre cluster randomized controlled trial at least 20 hospitals in 6 countries will be randomized to provide patients with advanced cancer with either ACP or \u2018care as usual\u2019. 1334 patients diagnosed with lung or stage IV colorectal cancer will be included. Patients will fill in questionnaires at inclusion, and at 2.5 and 4.5 months post-inclusion. A relative will fill in a questionnaire after the patient\u2019s death. Use of medical care will be assessed through medical files. Primary endpoints are quality of life (QLQ-C30 emotional functioning) and symptoms at 2.5 months post-inclusion. Secondary endpoints are the extent to which care as received was in line with patients\u2019 preferences, patients\u2019 evaluation of the decision making process, quality of dying and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Our project will assess the impact of ACP on quality of life, and contribute to improving comfort and quality of care for patients with advanced cancer.'", 315999.0, 5009783.0, "ACTION", null, null, null, "http://www.action-acp.eu/", "http://www.nottingham.ac.uk", null, "fp7_109469_999976978"], ["2RD", "GNSS for Global Environmental Earth Observation (GEEO) and GEOSS", "The University of Nottingham", "In the next future, the number of GNSS will drastically increase.

They focus the players' attention on the real world around them as much as on the digital world of the game, aiming to create a powerful juxtaposition of the two.Although location-based gaming is an industry on the verge of explosive growth, the creation and deployment of such experiences, especially those involving multiple participants, is simply out of reach for the vast majority of creative industries and authors because of the blend of many cutting-edge technologies they require, their hard to master limitations, and the complex gaming concepts they employ.The first objective of MAGELLAN is to deliver an unprecedented authoring environment based on visual authoring principles in order to enable non-programmers, as well as more advanced users, to cost-effectively author and publish multi-participant location-based experiences. The second objective is to deliver a scalable web platform featuring social networking means and supporting the publication, browsing and execution of a massive number of such experiences. Finally, MAGELLAN will produce a series of guides for authors of location-based experiences that will constitute a reference for interested people as well as a foundational document for future research in the field.To achieve this, MAGELLAN will adopt a holistic approach integrating interdisciplinary research involving a complementary group of world-class experts from multiple scientific and technological domains.

Transposons are promising tools in synthetic biology and gene therapy applications. The amount of DNA a transposon can carry is in principal unlimited. However, in practice, when transposon length is increased, for example by the addition of a therapeutic transgene, its ability to transpose is reduced. This phenomenon is known as 'length dependence' and limits the efficiency of transposons in gene delivery applications.\nAlthough length-dependence is a well documented phenomenon, the causes have not been investigated and remain unclear. We believe that the first step in combating the problem is to understand the underlying causes. We have therefore designed biochemical and genetic assays that will reveal the stage(s) of the transposition reaction at which length-dependence operates. The assays will be used to test those transposons that are currently under the most intensive development as tools in eukaryotic systems.\nSome of these transposons are reported to be substantially free of length-dependence. Our assays will confirm if this is true, and if so whether this 'immunity' is a property of the respective transposases, of the DNA sequences, or due to the binding of host proteins.\nOne of the attractive features of transposons as gene delivery vectors is that there are a lot to choose from, and different elements will have different advantages and disadvantages with different transgenes in different applications.

The number of PTWs on European roads has more than doubled over the last two decades. The recent MAIDS (Motorcycle Accident In-Depth Study) study of PTW crashes in Europe found that behavioural and ergonomic issues were major contributing factors to PTW crashes: the primary accident cause for PTW crashes was the failure of drivers to perceive two-wheelers; and human error was a major contributing factor to most crashes, for both PTW and car drivers. The majority of PTW crashes involved a collision with a car. Many large-scale research programs have been undertaken to understand the behavioural and ergonomic factors that contribute to crashes involving 4-wheeled vehicles. These have been effective in informing countermeasure development, which has led to significant reductions in crashes. To our knowledge, no comparable human factors and behavioural research programs have been initiated in the PTW domain, in Europe or elsewhere.

The project analysed nine of these to identify factors that lead to crashes, including road surface conditions, roadway design and amount of rainfall.\n\nPrincipally, the project gathered data to conduct sophisticated studies on PTW safety, developing a database of events that would eventually produce meaningful results based on naturalistic riding methodology. It also examined riders' perception of risk, as well as their acceptance of new safety technologies.\n\nThe tools and results developed by the project team have been disseminated on the project website and to interested parties through newsletters, journal articles, leaflets, conferences and workshops.

An estimated 15 million individuals are living with HCV infection within the EU. The economic, health and societal costs of chronic HCV infection are significant. HCV is the principal cause of death from liver disease and the leading indication for liver transplantation. The only treatment for end-stage liver disease is a liver transplant, yet the transplanted liver becomes rapidly re-infected and is frequently destroyed within 5 years after transplantation.  In this cohort of patients current antiviral treatments are too toxic - there is an urgent need to develop safe and effective treatments for use in this setting. Human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that target virus entry, are as yet an underutilised and potentially highly effective and safe weapon in the armoury against HCV infection. The consortium has identified MAb leads which, in pre-clinical analyses, potently block HCV infection.  HCV exhibits a high degree of genetic and antigenic variability, which enables the virus to escape protective immune responses. Crucially, the lead antibodies identified by the consortium are capable of preventing infection by a wide range of genetically distinct isolates because they target highly conserved epitopes on the virus or host receptor molecules. This limits the chances of virus resistance. Also, each lead antibody targets a unique component of the viral entry pathway, thereby paving the way for powerful combinatorial approaches which maximises clinical potency. HepaMAb harnesses leading expertise in MAb technology, preclinical efficacy and safety testing, biomanufacture and clinical trial to progress at least one anti-viral and one anti-receptor human MAb to phase I/IIa proof of concept clinical trial in the liver transplant setting for the prevention of graft reinfection.

The superoxide-producing NADPH-Oxidase AtrbohB is alternatively spliced in seeds depending on developmental status and the presence of ABA, and atrbohB mutants fail to after-ripen. The proposed interdisciplinary project will investigate mRNA-splice forms and superoxide production by rbohs in Arabidopsis and two other selected species during after-ripening and germination and focus on the the relation between ABA signalling, rbohs and alternative splicing in Arabidopsis seeds.

GPCRs are implicated in the amyloid cascade and amyloid-beta mediated toxicity and neuroinflammation observed in Alzheimer's.\n\nThe EU-funded FATOKUNEUFP7IIF2010 project focused on the development of fluorescent probes for the visualisation and quantification of GPCRs and their ligands. The idea was to use these molecular tools in drug screening to investigate allosteric interactions. The identification of ligands that pose allosteric effects of GPCRs has been envisaged as a means of eliciting neuroprotection.\n\nThe researchers investigated adenosine receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptors and the GABAB receptor closely since their modulation is highly relevant to neurodegeneration. Scientists synthesised a series of fluorescent GPCR ligands and screened them on cell lines in vitro. With the serotonin receptor 5-HT as a model system, appropriate functional assays were developed for assessing the quality of nine different fluorescent ligands. One ligand with antagonist properties for the 5-HT receptor was further processed for imaging purposes and is expected to replace the use of radiolabelled ligands in competitive binding experiments.  \n\nWith respect to the inhibitory GABAB receptors, scientists identified one fluorescent ligand with antagonist properties which also had excellent photophysical properties for imaging applications.

INTERACT will (1) establish a new approach to the science of mimicry, bringing together methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience and computer science, and (2) use this approach to understand the information processing mechanisms underlying mimicry of hand actions.  First, we will develop interactive avatars which can mimic a participant\u2019s hand actions or be mimicked by the participant in the context of a simple drum rhythm task.  Using computer-generated avatars allows us to precisely control and measure movement timing and structure during mimicry, and to record how participants interact with avatars with different socially-relevant features (age / attractiveness or even aliens).  Thus, the INTERACT system will enable high-resolution, well-controlled studies of how people detect and control mimicry.  Second, we will use the interactive avatars to examine mimicry in unprecedented detail, studying how the timing and structure of an action and form of the avatar impact on the control and detection of mimicry in typical adults.  Building on this, we will define the brain mechanisms of mimicry and why mimicry might go wrong in adults with autism spectrum condition.

In fact, roots grow towards zones with higher water contents and this response is called\nhydrotropism. This project is focused on the study of the mechanisms that link the perception of water deficits in the soil with\nthe adaptive responses caused by ABA that are directed to ensure plant survival. The identification of the mechanism by\nwhich an environmental signal causes a modification of root growth will be investigated. The discovery of\nthe elements responsible for transmitting the water deficit signal and the proteins involved in this signaling pathway\nwill compose the first part of the project. Next, the creation of multiscale models capturing the response integrating dynamic\nchanges in ABA response, biomechanics and root growth in response to hydrotropic stimuli as well as the use of non invasive\nmicro CT imaging of root systems will help to understand how plants respond to osmotic gradients in soil. The study of the\nmechanisms that regulate root growth and bending will help create useful tools directed to reduce crop losses\ncaused by this stress. The experience of the researcher in the field of ABA will help to create an integrative point of view of\nthe role of this hormone in the context of growth regulation.

The occurrence of these diseases is a significant problem for horse owners and breeders and leads to poor animal welfare and severe economic losses. The initiative of this project is mainly based on the strong wish from the studbooks to obtain a genetic alternative to the more traditional breeding methods which are often not feasible in the smaller breeds. For each disease, a genetic component to disease susceptibility has been confirmed and several research groups in Europe have independently carried out small to medium-sized studies in order to find the causative genetic mechanisms underlying the disorder. However, the mode of inheritance for these diseases appears to be complex, and no genes or mutations have been identified yet, suggesting that analysis of much larger sample sizes is required or across datasets. This project aims to bring together the efforts of European research groups that are currently working on the genetics of disease susceptibility in horses. This collaboration will enable the groups to pool data for meta-analysis leading to more rapid progress in the identification of the genes and suitable gene markers for use in genomic selection against disease susceptibility.

Notably, however, although MCC is 40 times less common than malignant melanoma, MCC has a dramatically higher mortality rate than melanoma rendering MCC to the most lethal skin cancer (37 versus 15 percent). This high mortality rate is largely due to the fact that to date none of the currently available therapeutic interventions is able to improve overall survival of patients suffering from metastatic disease.

This observation, that physiological angiogenesis proceeds in response to solid-phase cues motivates our approach, namely creating bioactive resorbable materials as scaffolds that contain bound molecular signals to induce physiological angiogenesis in situations of tissue repair and regeneration.

The interior and exterior membranes of the structure create a cavity to replace the glazing of conventional glazed envelopes, and the bubbles contained between the membranes transmit daylight while providing a thick blanket of insulation, which reduces heat loss in winter and solar gain in summer. The novel technology is expected to enable efficient year-round control of internal environments with minimum energy consumption, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

This is because spores play the pivotal role in the spread of infection (eg, C. difficile) and in foodstuff contamination and food poisoning (eg, C. botulinum and C. perfringens). The processes of spore formation (sporulation) and germination (return of the dormant spore to toxin-producing, vegetative cells), therefore, represent key intervention points. On the other hand, the majority of clostridia are entirely benign and can sustainably produce all manner of useful chemicals and fuels. Crucially, the regulation of chemical production is intimately linked to that of sporulation. Spores of benign species may also be used as a delivery system for treating cancer.

The structural materials, to be considered in the GEMMA project, are those selected by the designers of the ESNII systems for fuel cladding and, in some cases, for the main vessel and the internals. Their qualification means that their resistance to harsh exposure conditions of high temperature, highly corrosive environment and intense flux of fast neutrons, will be experimentally verified and/or numerically modelled. The applicability of materials to the reactors' construction implies also that relevant welded joints will be tested as well as corrosion protection treatments. Even the corrosion resistance of new Alumina Forming Alloy steels and surface treatments will be tested in representative conditions. The codification of the project results entails that a large amount of experimental data will be generated and that such data will be transformed to useful rules, for system and component designers, to be expressed in a suitable way for inclusion in the Design Rules of the RCC-MRx code.", 31610.0, 5791836.0, "GEMMA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.nottingham.ac.uk", null, "h2020_210833_999976978"], ["2RD", "Multiscale Analysis of AiRframe Structures and Quantification of UncErtaintieS System", "The University of Nottingham", "MARQUESS has been specifically designed to address the challenges outlined in the Topic Description reference JTI-CS2-2016-CFP04-LPA-02-15 to fit into the activities of WP2.4.3 in the LPA IADP in Clean Sky 2. \nMARQUESS will serve as a valuable precursor to the above as it will enable comprehensive modelling and simulation studies to optimise decision making regarding the structural design of aircraft platforms.

However, any new process developed should be environmentally sound. Metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) have attracted a large interest as catalytic materials due to their small size and high surface to bulk metal ratio, which leads to a greater catalytic activity. These catalysts are easily recyclable, although stabilizing agents are required to prevent agglomeration. In this context, ionic liquids (ILs), salts with melting point <100 \u00baC, can act both as stabilizers and as solvents. Moreover, MNPs may be immobilized in this medium, allowing the separation of the products and the subsequent recycling of the system. However, ILs are not \u201cinnocent\u201d media and can impose a high degree of directionality over the substrates. The employment of chiral ILs adds a new advantage: its potential use in asymmetric catalysis to induce the formation of chiral products. In this project we will merge the asymmetric properties of newly synthesized ILs with the catalytic activity of MNPs. Instead of classical chemical methods, MNPs in ILs will be obtained by sputtering-deposition (SD), an innovative physical technique which enables the fast synthesis of clean MNPs, avoiding the use of organic solvents and reducing agents. In contrast to other physical techniques, the SD of MNPs onto ILs allows the control of the size and shape of MNPs by the appropriate tuning of the sputtering conditions.

Our program will put Europe firmly at the heart of the process, with a manifold return on the EU investment, both in terms of technological innovation and economic growth.\n\nTo realise this vision, we have brought together a larger European consortium with about 150 partners in 23 countries. The partners represent academia, research institutes and industries, which work closely together in 15 technical work packages and five supporting work packages covering the entire value chain from materials to components and systems. As time progresses, the centre of gravity of the Flagship moves towards applications, which is reflected in the increasing importance of the higher - system - levels of the value chain. In this first core project the main focus is on components and initial system level tasks. \n\nThe first core project is divided into 4 divisions, which in turn comprise 3 to 5 work packages on related topics. A fifth, external division acts as a link to the parts of the Flagship that are funded by the member states and associated countries, or by other funding sources.

Age-of-onset and duration of deafness is thought to affect the extent of cross-modal plasticity (CP) in auditory cortex, with earlier onset and longer durations being associated with increased CP. Importantly, previous studies have suggested that the presence of such CP may negatively influence clinical outcomes of cochlear implantation. This has notably resulted in clinicians discouraging parents from teaching sign-language to deaf children for fear that the use of a visual language will promote CP and interfere with the development of auditory abilities, including spoken language, after cochlear implantation. However, recent models have proposed that CP may exert pressure on regions to maintain their cognitive function irrespective of the type of sensory input, and that such maintenance of functional units (e.g. for language) might be positively harnessed in cases of sensory restoration. This is supported by recent research that suggests maintained functional modularity of the visual cortex may be beneficial to the outcome of sight restoration in blind subjects \u2013 a finding that will have important implications on the development of guidelines for sight restoration when a technique becomes available. Ironically, the situation is reversed in the deaf, in which guidelines for a widely used technique is based upon limited understanding of the potential benefits of CP and its influence on functional modularity. It is therefore crucial to obtain a more complete picture as to how age-of-onset and duration may affect CP and functional modularity.

Youth unemployment is at unacceptable levels right across Europe. However, in practically all the overseas countries and territories (OCT's) of Europe youth unemployment is double that of the total population (2.3 times, on average). Some Caribbean OCT's are among the ones with highest youth unemployment in the world (World Bank 2014). Many young people there have never experienced regular, full time employment.The partners all share an interest in tackling youth unemployment by developing their capacity to support young people in rural areas, coastal areas or small islands to utilize their environment to develop entrepreneurial and employability skills. 50 participants from Spain, Italy, UK, St, Maarten, Montserrat and Turkey will live and learn together in Montserrat for 14 days to explore the barriers to education, employment or training that they experience.

The participants will come from various levels of understanding of what risk is so the programme will be designed to ensure that from an early stage they would have a common understanding of it. The programme will focus on the various elements that shape people\u2019s reaction to risk i.e. legal dimension, customs, attitudes, life experience, reactions to new environments, the use of power and how abuse is defined in different cultures. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the training course is to increase the quality of international projects in the Youth in Action Programme through the development of participants\u2019 competence in risk assessment and risk management. \r\n\r\nObjectives: \r\nTo raise awareness of issues of risk in international youth exchanges,\r\nTo exchange of good practices between youthworkers,\r\nTo work towards developing a common understanding of risk \r\nTo reflect on individual perception of risk \r\nTo reflect on the influence of culture on risk perception \r\nTo reflect on and be able to identify the factors of vulnerability of young people \r\nTo be able to identify risk in international environment (different contexts and national realities)\r\nTo understand and be able to do a risk assessment for Youth in Action projects (before and during implementation) \r\nTo reflect on and get to know how to involve young people in the process of identification and reduction of risk in projects \r\nTo get to know and be able to use crisis management \r\nTo experience various tools and methods that can facilitate risk management \r\n\r\nThrough participation in different scale of activities as discussions, presentations, field visits, participants will exchange their skills and experiences on risk assessment and risk management in youth exchange projects in different parts of Europe and will learn more about realities in different European countries.

Dunkirk and Rastaala School have been successfully  linked for 5 years. Many teachers from both schools have taken part in mobilities through our previous Comenius then Erasmus+ KA2 project. \r\nThis KA1project will open up the opportunity for twelve Teaching Assistants at Dunkirk to participate directly in an international mobility and become more involved in the international strand of work across the whole school. Teaching assistants have not yet had any previous opportunity to be directly involved, yet they are key members of staff who work with a range of pupils across every class in school.\r\nThe Teaching assistants work in school with a range of pupils all with varying needs. These needs include severe physical special educational needs (SEN) , emotional SEN, pupils who have experienced trauma (Refugee and asylum seekers),gifted and talented pupils, pupils with specific learning difficulties such as autism, speech and communication difficulties, EAL (English as an additional language), pupils who are suffering deprivation and hence low aspirations and pupils who are underachieving. This role requires a range of strategies and methodologies. \r\nCurrent national expectations of progress for pupils regardless of their specific needs have increased and there are a range of pupils new to the school with different needs, such as refugee and asylum seekers. This has now prompted the school into a review of the role of teaching assistants and if what they do currently can be improved. As we already know Rastaala School, we are very aware of their successful support and integration of pupils with different needs. They have specific expertise in using music and ICT to support such pupils and they have special classes for pupils with significant learning difficulties. They are also developing best practice in supporting pupils who are asylum seekers or refugees.\r\nTwelve teaching assistants have already applied to be a part of the KA1 Job-shadowing project with Rastaala School in Finland. They are all aware of the link and have met teachers who have visited Dunkirk from Rastaala previously. \r\nThis project will allow our twelve teaching assistants to visit Rastaala over a two year period and observe the strategies and methodologies that are so successful in Rastaala. They will discuss and document their findings and then return to Dunkirk and lead an assembly to share their experience with the school and lead a staff meeting where the strategies they have observed are discussed and review of their own practice takes place.\r\nThe project should lead to a more refined and improved provision for our pupils with different needs and with more confident practitioners who have had time to learn from and experience a different international system of supporting pupils with a range of needs. As the use of music and ICT(particularly use of IPads) are a particular specialism for Rastaala, we will see improved use of these in the teaching assistants provision for their targeted pupils back at Dunkirk.\r\nAnother long term benefit will be a higher profile for our link with Finland. The fact that another 12 members of staff will have visited  Rastaala School by the end of the project will ensure that the European dimension of our curriculum and ethos is part of every participants practice. \r\nEach participant will be expected to share their experience in assemblies and lead a staff meeting with their findings. They will also use the school website,  e Twinning and Europass to document their experience and outcomes. The confidence of the participants will increase and their involvement in whole school initiatives and project will increase. A greater European understanding amongst them will develop and this is crucial at this tricky time of Brexit. The participants work closely with pupils at all times and their ability to share their Finnish experiences will enhance the pupils understanding of what being a part of Europe means.\r\nA mid project review will take place by senior leadership and the international coordinator. This will ensure that any difficulties or areas of concern are identified and resolved.\r\nA final evaluation will take place at the end of the project, again by leadership and a questionnaire will be used.

The Headmaster of the Senior School is Mr Kevin Fear and the Headteacher of the Infant and Junior Schools is Mrs Clare Bruce.  The schools are all on one site and form part of one whole school.   \r\n\r\nThis project was conceived of when Miss Fiona Riley joined the school in January 2016 to take up the role of Head of Modern Foreign Languages (Infants and Juniors).  New to subject leadership, Miss Riley was keen to create and deliver a rich, stimulating and exciting modern foreign languages curriculum for the pupils, using authentic materials and resources.  The school offers a wide-ranging curriculum which encourages pupils to be independent, confident and flexible in their thinking and a modern foreign languages curriculum which encourages confident fluency in speaking is key to this ethos.  \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to bring rich, authentic resources to the curriculum; to enhance the modern foreign languages teaching in the school; to encourage greater connections and communication opportunities with native speakers of French; and to forge links with a primary school in France.  The only participant in this project will be Miss Riley; she was chosen due to the fact that she is a specialist language teacher and the sole teacher of languages in the school.  \r\n\r\nThe core activity in this project will be the participation of Miss Riley in an intensive, immersive French course run by PQ French in Carcassonne, France. This course will be an eight day residential course during which Miss Riley will have the opportunity to network and share ideas with other primary language teachers and subject leaders; to participate in French lessons to enhance her language skills; to visit the local area in France, to gain greater local understanding, enhance her vocabulary, learn additional 'real-life' French vocabulary, gather authentic resources and realia, and visit and connect with French primary school teachers.  \r\n\r\nThe objectives, findings and outcomes of the project will be recorded in the MFL Development Plan, the annual budget, the long-term and medium-term planning of the school, as well as through the use of the Europass Language Passport.  \r\n\r\nWe hope that through the delivery of this project, the modern foreign languages curriculum in the infant and junior schools will be greatly enhanced; pupils will gain a greater understanding of the real-life experience of living and studying in France; they will be exposed to a wider range of authentic vocabulary through new materials and resources; they will benefit from their MFL subject leader having a wide and rich network of contacts and they will gain greater communication skills through having the opportunity to communicate directly with native speakers of French.", "http://www.nottinghamhigh.co.uk", "Nottingham High School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036053_coordinator"], ["2RD", "Twinnet", "University of Nottingham Pharmacy Society", 80719.0, "Nowadays, we live in an important international environment.

The population dropped from 12,000 to just 2,000 in 2001. Following the earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010, Haitians were forced to migrate and many have settled in Montserrat. In addition poverty has forced people from the Domincan Republic to migrate. As a result of the outward and inward migration less than half of the current population in Montserrat, 5000 people, are indigenous Montserratian. This has given rise to a lack of tolerance, exclusion and discrimination against migrant communities. \r\n\r\nIn Montserrat young migrants do not drop out of formal education - they are pushed out. At the end of the autumn term of the exam year every student is assessed. If after assessment the teachers conclude that the student will not pass the exams with a good grade, they do not enter them for the exams at all. This means that the pass rates look very good but as many as 25% of young people leave school with no qualifications at all. These failure rates are significantly higher for French and Spanish speaking youth who have migrated from Haiti and the Dominican Republic to escape environmental disasters, poverty and oppression. There is only one VET College on the island. If you can't get into it because you don't speak English and/or you have no exam passes there is nowhere else to go for learning. A a result, young migrants suffer low self-confidence and self-esteem leading to feelings of depression. There is also tension between the immigrant and the host communities as they compete for low skilled jobs, suffer long periods of unemployment and work for extremely low wages. \r\n\r\nThe aims and objectives of this project are to \r\n1. Empower young people NEET by building self confidence and self esteem through non-formal learning activities\r\n2. Promote tolerance, equity and inclusion between communities \r\n3. Build the capacity of the partners to develop youth led initiatives that promote active citizenship\r\n4. Create a youth-led multi-lingual and multi cultural space for non-formal learning and a source of information about learning opportunities across Europe  \r\n\r\nThe ultimate aim is to improve the level of key competences and skills of young people, especially those with fewer opportunities as a result of being excluded from the benefits of the formal education system. This will be achieved through hosting 2 EVS volunteers to strengthen the capacity of an informal group of young people by supporting them to convert a disused campsite into a multi-cultural learning space where young people can come together to pursue their own interests and ideas. The weekly programme of activities that they will then provide will to promote active citizenship, inter-cultural dialogue, language skills, social inclusion and solidarity on the island. \r\nThe project also includes a youth exchange for 25 young people with fewer opportunities. The purpose of the youth exchange is to create an opportunity for inter-cultural dialogue on the impact of forced migration as a result of environment disasters. The partners seek to gain a greater understanding of the power of non-formal learning, its interconnectedness with vocational education and its potential to bring young migrants NEET closer to the labour market. \r\n\r\n \r\nBy the end of the project    \r\n1. 10 young people NEET will demonstrate increased levels of self confidence and self esteem after the non-formal learning programme \r\n2.

In order for pupils to be effective and successful European and global  citizens they need to be able to communicate with confidence.   \r\nThe project will focus on improving the attainment of all pupils who are not reaching expected levels in multi-literacy . This has been identified as an area of concern in both schools. The ability to speak, listen and communicate through different media is an essential skill for all pupils to have. It has been identified in each school that pupils cannot achieve the best in basic reading and writing unless they are confident speakers and communicators. This project will enable and encourage all pupils and teachers to investigate different ways of communicating their ideas, thoughts and opinions using both verbal and non-verbal techniques and strategies.  \r\n\r\nThis area  has emerged from our current Comenius project. The Erasmus+ Partnership opportunity enables us to jointly explore these issues and deepen our practice further . Pupils must be able to communicate, discuss and debate beyond the comfort zone of their own classroom. They need to be flexible communicators, have the ability to adapt and empathize across both local and European/Global contexts. Working with the partner schools in Europe provides us with the opportunities to develop global dialogues where a deeper understanding of each other\u2019s cultures, perspectives and opinions takes place. \r\n\r\n The project, 'Pupil Voice' will look collectively at the Big Question 'What Kind of a World would we like to live in? \r\nEach year one theme will be explored, taken from the Pupil Charter that was developed by the schools in the previous Comenius partnership which ends in August 2014. Due to the global themes the students have identified, the project will give all participants an enhanced sense of their ability to affect change on an individual and collective level. \r\nThe two themes selected from the Pupil Charter are\r\n\r\nGreed and Power\r\nEquality and Racism\r\n\r\nThere will be 6 transnational project meetings where senior managers, coordinators and teachers appointed to each schools Erasmus Team will work together on project planning, implementation and continual review and reflection.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole two years classes in both schools will work jointly and independently on the two themes. This will involve Skype, email, video conferencing and letter writing. Both schools will hold events, special days and ongoing classroom activities linked to the Erasmus themes. \r\n\r\nMany pupils in our schools will have little or no opportunity to ever take part in European travel. The project will see two 'Pupil Camps', one in Finland during winter and one in the UK. Pupils from both schools will take part and live together in a neutral venue for one week. Both Pupil Camps will be facilitated by a Theatre and Drama specialist who specializes in Ensemble Theatre, a style of theatre which involves communities working together in an equitable way which engages all participants  voice.\r\nShe will work with the camp participants on the process of creating a performance that responds to the theme that is being explored.  During this week they will explore the range of strategies for engaging Pupil Voice and will look at a Big Question the project has developed over the previous months. These pupils (and staff) will develop close and long standing relationships with each other and will be able to address some of the key issues identified through the months prior to the camp.

Big data provides very clear opportunities to contextualise improved learning through empirical research and we have a proven method of doing this that can scale at low cost to every country in Europe.  Activities are focused on collecting evidence from testing what children know and understand about digital technologies before and after formal teaching.  In order to take this beyond simple empirical data collection on a large scale we will provide the support and infrastructure for free to enable learning and hence improvement in knowledge, understanding and skills. We will sustain the project by establishing a low cost on-line certification of attainment and progress for which there will be a charge to the end users of 1 Euro per certificate after the funding period ends. This will be sufficient together with committed private sector sponsorship to maintain the free services that the project will extend from the UK to the partner countries.

The ultimate benefit is to improve affordable health care, higher standards of living, and quality consumer goods, addressing the 3 interlinked priorities identified by the EU strategy Europe 2020, promoting a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, some large companies have integrated the digital tools such as cloud computing, rapid manufacturing, data analytics, virtualization, knowledge library and social networks in several stages of the product life-cycle, driven by the reduced time to market (short product development time), improved productivity (in terms of quality and reduced waste) and management of cost. However, manufacturers are burdened with outdated production facilities and a big inertia toward a radical transformation. \r\n\r\nOn the other side, SMEs could more easily fulfil customized product requirements with computer-based systems that comprise simulation, 3D visualization, analytics, but at the present, they do not have enough awareness of the benefits and requirements of the digitalization and find it difficult to access this information. \r\n\r\nThis proposal will contribute to the skills enhancement of the workforce, by spreading in a systematic, coherent, user friendly, and innovative way the available knowledge on the most recent advancements in this fast growing, resource and knowledge intensive application domain, allowing the participants to acquire and improve the skills on Digital Manufacturing technologies to link IT and industry. \r\n\r\nWhile several books, course and websites already exist associated with Industry 4.0, including a number of initiatives within the VET framework, no e-learning platform is currently available which provides a comprehensive framework on Digital Manufacturing Technologies capabilities on an open access basis.

The project objectives align with the philosophy of the European Commission and Erasmus Plus.  The objectives are1. to generate a contemporary, shared conception of nurse leadership that integrates a range of cultural and professional values 2. to develop leadership knowledge, skills and attitudes of student nurses and newly qualified nurses 3. to establish active communities of practice for students and newly qualified nurses through blended mobility4. to provide opportunities for nurse educators to collaborate, experience and test innovative teaching methods RELATE targets nurse educators, newly qualified nurses and student nurses. The European Junior Leadership Academy seeks to address the important priority of developing skills in the European Area by focusing on developing the leadership skills of student nurses. The RELATE project also integrates development of digital and ICT skills into the leadership development of nurses because to deliver the most up to date and modern care, employers need nurses who, on the point of qualification, have the information technology skills necessary to take full advantage of the technological  resources available for patient care and patient outcomes. Enhancement of these skills has the potential to connect practitioners virtually to facilitate the adoption, diffusion and spread of innovation and evidence based nursing practice. The project also targets nurse educators because educating this modern nurse who is a clinical, care and knowledge worker requires highly skilled, digitally literate and innovative educators. RELATE seeks to develop nurses educators from different countries through shared training and experimentation with teaching and social network tools not often seen in nursing education. The team recognises the value of emerging leaders as peer mentors for student nurses. This project will therefore also target nurses in their first year of qualification and develop their peer mentoring skills. The European Junior Leadership Academy (EJLA) programme will identify 40 high performing nursing students from four Higher Education Institutions in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Slovenia and Portugal who demonstrate leadership aptitude and leadership potential. The programme will develop their leadership identity, knowledge, attitudes and skills by creating opportunities for them to observe leaders in action and leaders\u2019 impact on the individuals and organisations they lead. Through leadership retreats, internships, mentoring and peer network projects, the EJLA  will support participants to develop their leadership signature early in their career journey. Materials from the EJLA will be adapted and delivered as a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC). This element of the project aims to expose a wider number of student nurses across Europe and beyond, to leadership development opportunities. The RELATE project is needed because nurses across Europe face the common challenge of delivering more nursing care with less resources. The rising demand for healthcare has been fuelled by an ageing European population, the global epidemic of non communicable illnesses and the information revolution which has resulted in highly informed patients. At the same time, health systems across Europe are under increasing pressure to contain costs. Delivering high quality care under these conditions requires innovative, collaborative nursing practice and cadre of leaders able to operate in different professional situations and cultures. The results of the project include a collection of assets which will be curated on the RELATE website. The assets will include pedagogical resources for student nurses, nurse educators and nurses. These will be available openly to the public.  A Massive Online Open Course will also be produced as part of the project. The MOOC, Lead Now! will be available to any student nurse wishing to take part. The impact of the RELATE project in the local, national , regional and international nursing and nurse education community will be a  wider acceptance of junior leadership as a key talent management objective for student nurses. Locally, health facilities and higher education institutions will benefit from students and newly qualified/emerging leaders increased leadership identity and skills through the generation of more ideas for service and care improvement and more ability to initiate change.

The need to welcome these new arrivals (some who have come from traumatic backgrounds and circumstances) is a key concern for both schools. Pupils and teachers need to develop the skills to become effective and empathetic European/Global citizens where all members of the school (and wider) communities feel happy,  safe and able to fulfill their full potential. This identified need has emerged from the political developments in both countries regarding the intake/treatment of migrants and refugees. In both communities there have been significant issues raised about how we should behave when welcoming new members to our community. The need for the whole community to develop certain skills has become evident. These skills include Empathy, Gratitude, Resilience, Social Responsibility and Self Care. This all feeds into the need to have a robust PSHE (Personal, Social, Health and Emotional) curriculum that isn't squeezed out due to external pressures and time.\r\nThe main objective of the project is to develop a Scheme of Work for PSHE that can be used internationally and speaks to all teachers easily. It should meet any school's individual needs but also be something that can be applicable on a global/international level.

Having dialogue and discussion between teachers in both schools, sharing their strengths, skills, contexts and expertise provides an excellent platform from which to plan and implement the program.\r\nThe need to raise the self esteem of all pupils is a key area to develop. Developing the understanding, respect and tolerance between the different cultures and religions represented in both school communities is a big part of the project . Improving community cohesion and tolerance is something that will underpin the work of the next two years. \r\nThe ideas will center around developing Acts of Kindness across both schools. The aim will be to create kinder more empathetic communities.\r\nOver the two years 12 teachers and 3 leaders from each school will participate in a visit to the link school and their classes will link with each other sharing and collaborating throughout the whole project.\r\nThe overall theme of study across both schools will be 'Change' in year 1 and 'Action' in year 2.  In Year 1 of the project the schools will look at what we would like to change within our communities. Each class will design their own Community Action project on a school and local level which will be shared with each other. They will specifically design and implement Acts of Kindness activities at an individual, class and school level. By the end of the year 1they will move  on to a community Act of Kindness at a local level. This will be dependent on what changes they would like to see in their community. They will compare this with each other and also with The Lahore Lyceum School in Pakistan who will also participate in the project. \r\nIn Year 2 of the project the schools will try to develop further Acts of Kindness activities including  whole school events such as participation on the global Dance of Kindness Day and the World Kindness Day in November. The schools will work together to develop a joint Act of Kindness which will require complete collaboration in order for it to be implemented across both schools simultaneously. These events will be open to the community and may involve other community organizations.\r\nThe final year will see the team gather together to compile the best practice and develop the Scheme of Work for PSHE which the schools formally introduce to all staff in 2019-2020. The Scheme of Work will be shared on the Dissemination Platform, our own websites and e-Twinning. The schools will also hold dissemination seminars in UK and Finland where they will share the Scheme of Work ,teaching methodologies and what Erasmus is.\r\nDunkirk is about to become part of an Academy Trust and will open up the project to everyone in the Trust, enabling them to participate. There are 19 schools in the Trust.\r\nThe sustainable outcome is that the scheme of work developed through this project will be embedded into both schools (and hopefully many more) everyday practice and will become something that everyone uses.", "http://www.dunkirkprimary.com", "Dunkirk Primary and Nursery School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036523_coordinator"], ["2PS", "SPORT AND ACADEMIC TALENT INTEGRATION THROUGH EXCHANGE PROGRAMMES IN HOCKEY", "BEESTON HOCKEY CLUB LTD", 324686.0, "Nowadays, students at European universities have to develop, not only academic skills, but also those skills and competences that will allow them to succeed in a global job market. Intercultural and language abilities are a must, and this is the reason why the European Union is supporting mobility programmes in order to facilitate stays abroad. Elite amateur sport men and women are not outside of this reality. They have to develop a dual career at the highest level: both, academic and sportive.  If they want to be at the highest sport level, trainings and competitions are very demanding. At the same time they have to do their best at the university, as their labour future does not depend on the sport, but on their studies and competences.Too often, these students have to renounce living a mobility experience because of the high sport demand. It also happens that some of them decide to put above their studies and then they leave their sport in order to live the international academic experience. Clubs and national federations loose then a talent, while they loose the opportunity to compete at the highest level. Others, they choose to live a sport mobility leaving aside the academic career, as the international Club where they are offered to play does not have a university with an agreement with their university.This project proposal aims at the design of a sport-academic exchange scheme into the Erasmus+ Programme. Erasmus+ requirements and elite sports\u2019 requirements do not fit very well, and if universities and sport clubs work together, we a way to make possible that elite sport men and women do not have to choose between their academic and professional life and their sport life, enhancing their dual careers. The project is focused in Field Hockey as a pilot sport, but final results are expected are going to take into consideration all sports, mainly amateurs.
