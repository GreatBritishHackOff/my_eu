An integral part of this programme is student participation in a 3-week course that combines language instruction and vocational internship in the UK.\r\nThe first main objective of this programme is to offer international vocational training and education to those students who plan to pursue employment in retail, industry, office and bank sectors. The second main objective is to put the academic curriculum into effect.

In a personal meeting with the international director Marc Allen, the first cornerstones of a training of our teachers as well as possibilities for further cooperation (exchange of pupils and students, mediation of internships, job shadowing, etc.) were discussed. The suitability of the Sussex Downs College is due to the fact that the College has won several awards for the support of international students (the British Council Beacon Award for International Student Support). In addition, the college was awarded the best college in the fields of teaching, teaching and course building six years in a row by the British Council.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to transfer the key qualifications leading to the award of the college to the Berufskolleg Schlo\u00df Neuhaus and pass it on to interested vocational colleges.

Furthermore, observations of English lessons with subsequent reflection, peer teaching, as well as an exchange of experience on the quality management in the teaching are provided.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this mobility project is to achieve the following objectives:\r\n1. A personal development as well as a professional expansion of competence (with regard to vocabulary, pronunciation, reception and grammar, organization of instruction, evaluation of lessons, etc.) are aimed at.\r\n2.

D.I.C.K. was born after a careful analysis of the needs expressed by the members of the partnership and the examination of potential economic growth that Calabria territory could enable through a better training of its human resources and a better  marketing action for the positioning of food products in international market.\r\nThe Calabria region ( especially the territories  represented by the municipalities that are project partners) is characterized by an important agricultural and touristic potential. These territories despite their cultural and natural heritage, and the development of enogastronomic sector have been experiencing high rates of unemployment .\r\nThe region and the province of Reggio Calabria are not sufficiently able to enhance and promote their products. The high quality of products is not enough for the development if a marketing strategy is not implemented and  human resources are not really qualified.\r\nStarting from these considerations, MOB.Y. DICK was born to train adequate resources who can help face the challenges and opportunities coming from the global market and bring attention on agricultural and agri-food enterprises management. The objectives of the project are:\r\n1.To encourage a greater awareness of the opportunities that food industry can represent for territorial development;\r\n2.To train human resources able to answer global market modern needs;\r\n3.To work for a gradual and progressive adjustment of training systems according the real business needs, starting from the international experience and taking into account the European ECVET system of skills certification;\r\n4.To learn, through cooperation with foreign partners, good practices in the field of business management and marketing;\r\n5.To stimulate a greater dialogue among all stakeholders involved in the field of agribusiness and territorial development.\r\n\r\nMOB.Y.

Coming in contact with foreign companies and with different working styles, they will have the possibility to internationalize their curriculum and to acquire  knowledge for entering the European labor market . Their curriculum will be enriched by the Europass Mobility and other foreign certifications. Locally, the project will be an important opportunity for a territory that is characterized by an high level of youth unemployment. For recent graduates, it will represent an opportunity to apply the knowledge they learnt at school in a real labor experience functional to their career development.\r\nMoreover, the cooperation among various stakeholders involved in the area, will create greater synergy in order to join efforts in the promotion and commercialization of food and agriculture products. The comparison with the learners, once they get back, will represent a unique opportunity to compare different practices and to learn how foreign companies and territories have worked for the promotion of their own brands.\r\nMOB.Y.

Indeed, WBL and transnational mobility experiences are important to (re)motivate VET learners (preventing early school leaving) and to provide them with the competences required by the companies. \r\n\r\nTherefore the DUAL MOB project will give students the chance to develop technical competences and soft skills \r\nthrough WBL mobility experiences abroad.

Additional ECVET aspects included in the project are: Personal Transcript and Memorandum of Understanding which are to be signed in the course of visits in the respective countries.\r\nTaking part in this project is therefore useful for the students in many respects. By working in foreign countries they can consolidate their practical as well as their language skills, brush them up and enlarge them and that way increase their chance on the job market significantly. A further important aspect is that with the help of the Erasmus Plus project the students are to crack prejudices, become more open-minded and tolerant.
