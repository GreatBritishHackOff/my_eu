This condition contributes to morbidity and loss of Quality of Life (QoL) of Diabetes Mellitus sufferers, most especially the elderly.  We propose to develop a unit prototype, based on our proprietary pulsating negative pressure technology that can be used at home or nursing homes, for treatment of DFUs, and their prevention.\n\nOver 55Mn Europeans between 20 and 79 years of age are currently suffering from diabetes; 55% above 60 years old. The incidence of diabetes is expected to grow as the population ages. Diabetes sufferers have a 12 to 25% lifetime risk of developing a DFU. Over 8Mn Europeans coudl be suffering from DFU in their lifetime. A morbid display of DFU is the lower limb amputation; 85% of the amputations in diabetes sufferers are reported after unsuccessful DFU treatment this means between 290,000 and 450,000 amputations per year, an annual cost  in the order of \u20ac2 \u2013 2.5Bn.\n\nWe believe that introducing PreventDFU technology for home and nursing home use for the primary purpose of DFU prophylaxis during sleeping hours and for the secondary purpose of assistive therapy of mild DFUs may reduce DFU incidence in the elderly and prevent a significant number of DFU-related toe, foot and leg amputations. If Prevent DFU technology can only help 5% of the DFU sufferers, this would mean substantial QoL improvement for over 400,000 Europeans and over 2 Mn sufferers worldwide, substantially reduce associated healthcare costs and give a considerable boost to the European Medical Device Manufacturing, Nursing and Assisted Living sectors. PreventDFU technology could benefit elderly pressure ulcer (PU) suffers by providing timely prophylaxis by increasing the blood flow in the legs; it has been reported that 95% of all pressure ulcers occur in the lower part of the body while 70% of those occur in persons over 65 years of age.", 21321.0, 1035355.0, "PreventDFU", "Device for diabetic foot ulcers", "Over 55\u00a0million Europeans suffer from diabetes, and 8\u00a0million of these patientsare at risk of developing a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). Each year, as a result of unsuccessful DFU treatment, up to 450\u00a0000 lower limb amputations  cost health authorities around EUR\u00a02\u20132.5 billion .", "The EU-funded 'Device for prophylaxis and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers for hospital and home use' (https://sites.google.com/site/preventdfu/home (PREVENTDFU)) project is undergoing research to remedy this situation. A prophylactic device prototype called FlowOxTM will be developed to prevent or treat DFUs for use in homes or nursing homes. This device will modify existing pulsating negative pressure technology and use it to increase blood flow and prevent wound formation or stimulate healing at the ulcer site. \n\nScientists also worked on determining the optimal means of restoring blood flow in the lower extremities or limbs of diabetic patients using pulsating negative pressure. For this purpose, the prospective patient cohort will include diabetic or non-diabetic patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease along with healthy subjects. Requisite ethical approvals for the study were obtained successfully and pilot experiments have already started. Study outcomes will help determine optimal treatment protocols and negative pressure settings. \n\nPREVENTDFU scientists completed a comprehensive literature review encompassing the medical and biomechanical aspects of the device. Also, user trials were conducted to gain their perspective on DFU treatment requirements and issues with orthoses, externally applied devices used to modify the structural characteristics of the neuromuscular and skeletal system. \n\nBased on those for ankle foot, design specifications were incorporated into the principal design and a preliminary risk analysis carried out. This resulted in the manufacture and testing of wearable leg-and-foot chamber prototypes to further optimise design. In parallel, work is ongoing to develop and optimise the other device components such as the control system, pump, valves, user interface, power supply, pressure sensor, data logging system and housing. \n\nUltimately, the FlowOxTM device will improve the quality of life of diabetic patients by reducing their risk for DFU-related toe, foot and leg amputations. This would also result in substantial health care savings and boost the European medical device manufacturing, nursing and assisted living sectors.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014-04/62343.jpg", "fp7_101250_965830359"], ["7AL", "Portable Particulate Detection Device", "Lateral Logic Ltd", "Asbestos fibres are a major cause of disability and death in the construction, decommissioning and related industries. The \u2018Porpardet\u2019 project will address this through developing two innovative complementary portable automatic detection systems, based on novel concentrating and analysis methods for asbestos particles and certain other harmful materials of widespread concern, eg mineral quartz/silica. One system will be a wearable device with an immediate alarm, the second will provide rapid on-site quantitative analysis - both will have the ability to record exposure over time with a novel filter cassette. This equipment will directly improve the health protection of the individual, and reduce the potential cost of their healthcare provision and possible costs of litigation. It will be of great value to the manufacturing, construction, waste disposal sectors, and emergency services. It will allow application of relatively inexpensive resources in a rapid manner, but with proper risk management. The automation and simplicity foreseen will allow an ease of use and therefore an uptake in use which will not only lead to wider control, but will also allow moderate production costs for the equipment - which uses many elements now emerging from other industries such as low cost lasers.   The project will deliver two new products with related consumable sales. The products will be designed, manufactured, distributed and serviced by the SME partners within the project. It is estimated that the new products could generate a new market in excess of 12 million Euro per annum for the SME partners.

For a successful and broad penetration of LEDs into the general lighting market two key factors are required: high efficiency and low cost. Two new disruptive technologies based on nanostructured semiconductors are proposed to address these key factors. A novel epitaxial growth technique based on nanorod coalescence will be explored to realize ultra-low defect density templates which will enable strain-relieved growth of LEDs and thus achieve higher efficiency. The second highly innovative approach is the growth of directly emitting Gallium nitride based nanorod structures. These structures are expected to produce exceptionally high efficiency devices covering the whole visible spectrum and even phosphor-free white LEDs. Significantly, our new nanostructured compound semiconductor based technology will enable LED growth on low-cost and large-area substrates (e.g., Silicon) as wafer bowing will be eliminated and thus lead to a dramatic reduction in production costs.  The main objectives over the three years are:  \u2022Profound understanding of the growth mechanisms and properties of nanorod systems \u2022New materials and process technologies (wafer-scale nanoimprinting, dry etching, device processing) for LEDs based on nanostructured templates and nanorod-LEDs  \u2022Demonstrators: -Phosphor-converted white LEDs based on nanostructured sapphire templates (efficacy \u2265 150 lm/W @ 350 mA) and Silicon templates (efficacy \u2265 100 lm/W @ 350 mA) -Blue, green, yellow and red emitting Nano-LEDs (external quantum efficiency \u2265 10%) -Novel phosphor-free white-emitting Nano-LEDs (external quantum efficiency \u2265 2%) Realising the objectives of SMASH will start a new generation of affordable, energy-efficient solid state light sources for the general lighting market and will push the LED lamp and luminaire business in Europe.", 166430.0, 10260399.0, "SMASH", "Turn on the lights", "Cutting-edge nanotechnology has enabled the development of new light emitting diodes (LEDs) that will be much more stable and energy efficient than currently available lighting solutions.", "As energy efficiency and a cleaner environment become a requirement of modern life, scientists are researching novel super-efficient ways to illuminate our homes and workplaces. One idea worth investigating is the use of nanorods, or more specifically of nano-structured gallium nitride-based semiconductors to create clean and inexpensive lighting.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'Smart nanostructured semiconductors for energy-saving light solutions' (SMASH) aimed to use these nanorods to upgrade existing LED technology. It worked on resolving structural, optical and electro-optical properties in LED structures, based on passive nanorod templates and on nanoemitters, to develop the appropriate chips for this innovative technology.\n\nIn more technical terms, the project examined the relationship between the physical structure of the rods and the electronic band structure. It looked at carrier transport through the nanorods and studied their optical properties, investigating as well the device properties of nanorod LEDs. This also involved work on design aspects of the LEDs, particularly the electronic model, electroluminescence spectrum and optical model.\n\nIn addition, the project team made progress regarding scalable materials technologies based on nanorod coalescence on sapphire and silicon substrates. A major part of SMASH's work focused on building optimal nanoemitters, i.e. fabricating arrays of nanoLEDs with broad emission. This enabled the team to make significant progress in furthering front-end and back-end processes related to the LED fabrication value chain.\n\nSMASH lastly advanced processes for nanorod template fabrication and for the eventual manufacture of LEDs. These leaps in research have brought stakeholders much closer to being able to produce more cost-effective and efficient LED technology.
