There are 95 students of that sector in our school and 4 of their teachers and a professional associate (school\u2019s librarian) will carry out this project as a preparatory activity for introducing bilingual education at our school. During the project implementation, five members of the project consortium (an English teacher, Web Programming teacher, Art teacher, Web Design teacher and a librarian) will attend separate courses in Malta, UK, Italy and Belgium, will develop an online glossary of terminology related to web design and will hold six pilot bilingual classes of Web Programming, Web Design and Art.\r\nThe project\u2019s main objective is introducing CLIL methodology in the sector of web design and enabling the pilot lessons of bilingual education in the second grade of web design, that is, in the subjects of Web Programming, Web Design and Art in the period of the project\u2019s implementation, and later in the whole sector (1st to 4th grade). Project team will decide on key terminology of these three subjects which will be included in e-Glossary and used in lessons as a preparatory activity for setting up bilingual classes planned in school year 2019/2020. The project will also improve the curriculum of web design (implemented at SUDIGO Zabok in 2013/2014) with the usage of new teaching methods and tools and the development of language, communication and professional skills of both students and teachers which will enhance the students\u2019 possibilities for further education or employment within Croatia or in the EU.\r\n\r\nThe project's fist phase includes teachers' mobilities whose purpose is to develop their language and professional skills. The planned mobilities are: a two-week course CLIL Methodology and ICT Tools for Teachers with CLIL (St.Julian's, Malta), a one-week course CLIL Bilingual Education in Web Design (Ipswich,England), a one-week course T&T: Teaching and Technology for European Teachers (Soverato, Italy), a one-week course SCHOOL REVOLUTION! Flipped Classroom and Innovative Didactic Methodologies (Brussels, Belgium) and a two-week course Using Technology for Teaching English (Cardiff, Wales). \r\nWithin this phase e-Glossary will be issued. Its purpose will be to enhance language competences of the students and teachers but also of elderly citizens involved in the school's project ''We still want to learn'' where they are being taught by our students basic digital skills.\r\nE-Glossary will consist of around 100 key terms explained with the context of each subject and their common usage and translated into Croatian. The e-Glossary will serve as a foundation of bilingual education set up in 2019 but it will firstly be used in pilot bilingual classes and then upgraded in optional classes of the school's librarian in the school year 2018/2019.\r\nIn its second phase the teachers of Web Programming, Web Design and Art will prepare and give 6 lessons in English language (pilot bilingual classes) whereas the English teacher will use the e-Glossary in her classes as part of English for special purpose lessons.\r\nThe third phase or the sustainability of the project in 2018/2019 is the preparation and creation of the new curriculum for bilingual education in web design (which will include the above mentioned subjects), creation of teaching materials in English, organization of optional classes for upgrading the e-Glossary and obtaining the necessary language certificates of the levels of English language mandatory for bilingual education by Regulations on bilingual education in one of the European languages in elementary and secondary education.", "http://www.glocalfactory.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-HR01-KA101-034999_4"], ["3BL", "Digital Extra -SMILE", "Elderberry Gryd Limited (Trading as EUcourses.eu)", 7313.0, "It is a project that resulted from the need to renew the European orientation of the school and the teaching methods on traditional and modern subjects.\r\n\r\nIt includes as basic actions the participation in two mobilities which are linked with trainings. The first has to do with training on new technologies(notably video production ) and intercultural issues and how they can be integrated with innovative methods in the school curriculum. The second action takes the issue of interculturalism a step further, by engaging museums as institutions that can not only play a key role in teaching various subjects but also in consolidating the collective European Identity(Competence). These actions will be continued after the end of school mobility by creating projects which are related to the training items.\r\n\r\n The key objectives are to acquire skills related to e-learning, distance learning, new technologies, cultural issues and the use of museums in the educational process. It is also desirable to build lasting relationships with colleagues across Europe . The experience of the realization of the European project is another key objective.\r\n\r\nThe project includes seven mobilities which can be allocated to \u2013four to seven teachers of different disciplines- according to its development and the school day life. In any case, for the part of the project which will be implemented in our school it is expected that a great number of teachers and students will be involved.\r\n\r\nAfter attending the seminar the teachers will act as multipliers for the new methods it introduces.

Nevertheless, despite its significant size, one may notice some backwardness as far as students' and teachers' international mobility is concerned and also concerning its policy on European openess compared to other schools of the same size situated in big urban areas of the South West.\r\n\r\nConsequently, and starting from this analysis, at the moment we are writing the school project which determines the goals of the school for the years to come, it appears to us indispensable that teachers who are fully involved train themselves in new methods of teaching in order to develop a yearning for foreign languages and a feeling of being European among the students.\r\n\r\nOur goal, in territories which today tend towards ostracism, is nothing else but to encourage our students and those from the secondary schools of the area, to open their eyes on the unique opportunity of travelling to train themselves, study or work in a European Union country.\r\n\r\nForeign languages (Spanish and English), History and Geography, Philosophy, French as a Foreign Langage and Plasctis Processes teachers have been working relentlessly on this project to reverse the trend. The newly-formed team is composed of 14 motivated teachers who are convinced of the importance of what is at stake and experimented in the building up of European projects.\r\n\r\nThe project will enable the creation of collaborative work platforms for an internal and external use and the organisation of real and virtual exchanges with European schools (Spain, Italy, Sweden) of the general, technical and vocational education. Specific language trainings will enable the team to improve its skills, make it more efficient and increase the possibilities of openess. Thanks to these activities, we will come to innovating teaching practices, which will be attractive for our students and adapted to what is at stake in the new economy.\r\n\r\nMoreover, given the importance of our school in the area, we hope this project will have some repercussions on the secondary and primary schools around Marmande, that they will benefit from the experiences of our teachers and that of our partners.", "http://www.eucourses.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA101-036413_4"], ["3BL", "Internationalisering och Didaktik i Praktiken", "Elderberry Gryd Limited (Trading as EUcourses.eu)", 25505.0, "The senior high school teachers at our school \u201cUddevalla Adult Education\u201d work in a multicultural environment. \r\nMany students come from other countries and therefore our teachers have a natural need to develop skills in internationalization and get experience in a range of learning outcomes and placed in a European context which can benefit not only our school but also our education community and other providers of adult education in Sweden.\r\n\r\nIt is important for our teachers to have broad educational qualifications and skills in new teaching methods and internationalization in the learning process. This helps to develop not only the educators in attendance but also their organizations and the wider education community. It is of great value to learn and get experience from other countries and create new tools from an educational perspective and the European cultural identity in adult learning. \r\n\r\nWe intend to offer our 35 faculty teachers to participate in the project \u201cInternationalization and Didactics in Practice\u201d in order to get skills in internationalization of adult learning and strengthen their didactic ability in the school\u2019s teaching job. These increased skills are going to be obtained during the project, its mobilities and many other activities, together with our partner EUcourses.eu and new partners. Another goal of our participation in the project is that the teachers should obtain a greater knowledge of and a better understanding for our different cultural identities and how to transfer the society they live in with its language, culture and history in its educational activities and learning. \r\n\r\nParticipation in the project will also strengthen the common view within our faculty and the organization as a whole which is also for the benefit of our high school students.\r\nThe project\u2019s mobilities and activities will give us skills to identify our school\u2019s development needs and develop a plan of internationalization at our school. Our goal also includes the creation of a platform for exchanges and collaboration with other education providers in adult education.\r\nThe experience and knowledge that the participants receive will be communicated to teachers in other local municipal schools in various forms of activities such as seminars and internal educational courses in adult education. With the help of a digital meeting place EPALE for all who are involved in adult education throughout Europe our teachers will be able to create network for future cooperation with colleagues in the whole Europe which can benefit the experience and knowledge exchange with participants from Sweden and other European countries.

This therapy focuses on the supportive and consolidative interaction of art elements with the creative process,personal development, character and mental health. The main problem areas that we can take art therapy are such as the following: anger management, communicative skills, reconciliation with the past, chrisis management, coping with trauma/anxiety/stress, developing motivation and self-confidence.The prisoners and the participants in the Public Mental Health Centre struggle against such problems in their daily lives. During this process, we aim to provide the prisoners and adult learners on psychiatric medication in the Public Mental Health Centre with  rehabilitation and integration into the society. We aim to enable them to canalize their energy and surges of emotion into creative arts and thus both reveal their potential skills and develop a sense of self-confidence.Through the art courses we arrange at the Prison, we aim to enable the prisoners to cope with anger and to lower the recividism rates.We also aim to achieve the integration of the prisoners as productive and self-confident individuals able to cope with stress when their imprisonment is over. \r\n\r\nOur project involves one of the key priorities of the EU2020 strategy, the social inclusion of disadvantaged individuals.We aim to increase the capacity of our insitution to meet the needs of disadvantaged learners.
