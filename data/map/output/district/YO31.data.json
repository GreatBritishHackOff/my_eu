The project centres on the development and validation of a new method in health promotion, namely a community-based coach education program aimed at promoting the psychosocial development and adoption of healthy lifestyles among young people in Europe. The proposed project will foster collaboration between major research groups representing 5 countries (8 universities) in the European Community and promote the integration of their ongoing research efforts centred on health promotion in youth from two perspectives, namely (a) motivational processes and optimal functioning in the physical domain among young people, and (b) cross-national differences in and environmental impacts on children\u2019s health behaviour.  In terms of study design, the PAPA project will examine differences between the provision of youth sport and its health related impacts as currently exists in the targeted countries and a youth sport intervention designed to enhance personal competence, relatedness and self determination of the young players aged 10-14 and their adoption of a healthy lifestyle.   In examining the effectiveness of the intervention programme, the pre- and post-season (plus beginning of the subsequent season follow-up) responses of coaches and players in the intervention arm (representing 50 football teams) will be contrasted to a control group of 30 coaches and their players.", 80522.0, 3236586.0, "PAPA", "Helping children to embrace sports", "A new system of coaching in sports is slated to encourage children to stick to sports activity and appreciate it, contributing to better health and well-being.", "Childhood obesity is on the rise in the EU, due in part to a lack of physical activity. As increasing participation in sports may be one solution to address the issue, it is very important how sports coaches motivate and empower the young generation to take up sporting activities. The EU-funded project http://www.projectpapa.org (PAPA) developed a new strategy to achieve this aim.\n\nDesigning the Empowering Coaching\u2122 programme to help coaches motivate and engage the youth in sports, the project team sought to make physical activity more enjoyable. It worked with 46 expert coaches and 846 coaches through 87 workshops to potentially impact over 8\u00a0000 children in England, France, Greece, Norway and Spain. Football was then chosen as the common sport for the field study that was planned in the different countries.\n\nTo achieve its aims, the project documented good practices and research worldwide related to sports and motivation among children. It examined the feasibility and effectiveness of the Empowering Coaching\u2122 programme, considering as well the mental and emotional well-being of players. The project team then disseminated the principles of adaptive coaching to coaches and other stakeholders, targeting politicians and sports governing bodies as well.\n\nThe coaches received the new programme positively and field workshops demonstrated success in lowering drop-out rates among children. Particularly, the programme showed promise in grassroots sports \u2014 i.e. amateur participation in sport at lower levels with a 'sport for all' mentality, favouring enjoyment rather than competitiveness.\n\nA new business plan to launch a European-wide social enterprise, Empowering Coaching\u2122, has emerged from the project in association with the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom. If this ambitious drive takes off and spreads to the rest of Europe, our children may become fitter, healthier and happier.", null, "http://www.yorksj.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/147637.jpg", "fp7_90413_996613988"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7EX", "BBA Oldenburg - Let`s go Europe!", "YORK ST JOHN UNIVERSITY", 14815.0, "BBA Oldenburg, an initial vocational school for Occupational Therapy in Germany, is aiming to offer its students and lecturers inspiration through international experience and exchange in order to provide an up-to-date and high-quality training.
