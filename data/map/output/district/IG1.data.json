Massive investments on the field and the latest advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sensors has moved relevant market uptakes for autonomous driving from 2035 to 2020. \nCAVs are equipped with a huge number of sensors that allow them to understand the environment and act accordingly. However, this technology is superfluous without knowing the location of the vehicle in real time. Technology used to position a mobile device on earth is known as Global Navigation Satellite System \u2013 GNSS (e.g. GPS or GALILEO). Despite it seems impossible, currently, there are not any GNSS solution that meet the requirements of vehicle manufacturers for autonomous driving, due to: 1) excessive cost to be implemented at scale (low margin sector) 2) unavailability to provide location updates in real time under hostile GNSS conditions (e.g. urban canyons) and 3) lack of a reliability measure to detect when a location is not accurate enough. \nAt Albora, we have built and patented the Albora Correlation Engine, which uses AI and, in particular, biologically inspired Deep Learning Networks to achieve the performance required by the sector. Moreover, our technology can be embedded on the electronics currently available on autonomous vehicles, allowing us to keep the costs extremely low (no additional HW required!)\nTo exploit our product, we plan to build SW packages of our algorithms and sell licenses through an easy to use API (SW company approach). This model is highly scalable and will allow us to tackle the huge market opportunity. In fact, SW will keep the largest market share for CAV, growing from \u20ac0.5 billion at 2015 to \u20ac25 billion in 2030. To this end, we need to assess the technical risks of migrating our code to more efficient programing languages, seek industrial partners to perform large pilots and fine-tune our business model using design thinking techniques.", 43900.0, 62715.0, "ALBORA", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_214025_910325407"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["4NH", "Molek\u00fcler Gastromomi Alan\u0131nda AB Deneyimi", "UK-Certified Knowledge Association", 39227.0, "EU EXPERIENCE IN MOLECULAR GASTRONOMY\r\n\r\nCONTENT OF THE PROJECT\r\nThe main purpose of our school, which trains semi-skilled staff for the food and beverage sector, is to have our students be employed by the institutions where graduated students can practice their professions.

As a result, greater number of migrants is facing the concern of social exclusion compared to the past: in fact, according to the latest statistics, young migrants (age 16-29) facing poverty or exclusion risk in the EU area were increased up to 48,4% of the total population (EUROSTAT, 2012). In 2014, 122.3 million people, or 24.4 % of the population in the EU-28 were at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE), compared with 24.5 % in 2013. This means that these people were at least in one of the following conditions:\r\n\r\n\u2022 at-risk-of-poverty after social transfers (income poverty);\r\n\u2022 severely materially deprived or\r\n\u2022 living in households with very low work intensity.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the number of persons at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the EU is one of the key targets of the Europe 2020 strategy. The highest rates were been observed in Greece (23.5 % in May 2016) and Spain (19.6 %).  Now more than ever, there is a growing need for skilled youth workers to support young migrants towards their way to active social inclusion. A summary of Commission\u2019s recent researches has shown that: participation in non - formal education, knowledge and use of ICT tools, and having a creativity-driven way of thinking can increase employability especially for young migrants. Also commission has stated many new programs to promote social inclusion of migrants such as Progress Program: Fast track integration into the labour market for third country nationals targeting exclusively asylum seekers, refugees and their family members, GROWH: entrepreneurship for migrants etc.  As the need of integration is growing the need of youth workers and qualification is also growing. \r\n\r\nTherefore, in the path already tracked by Europe 2020 Strategy and its flagship.
