To answer identified needs, the Easily diStributed Personal RapId Transit (ESPRIT) project aims to develop a purpose-built, light weight L6 category electric vehicle that can be stacked together to gain space. Thanks to pioneering coupling systems, up to 8 ESPRIT vehicles can be nested together in a road train, 7 being towed for an efficient redistribution of fleets and a smartly-balanced and cost efficient transport system. Within the project, 2 user scenarios are foreseen: a one-way carsharing system within city centres and a last-kilometre personal mobility system to existing public transport infrastructures in peri-urban areas. These will be tested through 3 different geographical use cases (Glasgow, Lyon and L\u2019 L\u2019Hospitalet de LLobregat near Barcelona).\nThis innovative transport system concept will be demonstrated to TRL5 though state-of-the-art developments of diverse technological bricks (including vehicle and road train architecture, coupling and guiding systems, kinetic and dynamic behaviour management systems, efficient energy supply and rapid charge battery strategies). To prove the ESPRIT concept, the project will also work on modelling and simulation tools to predict, once ESPRIT vehicles are deployed, the economic, social and environmental benefits as well as key operating strategies.\nThis concept will incite citizens to use public transport and carsharing solutions rather than their private vehicles leading to seamless intermodal transport, decongestion, significant reduction of noise and air pollution. To reach all stakeholders, the ESPRIT project will not only rely on its technical expertise but also on the knowledge and network of its end user community represented by several partners as well as the Advisor Board which includes carsharing organisations, public authorities and transport operators.", 61721.0, 6542631.0, "ESPRIT", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_194859_987238065"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7JU", "A whole system investment in languages", "Summerhill Academy", 39289.0, "We are a large, 3 form entry primary school.

It includes one international mobility - a Training Course for youth workers, trainers, project managers and youth leaders - from 16 organizations from 10 European countries, an event with local stakeholders organized as part of the training and a one local event with youngsters per involved community which will take place after the training course. The overall aim of the project is to promote participatory democracy through community building and civic initiative.\r\n\r\nThe project organized from June 24 until July 3 and will involve 34 youth workers, trainers, project managers and youth leaders coming who will represent 16 organizations from 10 European countries. It will be held in Epirus, in the remote village of Skoulikaria of the municipality Georgios Karaiskakis. The competition for a social campaign will be organized in the city of Arta and will include 50 local stateholders (policy makers, local media, NGOs, youngsters). Regarding local events, each session will involve 15-20 youngsters aged 15-25 years old.\r\n\r\nThe project stems from Inter Alia\u2019s continuous problematization about the future of participatory democracy in Europe and the role of youth in shaping it. It sets off from the observed inconsistency between the international reputation of EU countries with regards to the quality of democratic institutions (Democracy Index, 2016) and their apparent incapacity to uphold the values that have made these institutions effective and popular in the first place (more recently manifested in the face of the economic and refugee crises). Ongoing challenges such as recession, unemployment, extremism and xenophobia are seen as by-products of Europe\u2019s derailment from its constitutional values. Those challenges cannot be sustainably addressed by mere compliance with rules imposed from the top-down but necessarily through the demand of citizens for fairer, more inclusive and democratic, societies.\r\n\r\nThe role of youth work and youth workers in the process of augmenting, canalizing and communicating this demand constitutes the main concern driving FOLLOW THROUGH. The aim is to enhance the role of youth work in fostering local level solutions to pan-European challenges of democracy and collective action. More specifically, FOLLOW THROUGH aspires to provide youth workers with new, effective and up-to-date tools for inducing trust of youth in EU values. The emphasis will be placed on ways for enhancing leadership skills of youngsters for promoting social change through community building. \r\n\r\nFOLLOW THROUGH TC will make use of diverse non-formal learning tools including experiential learning, cooperative learning, peer learning, outdoor activities. Particular emphasis will be given to the activity \"Adventure in the Woods\" which was successfully introduced during Inter Alia's TC \"Game of Challenges\" in May 2015. The aim of the \"adventure\" is to facilitate the creation of a community able to cooperate and act collectively. It foresees that participants will be led to the woods in the rough terrain of Epirus  and then, unwarned, will be left alone. For surviving this challenge, they will need to build a community and show leadership skills. Then, they will share their experience as part of a collective learning procedure. Regarding the planning  of civic initiatives, participants will work in teams and will use the project cycle management method. During the local events in partner communities, youngsters will use brainstorming for coming up with potential areas of intervention and use team work and peer learning for building their idea and presenting it to the rest of the group.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to impact on participants and target groups both practically and conceptually. While the project aims at developing manifold skills of participants (section E.2), it also expects to contribute in shaping a shared conceptual framework for democracy and collective action in Europe. Specifically, youth workers involved in the training course will have the opportunity to develop their skills and broaden their area of expertise while putting their existing experience and new skills to effective use through the local events. FOLLOW THROUGH is designed and developed in order to have an immediate effect on involved communities through the development of partner organizations' knowhow and to cause a multiple impact on European and international levels through the dynamics of the network. \r\n\r\nFOLLOW THROUGH aspires to promote cross-sectoral contact by involving local stakeholders (policy makers, youngsters, youth professionals from formal and non-formal education) in a competition for social campaigning organized during the training course.

The personal development and training opportunities available will enable participants to develop skills crucial for future training or employment, while given them the chance to be engaged as active citizens in civil society. At the local level, the participants will be directly involved with the delivery of services to vulnerable people in the community.
