Strong ethical, medical, social and health economic reasons therefore exist for improving treatment. The CENTER-TBI project will collect a prospective, contemporary, highly granular, observational dataset of 5400 patients, which will be used for better characterization of TBI and for Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER). The generalisability of our results will be reinforced by a contemporaneous registry level data collection in 15-25,000 patients. Our conceptual approach is to exploit the heterogeneity in biology, care, and outcome of TBI, to discover novel pathophysiology, refine disease characterization, and identify effective clinical interventions. Key elements are the use of emerging technologies (biomarkers, genomics and advanced MR imaging) in large numbers of patients, across the entire course of TBI (from injury to late outcome) and across all severities of injury (mild to severe). Improved characterization with these tools will aid Precision Medicine, a concept recently advocated by the US National Academy of Science, facilitating targeted management for individual patients.  Our consortium includes leading experts and will bring outstanding biostatistical and neuroinformatics expertise to the project.  Collaborations with external partners, other FP7 consortia, and international links within InTBIR, will greatly augment scientific resources and broaden the global scope of our research. We anticipate that the project could revolutionize our view of TBI, leading to more effective and efficient therapy, thus improving outcome and reducing costs.

Both victims and relatives experience suffering, and the associated direct and indirect costs to society are huge.\n\nCurrently, up-to-date evidence-based TBI treatment guidelines do not exist. Moreover, recently emerged technologies such as biomarkers, diffusion tensor imaging and genomics have not been considered in older studies.\n\nThe http://www.center-tbi.eu (CENTER-TBI) (Collaborative European neurotrauma effectiveness research in TBI) project will employ comparative effectiveness research (CER) to identify the most effective clinical care approach. This 6.5-year project is part of http://ec.europa.eu/research/health/medical-research/brain-research/international-initiative_en.html (The International Initiative for Traumatic Brain Injury Research (InTBIR)).\n\nCENTER-TBI is a large-scale observational study that will attempt to improve TBI classification and characterisation. Using CER, project members will determine between-centre and between-country differences in TBI management and outcome. A total of 78 sites from 21 countries in Europe and Israel will participate.\n\nDuring the first year of the project, project members laid the foundation for conducting the study and ensuring smooth and harmonised data collection. Over 280 participants attended the training meeting. Already, the study protocol has been registered and accepted for publication in the prestigious Neurosurgery journal. They finalised the case report forms (CRFs), developed a web-based data entry format (e-CRF), finalised outcome instruments and summarised the study procedures in a trial manual.\n\nCENTER-TBI successfully completed the linguistic validation of multiple outcome instruments in many languages. They also established a knowledge commons and obtained an overview of existing knowledge in the literature concerning TBI treatments. The first patients were enrolled in December 2014.\n\nProject members established close collaboration within and outside InTBIR with similar research endeavours such as TRACK-TBI in the United States and ADAPT, a study on severe TBI in children.\n\nProject activities were widely disseminated via presentations at scientific meetings, media publications and interviews. This has attracted global interest, with China and India also setting up similar studies that will be linked to CENTER-TBI.\n\nTransatlantic comparative analysis and meta-analysis of individual patient data in larger numbers will provide a truly global perspective.

Highly sensitized patients accumulate and often die on the transplant waiting lists as it is almost impossible to find donors towards which they don\u2019t have antibodies. The acceptable mismatch program of Eurotransplant has shown to be an effective tool to enhance successful transplantation of highly sensitized patients.  However, 35% of the patients have rare HLA phenotypes and no suitable donor can be found. HLA phenotype frequencies vary amongst European populations. Rare HLA phenotypes in one population are more frequent in other populations. The major objective of the 10 partners in this project is to analyze the feasibility and requirements for a Europe-wide acceptable mismatch program to enhance transplantation of patients with rare HLA phenotypes in their own population. Long waiting patients will be matched with virtual donors based on known HLA frequencies of different European populations and with actual donors from the different transplant organizations. If successful, the logistics will be tested by transplanting some of these patients with donors from elsewhere in Europe. Second objective is to simplify the definition of acceptable HLA mismatches. Although almost 4000 HLA class I antigens are known, only 150 polymorphic residues differentially spread over the different HLA antigens are responsible for the induction of antibodies. An innovative typing and matching strategy based on the definition of acceptable HLA epitopes will facilitate the identification of suitable donors. Third objective is to define whether antibodies against non-HLA targets on the donor endothelium affect the results of transplants in highly sensitized patients.

A pan-European innovative typing and matching should enhance the identification of suitable donors.", "When the immune system encounters foreign antigens it mounts antibody responses. The same applies for human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), the cell surface molecules that regulate the human immune system. Antibodies against foreign HLAs are considered a contraindication for renal transplantation due to acute graft rejection.\n\nThe emergence of anti-HLA antibodies can be induced by blood transfusions, transplantation and pregnancy. To enhance the outcome of renal transplantation, one approach is to remove anti-HLA antibodies using immunosuppressive drugs. However, this strategy has side-effects and does not work for all patients.\n\nAlternatively, the Eurotransplant Reference Laboratory's Acceptable Mismatch Program identifies the HLAss for which the patient never formed antibodies. Donor selection is then based on the compatibility of the donor with the patient's own HLAs and the acceptable HLA mismatches. This programme was established across Europe and has proven to be very effective with the majority of the highly sensitised patients receiving a transplant within two years.\n\nHowever, the polymorphic nature of HLAs and their geographical distribution resulted in a significant proportion of highly sensitised patients with no transplant available in the Eurotransplant region. Seeking to address this, the EU-funded http://www.eurostam.eu/ (EUROSTAM) project set out to extend the potential donor pool through a Europe-wide collaboration.\n\nAs a first step, the consortium has created an inventory of 600 highly sensitised patients in Europe who have been waiting for a transplant. The central database has been enriched with the patients' HLA phenotypes and their acceptable mismatches. In addition, partners have gathered HLA information from 212\u00a0634 individuals from 27 European countries in the http://hla-net.eu/ (HLA-net) bioinformatics platform. HLA phenotypes have also been collected from over 46\u00a0000 organ donors across Europe.\n\nUsing simulation methods, the consortium hopes to predict the chances for a particular highly sensitised patient to receive a transplant from a particular region. Taking into consideration the 4\u00a0000 available HLA alleles, the proposed epitope approach for finding the allowed HLA mismatches should increase the chances of finding suitable donors for most patients on transplant lists.", "http://eurostam.eu/", "http://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/157219.jpg", "fp7_106298_998249311"], ["4QN", "MEsenchymal stem cells to Reduce Liver INflammation", "Nhs Blood and Transplant", "Prevalence of liver disease is c6% (29 million people) in the EU with mortality rates from chronic liver diseases estimated at 14.3 per 100.000 in the EU-25 in 2004.

Safe novel anti-inflammatory therapies would satisfy a large unmet need for inflammatory liver conditions such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) are a mixed population of plastic-adherent (PA) cells isolated from bone marrow, umbilical cord and adipose tissue.
