We offer students of those two schools the opportunity to get financial support from the European Union to make their internship in one of the Erasmus+ eligible countries.\r\n\r\nPractical experiences, such as internships, can significantly increase the students\u2019 motivation to learn by showing them how relevant the knowledge and competences acquired abroad are for their professional future. \r\n\r\nThe project \u201eWest-East-Styria-to-Europe\u201c combines the international / European aspect with the motivation-enhancing aspect of practical experiences.\r\n\r\n\u201eWest-East-Styria-to-Europe\u201c supports students of the HLW Deutschlandsberg and HLW Feldbach to make their work placements abroad.\r\n\r\n\u201eWest-East-Styria-to-Europe\u201c aims at motivating as many students as possible of the HLW Deutschlandsberg and HLW Feldbach to accept the challenge of an internship abroad and make their obligatory internship at a company or institution abroad.\r\n\r\n\u201eWest-East-Styria-to-Europe\u201c supports students of the HLW Deutschlandsberg and HLW Feldbach to receive the EU funding, provided by the EU-programme Erasmus+; and to prepare, to realise and follow up the internships in the best possible way!\r\n\r\n\u201eWest-East-Styria-to-Europe\u201c is convinced that internships represent a unique chance for Styrian students to gain practical work experiences which they could hardly gain in Austria.\r\n\r\nHere are some strong arguments, from the project partners\u2019 point of view in favour of making an internship abroad:\r\n- Experiencing the opportunities, the European Union offers to its citizens\r\n- Acquisition of new practical and theoretical knowledge and competences.\r\n- Increasing the chances in the labour market: At home and abroad.\r\n- Acquisition of intercultural knowledge and intercultural skills.\r\n- Improvement of foreign language skills.\r\n- Strengthened sense of initiative and an enhanced entrepreneurial spirit.\r\n- Strengthening of social and personal skills.\r\n- Creation of personal networks (friends and employer) abroad.\r\nAnd many more.\r\n\r\nWho is \u201eWest-East-Styria-to-Europe\u201c? \r\nHere is a list of the project partners of \u201eWest-East-Styria-to-Europe\u201c which have access to a strong network of relevant organisations and enterprises:\r\n- The Styrian Association for Education and Economics (STVG) as project coordinator\r\n- The Education Authority of Styria with the Service Unit for the European Union\r\n- The regional Government of Styria with the Department for European Affairs and External Relations.\r\n- LOGO youth management.\r\nAnd\r\n- Upper Level Institute for Commercial Professions Deutschlandsberg (HLW Deutschlandsberg)\r\n- Upper Level Institute for Commercial Professions Feldbach (HLW Feldbach)\r\n\r\nTogether, the project partners and the project schools will prepare the supporting teachers and their students for the students' internships.
