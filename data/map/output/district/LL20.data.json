In regards to PCE design, deployment, and evolution, Europeans are amongst today's leaders in the process of transitioning PCE from software-defined concept to interoperable networking standards. This is particularly the case in the standardization bodies of IETF and ETSI, including the areas of advanced optical networks, sensor networks as well as frameworks for the Internet of Things (IoT).We are still facing a number of open challenges in the SDN areas, yet to be addressed through PCE design. First, current Open Networking Foundation (ONF) specifications lack control systems and well-defined interfaces with external (non-ONF) functions, which represents a not-to-be-missed opportunity for the PCE-based architecture. Second, the new ETSI initiative on Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is leveraging virtualization concepts, with the growing role of PCE concepts. Third, Application-based Network Operations (ABNO) \u2013 an architecture proposed, developed and led within the IETF by leading members of our consortium \u2013 uses a variety of PCE-based tools and techniques.PACE seizes this great opportunity of consolidation of the existing PCE developments, thereby facilitating a one-stop solution for all PCE-related issues, with an open-source software repository, workshops, standardization activities, plugin marketplace, etc. PACE will bring together a community of standardization and community leaders, developers, and academics.

Such traffic increase is impacting on both network costs and power consumption. Moreover, traffic is not only increasing but becoming much more dynamic, both in time and direction. For these reasons, transport network evolution from current DWDM systems towards elastic optical networks, based on flexgrid transmission and switching technologies, could significantly increase both transport network scalability and flexibility. Further benefits come from multilayer interworking mechanisms enabling electronic switching technologies (IP/MPLS, OTN, etc) to directly control the bandwidth of the Bandwidth Variable Transponders (BVT) for optical bandwidth optimization purposes.This then defines the key objective behind IDEALIST: To research in detail a cost and power efficient transport network architecture able to carry a wide range of signal bandwidths, each of which will be varying in real time in direction and magnitude, and some of which will be extremely large and possibly exceeding 1Tb/s.

Although the school is located in the Vomero district of Naples, which is supposed to be the more respectful city area, it hosts students from many surrounding areas, which are known for their urban and social decay. The connection to the metro line 1 between the Vomero and the Scampia district, built between 2005 and 2009, has, in fact, resulted in the increased number of students at risk, in terms of early school leaving.\r\nThe reality in which the school is located has, thus, led teachers to question themselves on how the school system can attract even the toughest guys towards learning and knowledge without penalizing the most deserving students.\r\nStarting from the need to defeat early school leaving and increase the education quality of the Institute in order to offer more employment opportunities for students, C.L.I.L. aims at deepening the use of new teaching methodologies and enhancing teachers\u2019 language skills, through the comparison with other European schools.\r\nSpecifically, the project involves the mobility of 20 teachers, 10 of which will be carrying out job shadowing activities in the United Kingdom (5 participants) and Malta (5 teachers) in order to identify and deepen the use of cooperative learning methods. The other 10 will follow structured courses, taught in English and French, in United Kingdom (5 participants) and France (5 teachers) in order to improve their language skills.\r\nCompared to new teaching methodologies,  it is expected the deepening of all the ways through which the students, guided by their teacher in quality of facilitator, can become active participants in their own learning process. Particular attention will also be paid to the analysis of educational strategies that allow a better integration of students, who would normally feel excluded during daily frontal lessons.\r\nAs regards, however, the structured courses of English and French, they will be provided by native speakers who will help participants improve their language skills, so that they can prepare and manage classes in Clil mode, once returned from the mobility.\r\nThe 20 teachers that will participate in the project  teach various disciplines (mathematics, marketing, economics, literature and law) and they are united by the need to update themselves in order  to properly  respond to the phenomenon of early school leaving, to deepen the knowledge of languages and to meet other foreign colleagues. Before their departure, they will receive a training of 46 hours divided as follows: 6 hours of guidance; 4 hours of cultural training; 30 hours of language training; and finally 6 hours on cooperative learning.\r\nThe project will develop a strong cooperation between all partners, which will be guaranteed by the signing of a specific agreement and a constant confrontation and dialogue, made possible by several  multimedia communication tools (Skype; drobox;  cloud).\r\nAs regards the project impact, C.L.I.L.  will produce its effect, first on the participants, who, thanks to their experience of mobility, will confront themselves with other foreign colleagues, by incorporating new teaching methodologies for the war against early school leaving. They will also improve their language skills and pass from a level of sufficient proficiency to an intermediate level. Mobility, especially for older teachers , hardened by daily difficulties and tired of a school system which isn\u2019t meritocratic, will renew their interest towards their own profession.\r\nThe Institute Giustino Fortunato will benefit, then, from more qualified teachers and therefore will increase its training quality.

The host organisation coordinates these issues.\r\nThe next five weeks are taken up by the internship, which consists of practical work in each participant\u2019s field of training and work.
