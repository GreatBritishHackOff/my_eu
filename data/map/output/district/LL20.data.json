In regards to PCE design, deployment, and evolution, Europeans are amongst today's leaders in the process of transitioning PCE from software-defined concept to interoperable networking standards. This is particularly the case in the standardization bodies of IETF and ETSI, including the areas of advanced optical networks, sensor networks as well as frameworks for the Internet of Things (IoT).We are still facing a number of open challenges in the SDN areas, yet to be addressed through PCE design. First, current Open Networking Foundation (ONF) specifications lack control systems and well-defined interfaces with external (non-ONF) functions, which represents a not-to-be-missed opportunity for the PCE-based architecture. Second, the new ETSI initiative on Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is leveraging virtualization concepts, with the growing role of PCE concepts. Third, Application-based Network Operations (ABNO) \u2013 an architecture proposed, developed and led within the IETF by leading members of our consortium \u2013 uses a variety of PCE-based tools and techniques.PACE seizes this great opportunity of consolidation of the existing PCE developments, thereby facilitating a one-stop solution for all PCE-related issues, with an open-source software repository, workshops, standardization activities, plugin marketplace, etc. PACE will bring together a community of standardization and community leaders, developers, and academics. PACE will ensure that different aspects of PCE are not developed in isolation, while addressing interoperability issues, and thus avoiding any delays in innovation, and in sealing European leadership in the sector.", 89517.0, 783631.0, "PACE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_111126_955270454"], ["8EB", "Industry-Driven Elastic and Adaptive Lambda Infrastructure for Service and Transport Networks", "Old Dog Consulting Limited", "Traffic demand is increasing dramatically, year on year, with typical growth figures of up to 60% for Internet based traffic. Such traffic increase is impacting on both network costs and power consumption. Moreover, traffic is not only increasing but becoming much more dynamic, both in time and direction. For these reasons, transport network evolution from current DWDM systems towards elastic optical networks, based on flexgrid transmission and switching technologies, could significantly increase both transport network scalability and flexibility. Further benefits come from multilayer interworking mechanisms enabling electronic switching technologies (IP/MPLS, OTN, etc) to directly control the bandwidth of the Bandwidth Variable Transponders (BVT) for optical bandwidth optimization purposes.This then defines the key objective behind IDEALIST: To research in detail a cost and power efficient transport network architecture able to carry a wide range of signal bandwidths, each of which will be varying in real time in direction and magnitude, and some of which will be extremely large and possibly exceeding 1Tb/s. The network architecture proposed by IDEALIST is based on four technical pillars:\u0095 Transport systems enabling flexible transmission and switching beyond 400Gbps per channel.\u0095 Control plane architecture for multilayer and multidomain elastic optical networks.\u0095 Dynamic network resources allocation at both IP and elastic optical layers\u0095 Multilayer network optimization tools enabling both off-line planning and on-line network re-optimization in elastic optical networks.The intention is that the IDEALIST network architecture will be easily industrialised. Therefore, feasibility studies and experimental implementation and demonstration of prototypes will be key activities, as well.

This infrastructure will be able to also support a wide variety of 5G applications with special emphasis on services from various industries vertical to the ICT.\nThis will be achieved by architecting new access-facing and core-facing nodes, complete with storage and compute facilities, interconnected by novel, spectrally efficient, and adaptive optical transmission networks. Advanced concepts, such as hardware disaggregation and virtualisation, will assist in hitting challenging cost targets whilst enabling automation and programmability \u2013 all supported by a purpose-designed SDN-based control plane which will interface with client applications, intelligently catering for the wide range of 5G KPIs. \nMETRO-HAUL will coordinate the disparate elements of transmission, switching, networking, compute, and storage, orchestrating dynamic solutions for multiple 5G applications. \nMETRO-HAUL will carry out Proof of Concept demonstrations of its networking solution involving the interconnection of metro node prototypes, the use of the project's transmission technologies, and the associated control plane and orchestration software.
