In addition to providing a deployment function, the large space deployable structures can provide shape and stability for a spacecraft throughout its mission. Deployable structures have the capability of reducing mass substantially and also allow for a very compact storage volume during the launch phase of a mission.  To date, there is a limited number of European deployable structures being developed due to the inherit risk, cost and complexity associated with them. In addition, the conservative nature of the space industry combined with the environmental and materials challenges related to the deployment and sustainability of space structures makes the problem even more challenging. The TRL level of most deployable technologies is currently low due to this associated risk. The objective of this project is to develop 3 specific, useful and innovative large space deployable technologies: an inflatable sail structure, a deployable solar panel and a CFRP deployable boom. The aim is to develop these technologies from a current TRL of 2-3 to 6-8 within the 3 years of the proposed DEPLOYTECH project. The project addresses two key areas required for the development of critical space technologies  as described in the SPA.2011.2.2-02 call: 1. Large thin walled deployable boom and membrane structures 2. Large thin walled inflatable structures. Ground prototypes of the three deployable technologies will be developed and qualified for future flight opportunities which have already been shortlisted with industrial partners. The DEPLOYTECH consortium is an exciting, well experienced group with world leading capabilities in deployable structures and with a with a well balanced mix of SME\u2019s, industrial primes and university/research institutes able to provide an innovative, low risk capability missing in Europe.'", 168685.0, 2076477.0, "DEPLOYTECH", "Origami solves a space problem", "Launch vehicles are limited in size, while large structures are required for current and proposed future space missions. An EU-funded project aims to increase the space industry's confidence in the use of deployable structures which fold during launch.", "Deployable structures are an integral part of origami-inspired folding reflectors, Earth observation antennas and solar arrays. They come with the promise of substantially reducing the volume of spacecraft and ultimately, the cost of their launch. However, the technology readiness level (TRL) of deployable technologies is still low, in the order of 3 \u2013 at experimental proof of concept stage. And because the cost of failures in space is high, the space industry is reluctant to use them. \n\nTo advance the TRL of deployable technologies, the 'Large Deployable Technologies for Space' (http://deploytech.eu/ (DEPLOYTECH)) project brought experts in the field from across Europe. Their efforts were focused on further developing existing technologies, rather than new technologies from scratch. Therefore, raising the TRL of a deployable solar cell array, an inflatable drag sail called InflateSail and a solar sail to a value of 8, system complete and qualified, is realistic.\n\nThe folding solar cell array has been designed to be compact at launch and expand to many times its size once it is deployed in outer space. It is based on carbon fibre-reinforced plastic booms with flexible solar cells between them, offering significant weight savings as compared to conventional rigid solar cell arrays. The same boom technology is also being employed in the InflateSail.\n\nThis drag sail consists of an inflatable mast and ultra-lightweight polymer sail, supported by carbon fibre-reinforced plastic booms. The availability of upcoming flight opportunities has added an exciting dimension to InflateSail, which has been designed to de-orbit satellites once they have reached the end of their service lives. It is hoped that its first successful deployment will be demonstrated on the 3U CubeSat, a picosatellite scheduled to be launched by late 2014. \n\nDuring the first part of the project, the engineering model of the folding solar cell array and InflateSail has been completed, while the flight model is being constructed. In addition, the Gossamer solar sail, which harnesses the subtle push of sunlight to allow the satellite to cruise like a boat through the sea, has been redesigned. The next step will be to subject it to rigorous testing, including thermal, vibration and vacuum tests. \n\nOnce successfully completed, the DEPLOYTECH project will make space exploration more affordable and offer access to destinations currently beyond our reach.", "http://www.deploytech.eu/", "http://www.rolatube.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20141118094704.jpg", "fp7_101853_972697765"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SO41"}
