Focusing on research-intensive, high technology SMEs the project offers targeted support measures, covering the entire innovation cycle of research projects. Key assets are highly qualified advice and support including a mentoring and coaching approach, hands-on trainings, effective SME-academia matchmaking and guidance to use H2020 more strategically. SMEs and researchers will be supported during all phases of research projects, including first orientation, consortium building, proposal writing, project management and efficient valorisation of project results. Cooperation between SMEs and academia will be strongly encouraged by dedicated services and tools and using new media. A well established, highly visible database with a sophisticated matchmaking-tool together with the complementary BiotechGate database will support the formation of competitive project consortia. H2020-Partnering Days will provide excellent interaction platforms for SMEs and academia. Target group-specific on-site and virtual trainings for H2020 starters, applicants and participants of running FP7 Health-, IMI- and EDCTP projects will be a hallmark of the project. Partnering Days and trainings for exploitation will support SMEs and researchers in successfully bringing their project results to the market. A mentoring and coaching approach and strategy trainings will support SMEs and clusters for a sustainable participation in H2020.

The project will show how DSOs can dynamically and actively manage grid balance in the emerging future where microgrids, ultra-distributed generation and energy independent communities will be prevalent. Best value will only emerge if these resources and stakeholders can be connected to both DSO activities and the centralized market mechanism. The project will establish solutions for this challenge by addressing the following steps:\n\n1. Design and develop a local energy market architecture\n2. Develop and demonstrate ICT components enabling the local market concept \n3. Develop and demonstrate balancing and demand response services supporting the local markets \n4. Design and validate local market enabled business models\n5. Analyze and develop solutions for secure data handling related to local market enabled transactions\n\nWith these steps, the DOMINOES project is able to address all the requirements of the LCE-01-2017 call.

The project has been developed for and in cooperation with the three target groups:\n1) Renewable energy project developers whose access to financing is getting more challenging\n2) The part of the public that has an interest in investing even very small amounts of their savings in renewable energy projects\n3) Crowdfunding platforms who act as intermediaries facilitating the financial transaction between the public and the project developers.\n\nThe overall objective of the proposed project is to contribute to the acceleration of the renewable energy growth in Europe by unleashing the potential of crowdfunding for financing renewable energy projects. In order to achieve this, the work has been structured for achieving the following objectives:\n1. Gain a deep understanding of the public\u2019s perception of crowdfunding\n2. Analyse the challenges faced by the application of crowdfunding for renewable energy projects in Europe\n3. Develop guidelines that support easier, more effective and wider accepted practices in crowdfunding renewable energy projects\n4.
