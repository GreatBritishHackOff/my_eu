CogWatch will focus on neurological patients with symptoms of Apraxia and Action Disorganisation Syndrome (AADS) who, while maintaining their motor capabilities, commit cognitive errors during every-day goal-oriented tasks which premorbidly they used to perform automatically. Most common rehabilitation ICT systems are focused on treating physiological symptoms of stroke, such as hemiparesis and are not appropriate for rehabilitation of cognitive impairments. Moreover, they are based on robot and/or virtual environment platforms which are expensive and impractical for home installations. In addition, they are designed as rehabilitation 'stations' which patients have to access and adapt to the way the systems operate. As a consequence, this affects the continuity of the therapy and weakens its impact. A new Personal Healthcare System (PHS) for cognitive rehabitation of action after stroke is proposed which will be be affordable, customisable and capable of delivering continuous cognitive rehabilitation at home, when it is needed. The proposed CogWatch project plans to exploit intelligent tools and objects, portable and wearable devices as well as ambient systems to provide personalised cognitive rehabilitation at home for stroke patients with AADS symptoms.", 106051.0, 3711562.0, "CogWatch", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_100774_969053960"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2AJ", "Il carreer team nella scuola superiore: dal bilancio di competenze al job placement", "Bournville College of Further Education", 11477.0, "The legislative framework and educational observations give the school autonomy, the role of a permanently guiding agency, targeting in its senior management the implementation of active job seeking and work placement policies. In effect, its role is, above all, to deliver core training of a technical and professional nature, which is of particular importance for today's world of work (and already in place at the school thanks, above all, to the work placement training programme), transferable skills, life skills: group working, effective communication, cooperation.\r\nIn line with the aims of the national \"Garanzia Giovani\" programme, of increasing employment and employability for youngsters, the school's training program and the associated guidance activities for school leavers fulfil a critically important role, alongside the hard skills learned in the classroom. Indeed, through training and other experiences from interacting with the world of work, it is possible to conduct trials and to validate the development and acquisition of the skills needed to enter the workforce, by optimising the concept - as the European Union has called for on several occasions - of skills as applied knowledge, in action.\r\nFrom this point of view, the \"real world tasks\", which companies devise with the school's representatives and assign to the students, play a central role. In the real world tasks, which are tangible and challenging workplace scenarios, the school's representatives identify with representatives of the companies training links and synergies with the school curriculum, thereby creating the conditions for an effective validation of the training programme, measured in terms of knowledge acquired.\r\nTo this end, three of the key competences for citizenship proposed by the European Union are used as reference:\r\n\u2022 learning to learn: ability to organise one's own learning;\r\n\u2022 sense of initiative and entrepreneurship;\r\n\u2022 social and civic competences.\r\nIn short, training experience and guidance initiatives occupy an essential place within the school's education offer, underpinning a number of key aspects:\r\n\u2022 in relation to employability, analysis and management of performance in a pro-active and problem-solving approach, as part of a virtuous cycle with the skills acquired in the classroom;\r\n\u2022 as an opportunity for meta-reflection and self-assessment, highlighting overlaps between technical and professional knowledge and life skills linked to active citizenship;\r\n\u2022 in the personal pathway to actively seeking work.\r\nTo ensure that the school's guidance and work placement policies are sustainable, lasting and effective, we are applying for this project to grow the number of guidance teachers, the school's future career team, which, as part of a plan of work shadowing abroad, develops and refines the following professional competences, to be spent in the actions/steps/phases of guidance for school leavers:\r\n- analysis of the demand in terms of expectations and requests from students leaving the school;\r\n- definition of a skills assessment, using the tools made available by the AlmaDiploma programme and others which will be acquired as part of the experience of work shadowing abroad;\r\n- ensuring the transparency of the student's \"training record\" by building on experiences and skills acquired in non-formal, informal and formal contexts;\r\n- creating, to match demand and emerging skills, a personal career plan towards university or the workplace;\r\n- preparation, monitoring and final reporting of experiences from the work placements organised by the school in collaboration with the host companies; \r\n- career tracking for one or two years from finishing school;\r\n- longer-term: redefinition of the active pathways curriculum at the Martini school, using transferable skills profiles connected to the professional profiles of school leavers.\r\nThe bidders are the 15 teachers who are currently involved in the guidance activities, for both new admissions and leavers; they include various different key individuals in the school: staff, holding instrumental roles, responsible for activities relating to the development of the informal and non-formal student curriculum, vocational career plans, relationships with universities and with the world of work.\r\nThe teachers, using the active learning \"by doing\" methodology, will support colleagues who have proven experience in a European context and with this far-reaching and active approach they will instil the following in the school and the network of schools in the Rotaliana area, of which the Martini school is part: seminars, workshops, discussions and above all the spreading of best practice within the school, between colleagues who will be key to the growth of the project's results.", "http://www.bournville.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT02-KA101-036010_1"], ["2AJ", "Dual MOB - Dual Training through Mobility", "Bournville College of Further Education", 580938.0, "Two of the main problems faced by VET systems in Europe are Early School Leaving (ESL) and the number of students failing to achieve key competences at the end of compulsory education.\r\nVET system has played a main role in fighting these challenges over the years, however in order to continue to tackle early school leaving and equipping students with relevant skills required by the labour market, it is important to foster WBL practices.\r\nMoving from these challenges and considering that the Italian Ministry of Labour and Social Policy launched the Dual System in Italy, the members of the consortium have decided to increase the opportunities for learning mobility during VET pathways that use WBL methodologies.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to promote, within VET courses that adopt WBL methodologies,  learning mobility period abroad. Indeed, WBL and transnational mobility experiences are important to (re)motivate VET learners (preventing early school leaving) and to provide them with the competences required by the companies. \r\n\r\nTherefore the DUAL MOB project will give students the chance to develop technical competences and soft skills \r\nthrough WBL mobility experiences abroad. These experiences will be carried out during VET qualification path and with the final aim of assessing and validating the learning outcomes acquired during the mobility so as to facilitate future inclusion of the young participants in the labor market or to continue their studies.\r\nThe project will involve 300 students (1/3 suffering from economic/social/cultural disadvantage) enrolled in VET courses in one of the 150 VET Centres run by the Consortium Members in 18 Italian Regions. \r\n\r\nThe project has a wide sectorial and geographical coverage. The sectors in which the students will have the chance to take their internship are the following:\r\n- Agribusiness (Backery and Pastry; Agriculture)\r\n- Arts and Crafts (Fashion, Wood)\r\n- Mechanic and Construction (Mechanics, Masonry, Electric, Electronic, Thermo-hydraulic)\r\n- Graphics\r\n- Administrative, Selling\r\n- Tourism and Catering\r\n- Personal Service (Beauty and Hairdressing)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the partnership will involve 16 partners from 6 different countries (ES, IE, UK, FR, DE, FI). Such a wide partnership will result in fruitful experience for the students, suitable to any professional path. \r\n\r\nThe DUAL MOB project promotes 2 different types of Transnational Mobility: 1) 3-4 weeks internships in a company abroad, carried out by students attending an Initial VET course; 2) 3-4 weeks in a VET centre abroad, with periods spent in company or other context, carried out by students attending an Initial VET course. \r\n\r\nThe Learning Outcomes will be valorized and recognized through the ECVET system. In fact, the Consortium Members will take advantage of the experience and the ECVET tools developed during the GORES project. \r\nThe project will have an impact on the development of professional and transversal skills of VET students and staff involved (accompanying persons), as well as on the offer of VET  training provision which will be possible thanks to the improvement in the use of the WBL approach and by strengthening the mutual trust among project partners.\r\n\r\nThis project will also lay the groundwork for enrichment in terms of organizational and teaching methods that the sending organisations may exploit during the pilot project related to the Dual System in Italy.", "http://www.bournville.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005930_11"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["2AP", "RBK", "THE ROYAL ORTHOPAEDIC HOSPITAL"], ["2AP", "RRJ", "ROYAL ORTHOPAEDIC HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B31"}
