At the forefront of combating this issue are low carbon technologies. Recently, HEV (Hybrid Electric Vehicles) have come forward as the most achievable solution of the moment. At present, HEV use expensive Lithium ion and NiM batteries due to their high power to weight ratio. Lead-acid batteries are a cheaper option, but due to their lower power to weight ratio they are not used.\n\nThe MEMLAB project aims to solve this through the development of lightweight electrodes for use in lead-acid batteries. The project will use state-of-the-art fibre production technology to create titanium and aluminium fibre networks. These will be coated in lead and lead oxide. The objective is to achieve a greater than 50% reduction in the overall weight of a lead-acid battery thereby significantly increasing their power to weight ratio making them a realistic alternative for application in hybrid electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition to application in the hybrid electric vehicle market, the replacement of standard lead-acid batteries, containing large and heavy quantities of lead, by lightweight lead-acid batteries will also lead to a significant reduction in the polluting effect of road-going vehicles due to the large quantity of vehicles in use. The number of lead-acid batteries currently manufactured in Europe is approximately 70 million per year.\n\nThe project consortium has been specifically constructed so that the research partners deliver the technical research required by the SME consortium partners. Successful completion of project MEMLAB will significantly strengthen the competitive position of the participating SMEs by both opening new markets, hybrid electric vehicles, and expanding opportunities in existing markets, lead-acid batteries. Furthermore, the project consortium will also seek to identify and evaluate further market applications, for example industrial filtration as well as fuel cells.", 52670.0, 1221355.0, "MEMLAB", "Lighter batteries for cars", "New lightweight electrodes for lead-acid batteries will reduce vehicle emissions and power the next generation of environment-friendly vehicles.", "Climate change can be combated through low carbon technology, which includes the development of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Lithium-ion and nickel-metal hydride batteries are used in HEVs due to their high power-to-weight ratio \u2014 but they are expensive. Lead-acid batteries may be cheaper, but are unsuitable because of their lower power-to-weight ratio.\n\nThe 'Melt spun and sintered metal fibre networks for lead-acid battery advancement' (http://www.memlab.eu (MEMLAB)) project was established to solve this problem by developing lightweight electrodes for lead-acid batteries using state-of-the-art fibre production technology. The fibres are coated with titanium and aluminium to form the battery electrode. This reduces by half the weight of lead-acid batteries, thereby dramatically improving power-to-weight ratio and enabling their use in HEVs.\n\nAround 70 million lead-acid batteries are manufactured in Europe each year. Replacing standard lead-acid batteries with the new lightweight battery will therefore help to reduce the quantity of lead used and limit pollution from road vehicles. \n\nSamples of melt spun aluminium and titanium fibres have already been successfully produced by the MEMLAB consortium. The fibres were characterised using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. In addition, aluminium and titanium metal fibre networks (MFNs) have been manufactured and new methods for the coating of electrode substrates investigated.\n\nMEMLAB is now able to produce MFNs from titanium and aluminium and to deposit lead on top of these MFNs. The performance of these new electrodes and their suitability for application in lead-acid batteries will be assessed.\n\nThe work conducted will help the participating small businesses to compete more effectively in new and existing markets.

Despite the multitude of benefits associated with EVs, some concern has been raised about the possible health effects of electromagnetic field radiation for people who drive these cars.\n\nTo increase public awareness and improve confidence regarding magnetic fields in fully EVs, researchers initiated the EU-funded project 'EM safety and hazards mitigation by proper EV design' (http://www.sintef.no/Projectweb/EM-Safety/ (EM-SAFETY)).\n\nResearchers performed magnetic field measurements on nine different EVs and three ICE cars. Measurements were taken inside the vehicle by a developed flexible monitoring platform with sensors on the head, chest and feet. Results showed that the field intensity was less than 20 % of the limit recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). In the case of gas- or petrol-powered cars, exposure was measured at around 10 % of the limiting value.\n\nBased on the measurements and extensive simulation work, EM-SAFETY developed low-emission cable, connector and design concepts and guidelines for minimising magnetic field exposure further.

The work progressed with experiments on different mammalian cell lines by exposing them to low-frequency magnetic fields under controlled conditions. There was no evidence of any carcinogenic effect of such magnetic fields, nor were cancer cells found to be stimulated to grow by the magnetic fields.\n\nEM-SAFETY contributed to the development of a European standard reference technology platform for EV design that contains architectures, models, and tools for verification, validation and testing.

While some improvements in efficiency of road vehicles have been achieved, continued growth in traffic and congestion mean that CO2 emissions from road transport have grown overall. At the same time rising fuel prices and supply instability also give pressure for increased efficiency.  The EC has set targets for the average CO2 emissions of new vehicles to be 120 g/km by 2012, with further reductions needed to achieve a 40% reduction in CO2 from light passenger vehicles by 2020.  The EE-VERT project will develop technologies that will play a key part in achieving these goals.  Despite improvements in individual areas of the modern vehicle such as powertrain, a considerable amount of energy is wasted due to the lack of an overall on-board energy management strategy.  Further electrification of auxiliary systems (the 'more electric vehicle') promises energy and efficiency gains, but there is a need for a co-ordinated and predictive approach to the generation, distribution and use of energy. In the state-of-the-art, power is generated with little knowledge of the actual loads, and some systems (both electrical and mechanical) consume power continually regardless of demand. The introduction of systems such as alternator set-point control and EPAS are first steps towards optimising energy use but such systems operate in isolation.  This project will develop strategies in conventional vehicles, also applicable to hybrids, for overall energy management (thermal and electrical) to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
