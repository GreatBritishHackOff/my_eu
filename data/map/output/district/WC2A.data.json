There is a growing concern that the loss of therapeutic options will present us with a post-antibiotic era where present and future medical advances are negated.  Resistant bacteria dramatically reduce the possibilities of treating infections effectively, and drastically increase the risk of complications with a fatal outcome.  Antimicrobial resistance, however, is an unavoidable consequence of antibiotic use and therefore new, effective antibacterials will always be needed and once developed should be used carefully, avoiding the overuse which can drive resistance.  Despite the recognized need for new antimicrobials for clinical use, the reality is that only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to market in the last 30 years and many drug developers have left the field.  This urgency is especially true when considering resistant Gram-negative infections where carbapenem-resistance is rising and use of drugs of last resort, such as colistin, is increasing. The New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs (ND4BB) initiative is a series of programmes designed to directly address some of the scientific challenges associated with antibacterial drug discovery and development.  The ND4BB ENABLE consortium will meet the challenges ahead by creating and optimising a portfolio of new antibiotics ranging from Hits through Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe overarching goals of the ENABLE consortium are to: 1) create a drug discovery platform with the expertise and resource base to prosecute multiple antibacterial programmes in parallel; and 2) increase the overall pipeline in the antibacterial area by applying this platform to optimise a variety of antibacterial programmes.  More specifically the key objectives of the consortium are designed to increase the overall pipeline of high quality, novel mode of action medicines to treat serious systemic Gram-negative infections by identifying three antibacterial Leads, two antibacterial Candidates and progressing at least one compound into preclinical and Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe platform group is made up of academics and SMEs from across Europe with the diverse expertise including from clinical microbiology, in vivo pharmacology, computational and medicinal chemistry, ADME profiling, PKPD modelling, pharmaceutics, assay development and screening all needed to undertake this programme.  This group, coupled with additional expertise and advice from within the EFPIA partners, will bring an unrivalled focus and breadth of judgment to this important area of research.  \n\nThe programmes are coming from institutions across Europe, initially with seven efforts from public partners, and arising from a novel discovery stage alliance between GSK and Sanofi.  These initial programmes to be considered for ENABLE cover a diverse landscape of targets and approaches including natural products, PNA-peptides, synthetic small molecules, and follow ups / improvements to medicines already available.  In addition, soon after initiation, ENABLE will launch an open call for additional efforts to create a sustainable portfolio of antibacterial discovery programmes moving forward. \n\nThe ENABLE consortium will provide a unique opportunity for a productive collaboration between leading European academic researchers, SMEs and the pharmaceutical industry. We believe these interactions will be synergistic for everyone concerned. Bringing together different disciplines for the common goals outlined in this proposal will make Europe the world-leader in antimicrobial drug discovery. The creation of a cooperative environment in the lifetime of this project and beyond will fulfill the needs of European society in the battle against antibiotic resistance and make a sustainable impact on the future of antibacterial drug discovery.", 330130.0, 73328047.0, "ENABLE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.helperby.com", null, "fp7_203716_997848507"], ["2AE", "DRIVING RE-INVESTMENT IN R&D AND RESPONSIBLE ANTIBIOTIC USE", "London School of Economics and Political Science", "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is widespread. Its global human and economic burden is tremendous and increasing annually. Yet today only a few pharmaceutical companies retain active antibacterial drug discovery programmes. While the elaboration of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action is scientifically complex, the chief challenge is diminishing incentives. Pre-market regulatory requirements and increased control on post-market access, use, and pricing of new antibiotics are strong deterrents to drug development. Meanwhile, healthcare payers are not currently prepared to reimburse antibiotics at prices that would support the cost of development.\n\nApplied to antibiotics, a simple sales-based economic model contradicts the public health mandate to reduce their consumption in order to preserve their efficacy. Alternative models that can create incentives for the discovery of novel antibiotics and yet reconcile these incentives with responsible antibiotic use are long overdue.\n\nThe multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder DRIVE-AB consortium composed of 16 public and 8 private partners from 12 countries will produce new models in a stepwise yet interconnected process.  To achieve this objective, the DRIVE-AB consortium has put together a strong team that comprises both currently active researchers on the antibiotics problem and new researchers who can bring a fresh perspective as well as experience from other industries, economic specialties, and business cultures. The academic team has been enriched by EFPIA members and stakeholders from various backgrounds. With this diverse, yet closely tied team, DRIVE-AB will deliver fresh, sustainable solutions to this complex problem.\n\nFirst, we will develop an evidence-based, consensus definition for \u201cresponsible antibiotic use,\u201d which, with its standardised quality and quantity indicators, will provide the framework for all later steps. Next, data from surveillance systems, antibiotic prescription databases, and published literature will inform estimations of the present burden of antibiotic resistance from both clinical and economic perspectives across varying socioeconomic backdrops. Simulation models informed by these data as well as data from past and ongoing epidemics will estimate future public health needs and impact related to AMR, again in diverse socioeconomic settings. Together these constructs will allow for valuation models that will estimate the true value of existing and new antibiotics from the perspectives of patients, physicians, payers, and society as a whole. These, in turn, will inform the creation of alternative economic strategies and reward models that will promote and sustain the development of new antibiotics while simultaneously bolstering appropriate use of existing antibiotics. The most promising schemes will be presented to policymakers and other stakeholders with attendant implementation and risk-management strategies.\n\nThis ambitious project will not succeed if it is developed and championed merely by one sector of society, be it academia, \u201cbig pharma,\u201d or public health. The robustness and applicability of the proposed alternative models will only be proportional to their level of input from all involved players. All work from beginning to end will be performed in close collaboration with the consortium\u2019s stakeholder partners, which run the gamut from patients and clinical societies to small- and medium-sized enterprises, large pharmaceutical companies, healthcare payers, public health officials, and government officials. The DRIVE-AB consortium will dedicate considerable resources to this collaboration and to the final dissemination of information to policymakers and the wider public.\n\nOverall, we are confident that the work of the DRIVE-AB consortium will have an immense impact.

Third, social contexts and policies shape individual and family life courses. Building upon these premises we a) explore the growing complexity of family configurations and transitions, b) examine their implications for men, women and children with respect to inequalities in life chances, intergenerational relations and care arrangements, c) investigate how policies address family diversity, d) develop short- and longer-term projections, and e) identify future policy needs.

Fertility rates have declined well below the levels that are necessary for the replacement of the population.\n\nNon-marital cohabitation has become increasingly prevalent, and divorce and separation rates have increased substantially even among couples with children. These changes have also influenced the family life-course, that is the sequence and pace at which certain events (such as marriage, birth, etc.) occur in individuals\u2019 lives. Individual lives are influenced by other family members, kin and broader social networks. The linkages within and between families and generations, and the decisions individuals make in these networks shape the life-courses and their outcomes.\n\nThe societal context also affects the family life-course through policies and norms that may prioritize certain types of families and distribute welfare risks more or less evenly across families and generations. The main processes that shape the family life-course interact with four dimensions: gender, culture, socioeconomic resources and life stages.\n\nBased on this context, the EU-funded project http://www.familiesandsocieties.eu/ (FAMILIESANDSOCIETIES) aims to further the understanding of the development of families in Europe and of the challenges resulting from these developments.

As a comparative aspect, the second experiment was conducted in the United States. It tested emotions with temporal orientation such as articles mentioning relief and anger verses those of hope and fear on the topics of elderly care and gun control.\n\nFindings indicate that positive emotions are more likely than expected to predict media effects. Furthermore, after being exposed to a news article, respondents registered an emotional reaction that led to changes in opinions and behaviours.\n\nA wide range of emotions were tested and an extensive list of moderator variables was used. The collected data can be useful in creating a typology of emotional cues. Results are also valuable to further develop the measurement of emotions and emotional traits in survey experiments.\n\nEMOCITI's work will contribute to the further theoretical integration of emotions into the field of political communication.

The team also assessed effective responses within countries, from national policies to managerial innovations. They identified and elaborated on the role of recruitment agencies, workforce planners, health workers and cross-border arrangements between countries.\n\nHEALTH PROMETHEUS found that health professional mobility affects all EU countries.

The well-researched and scientifically proven CADIC framework provides a sound model. A common language is developed, fostering trust then collaboration within the clusters. Then groups enrich their various business sectors by finding productive niches together. A cooperative, not competitive mindsetguides the SME and service providers through a successful bottom-up cluster-building process, enhancing intellectual capital (IC)-based collaboration.\n\nThe designed benchmarking system enables SMEs to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of their own intangible resource base and compare it with that of other organisations. This helps to identify areas for improvement, which in turn supports management decisions. All worked towards motivated investments on a cluster level. Showing strength simplified communication with the banks and other investors.\n\nTeam members developed and implemented a custom web platform that provided a much-needed tool for motivated SME staff.

Instead, it proposes to evaluate the modalities and limits of this policy by concentrating on the training, motivations, mobility and achievements of these imams, as well as the ways they are perceived by different components of the Turkish diaspora, with special focus on France, the UK and the USA. The interdisciplinary approach at the crossroad of political science, sociology and anthropology will address the political and religious dimensions of the ideology conveyed by the Diyanet imams and question their impact on the Turkish communities settled abroad, in terms of religious practices, political affiliation, integration and possible radicalisation. The comparative perspective will take into account the history and social characteristics of these distinct Turkish diasporas and the different traditions of state/religion relationship in the three countries under study to analyse the strategies of the Diyanet and evaluate its results.

By infusing the MNPs into an extra-corporeal blood loop containing the filter, MediSieve can remove both the pathogens that cause sepsis (bacteria) and the endotoxins that are responsible for the dysregulated immune response which is characteristic of sepsis. Importantly the method would work even in antibiotic resistant cases.\n\nAnnually, there are 1M cases in the US and 900K in Europe, with 135K deaths/year in the EU. Mortality rates are 29-50% with a cost of \u20ac25K per patient. With the aging of global populations sepsis incidence is increasing rapidly (8-13% annually in the decade to 2013).\n\nThe challenge is that both the pathogens and the immune response contribute to the disease. The destruction of bacteria by the immune system or antibiotics creates large quantities of endotoxins, which in turn aggravate the immune response and cause a cascade towards septic shock. MNPs that bind specifically to gram-negative bacteria and endotoxins enable the two targets to be rapidly and safely removed from circulation using MediSieve\u2019s magnetic filter.

Narratives have appeared in many places in the human, social and natural sciences over the past two centuries. They can be found both in accounts of real situations and in simulations of virtual situations, in empirical work and in theorizing. It is clear that narratives have played important roles for scientists well beyond the simple act of reporting. Yet we lack an account of what kinds of thing scientists know from using narrative and how such \u2018narrative knowing\u2019 is constituted. Indeed, with the notable exceptions of medicine and evolutionary biology, even the study of those field narratives, as narratives, has been largely ignored by both historians of science and narrative scholars.\nWhat do scientists gain from using narratives, what functions do narratives play? Initial research shows that scientists have used narratives to figure out what fits together with what, and to create coherence amongst the elements in their research.  But the means of such ordering vary - from site to site, and from science to science. Narratives used to explore a path dependent system in nineteenth century biology used a different mode of ordering both from the configuring narratives of mid-twentieth century case studies in sociology, and from the \u2018how possibly\u2019 narratives of modern computer-based simulations. Such variety requires a broad project, using many case studies to explore the critical role that scientists\u2019 narratives have played in modern science. Making sense of such variety offers an ambitious challenge. But while there is surely no simple answer to why scientists use narratives, all these notions of narrative ordering do have something in common.

This process is commonly termed 'globalisation'. As a result of an increasing lack of balance with regard to the prospects of independent action, social, political and cultural strategies altered dramatically. These strategies have given rise to a discussion concerning the most suitable paradigms with which to analyse global processes. The M.A. in Global Studies is not restricted to a single method of interpretation but is designed to equip highly-qualified students with the ability to contribute to this forward-looking debate, an essential qualification for enhancing one's prospects in the contemporary labour market. The programme, despite its various approaches their necessary combinations, takes global connections as a starting point for the understanding of globalisation. It views globalisation as follows: 1. Globalisation is not only a phenomenon of past centuries but requires a greater historical perspective. 2. It cannot be merely reduced to economic processes and social consequences but must also investigate the approval and disapproval of political and cultural developments. 3. It cannot only be analysed as a global process of homogenisation but also from the perspective of Regional and Area Studies. 4.  It is also subject to interpretation, perspective and intellectual environment. Depending on the individual mobility track it is possible to specialise in particular areas of globalisation research e.g. historical as well as comparative analysis of global entanglements, methods of global history, economic and social history of globalisation, global political economy, global governance, analysis of transformation processes in Central and Eastern Europe and development studies.An international experienceA number of EU-funded scholarships are offered to the best qualified candidates.Career prospectsUpon successful completion of this researched based Master\u2019s course, students qualify for PhD studies and for a variety of job opportunities in practice e.g. in cross- national and supranational agencies, non-governmental organizations, as intercultural mediator or in the field of development cooperation, economy and management. Diploma\tSuccessful students of the European Master 'Global Studies' will receive a Master of Arts in Global Studies. Depending on their mobility track a double degree (in case it contains Roskilde and/or London School of Economics) or joint degree (in all other cases) will be issued. The degree will be accompanied by a diploma supplement, which contains further information about the educational university systems used in the Consortium, the qualifications gained by the student during the participation in the programme and her/his mobility track.Website: www.globalstudies-masters.info", "http://www.lse.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_159647-EPP-1-2015-1-DE-EPPKA1-EPQR_5"], ["2AE", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE", 51558.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.lse.ac.uk", "LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-012594_coordinator"], ["2AP", "\u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03c9 \u039c\u03c5\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a0\u03b1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bd\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd \u03a1\u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd", "LSESU Board Games Society", 30437.0, "The project \u201cIntercultural Education through role playing games and mythology\u201d offers an innovation in teaching methods in the sense that traditional lecture is replaced by actual experience.\r\nThe general concept of the project is that 60 people from 3 different European countries will meet in Athens where split in groups, they will collaborate under the supervision of the coordinators (about 10 of the 60 participants) for the creation of a fantasy mythological setting within which they will subsequently act as players. During the setting creation process, the coordinators will provide guidelines and restrictions to the participants that will have been agreed between the coordinators at the preparatory phase. This will ensure game focus on one of the project's main aims, the understanding of European Union shared values such as freedom, solidarity, respect towards minorities etc. After the setting is complete, the participants will take the role of specific characters who act in this setting and will collaboratively face challenges that will have been prepared by the coordinators. Cooperation between the players is established by the fact that each character will have a restricted set of skills in the setting whereas for success to be accomplished several skills will be required. In the end of each day during the event, every player will participate in reflection meetings supervised and guided by the coordinators in order to discuss their views on the challenges and the European shared values they corresponded to.\r\nApart from the understanding of the European Union shared values, one of the project's main goals is the development of a strong European identity among the participants and the creation of a core group that will act in the youth sector at a local, national and international level. This core group will try to evolve into an active, multinational and multicultural European community that is interested in passing European Union shared values and ideas to new people in the rest of Europe. The core group creation goal will be achieved during the event as the coordinators will use team-building techniques to make sure that all participants are collaborating in a friendly, pleasant environment. Besides these, several social, communication and English language skills will be practiced and knowledge of several mythologies (primarily the Greek one) will be acquired by participants. Last but not least, the project aims to further develop the teaching method that will be used during the event.\r\nThe project will be completed in 3 phases: in the first, preparatory phase, all practical amendments will be taken care of (flights reservations, accommodation etc), research on several ethnic mythologies will be undergone and in general all necessary action will be taken to ensure the event runs smoothly, without surprises and with the expected learning outcomes. Phase 2 is the actual youth exchange in Athens, while in phase 3 coordinators will contact participants to write down their impressions and assist them to take initiative at a local level to expand the community and multiply the benefits of the event.\r\nParticipants will be chosen through informal youth groups that act in the youth and role-playing games sectors. All partners will do their best to include as participants young people with less opportunities, mainly youths with educational and financial difficulties. The collaborative framework within which the event will have been structured (coordinators will make sure that all teams formed during the event will have members of each and every nationality and background and will do their best to keep people moving among teams to amplify inter-cultural relations) will help participants understand European Union shared values and how these are perceived by European citizens of different culture.
