In 2015 it is expected that the number of hydrogen fuel installations will exceed a hundred thousand units.\n\nBecause hydrogen can react explosively with air there is inevitably public apprehension about using hydrogen as a mass market fuel that can inhibit wider commercialisation. Technical issues regarding hydrogen storage leakage are (i) the small size of the H molecule which causes it to diffuse through relatively open structured materials such as composites, and (ii) the phenomenon of Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE) which seriously reduces the strength of metals in extended contact with hydrogen. In order to greatly improve public confidence in the safety of hydrogen fuel, to address the technical issues, and thus facilitate the rapid commercialisation of hydrogen powered road transport, this project will develop a technology that will detect leaks and structural weakening of containment vessels caused by HE. This will prevent catastrophic failure of vessels which can actually occur before even small leaks arise.

This planning approach is in line with the European energy policy objectives to ensure the reliable delivery of renewable electricity and the pan-European electricity market integration. For this foresight exercise, five European power system scenarios have been developed.\n\nThe resulting modular development plan (to be delivered by the end of 2015) will depict the route towards different pan-European grid architectures, addressing each of the five scenarios which impact the pan-European transmission network most.

Fouling shortens the plant life, increases the need for periodic cleaning and pipe replacement. It also causes contamination of the end products which is especially serious when the fouling involves bacterial biofilms and the products are intended for direct human consumption. In addition pipe blockages, deformation, rupture or corrosion cause by a build up of fouling can lead to major incidents such as explosions involving with threats to human life and plant destruction involving loss of product and jobs. In domestic pipes fouling causes taps and valves to seize up and leaks to occur which leads to expensive plumbing costs in replacement parts, high labour costs, expensive repairs from flood damage and disruption to domestic life. ULTRACLEANPIPE offers a novel solution to the general problem of identifying and then removing fouling in industrial plant as well as domestic plumbing. The system prototype will be designed for application to small bore pipes that arise in the food processing and pharmaceuticals production industry as well as in plumbing systems. This focus is taken because (i) small bore pipes are obviously much more prone to than large ones and (ii) contamination of products intended for human consumption is a problem of the highest order.

The Convention requires ships to have Ballast Water Treatment (BWT) system installed by 2016. BWT is an evolving technology. However, it is generally accepted across industry that viable BWT consist of at least 2 stages targeting both macro and micro IS separately. Filtration is generally as the 1st stage and according to a Lloyd register survey and one we conducted ourselves, UV seem to be relatively the most preferred 2nd stage treatment as the water treated by UV seems to have the least effect on the environment and the ship. UV treated water is less likely to cause corrosion of the ballast tanks compared to other commonly used treatment such as Electrolysis. However, they have the highest operation cost/m3 and their performance can be affected by water turbidity and frigidity. Hence, as UV is the most preferred and with the highest cost of ownership, the rest of the market will migrate towards UV systems if effort can be made to reduce the ownership cost and overall performance issues for a given water turbidity and frigidity level.

ECM micro-machining \u2014 a non-conventional metalworking process \u2014 was on the up when the project was launched in 2010.\n\nIn a bid to raise standards, ?ECM partners focused on pulsed ECM, which is faster and within the range of conventional machining speeds. The development of a power supply unit with the capability of generating pulses of nanoseconds' duration allowed overcoming limitations encountered with conventional ECM. The pulse signal applied to electrodes generates high instantaneous currents with sharp ripples, which are beneficial for metal removal.\n\nSpecifically, during machining, the electrodes at micrometre distance are located relative to the workpiece. The gap between them is filled with a flowing, aqueous electrolyte. With each pulse, an electrical potential is established between the electrodes and the workpiece, causing controlled removal of the electrically conductive material. As each pulse is followed by a longer off-time, the system relaxes and by-products are removed.\n\nSuch a process involves heavy time-accurate calculations necessary to obtain the current density. Therefore, the ?ECM researchers proposed a new simulation method that reduces the computational effort and increases machining accuracy. Furthermore, the life span of micro-machined parts is increased with the potential for significant cost efficiencies across the automotive, medical device and aerospace industries.\n\nOne example of how the new pulsed ECM technology can benefit SMEs is the manufacturing of fuel injection nozzles in diesel cars. Nozzles manufactured with the new micro-machining technique will be able to operate at higher pressure.

Real and virtual 3D content will be homogeneously combined/mixed producing a novel form of rich and interactive content, defined as '3D Holoscopic content'. 3D Holoscopic imaging is a technique for creating full colour 3D optical models that exist in space independently of the viewer.

The continuous nature of the images produced with this method eliminates the effect of cardboarding (flattening of objects into discrete depth planes) and flipping (a visible effect created by moving between image fields) present in multiview stereoscopic systems. Unlike multiview stereoscopy, information about a point is contained in many different parts of the image plane. In this respect 3D Holoscopic imaging is akin to holography.

Telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein enzyme that maintains linear chromosomal DNA ends by the addition of TTAGGG repeats, is completely repressed or present only at low, tightly regulated levels in normal human cells as a safeguard against cancer. Normally, telomere shortening in the absence of sufficient telomerase leads to telomere uncapping, activation of a DNA damage response, and either replicative senescence or apoptosis. Paradoxically, however, under certain conditions (when damage response pathways are defective, eg through p53 gene mutation) unchecked telomere shortening can generate a chronic genomic instability that drives and accelerates clonal evolution and cancer progression. As a result, telomeres are dysfunctional in human cancers.  Individual protein components of the core telomere higher-order structure (known as the telosome, or the \u2018shelterin\u2019 complex) represent highly promising candidates for novel biomarkers of telomere dysfunction and human cancer progression.
