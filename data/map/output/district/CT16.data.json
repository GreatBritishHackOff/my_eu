The company has been one of the leading providers for food logistics in Germany and Europe for many years. As an internationally operating company, there is always a need to employ well-trained, qualified and internationally competent staff. The internationalisation and the smooth process and work flows for quality assurance within the company group require language skills, basic and additional skills of the employees as well as openness for new approaches and working methods in addition to expertise and professional experience in the area of human resources. As a company that takes on trainees, the Nagel-Group directs its strategy towards the future and tries to meet the demand with HR development concepts starting from the training period due to the adjustment of the European vocational training to the changing requirements and the modernisation of the labour market. As part of the project \u201cEuropean mobility in the Nagel-Group\u201d, 69 trainees in total are supposed to visit 13 European countries between 01.07.2014 and 30.06.2016 for four weeks. The foreign branches of our company group are the project partners. Our project partners know the quality standards of the company group. The process, the organisation and the contents of the exchange at a branch are agreed and coordinated before each project. In principle, each trainee of the Nagel-Group should receive the offer to take advantage of an exchange at a branch. At the beginning of their training, all trainees are informed about this opportunity. The efficient trainees are chosen for the exchange in the 2nd/3rd training period in personal discussions according to the quality standards. Moreover, the participants should have at least a good command of English. The training supervisors of the sending and destination country as well as the central training supervisor organise, coordinate and control the project. A detailed plan of processes and a schedule together with the respective learning goals are determined for each trainee. The participants are prepared for the stay abroad by participating in a preparatory seminar. In the course of the stay abroad, the trainees get an insight into the operational activities of the company (export operations, transport planning, insurance, accounting, customer management). In addition to the basic skills, such as expertise, the ability to work in a team and collaboration, the trainees should acquire and improve additional skills, such as independence, the ability to manage stressful situations and endurance, openness for different working methods and cultures as well as communication. The knowledge and skills achieved are used especially when coping with tasks in an international forwarding company or an international department. The experiences acquired by the participants ensure a better process and work flow and contribute to a prevention of disturbance factors and problems. In some cases, the trainees are employed in one of the foreign branches for a longer period of time after having completed the vocational training. In this case, the exchange serves as basis of decision-making on both sides. The implementation of the project is to ensure that the company group can have a well-trained staff prepared for the internationalisation. On account of the support within the subsidies of the programme of the European Union of Eramus + the number of the participants can increase the Nagel-Group on at least 15 percent as well as improve the expiry and organisation processes in the establishments with lower stay amount and optimise.
