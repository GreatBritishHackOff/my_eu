The town has a relatively high level of unemployment and is quite insular. Through this project we hope to broaden pupils horizons as well as increase their knowledge of the Spanish language in readiness for the new Spanish GCSE. examination.  At present Spanish is taught to nearly all pupils in the school by two Spanish teachers. For the participating teachers, Spanish is their third foreign language and consequently they are seeking to extend their own degree of fluency in the language which will then also be disseminated to pupils.\r\n  The project entails 2 mobilities to Spain. The first, which would be during Easter 2018 would be a week's course at a language school in Granada, where lessons would be tailor made to fit participants' needs. During the course the participants would live with one of the course organiser's families, which would further consolidate their knowledge and ameliorate their use of the Spanish language.\r\nThe 2nd mobility would entail job shadowing in a secondary  school in Spain, with the objective of gaining a greater insight into the Spanish education system, importing to Wales any effective teaching and learning techniques used , further improving language skills and establishing links with schools in the Granada area, with a  view to starting an Erasmus + partnership project.\r\nThe greatest impact we would like to see from this project is that the participants' level of fluency increases. particularly when using spontaneous Spanish in the classroom. As a consequence pupils' levels of Oracy would also improve, as pupil confidence would increase as increasingly more Spanish was spoken in the classroom. The school's international profile would be substantially enhanced by this project which would be disseminated widely in the region and beyond.", "http://www.glanymorschool.co.uk", "Ysgol Glanymor School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035869_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SA16"}
