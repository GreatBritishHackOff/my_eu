Objectives of the proposal will be reached through the realization of 9 WPs. WP1 will develop diagnostic kits to predict quality and safety of raw material and final product. WP2 will develop process control aids based on non-destructive and rapid evaluation. WP3 will develop decision support tools in very critical points of processing chain. WP4 will investigate innovative processes to improve quality and safety of fresh-cut products. Technological innovations will go through implementation and demonstration in WP5 and through an economic evaluation approach in WP6. Results will represent valuable information in order to re-visit and improve good practice procedures or, to define a more efficient management system for quality and safety (in WP7). Finally results will be disseminated to potential users in WP8, while WP9 will consist of the management of the consortium. The participants are 14, of 7 Countries including 6 SMEs, 2 public research Institutes and 6 Universities, assorted in terms of scientific and technological expertise. The presence of SME will ensure the exploitation of the results directly and indirectly. Potential impacts of the results of this project may be related to the increase of scientific evidences about safety and quality, expansion of consumer awareness, increase of the innovation capacity of the industry strengthening its competitiveness, provision of scientific evidences to the EC and other health authorities (also for campaigns for healthy nutrition), and a reference point to mass media.", 93236.0, 3301203.0, "QUAFETY", "Keeping fresh-cut produce tasty and safe for consumption", "Fresh-cut fruit and vegetables are rapidly gaining in popularity across Europe. A research project is addressing the risk of foodborne diseases associated with the consumption of this ready-to-eat (RTE) food category.", "The preparation of RTE fresh produce is missing one important step: treatment that reduces the final microbial count. This represents an underestimated public health risk, with high possibility that some products carry pathogenic bacteria or other contaminants. Another factor for consideration has to do with quality attributes such as appearance, texture, flavour, and nutritional value.\n\nSupported by EU funding, the 'Comprehensive approach to enhance quality and safety of ready to eat fresh products' (http://www.quafety.eu/ (QUAFETY)) project tackles these challenges. With the overall goal of improving on safety and quality of such produce, the project is considering both industry and consumers in its development of useful kits and tools.\n\nWork has been divided across nine areas, six of which cover diagnostic kits, process control aids, decision support tools, innovative processes, technological innovations, economic evaluation. Final results will inform the development of a more efficient quality and safety management system for dissemination to potential users. The consortium is made up of 14 partners from seven countries and includes small businesses, public research institutes and universities.\n\nVarious studies related to the detection of pathogens have resulted in an optimised protocol for extracting bacterial DNA from vegetables. The results are important for the development of diagnostic kits.\n\nAnother achievement lies in the development of process control tools for non-destructive and rapid evaluation. Work in this area involved identifying nutritional and functional markers for processing and storage conditions.\n\nThe project team has made progress in the development of tools supporting critical points in the fresh-cut processing chain. Studies investigated various factors that may affect the quality of fresh-cut produce such as melons, rocket leaves, and fruit salads. Findings relate to suitable cultivars, cutting size, atmosphere, packaging and respiration rate.\n\nIn other work, QUAFETY explored different innovative processes for improving quality and safety of final product. Related findings highlight the benefits of alternative methods for water treatment and product disinfection, and thermal decontamination for controlling and reducing microbial growth during storage. Scientists also developed a hands-off watermelon cutting concept that has been confirmed experimentally.\n\nResults to date have been disseminated to potential users through websites, seminars, courses, conferences and papers.

Our aim is to develop a core scientific platform from which novel non-invasive drug delivery systems can be developed and clinically assessed. At the core of this project lies the hypothesis that microneedle assisted topical drug delivery has failed to fulfil expectations because researchers have routinely over estimated the scale of permeation enhancement possible using passive microneedle treatment and also, in general, have targeted unsuitable therapeutic molecules. This project aims to address both of these issues by developing new formulation and fabrication approaches. Combining physical disruption of the stratum corneum barrier with microneedle arrays and a number of active permeation enhancement techniques (such as iontophoresis and phonophoresis) will produce a range of novel hybrid permeation enhancement systems (HPES).  The project will focus on high potency therapeutics possessing low therapeutic concentrations that make only realistic demands on delivery systems. Such high potency materials are of increasing importance in therapeutics but are inherently difficult to work with because of the health and safety implications of their high activity. The project pools the expertise of a number of international partners with particular expertise in specific aspects of the approach.\n\nThree clinically interesting target areas have been identified for evaluation:\n1.

The project will also focus on medical issues and on the relevant ethical dilemmas. SGL for USaR has marshaled a pan-European interdisciplinary project team to produce a well-balanced consortium of 21 partners including rescue teams, researchers and SMEs along with the support of 15 LOIs. The project is formed by eight sub-projects (work packages) running in parallel. These WPs address the development of simulation environments; the development and validation of portable devices for location operations; the development and validation of smart sensors environment for monitoring the situation under the ruins; the management of medical information, including privacy and bioethics; and finally the development of an ICT platform that will integrate all the previous data, ensure interoperability and control the flow of the information from the field to the operational center. SGL for USaR will deliver methods and guidelines, as well as, tangible prototypes: a stand-alone FIRST responder device that integrates five different location methods (five in one); a networked rapid casualty location system (REDS) equipped with wireless sensor probes; an advanced environmental simulator for training and testing search and rescue units, including canine teams; and a prototype mobile operational command and control platform.

Typically, rescuers will not know how many victims they should be looking for, or whether they are alive or dead. The best solution to date has been rescue dogs.\n\nDevising a higher-technology option has been the 'Second generation locator for urban search and rescue operations' (http://www.sgl-eu.org/ (SGL FOR USAR)) project. The 21-member project ran for four years to the end of October 2012. The project received approximately EUR 4.9\u00a0million in funding, with which it aimed to develop sensor technologies for rescuing victims trapped in collapsed buildings. The project's broad aims included detection and identification of human chemical signatures and integration of sensors into operational devices. Another aim was to combine the technologies into a single portable data- and resource-managing platform. \n\nThe project succeeded in its goals and developed an innovative portable system. The system includes sensor probes and an integrated Remote Early Detection System (REDS) for monitoring voids. The project first had to build an entrapment simulator, an odour simulator, and a first responder portable device. The system depends on modules, developed by the project, which detect chemical markers indicating human breath, sweat and urine, plus corpses. A further system analyses metabolite traces from breath for data to estimate victims' medical status. The project's core results also include algorithms for acoustic analysis of sounds within building rubble, and a system enabling wireless communication inside and around the collapsed structure. \n\nProject members developed two complete prototypes. A portable device incorporated an ion spectrometer for detection of key chemical tracers. A second prototype (the REDS) continuously monitors the large-scale situation at disaster scenes. Testing using pig carcasses as substitutes for human victims verified the ability to detect and identify key compounds. An additional system supports rescuer safety by identifying risks in the operational area.\n\nThe result of SGL FOR USAR will be systems that detect human traces in the rubble of collapsed buildings.

The game itself is set in present day Wales and you play as Lucy Moss, a student with a fascination in the supernatural. One weekend, she travels to Sker House, South Wales, a private residence with a macabre history which has recently been converted into a seaside inn. She plans to write an article for the university magazine about a supposed haunting, but when she arrives, she meets the landlord who seems to have a lot to hide. Soon, it becomes apparent that all is not well at Sker House. An air of oppression hangs over it, while misery, tragedy and ill-fortune are commonplace. Gradually, it becomes clear that the true depth of the mystery goes far beyond a mere historical haunting. This is a place where bad things happen, and evil lurks. Little by little Lucy falls under Sker's dark spell, and as she begins to unravel the mysteries of the past, she realizes that nothing stays buried forever.
