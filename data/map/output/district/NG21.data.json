Typically, the wind around buildings is too turbulent and slow to be of much use. Normal turbines need to be placed high above them which is expensive and attracts planning objections.  If buildings could be used to augment turbine airspeeds, it\u2019s estimated that the potential for energy capture in the built environment could exceed 10 TWh, creating CO2 savings of approximately 4 Megatonnes by 2020.   We will develop a retro-fittable roof-mounted module that will be almost invisible from street level. It will accentuate the low pressure zone over a flat roof parapet and link it to high-pressure static air beneath using a tapered duct. The air speed in such a duct has been shown to exceed the free wind by more than 30%. Power increases with the square of air velocity, so a turbine in this region will generate more than double the power of a conventional turbine, and as a ducted fan it will cause significantly less noise and vibration.  Further, we will use passively-warmed air injection to create a vortex in the duct, raising generator output by another 40%.  The vortex can heat or chill air directly which, coupled to powered passive ventilation, might augment a building\u2019s air conditioning and offset power consumption, cutting payback time still further.  The potential EU market for building integrated wind turbines is \u20ac345m and we believe that we can capture a high proportion (20%) of it. Conventional wind turbines typically have payback periods of 15-30 years (depending on location) and our system has the potential to reduce this to 5 years.  Regardless of the level of augmentation, this approach will significantly improve urban wind power viability and make wind power possible in wind-rich but planning-sensitive areas such as seaside towns and national park hillsides for the first time.", 180730.0, 1217378.0, "ROOF-CAPTURE", "Mini wind farms for urban roof tops", "Novel technology is exploiting the wind sweeping over the roofs of city buildings. It could soon provide power, heat and cooling for these structures and significantly reduce dependence on fossil fuel combustion.", "Despite the intensity felt when standing at the railing of a terrace on a tall building, the wind on top of buildings is typically too turbulent and slow to be of much use in powering a turbine. Scientists decided to accelerate and channel the wind with EU funding of the project 'Innovative design for wind energy capture in urban environments' (ROOF-CAPTURE) for a micro-generation solution in new or retrofit buildings.\n\nThrough knowledge developed regarding air flow over the flat roof surface and a model of how to accelerate it, scientists developed a modular system in which 5-metre\u2013long modules can be connected in parallel and extended along the roofline of the building. Photovoltaic (PV) and aerodynamic elements increase airflow through multiple small wind turbines, enabling them to significantly enhance overall output. Intelligent control maximises the system efficiency by optimising the positioning of either solar or wind energy harvesters depending on the best available resource at the time.\n\nCareful attention was given to ensure that the prototype system would be financially feasible and provide return on investment within 5 years in comparison to conventional wind turbines that typically have a payback period of 15\u201330 years. The prototype is installed and undergoing testing, expected to provide power, heating and passive ventilation to its host building with significant cost savings and a reduction in harmful emissions. Designed to be barely visible from the street level, the novel modular ROOF-CAPTURE systems could even make a significant impact on energy supply in windy seaside resort towns and national park hillsides.\n\nBigger is not always better and ROOF-CAPTURE's micro-turbines are proving the point when it comes to renewable forms of energy for urban locations. The combined PV and aerodynamic elements could ensure that buildings get the energy they need \u2014 sustainably \u2014 when the Sun is shining or there is a breeze.", "http://www.roofcapture.eu", null, "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58238.jpg", "fp7_92579_996512720"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NG21"}
