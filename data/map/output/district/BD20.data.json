Aside from the social costs in terms of suffering, they account for 70% on European average of public healthcare systems in the EU. A plethora of ICT based applications have been developed in the last years, allowing to tackle at least partially problems related to specific pathologies. However, even advanced experiences have had limited impact, mostly focusing on pilot applications entailing little or no change on the whole healthcare system. The RICHARD project arises from the need to make healthcare systems more efficient while managing effectively their costs. ICT can be a major change agent in this process, but only if systemic aspects are duly taken into account, such as the interrelation of ICT with organisational and non-technological components of healthcare systems. To do so, a significant shift is necessary to evolve from an application based model, to a comprehensive and sustainable chronic care model, likely to be adapted to the broadest possible range of chronic conditions. The RICHARD project will therefore focus its analysis on the pathologies-specific ICT applications being implemented in leading European regions and elaborate a Joint Action Plan oriented to the integration of those technologies for the deployment of sustainable chronic care models for European regions. This will require a strong coordination of research resources and innovation stakeholders (clearly identified in the first phase of the project) to design new research paths and innovation models. The Joint Action Plan will also be inspired by a medium-long term vision that looks at e-health services into a perspective of economic growth for the regions along the principles of open competition for better and pan-European healthcare services. In this respect the project plans to build upon strategic initiatives already undertaken within each participating region.", 123496.0, 2655466.0, "RICHARD", "Regional ICT clusters for healthcare and R&D", "Four European Regional Clusters are developing models for the care of chronic conditions, with a focus on diabetes, cognitive diseases and stroke derived impairments.", "Since now, tele-health applications for the care of chronic conditions had  a limited success, and often they did not get over their experimentation phase.  More than for technical reasons, this is due  to the level of readiness of the Health Systems to support a organizational, cultural, regulatory, infrastructural changes.\n\nThe 'Regional ICT-based clusters for healthcare applications and R&D integration' (Richard) project intends to facilitate the definition and the implementation of novel models, using ICT, for managing chronic conditions in four regions (Tuscany in Italy, Lodz in Poland, Vasterbotten in Sweden and Yorkshire in the United Kingdom), leveraging on the direct cooperation of Health authorities with the Academic and Enterprise actors  (the triple helix concept) on a shared Joint Action Plan.\n\nThe team also recruited a set of external experts who formed an Advisory Committee assessing the implementation of these Joint Actions.\n\nFirst, the project identified major barriers to the implementation of tele-health services across Europe based on scientific literature. The next step was to develop a telehealth implementation toolkit (the Ready Steady Go toolkit, http://clahrc-sy.nihr.ac.uk/resources-project-reports.html)  to support stakeholders in defining, implementing and delivering effective tele-Health services.  The toolkit was developed in collaboration with the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care for South Yorkshire (NIHR CLAHRC SY).\n\nA third step was to exchange detailed information about pilots and models already in place in the four regions and to  cooperate to facilitate the cross adoption of them (mentoring activities).\n\nFinally, the project team published the acquired information in 4 languages (see http://www.richardproject.eu) and participated in 20 conferences presenting their strategy. They have also published a brochure, generated four press releases and participated in four web/radio programmes.\n\nThe Richard programme could be viewed as a reference initiative to improve Chronic Care management in Europe using ICT. Implementation of the project will help to combine resources, consolidate regional clusters on tele-health and disseminate the findings among further regions in Europe.", null, "http://www.airedale-trust.nhs.uk", "/docs/results/images/2013-03/54312.jpg", "fp7_95879_985073704"], ["5LN", "Integrated Thermal Energy Reduction, Recovery & Re-use in Autoclave based Composites Processing", "Premier Autoclaves Service and Solutions Ltd", "Our Idea is to develop an integrated, computer controlled, heat recovery, reuse & thermal energy management system centred on the autoclave with re-use of thermal energy in the post-cure ovens or autoclaves, and possibly in the clean room air filtration/cooling system. The proposed system will extract heat from the autoclave to match existing cooling rates that are specified by material manufacturers. The heat will be stored in a specially designed thermal store at the highest enthalpy possible to maximise opportunities for re-use. We aim to reduce initial energy use in the autoclave by at least 25% through reduction of the autoclave headspace and recover 50% of the energy wasted at the end of the autoclave processing stage for re-use in other energy intensive heating processes such as the post cure process. In addition, we aim to recover compressed air (with its intrinsic compression energy and heat from the autoclave) and heat from the air compressors that create the 7 to 10 bar pressure and integrate this with the system.\n\nOur proposed technology would have a major impact on end-users and the environment. In summary we could achieve energy savings of 639,000 kWhr per system p.a; equating to \u20ac66,000 in end-user increased gross profit potential per system p.a. and would reduce CO2 emissions by 318 Tonnes p.a.", 232714.0, 1192696.0, "ENRSYS", "Recovering energy from autoclaves", "Engineers are advancing a system to recover energy from industrial autoclaves.

There are currently over 2\u00a0000 active industrial autoclaves in the world, and, after each curing cycle, excess heat and pressure is simply released into the environment.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Integrated thermal energy reduction, recovery  &  re-use in autoclave based composites processing' (http://www.enrsys.eu (ENRSYS)) project is advancing a prototype system to recover that excess energy for reuse.\n\nInitially, researchers identified the major sources of recoverable energy. This included heat energy released from cooling autoclave water and fan motors, and kinetic energy from the release of air pressure.\n\nThey also generated a large body of knowledge related to the efficiency, system constraints and operation of composite curing systems. This work forms part of the research needed to inform the design of a prototype that could be integrated into a real-world operational environment.\n\nENRSYS estimates indicate that yearly savings of between EUR\u00a040\u00a0000 and 80\u00a0000 could be obtained by implementing the energy-recovery system in development. Exact figures depend on the weight of the load inside the autoclaves, but generally speaking, the payback on installing such a system would be significant.", null, "http://www.premierautoclaves.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/144531.jpg", "fp7_105758_938231337"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BD20"}
