By extracting the context under which the knowledge is generated in a network (e.g. goals, teams, temporal and spatial aspects), it is possible to enrich it to be more effectively used within future work.<br/>In order to explore such hypothesis, the project intends to answer several problems: how to efficiently monitor/trace a process of generation/usage of knowledge in the network so that this knowledge can be re-used for future work; how to extract context from this process; and how to enrich the knowledge generated with extracted context to support knowledge sharing in future network activities. <br/>By solving these problems, K-NET will allow the development of new services to manage social interactions allowing to effectively monitor the (collaborative) knowledge generation/usage processes (specifically addressing knowledge provided/contained in 'smart' devices), services to automatically extract context from such processes and enrich the knowledge, and KM services applying extracted context to support use of this knowledge in the network, with special emphasis on knowledge representation services (considering e.g. IPR and privacy issues). <br/>These services will open new business opportunities for networked enterprises to provide new products/services. K-NET will develop generic services, applicable across different domains, and specifically explore new business opportunities in manufacturing and engineering SMEs.

There is a lack of ICT systems/tools to support product/process design for energy efficiency of installations.A critical issue in energy use optimisation of manufacturing processes is availability of knowledge on actual energy consumption patterns within such processes. Ambient Intelligent (AmI) systems integrated in manufacturing installations may support energy efficiency of processes through extended services and provide such knowledge to optimise process design from energy efficiency point of view.A generic methodology and SOA-based context-sensitive services which can be easily added/integrated in the existing design systems will be developed: Energy Dependency Selector \u2013 pre-design stage planning of which equipment to use for meeting both specs and energy efficiency over the process life cycle for Eco-Design by applying TRIZ methodology, Energy Monitoring Setup \u2013 design of AmI systems and extended services to ensure energy efficiency of the installed process, Energy Analyser \u2013 multi-factor and multivariable optimisation of energy efficiency of process, Energy Simulator \u2013 what-if life cycle scenarios with stochastic inputs simulated to quantify the effects of different configurations.3 existing product/process design systems will be enhanced with these generic SW services and such integrated solutions will be tested for collaborative design using data from real manufacturing environments.
