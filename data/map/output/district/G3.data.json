Joblessness lasting more than 6 months is a major factor preventing young people from getting (re)hired, with potentially grave consequences: lost production, increased social spending, decreased tax revenue and slower growth. On a personal level the impact on the young job seeker is no less devastating and includes; loss of confidence & self-reliance, depending on social benefits, etc. Policy makers & academics are now asking whether an improving economy might absorb those young workers in time to prevent long-term economic damage. In any given month, a newly jobless young worker has about 20 to 30 % chance of finding a new job. By the time s/he has been out of work for 6 months, though, the chance drops to 1 in 10. The skills mismatch on youth labour markets has become a persistent & growing trend. \r\nMany of these young people are not only early-school leavers, lacking qualifications, relevant skills & work experience but more & more it affects third-level graduates who cannot find a first job. Nordstr\u00f6m/Skans (2011) show that an unemployment spell of more than 51 days subsequent graduation increases the probability of unemployment 5 years later. By request of the Scottish Government (SG) & Edinburgh Capital City Partnership (CCP), Skills Development Scotland (SDS), Ingeus & the Joined Up for Jobs network we will do anything in our power to support recent graduates from VET-schools in their Journey to Work. That's why WS has submitted an Erasmus+ another application for a KA1 project Journey to work (JTW4) (see PM's). \r\nJTW4 is for 12 recent graduates up to 30 years old, who are in unemployment (benefit). We will target the 3 groups of recent graduates (5-5 & 5 incl. fewer opportunities) from VET-schools pre-dominantly when they enter the social benefits system. \r\nJTW4 from Werkcenter Scotland (WS) and its Model, the 1-2-3 methodology (\"EU Good Practice 2006, 2012 & 2014')  will deliver work experience to recent graduates from VET schools as they are asked by potential employers about their work experience before they even have the chance to obtain any work experience. \r\nWS & the approach of the host organisation DFW2W is used to support and guide recent graduates in getting & improving new knowledge, skills and qualifications to facilitate personal development and responsibility to obtain basic  work experience & qualifications and/or participation on the local, national and EU labor market. A fresh Spanish Partner AEBL, social media experts will join this proven project\r\nDFW2W is a very experienced partner and has been our partner in YfEj, From Work to Work, JTW 1,2 and 3 and is specifically chosen for their apprenticeships  and specialization in the Dutch Rotterdam area and the Green Heart inside the Randstad area. DFW2W has an educational social inclusion approach & they use person-centered planning & action-based learning processes. DFW2W has a very broad range of apprenticeships in the fields of Welfare, Work, Income, Health & Care & Public Affairs. WS will tackle passivity, youth unemployment in JTW4 & aim to reduce the number of recent graduates without a job on a small scale. We place recent graduates on a structured JTW. WS & DFW2W both have extensive international experience with similar successful projects. AEBL is a relative new player, but is already a well known partner for WS and DFW2W.\r\n\r\nThe 1-2-3 Methodology of WS has 3 phases:\r\nAssessment(1): 4-8 weeks (Preparation)\r\nDevelopment(2): 6 weeks (apprenticeship)\r\nJob Mediation(3): 4-20 weeks (Job Mediation)\r\nIn the assessment phase the preparation training JTW4 takes place. This is required to get the recent graduates from VET-schools ready for the internships abroad, a young person who demonstrates correct behaviour will be rewarded and allowed to the Development Phase abroad Holland or Spain (special Needs). This is then followed up by a further intensive Welfare to Work programme delivered by CCP & the Joined Up for Jobs network, SDS & Ingeus  on the young person's return to Scotland. \r\nUpon returning to UK, WS expects (based on experience with the YfEj & FW2W and Journey to Work projects) the following results: \r\n- 70% of the started recent graduates from VET schools will positively sustain the assessment phase. Under the conditions as described earlier they will be fit to travel abroad as a form of incentive.\r\n - 90% of the recent graduates from VET schools doing work placements abroad will return to UK with work experience & are 'job ready' to enter the labour market\r\n- 75% of the project recent graduates from VET schools who have successfully completed the project will still be at work 1 year after completion of the project\r\n - 100% of the project participants will be evaluated.\r\nSee also: 9 ANNEXES: Partner Mandates, Memorandum of Understandings, Service Level Agreement, Implementation Plan, Journey to Work 4 preparatory workshops & Activity Plans", "http://www.werkcenterscotland.org.uk", "Werkcenter Scotland Limited", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-035504_coordinator"], ["7DS", "Living Europe As A Reality", "LIGHT ON THE PATH LTD", 142404.0, "Supported by the Rectorat, the consortium presented here has for objective to contribute to the updating and upgrading of the professional skills of all the participants.

Motivation and involvement of all them show their willingness to work in team and share skills and practices. It is undeniable that the pooling of resources and practices has provided a new impetus to the international programs coordinated by Acad\u00e9mie. Indeed, we have decided to share our foreign partners and receiving company lists, this is a real asset because it has creates an efficient partnership network and given a greater legitimacy to our consortium on the local and European scene\r\nThe schools all have students coming from underprivileged fields. These students have difficult schooling background. The schools propose a wide range of industrial and service sectors. Our European partners appreciate our wide range of industrial and service fields and are interested in the reciprocity of placements.

We have to underline that such a program couldn\u2019t be achieved without the help of Europe\r\n\r\nThe objectives respect the recommendations of the EU commission, our decision to offer that chance to the students and staff meets the professional needs of the participants but also their EU recommendations. The content of the working program has been agreed on by all the partners and they are committed to respect the stages of the project. These stages will imply a vast panel of people\r\nThe role of each partner is perfectly clear. The GIPAL carries the project. The Rectorat manages the project. It has a long experience of the programme and it will support the vocational schools all along the project.

The sending organizations will respect the terms of the mobility program of the consortium. They are in charge of the monitoring and evaluation of the participants\r\n\r\nThe young people will be more efficient on the job market, they will enrich their professional, cultural and linguistic skills, they will see Europe differently, they will improve their skills in ICT, they will be more autonomous, become aware of the similarities and differences of the working methods, prove their ability to adapt and integrate into a new environment, get the Europass, the Europro and the opportunity to get a bonus for their baccalaureate. The schools will develop a network of training organizations, a partnership \u201ccompany-school\u201d at the European level, exchange innovative practices and give a new image to vocational schools. They\u2019ll get the accreditation for quality award Label Lyc\u00e9e des M\u00e9tiers, increase the attractivity of their schools, decrease the rate of school-leaving pupils. Expected impact: renewal and sustainability of the project in 2019. The staff will improve their professional skills, enrich their educational practices, exchange skills and discover other education systems. Expected impact: improvement of the professional, practical and theoretical skills. For the learners, it will be an undeniable professional added value which will be transformed into assets on the job market and it will offer career developments to the staffs involved in the project\r\n\r\nThese impacts are tangible and easily measurable.

It highlights that in England in the 2015/16 season, club-trained players represented only 10% of the total number of English players, the lowest level among the European Big 5 Leagues. Although English Football League Clubs play a major role in producing national players, Premier League Clubs are the highest recruiters of players and coaches from abroad amongst the Big 5 Leagues, with 46.8% of players recruited internationally and only 7 British Managers for the 20 Premier League Clubs. Also, English players and coaches are the least represented in the other European Leagues, highlighting a clear reluctance or inability of English players to attain First Team opportunities abroad. Within English Football Academies, the situation is inverted: amongst 320 scholars aged between 16 and 18 over 85% are British and amongst the U16s 2,486 students the proportion rises to around 95%.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nLSE and its partners see European mobility as an invaluable way to address two of the key areas identified by the England Commission to enhance the quality of English footballers and coaches. The project aims to tackle the lack of quality coaching by integrating the BTEC/NVQ developed at the Academy with innovative elements from the Bozsik Elite Programme (founded in Hungary) by sending the academies to GLOBALL Football Park and Sporthotel in Telki, Hungary. They will undertake daily training sessions and progress will be monitored through use of video analysis and daily diaries. It is expected that this will improve the skills of the apprentice players whilst broadening their employment opportunities, allowing them to become more competitive within the English market and/or being able to pursue a career abroad as a consequence of the mobility.\r\n\r\nBeing subject to new training methodologies in the host country, the aim is that the apprentices will benefit both from improved employment rates in acquiring professional playing contracts and enhance their employability in a secondary career, either in the UK or in Europe. Furthermore, the project will be of primary importance to the staff, considering that very few coaches currently employed within UK Academies go on to achieve First Team coaching roles at the top tier of National Football and are often reluctant/unprepared to obtain similar opportunities abroad.\r\n\r\nNR. AND PROFILES OF PARTICIPANTS\r\nA group comprised of 22 players and 6 staff from the Under 18 teams of each of the 7 Academies will participate in the project. All U18 players are undergoing a two year BTEC/NVQ course in Sports.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF EXPECTED RESULTS\r\nThe project will have an extensive impact on the apprentices\u2019 footballing skills, enhancing the quality of their game and help them progress towards professionalism, as a player or in an alternative career pathway. The focus won\u2019t be limited to the UK, as it is normally foreseen in their BTEC/NVQ, but will include career opportunities at European and International level. In addition, this project is expected to reinforce apprentices\u2019 motivation and dedication towards the attainment of a professional career and working in UEFA and FIFA recognised training centres will set the standards they need to achieve. Those who do not make the transition to a professional playing career are still four times more likely to be offered employment than those who have not undertaken mobility.\r\n \r\nThe project will broaden the coaching skills of participating staff, introducing them to new knowledge detailed in the Bozsik Elite Programme. Coaches undertaking the mobility abroad will receive an influential set of practical skills and knowledge from the mobility, allowing them to deliver enhanced qualitative football training to their apprentices, whilst boosting the quality of their colleagues at the Academy through a series of internal training sessions and seminars. As with the young apprentices, working in UEFA and FIFA recognised facilities will enhance their motivation and dedication to work, reinforcing their ambitions on career progression, either in the UK and abroad. \r\n\r\nThe mobility will represent a model for acquiring new knowledge that they can replicate in the future to further enhance their expertise.\r\n\r\nPOTENTIAL LONGER TERM BENEFITS\r\nEach participating Academy will benefit from innovative training methods that they can apply at their UK base in order to produce superior players who can play regularly for the First Team or for other professional teams, in the UK or abroad. By using the internal seminars and workshops, the knowledge acquired whilst on mobility will be shared among the Academy\u2019s coaching staff, benefitting all players and staff.", "http://www.liberoagency.com", "Libero Sport and Education Limited", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036155_coordinator"], ["7YE", "Passing the Oval Ball Overseas", "Libero Sport and Education Limited", 188824.0, "CONTEXT\r\nRugby is a contact sport and as such, it experiences a higher number of injuries compared with other sports, with participants in younger age groups at an increased risk. It is believed that young players do not possess the required skills to protect themselves when falling to the ground as a consequence of a tackle, increasing the possibility of getting injured.\r\n\r\nMental Strength is a term commonly used by coaches, sport psychologists, sport commentators, as well as athletes to describe a collection of mental attributes that allow a person to achieve peak performance and persevere through difficult circumstances such as injury. Former professional players and a wide variety of experts in the Sports industry agree that the real difference between elite athletes is mental, as the physical, technical and tactical preparation is similar at the highest level, believing that the inclusion of mental strength sessions from an early age can assist young athletes in bridging the transition into performing at the highest level.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nThis mobility sets out to enhance the professional and soft skills of participants from Gloucester Rugby and Ospreys Rugby. The project aims at providing innovative training sessions to rugby apprentice players, involving the use of parkour and mental strength sessions. The modules on parkour aim at enhancing the agility skills of the young players; the modules on mental strength coaching aim at revolutionise the connection between mind and body, to boost athletes\u2019 performances in training and matches. Part of the mental strength sessions will target coaches, to help them recognise and address the different needs for development of their players, assisting them maturing as individuals and as players.\r\n\r\nNR. AND PROFILES OF PARTICIPANTS\r\nBoth Rugby Clubs have selected their U18 squads to participate in this mobility as they strongly believe that the described programme can enhance their chances of becoming professional Rugby players, encouraging them to undertake overseas experiences and refine the profile of those apprentices who may decide not to pursue a playing career. Indeed in this final phase of their compulsory education pathway, apprentices need concrete working and training experiences which would allow them to understand the final steps they need to make to successfully secure a position in the world of work. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF EXPECTED RESULTS\r\nThis project will have a considerable positive impact on all the organisations involved, widening their theoretical and practical knowledge of coaching methodologies and organisational models. Transnational cooperation commonly brings many advantages to all participants: Ospreys Rugby and Gloucester Rugby will improve their coaching methodologies by integrating additional modules deriving from the discipline of parkour, which will enhance the agility skills of their Academy players. Petrarca Rugby has already implemented a piloting period which saw modules of parkour integrated into the existing training programme, which produced tangible positive results on the agility skills of their apprentices and helped the Academy tackle the number of injuries. Both sending organisations will have track records of results (those recorded by Petrarca Rugby) for comparison, and an open line of communication for further assistance.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, visiting players will test a new approach to mental strength thanks to the method developed and implemented by Mauro Bergamasco. This will allow staff at both sending organisations to enhance the efficacy and efficiency of the training while respecting each player\u2019s personal development pace, with cascade benefits on performances of the Academy teams. As already demonstrated by growing scientific literature, mental strength sessions applied since younger ages can greatly assist players developing into professionals. Another beneficial aspect of mental strength sessions is helping players recovering faster and better from injuries and setbacks, either it is applied at individual or at team level.\r\n\r\nPOTENTIAL LONGER TERM BENEFITS\r\nThe fact that Ospreys Rugby and Gloucester Rugby also participate in Continental competitions represents a multiplier factor to encourage European Rugby Clubs to follow in the pathway of transnational cooperation in order to develop their coaching methodologies as well. In the long term, the European Rugby industry as a whole should benefit from the example set by this Mobility project as participants will understand the demands of a cross-cultural experience, making them a more attractive candidate to further education institutions, local and European rugby clubs and future employers alike.\r\n\r\nFurther additional benefits will be achieved by Rugby Clubs and participants discussing about their overseas experience with their own communities of fans and friends, reporting on the formative educational experiences made available by the European Union.", "http://www.liberoagency.com", "Libero Sport and Education Limited", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036184_coordinator"], ["7YE", "From Italian Stock to British Chefs", "Libero Sport and Education Limited", 253163.0, "CONTEXT/BACKGROUND\r\nAccording to the results of a survey by the Recruitment & Employment Confederation (REC), 61% of hospitality and catering recruitment agencies stated that they did not have enough chefs registered with them to fill vacancies for 2016. 93% of agencies surveyed said there are not enough trained chefs in the UK to meet demand whilst 83% anticipate the demand for chefs to continue to increase over the next 12 months, with 42% of chef vacancies considered hard-to-fill. Currently, 42% of the 250,000 chefs working in the UK are migrant workers, leading to concerns that this gap in resource could worsen following Brexit.\r\n\r\nUK-based training providers in hospitality and catering are under great pressure to produce better graduates who are able to perform at a higher level and in a shorter period of time. These graduates should also possess up to date knowledge of the latest culinary trends, techniques and methodologies in order to respond to customer preferences and tastes. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nThis 2-year mobility aims to provide apprentices and new graduates from courses of Professional Cookery at West Lothian College and Fife College with the proper theoretical and practical knowledge to operate in the hospitality and catering industry. 2017 and 2018 apprentices will have an instrumental opportunity to enhance their profile to become a more attractive asset for potential employers. The programme designed by ENAIP together with Istituto Cerletti will involve the alternation of theoretical and practical lessons. Participants will enjoy a cooking workshop, bar and fully equipped workstations.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES AND METHODOLOGY\r\nWhilst the central objective of the mobility will be that of enhancing employability within the hospitality and catering industry, it will also enhance Italian language skills (work-oriented) and foster intercultural exchange between hosts and visitors.\r\nThe programme will consist of 32 hours VET training including laboratory covering:\r\n\u2022 Classification of typical Italian and regional products\r\n\u2022 Quality schemes (DOC, DOCG, IGT, DOP, IGP, STG) and labels\r\n\u2022 Criteria for the selection of raw materials\r\n\u2022 Local products, traditional cuisine and new eating habits and styles\r\n\u2022 Preparing typical dishes of the Venetian and Italian tradition\r\n\u2022 Pathway on food and wine pairings\r\n24h of Italian language course at A2 Level;\r\n12h of excursions to major companies of Venetian cuisine;\r\n12h of cultural excursions.\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS\r\nAll participants selected will be enrolled in or have recently graduated from vocational courses of Professional Cookery organised by Fife College and West Lothian College. They will all be 16+ years old, a mixture of males and females, in full time education and located in central Scotland. Very few of them will have travelled abroad, never mind having enjoyed overseas training or working experience.\r\n\r\nDESIRED IMPACT AND OUTCOMES\r\nThe desired impact of this 2-year project will be an upsurge in graduates from West Lothian and Fife Colleges who will secure a job position in the UK or abroad. They will become more competitive in the labour market and able to face the growing competition posed by their European counterparts who, without prejudice for future development of the Brexit referendum, every year come to the UK to work in the hospitality and catering industry. Furthermore, graduates will be encouraged to pursue a career, more experience, or simply an additional training period in another European Country.

Mobility projects have always been significant in motivating the learners, raising the quality of VET, enhancing international activities and in overall development of RTRIT.  \r\nInitiated by National Agency, developed by RTRIT, Internationalization strategy 2016-2020  structures the further plans and international development paths of the school. This project application is developed based on two essential documents - Internationalization strategy and VET Mobility Charter. \r\nOne of the targets of international development is to create new partnerships, and this project aims to involve several new partners. Organization CHASE (Consortium of Hotel and Accommodation Schools of Europe) continues it development by involving new partners who are able to fulfill quality criteria and are accepted in internal voting thus tourism and hotel school of Netherlands has joined the CHASE. RTRIT has plans to realize two student mobility to Netherlands within this project. Besides the partner from Netherlands, RTRIT has made contacts and plans mobility to new partners in Spain, Slovenia, Lithuania and Malta. \r\nThe title of the project \u201cChange the world - start with yourself\" is continuance of previous project \"To change the world, you have to start with yourself\" yet this project aims to address the participants more directly, to challenge them to start the positive change, and to put emphasis on development of individual participant and his/her further input in the development of organization. \r\nMobilities that have significant role in international development of RTRIT, are to be carried out in this project as described in the internationalization strategy. \r\n1) Long term mobilities of qualification training for last year students will be realized within CHASE. CHASE members have mutually agreed upon exchange of the learners, quality measures of training programs, and the most important - February 2017  member schools of organization (19) will start development of new training evaluation system that will be fully compatible with education systems working with ECVET. Mobility trainings realized within this project will be evaluated by the newly developed system. \r\n2) 2-5 week long mobilities for various training programs in different sectors and host organizations.  \r\n3) Mobilities addressing the needs of learners who are facing learning difficulties, losing learning motivation or are on the edge to be disclosed of voluntary leaving the education process.  In cooperation with partner-schools from Kaunas and Tartu mobility programs are specially designed to strengthen personality, develop social and communication skills, and raise learning motivation. These mobilities involve necessary accompanying persons that will support learners practically and mentally during the mobility. \r\n4) Mobility of teachers and staff involving a) development of professional skills that will be used in further work after mobility, b) demonstration of skills and sharing experience to rise the status or the school in on international level, and c) developing and strengthening of new partnerships for further cooperation and future mobilities. \r\nTaking into account descriptive evaluation of mobility charter, number of participants is adjusted, excluding the participants that will be funded by own means. Total number of participants is corrected from what has been mentioned in charter plans, corrections with slight decrease in number is made due to actual numbers of current learners and planed numbers for next academic year. The numbers planned for the next academic year are also corrected in common development strategy of RTRIT. Number of participants representing certain education program is directly proportional to the number of learners in each program.  Time and duration of mobility is set according to study process in the represented education program and by taking into consideration possibilities of host to organize study and training at high quality.", "http://www.lightonthepath.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-LV01-KA116-035386_6"]]}}, "outwardCode": "G3"}
