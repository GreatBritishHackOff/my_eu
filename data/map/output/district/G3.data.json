The strategy behind POLIS lies in the development of specific technological modules and to implement them at pilot line level on the existing production line. POLIS will also enable the development of several key demonstrators representative of potential final products serving multiple applications. More specifically, in order to support imaging expansion into new markets (automotive, consumer, medical, security), the project proposes to focus on the following application fields: sensors capturing photons beyond visible wavelength range, focusing on the limits of spectral range (X-ray/Gamma and thermal IR/THz), sensors using Time of Flight (ToF) technology and light emitters based on OLED on silicon technology for micro-displays.", 24745.0, 86020761.0, "POLIS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_201977_950334124"], ["6RQ", "Architecture, Design and Art Practice Training \u2010 research", "Glasgow School of Art Lbg", "The ADAPT-r ITN aims to significantly increase European research capacity through a unique and ground-breaking research model:  at its core is the development of a robust and sustainable ITN in an emergent Supra-Disciplinary field of research across a range of design and arts disciplines \u2013 creative practice research.

Globalisation is not an imaginary threat to the European SME but a sometimes intangible adversary. From customers to markets, suppliers and resources, through to financing and expenses, SMEs are affected more than other businesses.\n\nThe project 'Cross-organisational assessment and development of intellectual capital' (http://www.cadic-europe.org (CADIC)) created a platform for knowledge sharing and idea exchange. Networking is saving the small businesses bound by close ties with local markets in a global world. Collaboration and then bonding occurs when local firms and agencies create regional capital, strengthening the economy by banding together. \n\nCADIC helped a large number of SMEs to set up and strengthen networking clusters. The well-researched and scientifically proven CADIC framework provides a sound model. A common language is developed, fostering trust then collaboration within the clusters. Then groups enrich their various business sectors by finding productive niches together. A cooperative, not competitive mindsetguides the SME and service providers through a successful bottom-up cluster-building process, enhancing intellectual capital (IC)-based collaboration.\n\nThe designed benchmarking system enables SMEs to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of their own intangible resource base and compare it with that of other organisations. This helps to identify areas for improvement, which in turn supports management decisions. All worked towards motivated investments on a cluster level.
