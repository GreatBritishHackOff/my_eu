Unfortunately, young people living in rural areas or small cities are harder to access opportunities to get foreign experiences than those who live in metropolitan areas. Most of the project target groups consist of such disadvantaged/fewer opportunities young people. The project aims to create an opportunity for young people with fewer opportunities to go abroad. However, the project will increase the employment participation rates by increasing the youth's self-confidence and competence. The solution of of racism and gender discrimination problem, which is at the head of the common problems of Europe, will be supported by the project again. Informal learning/teaching methods will be used in the project and it is expected that the project will make a positive contribution to the capacities of all stakeholders.\r\n\r\nTotally, 15 volunteers will be sent to 5 different organizations under 5 follows for 12 months long term EVS activities.

For this reason, we refer to volunteers and students as a volunteer for EVH to send abroad as EVS volunteers and to help our students learn, learn and improve skills or acquire new skills.\r\n\r\nIn our project, in summary; For 30 volunteers, direct the activity site for 30 short periods.\r\nMalta; Between 01-06-2018 / 24-10-2018, there are a total of 10 volunteers, two short term 2 month term volunteers,\r\nPortugal; Between 01-06-2018 / 24-10-2018, there are a total of 10 volunteers, two short term 2 month term volunteers,\r\nItaly; 01-06-2018 / 24-10-2018 We have 2 volunteers in total for 2 short-term months and 10 volunteers in total.\r\n\r\nOur main goals and main focuses in these activities are as follows.\r\n- Raising awareness of Europe among the peoples\r\n- To enable young people to acquire new knowledge, skills and experience\r\n-Improving quality in youth work\r\n-To contribute to the acquisition of new experiences by other organizations\r\n- To offer active participation opportunities for young people with limited education\r\nI know more about our sickness and make mine more\r\n-The ones who are trying to create value for my grandmother are planned to gain everything.\r\n\r\nIn our project, volunteers will receive assistants to the qualification staff and actively participate in the development of the professional development program. The selection of the volunteers will be made by consultation with the relevant staff. Volunteers can plan their own activities if they wish, and creative ideas are welcomed and made by all partners. They will receive volunteer language training in the project. Language training is a practical speech conversation everyday. Volunteering times were arranged together with the host organizations. The host organizations will primarily see the motivation letters of the volunteers and then decide. It is your responsibility to volunteer at the criteria required by the sending organization's host organization.\r\n\r\nThe target mass of the projects is generally disadvantaged youth, and at the end of the project, these young people are planning to improve themselves and culturally develop their employability.

The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other so that we can develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   \r\n\r\nThe Municipality has a need to prepare the pupils for a global labor market, encourage and inspire them to learn foreign languages and to offer the pupils contact with pupils in other parts of the world.  International projects are a very important tool in this work, and also contribute to an increased tolerance and acceptance of other people and cultures.  This is very important since our municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, just as in the rest of the country and EU, and the consortium has a need to always work on these issues.     \r\n\r\nIn this project, the consortium consists of the Childcare and Education department and eight primary / secondary schools.  Considering the above mentioned issues, and considering that international contacts and projects are an excellent tool in this work, the consortium has the following objectives in this project:  \r\n \r\n\u2022 Enable international contacts for head teachers, teachers and pupils\r\n\u2022 Increase the number of schools who have international projects and collaboration \u2013 Currently several of the primary / secondary schools are involved in international projects, but there is also a huge number who isn\u2019t.  It is also important to maintain the interest for internationalization at the schools where projects already exist.  \r\n\u2022 Increase the language competence and the interest in foreign languages, for head teachers, teachers and pupils.\r\n\r\nIn our project there are eight head teachers and three deputy head teachers from the schools G\u00f6kstensskolan, Hammarg\u00e4rdets skola, \u00c4rstaskolan, Tegelviken, Bj\u00f6rktorpsskolan, Skiftingehus, Fr\u00f6slundaskolan och St\u00e5lforsskolan. All of them will do job shadowing activities in Birmingham, where they will have the opportunity to get inspiration and and ideas which will help them in their strategic quality development of their schools.  They will also be able to establish contacts for international collaboration for head teachers, teachers and pupils.   Furthermore, the job shadowing gives them a chance to improve their English, which will be valuable in their future collaboration.  For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and these job shadowing activities are part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe head teachers (all but one) will also take a course in order to learn more about Erasmus+ and how it can be effective in the strategic development of the school and in the collaboration with teachers and pupils from other countries.  They will learn how to anchor Erasmus+ in the work of the organization and use it as a tool.  The course also gives them a good opportunity to meet others and make connections for future KA1 and KA2 projects, as well as an opportunity to improve their language ability.  \r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the activities will lead to more schools in Eskilstuna having international projects and international collaboration.  Moreover, these projects are expected to lead to increased language ability among head teachers, teachers and pupils, to increased tolerance and understanding of different cultures and to make the pupils prepared for an international labor market.", "http://www.holyfam.bham.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA101-038787_11"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B10"}
