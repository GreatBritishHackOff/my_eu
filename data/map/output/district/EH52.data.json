Given the specific context of Brussels, it is essential for our pupils that we offer them innovative, modern and quality education. One of the parameters thereof is the use of ICT to develop innovative, creative and inspiring didactic material (playfully learning, learning by doing, talent development and prevention of early school leaving). For this reason, we offer a diverse group of teachers from our VET, general secondary and primary education, the opportunity to participate in an international course and job shadowing with colleagues abroad in order for them to acquire these skills and tools and at the same time broaden their horizon whilst establishing international contacts. We will continue this 'Integrating ICT creativity @ school' project by setting up, in cooperation with the participants, trainings and workshops to support all schools and teachers of GO! Scholengroep Brussel. By measuring the effects of the didactics (= integration of the creative ICT tools) of the teachers and the increase of Erasmus+ applications, we will be able to demonstrate whether we have achieved our goals.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-BE02-KA101-034625_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EH52"}
