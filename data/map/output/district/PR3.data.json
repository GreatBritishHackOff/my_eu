The project will incorporate scientific findings from over 30 European projects, national and international research programmes and transatlantic co-operations to develop (i) methods and tools to predict nanomaterials exposure and effects on humans and ecosystems, (ii) implementable processes to reduce hazard and exposure to nanomaterials in different lifecycle stages, (iii) innovative technological solutions for risk management in industrial settings, and  (iv) guidance on best practices for securing both nano-manufacturing processes and nanomaterials ultimate fate, including development of approaches for safe disposal and recycling. In summary, SUN stands for an integrated approach for the long-term sustainability of nanotechnologies through the development of safe processes for production, use and end-of-life processing of nanomaterials and products, as well as methods reducing both adverse effects and exposure to acceptable levels.", 161643.0, 10748780.0, "SUN", null, null, null, null, "http://www.thereachcentre.com", null, "fp7_110420_985308444"], ["3JP", "Managing Risks of Nanoparticles", "The Reach Centre Limited", "While there are standard procedures for product life cycle analysis, exposure, hazard, and risk assessment for traditional chemicals, is not yet clear how these procedures need to be modified to address all the novel properties of nanomaterials. There is a need to develop specific reference methods for all the main steps in managing the potential risk of ENM.  The aim of MARINA is to develop such methods.  MARINA will address the four central themes in the risk management paradigm for ENM: Materials, Exposure, Hazard and Risk. The methods developed by MARINA will be (i) based on beyond-state-of-the-art understanding of the properties, interaction and fate of ENM in relation to human health and the quality of the environment and will either (ii) be newly developed or adapted from existing ones but ultimately, they will be compared/validated and harmonised/standardised  as reference methods for managing the risk of ENM.

A European consortium of nearly 50 partners is developing and validating a strategy for ENM risk management with the EU-funded project 'Managing risks of nanoparticles' (http://www.marina-fp7.eu/ (MARINA)).\n\nThe project focuses on exposure, hazards and risks. MARINA has established links with other related projects. A database along with data collection templates have also been created in order to compile and assimilate information on relevant materials.\n\nReference ENMs have been distributed to partners and assessment of release during production, processing, and handling by both workers and consumers is under way. Further, experimental results are being used to create a database of parameters associated with the environment, plants and animals that affect the fate and behaviour of ENMs. Partners working on hazard assessment have compared the characterisation and exposure data to extensive human health and environmental studies measuring various hazard-associated parameters. Scientists have developed a framework for systems biology studies to determine mechanisms of action of the selected ENMs.\n\nTo develop standardised paradigms to assess, manage and reduce risk associated with ENMs, the consortium is evaluating current approaches and developing new ones with a regulatory perspective. The project also includes a component on minimising massive exposure that could occur via an explosion or environmental leak or spill.\n\nMARINA is developing the comprehensive databases and experimental results required to understand the interactions of ENMs with human beings and the environment.

Apart from expected benefits, distinctive properties of NMs may also affect (environmental) health risks. Safety assessment requires sufficient information for each NM, but testing every unique NM for their potential adverse effects is virtually impossible. More efficient ways to obtain safety information are needed, which could be achieved by applying grouping and read-across approaches to NMs. On a conceptual level, regulatory accepted approaches for grouping and read-across for NMs already exist, but actual application remains difficult as the required knowledge is not systematically brought together,   lacks data curation or is still missing. GRACIOUS will address this urgent need by developing a framework for grouping and read-across based on physicochemical, release, exposure, environmental fate, toxicokinetic and toxicological information. This framework will be delivered as a practical e-tool, fit-for-purpose for various key (regulatory and industrial) stakeholders, who will be engaged from the start of the project. To develop the framework, GRACIOUS will build upon currently available approaches by collating, curating and assimilating existing and new knowledge on intrinsic and extrinsic physicochemical properties in relation to their (environmental) health risk. The resulting framework will support safe innovation by enabling considerations of safety a.o. via grouping and read-across in industrial decision making at various stages of product development. For regulators and policy makers, GRACIOUS will facilitate actual application of grouping and read-across of NMs to enable risk analysis of NMs without extensive testing.", 217283.0, 6261447.0, "GRACIOUS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.thereachcentre.com", null, "h2020_212339_985308444"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["3JP", "YORDAS LIMITED", 217333.0, "Leadership in nanotechnologies, advanced materials, laser technology, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing and processing (08.02.02.01)", "fts_2017_4318", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "PR3"}
