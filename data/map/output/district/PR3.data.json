The project will incorporate scientific findings from over 30 European projects, national and international research programmes and transatlantic co-operations to develop (i) methods and tools to predict nanomaterials exposure and effects on humans and ecosystems, (ii) implementable processes to reduce hazard and exposure to nanomaterials in different lifecycle stages, (iii) innovative technological solutions for risk management in industrial settings, and  (iv) guidance on best practices for securing both nano-manufacturing processes and nanomaterials ultimate fate, including development of approaches for safe disposal and recycling.

There is a need to develop specific reference methods for all the main steps in managing the potential risk of ENM.  The aim of MARINA is to develop such methods.  MARINA will address the four central themes in the risk management paradigm for ENM: Materials, Exposure, Hazard and Risk. The methods developed by MARINA will be (i) based on beyond-state-of-the-art understanding of the properties, interaction and fate of ENM in relation to human health and the quality of the environment and will either (ii) be newly developed or adapted from existing ones but ultimately, they will be compared/validated and harmonised/standardised  as reference methods for managing the risk of ENM.

A European consortium of nearly 50 partners is developing and validating a strategy for ENM risk management with the EU-funded project 'Managing risks of nanoparticles' (http://www.marina-fp7.eu/ (MARINA)).\n\nThe project focuses on exposure, hazards and risks. MARINA has established links with other related projects. A database along with data collection templates have also been created in order to compile and assimilate information on relevant materials.\n\nReference ENMs have been distributed to partners and assessment of release during production, processing, and handling by both workers and consumers is under way. Further, experimental results are being used to create a database of parameters associated with the environment, plants and animals that affect the fate and behaviour of ENMs. Partners working on hazard assessment have compared the characterisation and exposure data to extensive human health and environmental studies measuring various hazard-associated parameters. Scientists have developed a framework for systems biology studies to determine mechanisms of action of the selected ENMs.\n\nTo develop standardised paradigms to assess, manage and reduce risk associated with ENMs, the consortium is evaluating current approaches and developing new ones with a regulatory perspective. The project also includes a component on minimising massive exposure that could occur via an explosion or environmental leak or spill.\n\nMARINA is developing the comprehensive databases and experimental results required to understand the interactions of ENMs with human beings and the environment.

Apart from expected benefits, distinctive properties of NMs may also affect (environmental) health risks. Safety assessment requires sufficient information for each NM, but testing every unique NM for their potential adverse effects is virtually impossible. More efficient ways to obtain safety information are needed, which could be achieved by applying grouping and read-across approaches to NMs. On a conceptual level, regulatory accepted approaches for grouping and read-across for NMs already exist, but actual application remains difficult as the required knowledge is not systematically brought together,   lacks data curation or is still missing. GRACIOUS will address this urgent need by developing a framework for grouping and read-across based on physicochemical, release, exposure, environmental fate, toxicokinetic and toxicological information. This framework will be delivered as a practical e-tool, fit-for-purpose for various key (regulatory and industrial) stakeholders, who will be engaged from the start of the project. To develop the framework, GRACIOUS will build upon currently available approaches by collating, curating and assimilating existing and new knowledge on intrinsic and extrinsic physicochemical properties in relation to their (environmental) health risk. The resulting framework will support safe innovation by enabling considerations of safety a.o. via grouping and read-across in industrial decision making at various stages of product development. For regulators and policy makers, GRACIOUS will facilitate actual application of grouping and read-across of NMs to enable risk analysis of NMs without extensive testing.", 217283.0, 6261447.0, "GRACIOUS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.thereachcentre.com", null, "h2020_212339_985308444"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0RY", "NaturiWab2 - students and staff abroad", "Myerscough College", 93676.0, "In NaturiWab2 - students and staff abroad \u2013 project we will provide work based learning periods abroad for 63 student in the branch of Natural Resource and Environment and also for 18 staff member (staff training abroad). Student exchange periods last 2-4 weeks and staff trainings will last 5 days. Shorter student training periods help us to reach our new goal to sent abroad as many adult student as possible. Most of our partners in this project are reliable long-time-partners and we already have excellent development culture with our partners to further refine our ongoing international activity.\r\n\r\nNaturi \u2013 network is an executor in this project. Naturi-network consists of five federation of education in Finland and specially of Natural Resource and Environment branches in these five federations. Keski-Pohjanmaan koulutusyhtym\u00e4, Kpedu, is the applicant and coordinator of this project. Naturi has done great cooperation since 2005 ja executed 7 staff and student exchange \u2013 projects with good results. The real results of this project are student and staff exchanges and possibility to continue our work to further Internationality in our organizations, among the students, staff, network and foreign partners. We value International work and Internationality in everyday life, so we want to develop and work for Internationality, not only in our school than in whole Finland. International practices in education level up cooperation between different countries and also improve quality of education and skills and workmanship in privat level. Because of excellent and high quality cooperation of this network, we will apply an official accreditation for Naturi network this spring. \r\n\r\nIn NaturiWab2 we will develop occupational skills of our students and also readiness for working life. Naturi network will carry on using ECVET- system and its forms: Memorandum of Understanding and Learning agreement. Finnish education is in very high level of using digital education tools and we want to share this knowledge with our partners. This makes it easier for our students to use digital methods during their international studies and we also may get new methods and tools to \u201ddigi-jump\u201d. We will use student information system to prepare ECVET \u2013 agreements and we will also use more social media in dissemination \u2013 by using Facebook, blogs, Twitter and Instagram accounts.\r\n\r\nAs a new section in our project we will focus on sending adult students abroad. It is important for us to be able to meet the demand of adults as the educational reform will guide the way in very near future. The new project will also also grow knowlede of Internationality among our staff. Main goal is to provide huge extra value for student\u2019s studies by sending them abroad for work based learning period. We sustain and strengthen our cooperation with foreign partners and with a help of them we get new ideas for our teaching methods and curriculum.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this project students and staff will provide their occupational skills, language skills and knowledge of different cultures.

We must keep our good level also in the future with our partners.\r\nIn CUBE 2017- project we send 74 students and 3 staff members to work based learning periods abroad.  This means real work in real work places. Additionally we send 7 staff members to visit partner schools abroad and receive three experts to teach our students and get to know our education, teaching methods and companies. We try to offer possibilities also to students with fewer opportunities, which means we have to accommodate accompanying persons with their periods. We try also achieve more periods to adult students and  even apprentices. In CUBE 2017 \u2013project we have about 80 partners in16 different countries.
