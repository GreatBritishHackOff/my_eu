Safety assessment requires sufficient information for each NM, but testing every unique NM for their potential adverse effects is virtually impossible. More efficient ways to obtain safety information are needed, which could be achieved by applying grouping and read-across approaches to NMs. On a conceptual level, regulatory accepted approaches for grouping and read-across for NMs already exist, but actual application remains difficult as the required knowledge is not systematically brought together,   lacks data curation or is still missing. GRACIOUS will address this urgent need by developing a framework for grouping and read-across based on physicochemical, release, exposure, environmental fate, toxicokinetic and toxicological information. This framework will be delivered as a practical e-tool, fit-for-purpose for various key (regulatory and industrial) stakeholders, who will be engaged from the start of the project. To develop the framework, GRACIOUS will build upon currently available approaches by collating, curating and assimilating existing and new knowledge on intrinsic and extrinsic physicochemical properties in relation to their (environmental) health risk. The resulting framework will support safe innovation by enabling considerations of safety a.o. via grouping and read-across in industrial decision making at various stages of product development.

This will provide the students with a unique opportunity to improve their learning, employability, self esteem and cultural awareness. \r\n\r\nMyerscough College is a specialist land-based and sports college in the North-West of the UK and the placements will be provided by APCC, an organisation with the facilities and experience of delivering land-based vocational education for people with special needs.  APCC will provide relevant work experience on their organic farm, small animal centre and riding school in a safe and supportive environment.\r\n\r\nMyerscough College and APCC established their partnership in 2011 and have undertaken successful exchange visits and 2 previous and 1 current mobility projects.  The visit by LDD learners from the College to APCC in 2013 was identified by the Ofsted inspectors as an area of excellent practice and one which should be incorporated within programmes of study.\r\n\r\nThe project will enhance the learning programmes for Foundation Learning students.\r\n\r\nThe objectives are to:\r\n - enhance the quality of vocational education training and enable the participants to experience and acquire new skills in a different culture/environment.\r\n- improve the participants\u2019 levels of confidence and develop their social skills and self-esteem through working with European students with similar challenges.\r\n- expand the learners' experience of 'the world around them' from the small environment of their home and College to international scales.\r\n- increase the learners' understanding of different cultures, language, currency and environment.\r\n- improve the participants\u2019 levels of confidence and develop their social skills and self-esteem through working with European students with similar challenges.\r\n- identify and share areas of good practice in the vocational training of students with special needs that can be incorporated into Myerscough College\u2019s training programmes\r\n\r\nThese will be achieved by a combination of work experience linked to their vocational qualification, social events and cultural visits.  The students will undertake work activities on the partner organisation\u2019s organic farm where they will have the opportunity to improve their vocational and employability skills with support from the specialist support staff to meet their individual needs.  The learning outcomes will vary according to the ability of the individual student.\r\n\r\nThe experience of travelling to a foreign country, living and working with their peers and mixing with students from another country with similar challenges will immensely improve their personal and social development skills.  Increased understanding of different cultures, language, currency and environment will start in the classroom months before the learners travel as they are introduced to the Portuguese language and culture and plan the travel arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe project will be managed by teams of staff at both the College and APCC who will liaise closely on arrangements for the project, organisation and delivery.  The students will be prepared for the experience through training incorporated within their course prior to travel and additional language support.  Due to the high level of need of the participants in the educational environment, each group of students will accompanied by 4 SEN trained tutors who, as well as supporting the students, will map the learning outcomes to the students' vocational curriculum, monitor the work undertaken and ensure formal recognition in their final qualification.\r\n\r\nThe project will allow 16 participants who otherwise would not get the opportunity to travel abroad, the experience of going to a foreign country independently of their families/carers, some for the first time.  This will have a profound affect and a life changing impact on their life and work chances.  The intention is to select students who have the potential to benefit from the whole process and ultimately be able to find sustainable employment either paid or on a voluntary basis. \r\n\r\nVocational training programmes for LDD learners will be enhanced through the good practice identified at APCC by the Head of Foundation Learning and the accompanying support staff that can be incorporated into the management and delivery of vocational education at Myerscough College.", "http://www.myerscough.ac.uk", "Myerscough College", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047369_coordinator"], ["0RY", "2015-1-FI01-KA109-009206", "Myerscough College", 100279.0, "International work based learning for students and staff as well as receiving guests from our partner organisations are the main strategic themes of our international activities. Our target is to make students, teachers, staff, schools and our working life more international. Our target is to keep the amount of students\u2019 mobility at least on same level as earlier. Every participant will develop their language skills, social skills, professional skills, attitude, tolerance, general knowledge and entrepreneurship. The project affects students\u2019 employment and the internationality of our organisation and the region in the future. Main issue in our international work based learning is quality and continuous improving. We must keep our good level also in the future with our partners.\r\nIn CUBE 2018- project we send 72 students and 3 staff members to work based learning periods abroad.  This means real work in real work places. Additionally we send 8 staff members to visit partner schools abroad and receive three experts to teach our students and get to know our education, teaching methods and companies. We try to offer possibilities also to students with fewer opportunities, which means we have to accommodate accompanying persons with their periods. We try also achieve more periods to adult students. In CUBE 2018 \u2013project we use our large partner network (about 120 partners in 24 different countries). We try to expand our network during the project. \r\n\r\nDuring the work based learning periods both students and staff collect cultural differences at work places, free time and everyday life.  This information will help next travelers to meet the differences in other countries. They also describe in they travel report how internationalism is seen in the working place. We also try to find new digital solutions with our domestic partners how to administer our Erasmus+ projects.", "http://www.myerscough.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FI01-KA116-046780_18"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["3JP", "YORDAS LIMITED", 217333.0, "Leadership in nanotechnologies, advanced materials, laser technology, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing and processing (08.02.02.01)", "fts_2017_4318", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "PR3"}
