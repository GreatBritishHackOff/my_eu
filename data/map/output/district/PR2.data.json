Histology is a complex process requiring several steps for the tissue sample preparation. The most demanding and time-consuming step is the microtomy, where the tissue sample, now dehydrated and placed inside a piece of paraffin wax, is cut into slices 4-micrometre thick. This step is further complicated by the fact that the thin slices become wrinkled with the cutting and are normally put on warm water in order to smooth out (the with the aggravated problems of rehydrating the cells and increasing the risk of cross-contamination). Microtomy is a labour-intensive procedure carried out by highly-skilled clinical/scientific staff. A skilled operator can perform up to 80 samples a day, but will cost well over \u20ac100,000 p.a. The MicroLean project proposes a low-cost automation of the microtomy process by a contactless manipulation of the samples. The MicroLean system will be retrofittable to existing microtomes.", 133471.0, 1145058.0, "MICROLEAN", null, null, null, null, "http://www.imsol.co.uk", null, "fp7_111597_952210104"], ["2XE", "Improving Outcome of Necrotizing Fasciitis: Elucidation of Complex Host and Pathogen Signatures that Dictate Severity of Tissue Infection", "Marsden Doreen", "The overall goal with INFECT is to advance our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms, prognosis, and diagnosis of the multifactorial highly lethal NSTIs. The fulminant course of NSTIs (in the order of hours) demands immediate diagnosis and adequate interventions in order to salvage lives and limbs. However, diagnosis and management are difficult due to heterogeneity in clinical presentation, in co-morbidities and in microbiological aetiology. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in order to improve outcome of NSTIs. To achieve this, a comprehensive and integrated knowledge of diagnostic features, causative microbial agent, treatment strategies, and pathogenic mechanisms (host and bacterial disease traits and their underlying interaction network) is required. INFECT is designed to obtain such insights through an integrated systems biology approach in patients and different clinically relevant experimental models.\n\nSpecific objectives of INFECT are to:\n1. Unravel specific mechanisms underlying diseases signatures though a bottom-up systems approach applied to clinically relevant experimental settings\n2. Apply a top-down systems biology approach to NSTI patient samples to pin-point key host and pathogen factors involved in the onset and development of infection\n3. Identify and quantify disease signatures and underlying networks that contribute to disease outcome\n4. Exploit identified disease traits for the innovation of optimized  diagnostic tools\n5. Translate the advanced knowledge generated into evidence-based guidelines for classification and management, and novel therapeutic strategies\n\nWe have gathered a team of multidisciplinary researchers, clinicians, SMEs and a patient organization, each with a unique expertise, technical platform and/or model systems that together provide the means to successfully conduct the multifaceted research proposed and efficiently disseminate/exploit the knowledge obtained.", 38875.0, 12847916.0, "INFECT", null, null, null, "http://www.fp7infect.eu", null, null, "fp7_106297_953303779"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["9WT", "NORTH & WESTERN LANCASHIRE CHAMBEROF COMMERCE LBG*NWLCC", 19485.0, "Information outlets (16.03.01.03)", "fts_2016_67255", 2016], ["9WT", "NORTH & WESTERN LANCASHIRE CHAMBEROF COMMERCE LBG*NWLCC", 8938.0, "Cohesion Fund \u2014 Operational technical assistance (13.04.61.01)", "fts_2016_72480", 2016], ["9WT", "NORTH & WESTERN LANCASHIRE CHAMBEROF COMMERCE LBG*NWLCC", 20934.0, "Information outlets (16.03.01.03)", "fts_2017_65724", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "PR2"}
