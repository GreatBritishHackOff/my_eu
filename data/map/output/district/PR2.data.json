Histology is a complex process requiring several steps for the tissue sample preparation. The most demanding and time-consuming step is the microtomy, where the tissue sample, now dehydrated and placed inside a piece of paraffin wax, is cut into slices 4-micrometre thick. This step is further complicated by the fact that the thin slices become wrinkled with the cutting and are normally put on warm water in order to smooth out (the with the aggravated problems of rehydrating the cells and increasing the risk of cross-contamination). Microtomy is a labour-intensive procedure carried out by highly-skilled clinical/scientific staff. A skilled operator can perform up to 80 samples a day, but will cost well over \u20ac100,000 p.a. The MicroLean project proposes a low-cost automation of the microtomy process by a contactless manipulation of the samples.

The fulminant course of NSTIs (in the order of hours) demands immediate diagnosis and adequate interventions in order to salvage lives and limbs. However, diagnosis and management are difficult due to heterogeneity in clinical presentation, in co-morbidities and in microbiological aetiology. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in order to improve outcome of NSTIs. To achieve this, a comprehensive and integrated knowledge of diagnostic features, causative microbial agent, treatment strategies, and pathogenic mechanisms (host and bacterial disease traits and their underlying interaction network) is required. INFECT is designed to obtain such insights through an integrated systems biology approach in patients and different clinically relevant experimental models.\n\nSpecific objectives of INFECT are to:\n1. Unravel specific mechanisms underlying diseases signatures though a bottom-up systems approach applied to clinically relevant experimental settings\n2. Apply a top-down systems biology approach to NSTI patient samples to pin-point key host and pathogen factors involved in the onset and development of infection\n3. Identify and quantify disease signatures and underlying networks that contribute to disease outcome\n4. Exploit identified disease traits for the innovation of optimized  diagnostic tools\n5.

Selected volunteers will have the opportunity to take part in a range of humanitarian projects, which will enable them to develop their understanding and experience of active citizenship in a global world and enhance their employability skills.\r\n\r\nThe various projects included in this application are thematically linked by a common commitment to the inclusion of vulnerable groups, both at the local and community level; this focuses primarily on supporting vulnerable individuals in the community such as refugees and asylum seekers, the elderly, people with learning disabilities. \r\n \r\nIn line with Erasmus+ Programme specific objectives in the field of youth, our project aims to achieve the following:\r\n- encourage young people\u2019s active participation in society by helping them to increase their self-confidence and sense of initiative;\r\n- enhance young people\u2019s employability and career prospects, by enabling them to develop their skills in a safe, supported environment and validating these through the Youthpass framework;\r\n- facilitate opportunities for young people to develop enhanced inter-cultural dialogue. \r\n\r\nThrough a range of informal and non-formal learning activities and experiences, volunteers will be supported over the course of the placement to take an active role in society, and will also have the space for personal development, self-reflection and learning. The personal development and training opportunities available will enable participants to develop skills crucial for future training or employment, while given them the chance to be engaged as active citizens in civil society. At the local level, the participants will be directly involved with the delivery of services to vulnerable people in the community. Their contact with community groups who may otherwise have little contact with people from overseas enables the intercultural learning from the programme to spread more broadly than the participants themselves.
