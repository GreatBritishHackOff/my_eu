New lubrication technologies will significantly increase engine efficiency and decrease emissions in automotive applications.", "Energy is one of the most important areas of research development in the 21st century as increasing human activities put increasing pressures on global climate and the environment. While renewable resources will form an important piece of the future energy puzzle, combustion will remain an important contributor for a long time to come, making improvements in combustion technologies an important contributor to a greener society.\n\nICEs include gasoline and diesel engines, gas turbine engines and even rocket propulsion systems. They are found in everything from cars to industrial machines to space shuttles. A large training network is focusing on development of a new generation of clean and energy-efficient engines with EU support of the http://www.enticeitn.eu/page/entice (ENTICE) (Engineering tribochemistry and interfaces with a focus on the internal combustion engine) project.\n\nTribological processes at interfaces in relative motion and the associated friction and wear are critical to efficient ICEs. These engines convert chemical energy in the bonds of fuel into mechanical work to move parts. Greener lubricants with improved performance will both eliminate harsh chemicals and additives while increasing energy efficiency, and thus reducing emissions. ENTICE is supporting 10 early-stage researchers (ESRs) and 2 experienced researchers, with 2 more ESRs currently being recruited.\n\nThe team is studying the physics associated with the tribochemistry of lubricated contacts. Development of both experimental, analytical and measurement techniques as well as models will aid understanding of processes. In parallel, scientists are investigating oil ageing (lubricant degradation) within the context of tribochemistry processes to develop better and greener lubricants. Experimental simulation of engine tribology systems will enable bench testing of improved systems for automotive engines.\n\nResearchers are taking advantage of numerous academic and industrial training courses complemented by teamwork and mentoring. The productive and enthusiastic collaboration is now leading to the first publications of results. The ENTICE training network is preparing a new generation of scientists to develop significantly more efficient ICEs for cars.

Preschool Matija Gubec with its project \"Different approaches to creative teaching in early and preschool age children\" encourages lifelong learning of its employees through professional training in EU. To develop and raise the quality of work of the institution, we recognized the importance of two specific areas. The first area relates to education for sustainable development and outdoor education with children. Environment of the child, especially a natural one becomes an important factor in the educational process. It encourages a full psycho-motor development of the child, develops awareness of the importance of physical education and a sense of living in harmony with nature and learning about ecology (exploitation of natural resources and raising awareness of responsible attitude towards the environment). The second area is early English learning, which we consider to be an important factor in helping preschool children develop communication competence in a foreign language. Increasing the quality of short and full daily curriculum enriched with English learning is one of the goals of our institution. This is possible only with high-quality continuous training of employees working in the programs. These areas are an important part of the curriculum in our institutions and in accordance with the National Curriculum for Preschool Education. The main objective of the project is to improve knowledge about unconventional ways of teaching based on the latest psychological and pedagogical knowledge, theoretical and methodological assumptions in accordance with the modern concept of creative teaching. Objectives of this project are: improvement of key competencies and skills, promoting quality and excellence in innovation and internationalization of the institution, increasing the awareness of employees about the importance of lifelong learning, improvement of international dimension of education and training and teaching and learning of languages  encouraging linguistic and cultural diversity.\r\n\r\nParticipation of 15 employees is planned based on the activitites of the project: 8 educators for the job-shadowing activities and 7 workers for the structured courses.\r\n\r\nJob shadowing action plan involves the following preschools :\r\n\"Mezmalina\" preschool (Latvia) is a recognized Eco-preschool which shows a specialty of their work through teaching children outdoors. \"Long Buckby Infant School\u201c (UK) puts emphasis on a stimulating environment and natural environment in the forest where children are able to learn to appreciate nature and the environment that surrounds them. Estonian preschool \"Naba\" is focused on: project learning, outdoor learning, promoting health, developing values and focusing on team work using \"Step by Step\" method. The main focus in \"Idr\u00e6tsb\u00f8rneg\u00e5rden Skratmosen\" preschool (Denmark)  is on physical education, which is used as a tool/method for encouraging development: social competence, science, language and cultural expression.\r\n\r\nStructured courses activity plan includes :\r\n- The Lake School of English Oxford, English for Effective Communication - offers years of experience and skills of teaching communication skills in English.\r\n- Cursus Iceland, Outdoor arts & crafts - provides the skills of practical knowledge and tools for the promotion of art and crafts (handicrafts), conducting of practical workshops using natural materials outdoors in everyday practice.\r\n- Alpha School of English, Teaching English to very young learners - provides the experience of teaching and methodical approach of early English learning in children.\r\n- Outdoored, Outdoor leadership \u2013 transfering their experience in working with children and their skills of organizing and conducting children outdoor activities through creative games and exercises \r\n\r\nOur institution plans to conduct all mobility activities within two years. In order to effectively organize work of the institution (working in 4 separate facilities), we planned on two employees from different facilities taking part in each activity, to ensure the good implementation of the acquired knowledge and experience in practice. The project will have a positive impact on the employees who participate in mobility by providing new knowledge and experiences and to strengthen their competence. Also, the project will have an indirect positive impact on children and other staff, parents, local and wider community.

Our domestic and foreign business locations as well as the labor market itself need interculturally skilled and internationally deployable employees. At the same time participants should receive attractive development opportunities in the international labor market. Furthermore when interacting with different cultures especially young people can develop their personal skills in a good way and become more open-minded. Important requirements for a successful cooperation in a multinational company like extending the personal horizon, getting self-organized and developing social skills can be achieved here. Within Daimler AG, every apprentice as well as every instructor has the opportunity to participate in the exchange program. In the upcoming funding period 140 apprentices and 21 instructors will be dispatched for an assignment that lasts between 3 to 6 weeks (apprentices) or up to 10 days (educational staff) of time. The ambition is to dispatch apprentices in the second or third year of their apprenticeship in order to ensure a certain amount of expertise. These assignments take place in the different occupational fields on the one hand as well as in different specialist fields in foreign places on the other hand. In advance, the training contents are determined together with the position responsibles in the home country and also abroad.  Instructors from different professional groups take part in the dispatch of educational staff. Through hospitation stays like for example Job-shadowings, these instructors are allocated to the respecitve position responsibles. Already before the actual project takes part, the participants are strongly involved in the project preparation. Through the formation of project groups one can make sure that the tasks are equally distributed and the self-reliance of each and every participant is demanded. During their stay abroad, all participants have a contact person both on site and in the home country. The direct contact person on site accompanies and supports the participants in the execution of the project task or the work assignment. During the stay abroad, the position responsible controls the learning agreement and afterwards the position responsible in the home country does the same. With this kind of approach, we boost the participant`s own initiative as well as their ability of responsibility. Additionally the participants are sensitized and strengthened for further cross-cultural experiences. Especially in a business organization that operates internationally, cross-cultural competence is highly asked for. We put a special focus on the integration of stays abroad into the whole vocational training as well as a really good preparation which is mostly taken by the participants themselves. The experiences from one project serve as a base for continuous improvement management with regard to upcoming stays abroad. On a national and international level we can both enhance the attractiveness of the vocational training at Daimler AG and proclaim the dual system in foreign countries.", "http:// www.mercedes-benz-hpe.com  ", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003994_7"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["8NQ", "DEAN SMITH & GRACE LATHES LIMITED", 106260.0, "Research programme for steel (08.05.01)", "fts_2017_37567", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "NN6"}
