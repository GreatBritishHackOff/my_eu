It aims to train the next generation of researchers to work in diverse teams, to cross disciplinary and sectoral boundaries and apply advanced communication and information technologies to work across many scales of time and space. Detailed project objectives are:\n1.  To provide scientific and professional development to a highly motivated group of early stage researchers (ESRs) to address a number of key interdisciplinary research issues of great importance to the future of transport industries.\n2.  To facilitate and support scientific and professional development of two experienced researchers (ERs) to enable them to become the research leaders in two challenging interdisciplinary research areas.\n3.  To disseminate the knowledge and products developed through scientific research to industry, policy makers and the wider academic community for maximum impact of the research.\n4.  To initiate a sustainable long-term research, training and educational collaboration between the partners involved.\nHere we propose the development of a training network that brings together some of the key active research groups in Europe, with a leading international reputation, in complementary areas relevant to the fields of tribochemistry and interface design. A number of leading industrial companies, comprising of SMEs and LEs, will engage in training and facilitate the Transfer of Knowledge (ToK) to and from the industrial partner through research programmes for 12 ESRs and 2 ERs. The training programme proposed comprises two key elements; generic training to cover aspects of training required for future research leaders in academia and industry and on-the-job training which will include specialised project-specific skills and development.", null, 2684451.0, "ENTICE", "Greener car engines", "Internal combustion engines (ICEs) have been around since the 19th century and are the most common power generating devices in use. New lubrication technologies will significantly increase engine efficiency and decrease emissions in automotive applications.", "Energy is one of the most important areas of research development in the 21st century as increasing human activities put increasing pressures on global climate and the environment. While renewable resources will form an important piece of the future energy puzzle, combustion will remain an important contributor for a long time to come, making improvements in combustion technologies an important contributor to a greener society.\n\nICEs include gasoline and diesel engines, gas turbine engines and even rocket propulsion systems. They are found in everything from cars to industrial machines to space shuttles. A large training network is focusing on development of a new generation of clean and energy-efficient engines with EU support of the http://www.enticeitn.eu/page/entice (ENTICE) (Engineering tribochemistry and interfaces with a focus on the internal combustion engine) project.\n\nTribological processes at interfaces in relative motion and the associated friction and wear are critical to efficient ICEs. These engines convert chemical energy in the bonds of fuel into mechanical work to move parts. Greener lubricants with improved performance will both eliminate harsh chemicals and additives while increasing energy efficiency, and thus reducing emissions. ENTICE is supporting 10 early-stage researchers (ESRs) and 2 experienced researchers, with 2 more ESRs currently being recruited.\n\nThe team is studying the physics associated with the tribochemistry of lubricated contacts. Development of both experimental, analytical and measurement techniques as well as models will aid understanding of processes. In parallel, scientists are investigating oil ageing (lubricant degradation) within the context of tribochemistry processes to develop better and greener lubricants. Experimental simulation of engine tribology systems will enable bench testing of improved systems for automotive engines.\n\nResearchers are taking advantage of numerous academic and industrial training courses complemented by teamwork and mentoring. The productive and enthusiastic collaboration is now leading to the first publications of results. The ENTICE training network is preparing a new generation of scientists to develop significantly more efficient ICEs for cars. Given the increasing number of cars on the roads, this will make a major contribution to decreasing emissions and global climate change.", null, "http://www.mercedes-benz-hpe.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/160896.jpg", "fp7_102080_986455178"], ["7QA", "Developing advanced Biorefinery schemes for integration into existing oil production/transesterification plants", "Charles Jackson & Co Ltd", "An ambitious and achievable vision for 2030 is that up to 25% of the EU\u2019s transport fuel needs could be meet by clean and CO2-efficient biofuel. To achieve this, it will be necessary to promote the transition towards \u201csecond generation biofuels\u201d (e.g. lignocellulosic ethanol, syngas gas based fuels, pyrolysis oil based biofuels) but also support the implementation of currently available biofuels including biodiesel via integrated production of energy and other added-value products trough biorefineries. The aim of SUSTOIL is to develop advanced biorefinery schemes to convert whole EU oil-rich crops (rapeseed, olive and sunflower) into energy (fuels, power and heat), food and bioproducts (chemicals and/or materials) making optimal uses of the side streams generated during farming/harvesting, primary processing (e.g. oil extraction and refining) and secondary processing (e.g. transesterification). This will be achieved by bringing together the appropriate skills in Europe so as to create a critical mass of expertise necessary to develop the Biorefinery scheme. SUSTOIL will integrate the expertise of a number of Project Partners with the expertise of an Advisory Board composed of experts from the EU, US and beyond. Economic, social and environmental costs benefits of optimal integrated schemes will be assessed and main technological challenges/knowledge gaps will be identified, resulting in recommendations of key activities for future collaborative projects.
