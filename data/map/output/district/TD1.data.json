The new business model will offer drastic improvements in product development efficiency (reduced number of physical samples from 20% to 100%, time-to-market reduced by 3 weeks, collaboration between fabric and garment producers), services at low-cost (open, vendor independent and scalable platform), while opening new market opportunities to vendors of CAD and PDM/PLM systems. A just-right Consortium of 6  organisations: A leading European Institute (Fraunhofer-IGD) as Coordinator (will develop the massively parallel simulation engine), Assyst (apparel CAD) and ScotCad (fabric CAD) already offering state-of-the-art 3D VP solutions will work on improving simulation accuracy (from yarn to garment), ATC an ICT company with expertise in web integration based on the SOA model will develop a Collaborative Design and Prototyping  platform (CDP),  and two end-users (Piacenza- manufacturer of fine woollen fabrics and Consitex, the garment manufacturing member of the Ermenegildo Zegna Group) will integrate the innovative VP platform in their joint product development processes and will demonstrate/ evaluate its efficiency and impact. Various exploitation schemes will be adopted (new packaged VP fabric and garment solutions, integrated fabric-garment design and VP offer, joint exploitation of the Software as a Service CDP platform. The project duration is 36 months.", 174155.0, 2909705.0, "FFD", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_99928_966348339"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3HE", "Scalda Europese Mobiliteit 2017 - 2019", "Borders College", 80105.0, "The policy of Scalda concerning International learning is aimed at integration of international learning in the curriculum of the VET education. Each cluster of education is responsible how fast this process will go and to what extent. In 2013 Scalda has written a policy on international learning which states that each cluster of education has to make a scan of its present position regarding international learning, based on ''Archetypes'' of international learning. Afterwards every cluster of VET education of Scalda will write down the cluster's ambition and policy. The project SEM 2016-2019 is part of the policy of Scalda and is aimed at the goals of the policy. In 2015 a plan for excellence is written which included the target to increase international mobilities with 50% by 2018.\r\n\r\nAt the moment 5 clusters of Education are involved: Catering, Tourism & Food (HTV),  Health, Technology & Design (T&D) and CIOS (Sports).  For each educational part of Scalda it is very important the student will experience an European labour market. Scalda wants students to become competent on the international labour market and to gain international (technical) knowledge.  Also the student will experience differences in European cultures, not only in work experience, but by living for a longer time in another European country. Foreign language learning is therefore essential to the project; both professionally as well as communicating in general.\r\n\r\nIn this project professionals of Scalda will expand their professional competences through international mobility, which will benefit the educational courses of Scalda.\r\nThe project will be carried out decentralised at the level of education when it concerns educational support and administration. \r\n At a central level the project coordination and financial administration will be organised.\r\nThe project will receive publicity on the Scalda website, web portals and in newsletters. Also, international  learning will be part of the introductions for young people interested in Scalda courses.", "http://www.borderscollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA102-035088_15"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["3ND", "SCOTCAD TEXTILES LIMITED*", 116674.0, "Promoting entrepreneurship and improving the competitiveness and access to markets of Union enterprises  (02.02.01)", "fts_2016_23690", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "TD1"}
