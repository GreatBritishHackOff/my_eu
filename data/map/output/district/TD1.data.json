The new business model will offer drastic improvements in product development efficiency (reduced number of physical samples from 20% to 100%, time-to-market reduced by 3 weeks, collaboration between fabric and garment producers), services at low-cost (open, vendor independent and scalable platform), while opening new market opportunities to vendors of CAD and PDM/PLM systems. A just-right Consortium of 6  organisations: A leading European Institute (Fraunhofer-IGD) as Coordinator (will develop the massively parallel simulation engine), Assyst (apparel CAD) and ScotCad (fabric CAD) already offering state-of-the-art 3D VP solutions will work on improving simulation accuracy (from yarn to garment), ATC an ICT company with expertise in web integration based on the SOA model will develop a Collaborative Design and Prototyping  platform (CDP),  and two end-users (Piacenza- manufacturer of fine woollen fabrics and Consitex, the garment manufacturing member of the Ermenegildo Zegna Group) will integrate the innovative VP platform in their joint product development processes and will demonstrate/ evaluate its efficiency and impact. Various exploitation schemes will be adopted (new packaged VP fabric and garment solutions, integrated fabric-garment design and VP offer, joint exploitation of the Software as a Service CDP platform.
