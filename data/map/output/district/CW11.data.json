Despite the importance and incidence of the diseases and the evidence for the possibility of better diagnosis through imaging, there has been relatively little translation of theory into clinical practice.\nIntegrative action is required to train researchers who understand the medical, clinical, technological and commercial aspects of the problem domain and to establish common working methodologies and tools across the field.

We have developed retinal (fundus) photograph analytical software - Spectra, complemented by the lower cost, standalone and portable Spectra Retineye. Spectra is one of only three software packages certified by the English National Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) Screening Programme. It has benefitted screening providers by seamless integration with patient records and ability to monitor over time. Providers reported improved throughput and attendance.  \nSpectra highlights much more than just DR. In deployments to date, over 50% of urgent eye clinic referrals are for suspected non-diabetic retinopathies. Thus, Spectra detects reliable biomarkers for many conditions. The greatest causes of blindness (after cataracts) are glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and DR. Spectra can detect early and treatable stages of these diseases, in particular low-pressure glaucoma missed by ocular pressure tests. New markets also exist for diabetic eye screening programmes (DESP) in countries lacking the resources of the UK NHS. Teleopthalmology (enabled by Spectra Retineye) could deliver these.   \nBoth Spectra and Spectra Retineye can deliver economic benefits:\n\u2022\tReducing need for expensive equipment and highly-qualified staff\n\u2022\tPortability \n\u2022\tIncreased footfall in high-street optometrists from eye screening patients \n\u2022\tEasier and lower cost of screening to patients \n\u2022\tReduced social security costs due to sight loss \nSpectra will deliver tremendous social benefits.

The aim is to achieve this within a one year time frame.    To achieve this, we plan to train our own staff to a proficiency level that will give them the competencies and confidence to deliver to our two mixed age classes.  Currently the four staff lack confidence to deliver the requirement s of the new curriculuum.  We choose to use our own staff as we believe this enables the children to experience the teaching not only in designated lessons but throughout the school day in many ways.  Our own staff are already highly skilled in other key aspects of outstanding teaching including behaviour management.  Our experience informs us that our children respond more positively to known adults and a teacher visiting once a week to deliver a lesson does not have the required relationship to achieve the best attainment and progress.  Our project will be given high priority and the development plan and process we plan to implement the project through is the same as the one we would use for high profile subjects such as English and maths.   Our first priority will be to deliver high quality immersion training to a group of four staff to develop their own language competency ,knowledge of effective methodology and cultural awareness.   We will then provide continuous peer and external professional development support.  On return from the course the participants will contribute to develop the schools, policy and  curriculum planning.  The wider school community including senior leader, governors and parents will be kept well informed and able to monitor and evaluate our progress with the project.  \r\n\r\nTopic based learning will be planned and delivered in a creative and engaging way.  Children will know what they are learning and be able to apply the knowledge and skills taught so that they and their teachers are able to measure attainment and progress in language learning and to identify next steps.  Assessments will be tracked and analyses and used to further improve outcomes.   The school anticipates the quality of the planned project will ensure teaching is at least good and outcomes meet or exceed national expectations. \r\n\r\nThe long term benefit of the project will be that we introduce children from a more deprived backgrounds to new learning and give them opportunities and aspirations for the future that may or may not otherwise be on offer to them.  They will transfer to their next phase of education with confidence and possibly develop languages as an area of strength.
