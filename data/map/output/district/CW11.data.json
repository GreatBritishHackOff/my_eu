Despite the importance and incidence of the diseases and the evidence for the possibility of better diagnosis through imaging, there has been relatively little translation of theory into clinical practice.\nIntegrative action is required to train researchers who understand the medical, clinical, technological and commercial aspects of the problem domain and to establish common working methodologies and tools across the field.

We have developed retinal (fundus) photograph analytical software - Spectra, complemented by the lower cost, standalone and portable Spectra Retineye. Spectra is one of only three software packages certified by the English National Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) Screening Programme. It has benefitted screening providers by seamless integration with patient records and ability to monitor over time. Providers reported improved throughput and attendance.  \nSpectra highlights much more than just DR. In deployments to date, over 50% of urgent eye clinic referrals are for suspected non-diabetic retinopathies. Thus, Spectra detects reliable biomarkers for many conditions. The greatest causes of blindness (after cataracts) are glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and DR. Spectra can detect early and treatable stages of these diseases, in particular low-pressure glaucoma missed by ocular pressure tests. New markets also exist for diabetic eye screening programmes (DESP) in countries lacking the resources of the UK NHS. Teleopthalmology (enabled by Spectra Retineye) could deliver these.   \nBoth Spectra and Spectra Retineye can deliver economic benefits:\n\u2022\tReducing need for expensive equipment and highly-qualified staff\n\u2022\tPortability \n\u2022\tIncreased footfall in high-street optometrists from eye screening patients \n\u2022\tEasier and lower cost of screening to patients \n\u2022\tReduced social security costs due to sight loss \nSpectra will deliver tremendous social benefits.
