The main advantage of diffusion bonding is that, unlike welding, it is not a 'fusion' process \u2013 it is a solid state process and the parent materials to be joined do not need to be melted. This makes diffusion bonding an ideal solution for joining materials such as metals to ceramics and Aluminium, Titanium, Nickel, Steel etc.\n\nOther advantages include near-parent properties, minimal shape change to parts and no post-finishing. The key to successful diffusion bonding lies in choosing process conditions which are appropriate to the circumstances, because the joint needs to form successfully with both parent materials, whilst controlling deformation. Joint intimacy and cleanliness are also critical factors.\n\nA reliable NDE method is required for the inspection of the bonds. A non-satisfactory bonding may include voids that will have a negative effect of the integrity of the joint. The challenge in inspecting these bonds is that the joining process will create a multi-layered structure that will complicate the interpretation of the inspection data. In addition to this, the bonding layer will have an irregular surface making most inspection techniques unsuitable.\n\nIt is anticipated that this issue can be solved by developing a phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) method and Full Matrix Capture (FMC), that combined with a material-based model of the multi-layered structure will give an assessment of the diffusion bonding. The model and the tailored inspection data will then be used in signal processing algorithms to extract features of the bonding layer.

The nascent technology of space-domain multiplexing (SDM) for high capacity transmission is the only solution with the scaling potential to meet future demands. However, there is still a large technological chasm between the transport solution and the SDM network implementation.INSPACE proposes a novel networking approach by extending the established spectral flexibility concepts to the SDM domain and significantly simplifying the super-channel allocation and control mechanisms, by removing current limitations related with the wavelength continuity and fragmentation issues. The new concept utilises the benefits of the high capacity, next generation, few-mode/multi-core fiber infrastructures, providing also a practical short term solution, since it is directly applicable over the currently installed multi-fibre cable links. The realisation of INSPACE approach is enabled by the development of novel multi-dimensional spatial-spectral switching nodes, which are fabricated by extending the designs of the existing flexible WSS nodes, incorporating advance mode/core adapting techniques. The concept is further supported by novel processing techniques that minimise the mode/core interference as well as new network planning algorithms and control plane extensions that are enhanced with the space dimension.

Combination of psychological testing, brain-imaging and exclusion of other neurological disorders makes the diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease complicated and time consuming (taking up to 20 months). A rapid, sensitive and specific immunoassay for protein markers inside blood would largely improve early diagnosis and lead to a better treatment of dementia. Homogeneous assays based on FRET from one dye labeled specific antibody (AB1) to another (AB2) within an \u201cAB1-biomarker-AB2\u201d immune complex are an ideal basis to meet these diagnostic requirements.

Current diagnosis methods are time consuming and there are limited assays for monitoring disease progression. As a result, novel diagnostic and prognostic tools are required to alleviate patients from the suffering of continuous monitoring.\n\nSeeking to address this, the EU-funded 'Quantum dot-based highly sensitive immunoassays for multiplexed diagnostics of Alzheimer's disease' (http://www.nanognostics.org/ (NANOGNOSTICS)) project set out to develop an innovative tool for identifying alterations of protein expression patterns caused by AD. The NANOGNOSTICS technology relied on a multiplex immunoassay where detection of a biomarker was performed by two differently labelled antibodies. When the two antibodies recognised the same molecule, they came into close proximity and a physical phenomenon known as fluorescence resonance transfer (FRET) occurred. This phenomenon required that the employed dyes had overlapping emission and absorption spectra, and that the antibodies were brought together on the same molecule by another level of strong binding, the biotin\u2013streptavidin interaction. \n\nThe advantage of this technology over standard immunoassays was the signal amplification it generated, making it sensitive enough to detect small amounts of protein in human blood. Importantly, researchers are confident that diagnosis would be provided in less than 10 minutes following blood sample collection.\n\nAs alternatives to fluorescent dyes, project partners exploited the nanoparticles known as semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Their unique photophysical properties combined with their size-dependent absorption and emission wavelengths render QDs ideal candidates for such purposes. To this end, a variety of QDs were studied for their suitability to be used in highly sensitive clinical FRET-bioassays.\n\nResearchers worked on the applicability of various proteins as disease biomarkers of AD, and focused particularly on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), EGF and L-selectin. Additional assays based on the aggregated form of amyloid-beta peptide \u2014 the hallmark of AD \u2014 were constructed. \n\nApplication of the NANOGNOSTICS assays was performed on blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples from AD patients.

The transmitter module that implements the optical super-channels employs a planar optical multi-channel Silica motherboard carrying four hybridly integrated InP-based twin-IQ Mach-Zehnder Modulators in combination with a novel 8x8 AWG-based waveguide structures on board. The receiver is a fully integrated, multi-channel optical coherent receiver module consisting of a similar 8x8 AWG-based waveguide structure with DFT functionality, eight 90\u00b0 hybrids and high speed balanced photo-detector arrays of 32 active elements per polarisation, hybridly integrated onto a Silica motherboard. Additionally, ASTRON will develop advanced digital signal processing algorithms for impairment mitigation and a novel software-defined signal processing module that renders the transceiver flexible in terms of format, bit rate and spectrum utilization.

Point of Care of the device will be carried out by preclinical and clinical sample analysis of genitourinary cancer patients to warrant personalized medicine. \nImportantly the GLAM unique technology will make the device also usable with other biofluids and might also be used to help physicians with other biomarker driven.", 333385.0, 4022113.0, "GLAM", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_193314_985490319"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["6FF", "Business Competitiveness - West Lothian", "West Lothian Council", "raising the levels of performance of SME\u2019s, particularly those in smart Specialisation and regionally important sectors through additional Business Gateway Service.", "ERDF", 1714513.87, 4286284.68, "erdf_scotland_92"], ["6FF", "Business Competitiveness", "West Lothian Council", "Raising the levels of performance of SME\u2019s, particularly those in smart Specialisation and regionally important sectors through expansion of Business Gateway Service", "ERDF", 147271.64, 368179.1, "erdf_scotland_93"], ["6FF", "West Lothian Pipeline Management and Monitoring", "West Lothian Council", "Strategic Intervention management, administration and compliance.", "ESF", 73269.18, 183172.95, "esf_scotland_214"], ["6FF", "Pipeline to Employment", "West Lothian Council", "The operation will deliver interventions across all stages in the employability pipeline and will include delivering by both intensive and tailored one-to-one and also group based approaches, providing qualification and employment outcomes.", "ESF", 1488730.82, 3721827.05, "esf_scotland_215"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["5DW", "ROUTE MONKEY LTD", 808100.0, "Making the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system (32.04.03.01)", "fts_2017_1584", 2017], ["7DQ", "OPTOCAP LTD*", 337808.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_3170", 2017], ["7EJ", "OPTOSCRIBE LIMITED*", 276886.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_4748", 2017], ["7GA", "DESIGN LED PRODUCTS LIMITED*", 153560.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_10980", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "EH54"}
