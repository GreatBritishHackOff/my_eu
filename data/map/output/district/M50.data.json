SME-AGs have identified the \u201cpremium\u201d branding approach, as a response to the competitive pressure from producers in developing nations and from large retailers. This goal is aligned with the major objectives of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP): to improve European fruit quality, and to promote the consumption of healthy food by European citizens.\n\nVia FRUITGRADING, SME-AG associates estimate that the base price at origin can be raised by 10%-30% with respect to standard \u201cextra class\u201d and \u201cfirst class\u201d fruit, which will deliver an additional turnover of \u20ac5.7M/year for the set of associates. From the perspective of the European Fruit Sector, SME-AGs have estimated that the general adoption of the proposed sorting technology could potentially generate up to \u20ac3.5 billion in the EU-27. Considering the significant market potential for the proposed system, SME-AG proposers plan to patent and fully exploit the proposed technology.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, FRUITGRADING aims to develop and validate a fruit sorting pilot plant which integrates low cost and contactless inspection technologies for assessing the internal quality of the fruit. Sorting technologies currently available in the market rely on the measurement of external quality criteria, and are unable to quantify internal fruit quality \u2013 which is perceived by the customer, however. By combining Magnetic Induction Spectroscopy, and Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy, FRUITGRADING will evaluate electric and optical parameters, which are known to be correlated with standard reference analytical methods to determine internal fruit quality (such as Solid Soluble Content, water content, etc).", 16285.0, 1723821.0, "FRUITGRADING", "The pick of the crop", "A huge boost to fruit grading is imminent thanks to research into rating internal quality. Scientists are using equipment more at home in a hospital or laboratory to achieve this.", "Top quality class fruit can demand a price double that of Class II. As the criteria for classification includes internal quality as well as external appearance, the fresh fruit and vegetable (FFV) sector would benefit greatly from inclusion of high-tech sorting methods on the production line.\n\nThe 'A low cost sorting solution for the fruit sector based on the evaluation of internal fruit quality' (http://www.fruitgrading.eu/ (FRUITGRADING)) project has started work on a new fruit sorting technology. Their goals are in alignment with the major objectives of the European Common Agricultural Policy: to improve European fruit quality and to promote the consumption of healthy food.\n\nTesting is focused on two main technologies \u2014 magnetic induction spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for evaluating electrical and optical parameters, respectively. During the first project period, the researchers characterised fruit internal qualities at the laboratory level. These include sugar, acidity and firmness in a variety of apples, pears, peaches and kiwis. They also calculated the definition of the specifications for the development of the fruit sorting prototype.\n\nThe FRUITGRADING team performed a correlation analysis for the design of the optical instrument that will be developed during the second phase. They also analysed the electromagnetic response of fruit during ripening and the corresponding change in the electromagnetic spectrum. To optimise the instrument and improve correlation models, work will focus on further reducing sensor noise.\n\nFRUITGRADING has organised training and dissemination to optimise use of the new technologies in the FFV sector. For producers, new sorting methods permit production on the basis of 'premium quality' using suitable quality benchmarks for critical parameters. As the technology is non-invasive, percentage of discarded fruit will be reduced. Moreover, fruit farmers can implement pre-sorting strategies before fruit storage in maturation chambers.\n\nThere has been a steady rise in demand for premium fruit \u2014 an average of 8.9\u00a0% increase per year in the last 5 years in the United States \u2014 despite a drop in overall consumption.

This facility would be the first of its kind in the world and would represent a significant advance for metallurgy. The novel technology that enables this HTT facility is based on automated, direct laser deposition (DLD). The key feature of this technology is the way in which a mixture of elemental powders is accurately and directly fed into the laser's focal point, heated by the laser beam, and deposited on a substrate in the form of a melt pool, which finally solidifies to create a unique fully-dense alloy button with precise stoichiometry. This robotic alloy synthesis is 1000 times faster than conventional manual methods. Once produced, these discrete mm-sized samples are submitted to a range of automated, standardised tests that will measure chemical, physical and mechanical properties. The vast amount of information will be recorded in a 'Virtual Alloy Library' and coupled with computer codes such as neural network models, in order to extract and map out the key trends linking process, composition, structure and properties. The most promising alloy formulations will be further tested, patented and exploited by the 20 end-users.

These pollutants are often present in rivers and industrial effluents. Catalytic ozonation not only removed the initial pollutant, but was effective in the removal of less toxic by-products of the ozonation process. Bromate, for instance, was reduced to harmless bromide.\n\nProject members also developed and tested catalysts for the reduction of nitrates. Reducing nitrates (often found in fertilisers) to nitrogen (N2) is complicated by the need to avoid the formation of ammonia (NH3) (also a pollutant).

ActivitiesClass discussion around career opportunities and their required qualifications in both countries highlighted after relevant trips or visiting speakers. For example a visit to a local Stud Yard to look at the different roles available in this specific career and entry qualifications or advancements in reproductive technologies. An assessment will be for students to work in pairs to map equine careers with qualification levels in both France and England. Work experience placement will be arranged and will form part of the portfolio of evidence. Introduction to stable management practices of the yard and work experience. Ridden competitions in a foreign language - learners will learn equine phrases in a foreign language to understand/deliver instructions.

This project has established a trans-curricular team and a network of European partner schools, setting the grounds for further enhancement of our international development. \r\nSituated in an attractive part of the French Mediterranean, where unemployment and precariousness are key issues nonetheless, the Ernest Ferroul High School\u2019s ambition is to broaden the horizon of its pupils by offering them a wider range of opportunities, particularly in the vocational fields. \r\nThe objectives are manifold and have been set in compliance with the school project: \r\n- To develop the pupils\u2019 professional, linguistic and cultural skills, to help them build their citizenship skills within the European Union and to challenge social and geographic determinism, which is strongly-felt in the d\u00e9partement of Aude. \r\n- To improve the students\u2019 school results, retention and future employability, by giving them more professional experience. \r\n- To prepare the teachers (namely in Science and vocational subjects) to CLIL in order to prepare the opening of European Sections. \r\n- To improve the teaching skills of the teams through peer to peer exchanges and joint projects with our European partners. \r\n- To improve the curricular offer of the school \r\n- To boost the students\u2019 motivation and the teachers\u2019 well-being. \r\nAfter the success of the first project, the team has settled the grounds for further developments: new staff members have joined the initial team, a new section (Bac Pro ASSP \u2013 Health Care and Child Care) is going to be involved and new destinations are going to be offered (Amurrio and Girona in Spain, Lauterbach in Germany). The next mobility projects will thus involve three languages: English, Spanish and German.\r\nIn Spain: \r\n-Las Palmas de Gran Canaria : 4 student mobilities (two 2nd-year students in \u201cRetail and sales\u201d + two 2nd-year students in logistics)\r\n- Amurrio: 4 student mobilities (four 3rd-year students in Health Care and child care)\r\n- Girona: 2 student mobilities (one 3rd-year student in Logistics + one 3rd-year student in Transport)\r\nIn the United Kingdom:\r\n-Salford \u2013 Greater Manchester-England: 4 students mobilities (four 2nd-year students in \u201cRetail and sales\u201d)\r\nThe Ernest Ferroul Secondary School has already had the privilege of building strong collaboration with intermediary partners (namely the Salford City Council and its twinning committee, the CIFP Cruz de Piedra in the Canary Islands, the IES ZARAOBE in Armurio, Masco Trans Society) who provide invaluable assistance for the pupils\u2019 work placements. \r\nThat support and guidance at each stage of the project guarantee the quality of the work placements, and the variety of the tasks that are set for the students within the framework of each degree. \r\nRegarding the staff work placements, Salford City College as well as the Spanish and German partner schools work with us to set up visits that fit the needs of the French teachers (observing how specific educational issues are tackled or discovering new learning practices). \r\nBy enabling our students to take part in European mobilities during their studies, not only do we help them to gain significantly in terms of linguistic and professional benefits but also contribute to their intercultural awareness as well as their identity and citizenship construction, by changing their perspectives at a European level. Acquiring intercultural skills and better mastering a foreign language will be a strong asset to live, work and succeed within the European Union.\r\nErasmus staff mobilities will also be highly beneficial. By observing class practices and exchanging with European counterparts, our staff will discover new ways of teaching or managing a school. These visits will be great opportunities that will contribute to the students and the whole school improvement by adapting these successful practices and implementing them in our own national educational context.\r\nIn the very near future Ernest Ferroul College is to become one of the trade and qualifications campus support schools for the logistics and transport sector.

The Ernest Ferroul Secondary School is highly determined to enhance its curricular offer and students\u2019 skills by offering such fantastic mobility opportunities inside the European Union and fully aware of the necessity to build up a real expertise and a solid network on a European scale without any delay.", "http://www.salfordcc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-047012_1"], ["3SR", "Equine Management European Mobility", "Salford City College", 79484.0, "There are an estimated 1 million horses in the UK with the gross output of the equestrian sector is valued at \u00a33.8 billion (source: BETA National Equestrian Survey 2011). The equine industry in the UK is varied offering significant employment from leisure to professional sectors.  The programme aims to highlight the varied roles in the industry in Europe, focusing on opportunities and developing employability skills for students. Ryders Farm Equestrian Centre is based in an urban area of Salford, in comparison to the less densely populated, rural area of Terrou in France. Both colleges offer exceptional facilities and outstanding learning environments. The mobility opportunities for both countries will offer a unique experience for learners to benefit from a different perspective of the equine industry in contrasting settings. SCC have worked with MFR Terrou on KA1 and KA2 mobilities for the past 5 years. This next project will enhance this successful partnership further.\r\nObjectives\r\nEnsure both colleges are delivering the core competences required in both economic contexts, through discussions, joint work and evaluation. Increasing awareness of the wider equine industry in Europe, giving a deeper understanding of the varied roles, skills required, technical knowledge including ICT and raising career aspirations.\r\nTo develop educational aspirations in further and higher education as well as aid student retention by providing a exclusive opportunity to work and study abroad in their area of interest.\r\nTo improve students long term employability chances through skills development both vocationally specific and personal 'soft' skills including social, self-management skills and problem-solving in order to support innovation. Promoting flexibility and adaptability of learners in terms of working or learning environments.\r\nTo educate students to value the cultural differences in the work setting and in society through joint working, socialising and participating in the local community.\r\nTo create shared learning opportunities and build international partnerships to promote mobility for teachers and students.\r\nTo produce a project portfolio of evidence, closely linked to the curriculum, demonstrating key learning outcomes of the work placement, cultural experience, equine practical tasks and personal development skills.  \r\nThe target group are Level three Equine Management students aged 17-19 from various socio-economic backgrounds, the majority of which are from disadvantaged areas of the city or vulnerable due to independent living.\r\nAccompanying teaching staff are experts themselves in the industry. Their role will be to support by giving assistance and guidance to students who require extra help, due to their specific identified needs.  Teachers will benefit from sharing knowledge, skills and experience with international colleagues. \r\nActivities\r\nClass discussion around career opportunities and their required qualifications in both countries highlighted after relevant trips or visiting speakers. For example a visit to a local Stud Yard to look at the different roles available in this specific career and entry qualifications or advancements in reproductive technologies. An assessment will be for students to work in pairs to map equine careers with qualification levels in both France and England. \r\nWork experience placement will be arranged and will form part of the portfolio of evidence. Introduction to stable management practices of the yard and work experience. Ridden competitions in a foreign language - learners will learn equine phrases in a foreign language to understand/deliver instructions. Maths classes, incorporating ICT skills, English and French-development of language skills will improve confidence in students to engage in the planned activities in the local community. Cultural elements will consist of visits to local towns, Ch\u00e2teau, farmers market, local areas of natural beauty, education on the history of the area. \r\nA qualitative methodology will be used to assess the activities and overall project success, using feedback and unstructured interviews with a general theme to allow the conversation to develop organically in an informal way. \r\nWe expect students to have learned about careers and education opportunities in both France and England.  Learners will have developed both their vocational and personal skills. We envisage the project will encourage others to participate in European cooperation projects.  Students will be able to use the skills they acquired on the project in future study or careers. As this project offers an invaluable opportunity, students- particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds- will experience a once in a lifetime challenge.", "http://www.salfordcc.ac.uk", "Salford City College", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047402_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2GL", "COMMUNITY FOREST TRUST", 1074616.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_1368", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "M50"}
