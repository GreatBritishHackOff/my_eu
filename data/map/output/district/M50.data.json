SME-AGs have identified the \u201cpremium\u201d branding approach, as a response to the competitive pressure from producers in developing nations and from large retailers. This goal is aligned with the major objectives of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP): to improve European fruit quality, and to promote the consumption of healthy food by European citizens.\n\nVia FRUITGRADING, SME-AG associates estimate that the base price at origin can be raised by 10%-30% with respect to standard \u201cextra class\u201d and \u201cfirst class\u201d fruit, which will deliver an additional turnover of \u20ac5.7M/year for the set of associates. From the perspective of the European Fruit Sector, SME-AGs have estimated that the general adoption of the proposed sorting technology could potentially generate up to \u20ac3.5 billion in the EU-27. Considering the significant market potential for the proposed system, SME-AG proposers plan to patent and fully exploit the proposed technology.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, FRUITGRADING aims to develop and validate a fruit sorting pilot plant which integrates low cost and contactless inspection technologies for assessing the internal quality of the fruit. Sorting technologies currently available in the market rely on the measurement of external quality criteria, and are unable to quantify internal fruit quality \u2013 which is perceived by the customer, however. By combining Magnetic Induction Spectroscopy, and Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy, FRUITGRADING will evaluate electric and optical parameters, which are known to be correlated with standard reference analytical methods to determine internal fruit quality (such as Solid Soluble Content, water content, etc).", 16285.0, 1723821.0, "FRUITGRADING", "The pick of the crop", "A huge boost to fruit grading is imminent thanks to research into rating internal quality. Scientists are using equipment more at home in a hospital or laboratory to achieve this.", "Top quality class fruit can demand a price double that of Class II. As the criteria for classification includes internal quality as well as external appearance, the fresh fruit and vegetable (FFV) sector would benefit greatly from inclusion of high-tech sorting methods on the production line.\n\nThe 'A low cost sorting solution for the fruit sector based on the evaluation of internal fruit quality' (http://www.fruitgrading.eu/ (FRUITGRADING)) project has started work on a new fruit sorting technology. Their goals are in alignment with the major objectives of the European Common Agricultural Policy: to improve European fruit quality and to promote the consumption of healthy food.\n\nTesting is focused on two main technologies \u2014 magnetic induction spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for evaluating electrical and optical parameters, respectively. During the first project period, the researchers characterised fruit internal qualities at the laboratory level. These include sugar, acidity and firmness in a variety of apples, pears, peaches and kiwis. They also calculated the definition of the specifications for the development of the fruit sorting prototype.\n\nThe FRUITGRADING team performed a correlation analysis for the design of the optical instrument that will be developed during the second phase. They also analysed the electromagnetic response of fruit during ripening and the corresponding change in the electromagnetic spectrum. To optimise the instrument and improve correlation models, work will focus on further reducing sensor noise.\n\nFRUITGRADING has organised training and dissemination to optimise use of the new technologies in the FFV sector. For producers, new sorting methods permit production on the basis of 'premium quality' using suitable quality benchmarks for critical parameters. As the technology is non-invasive, percentage of discarded fruit will be reduced. Moreover, fruit farmers can implement pre-sorting strategies before fruit storage in maturation chambers.\n\nThere has been a steady rise in demand for premium fruit \u2014 an average of 8.9\u00a0% increase per year in the last 5 years in the United States \u2014 despite a drop in overall consumption.

This facility would be the first of its kind in the world and would represent a significant advance for metallurgy. The novel technology that enables this HTT facility is based on automated, direct laser deposition (DLD). The key feature of this technology is the way in which a mixture of elemental powders is accurately and directly fed into the laser's focal point, heated by the laser beam, and deposited on a substrate in the form of a melt pool, which finally solidifies to create a unique fully-dense alloy button with precise stoichiometry. This robotic alloy synthesis is 1000 times faster than conventional manual methods. Once produced, these discrete mm-sized samples are submitted to a range of automated, standardised tests that will measure chemical, physical and mechanical properties. The vast amount of information will be recorded in a 'Virtual Alloy Library' and coupled with computer codes such as neural network models, in order to extract and map out the key trends linking process, composition, structure and properties. The most promising alloy formulations will be further tested, patented and exploited by the 20 end-users. Industrial interests include: (i) new lightweight fuel-saving alloys (<4.5 g/cm3) for aerospace and automotive applications; (ii) new higher-temperature alloys (stable>1000\u00b0C) for rockets, gas turbines, jet-engines, nuclear fusion; (iii) new high-Tc superconductor alloys (>30K) that can be wire-drawn for electrical applications; (iv) new high-ZT thermoelectric alloys for converting waste heat directly into electricity; (v) new magnetic and magnetocaloric alloys for motors and refrigeration; and (vi) new phase-change alloys for high-density memory storage.

From aerospace and automotive applications to electrical and computing devices, metals are ubiquitous. Novel materials are a key driver of new product development. The EU-funded project Accmet was designed to accelerate the alloy discovery process to less than one year from the current five to six years by exploiting high-throughput technologies (HTTs).\n\nScientists are exploiting direct laser deposition (DLD) that enables two elemental powders to be mixed, melted and deposited onto a substrate forming a solid fully-dense alloy button with precise stoichiometry. Automated DLD synthesis is 1\u00a0000 times faster than conventional manual methods. DLD is being employed with a combinatorial synthesis and testing protocol. It further speeds the process by focusing on certain synthesis combinations and certain tests.\n\nThe information will be stored in a virtual alloy library with processing algorithms to extract and link processing parameters, composition, structure and properties. The most promising combinations will be pursued for patenting and commercialisation.\n\nThe first project year has been focused on assembling the required staff and high-throughput equipment. Most positions have now been filled and two new research groups have been formed at partner facilities. Following a detailed inventory of available equipment in partner labs, scientists identified the need for accessories and complete machines to enable rapid alloy synthesis, testing and analysis. Although development of labs is ongoing, enhancements have already enabled demonstrated synthesis of specific alloy compositions. Automation is also underway. Scientists have chosen target alloy systems with input from end users and are developing the necessary analytical techniques for alloy testing.\n\nAccmet expects to do for the European metallurgy industry what HTT has done for the pharmaceutical industry, providing an advantage over competitors due to faster new product development.

Every partner responsible for testing the monoliths will focus on a different pollutant (Nitrates, organic matter\u2026) and catalytic process (hydrogenation, oxidation) depending on the particular expertise of every partner. The properties of monolithic reactor coated with NCM, e.g. thin catalyst layer and mesoporosity, enable the control of the diffusion path and enhance the diffusion of reactant to catalytic sites. The objective is to achieve, via the use of monoliths coated with NCM, an intensification of the catalytic process in terms of improved selectivity, robustness, stability and performance while reducing energy requirements and by-product generation with respect to the catalytic process using conventional reactors, as e.g. trickled bed or slurry", 32201.0, 2309321.0, "MONACAT", "Microscopic labyrinths for selective water purification", "Access to clean drinking water is necessary for life.

Scientists set out to control structural designs of the macroscopic reactor and nano-scale catalysts. Their aim was to enhance detoxification performance by optimising the diffusion path and contact with catalytic sites. To achieve their goal, they employed monolith reactors containing channels in a honeycomb structure. They coated these with catalyst nanoparticles (NPs) based on carbon nanofibres (CNFs).\n\nA number of catalysts were developed and tested for ozonation of five micropollutants, namely an antibiotic, a pharmaceutical, two pesticides and an endocrine system disruptor. These pollutants are often present in rivers and industrial effluents. Catalytic ozonation not only removed the initial pollutant, but was effective in the removal of less toxic by-products of the ozonation process. Bromate, for instance, was reduced to harmless bromide.\n\nProject members also developed and tested catalysts for the reduction of nitrates. Reducing nitrates (often found in fertilisers) to nitrogen (N2) is complicated by the need to avoid the formation of ammonia (NH3) (also a pollutant). One of MONACAT's nitrate-reducing catalysts achieved record-breaking catalytic activity and N2 selectivity in a continuous mode open-flow reactor using natural water.\n\nNanocarbon coatings were tested for industrial application, energy cost and adhesion of NPs simulating natural flow conditions. All tests were successful, supporting the suitability and safety of the composites for use in catalytic water treatment.\n\nMONACAT systems employ novel water purification technology that could provide industries with viable means of ensuring compliance with global environment safety regulations and keeping costs down.
