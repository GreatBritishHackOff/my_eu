Making buildings more sustainable is an excellent way to have high impact on challenges such as water and energy consumption and material waste.\n\nA large European consortium laid the groundwork for development of a standardised assessment system for sustainable buildings (SBs) with EU funding of the project 'Sustainability and performance assessment and benchmarking of buildings - Superbuildings' (SUPERBUILDINGS). Scientists focused on the development of assessment methods and indicators of environmental, social and economic performance within the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n\nThe consortium focused on potential indicators for which assessment information is lacking, that relate to methodological issues or that are currently completely lacking. Researchers chose 13 indicators, including those related to water and non-renewable energy consumption, land use, global warming potential, waste generation, water pollution and indoor air quality. Scientists determined that local knowledge regarding typical performance values and sustainability indicators is already good among architects, designers, planning authorities and building authorities. However, it is currently of minimal concern to bankers, insurance companies and community representatives.\n\nScientists studied the effective use of sustainability indicators throughout the building process, from customer briefing and planning for SBs to design, implementation and use/maintenance. The team also made recommendations for the technical and semantic integration of indicators into building information modelling (BIM). A relatively new modelling platform, BIM enables building professionals to explore a project digitally before beginning construction. Researchers concluded that SB indicators are mature enough to be included in all life-cycle phases. They thus proceeded with developing recommendations for implementation of the system.\n\nSUPERBUILDINGS investigated the potential for standardisation of building sustainability indicators in order to benchmark building performance at all stages of the building process.

Due to climate change, the extent and consequences of flooding are likely to become more severe in the future. It is, for this reason, essential not only to know the flood risk, but also to take measures in advance to protect people and their homes.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Smart resilience technology, systems and tools' (http://www.floodresilience.eu/ (SMARTEST)) project was initiated to promote the adoption of flood protection technologies and facilitate the design of holistic flood defence systems. During its three-year lifetime, it sought to open the route to market for innovation and support implementation of the European policy on flood risk management.\n\nSMARTEST brought together academics and researchers from different disciplines who analysed how conventional technologies for flood protection are deployed. After reviewing the best and worst practices in the adaptation or construction of buildings, they developed guidelines for employing flood protection systems. They also assessed obstacles in the uptake of new technologies and isolated opportunities to overcome them.\n\nThe European market has seen the emergence of smart flood resilience technology. Such technology may be based on automatic control of barriers and protection walls, or innovative materials for higher performance. SMARTEST partners worked with manufacturers, consultants, the insurance industry, environmental agencies and local authorities to establish standards and test the new products.\n\nA wide range of innovative flood resilience products was tested in the laboratory. Based on the results, the team created a database with reliable information on the performance of each technology as well as its limitations. SMARTEST identified performance tests as one of the keys to supporting adoption of smart flood resilience technologies. However, further research is needed before integrating the new technologies into flood risk management plans.\n\nProject researchers have developed models to assess the extent of flooding and help decision makers be better informed of the potential impact. Linked to the http://www.tech.floodresilience.eu/ (decision-support platform) available on the project website, these can be used to determine the benefits of flood protection technologies.\n\nThe SMARTEST project was innovative in the design of flood protection strategies.

However, its fabrication is characterized by total CO2 emissions amounting to around 5% of the worldwide anthropogenic GHG emissions. More sustainable cements with lower embodied energy and CO2 footprint are needed.\nAs stated in the European Directive on Energy Performance of Buildings (COM 2010/31/EU), the development of better performing insulation materials and lightweight systems for building envelopes is crucial, playing a significant role in the reduction of buildings operational energy while complying with the load bearing features of existing building structures.\nThe ECO-binder project aims to implement industrial R&D activities on the results of previous research, demonstrating the possibility of replacing Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) and OPC based concrete products with new ones based on the new Belite-Ye\u2019elimite-Ferrite (BYF) class of low-CO2 binders to develop a new generation of concrete-based construction materials and prefabricated building envelope components with more than 30% lower embodied energy, 20% improved insulation properties and 15% lower cost than the actual solutions based on Portland cement. The new building envelope solutions will integrate multiple functions in a single product package, providing the higher performances in terms of acoustic insulation/absorption, fire resistance, dimensional stability, indoor air quality optimization, at an affordable cost.  Demonstration of full-scale retrofitting  and construction will be performed prototyping and installing a family of prefabricated concrete systems of different complexity and end-use in four different climatic conditions involving public authorities..

The HONEST (High performance Optimized Nanomaterial Energy efficient SysTem) package is a \u201cmodular toolbox system\u201d providing a set of complementary solutions that will address most of the complex challenges raised by thermal renovation as well as new construction.\nThe HONEST package includes: insulating thermal coating-finishing with low emissivity, internal high performance insulating plaster, insulating interior patching filler, external high performance insulating render, and insulation clay bricks. These products/systems will provide top insulation performance as well as improved comfort, indoor air quality, fire safety, durability and sustainability. \nThese highly efficient products are achieved through the synergy between the different members of the consortium through combining the high performance, sustainable, and advanced nanotechnology of the silica aerogel, with existing, already approved, efficient products. The aerogel materials structure properties and cost will be optimised. The process of the five high efficient mineral insulation systems will be scaled-up to test replicability, processability and reach industrial scale. Then, these five systems will be fully characterised including an LCA assessment, along with certification and standardization activities.\nIn addition, the project sets a major focus on the \u201cgo to market\u201d validation of the five products.
