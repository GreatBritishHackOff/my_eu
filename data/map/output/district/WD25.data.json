Scientists focused on the development of assessment methods and indicators of environmental, social and economic performance within the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n\nThe consortium focused on potential indicators for which assessment information is lacking, that relate to methodological issues or that are currently completely lacking. Researchers chose 13 indicators, including those related to water and non-renewable energy consumption, land use, global warming potential, waste generation, water pollution and indoor air quality. Scientists determined that local knowledge regarding typical performance values and sustainability indicators is already good among architects, designers, planning authorities and building authorities. However, it is currently of minimal concern to bankers, insurance companies and community representatives.\n\nScientists studied the effective use of sustainability indicators throughout the building process, from customer briefing and planning for SBs to design, implementation and use/maintenance. The team also made recommendations for the technical and semantic integration of indicators into building information modelling (BIM). A relatively new modelling platform, BIM enables building professionals to explore a project digitally before beginning construction. Researchers concluded that SB indicators are mature enough to be included in all life-cycle phases.

Due to climate change, the extent and consequences of flooding are likely to become more severe in the future. It is, for this reason, essential not only to know the flood risk, but also to take measures in advance to protect people and their homes.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Smart resilience technology, systems and tools' (http://www.floodresilience.eu/ (SMARTEST)) project was initiated to promote the adoption of flood protection technologies and facilitate the design of holistic flood defence systems. During its three-year lifetime, it sought to open the route to market for innovation and support implementation of the European policy on flood risk management.\n\nSMARTEST brought together academics and researchers from different disciplines who analysed how conventional technologies for flood protection are deployed. After reviewing the best and worst practices in the adaptation or construction of buildings, they developed guidelines for employing flood protection systems. They also assessed obstacles in the uptake of new technologies and isolated opportunities to overcome them.\n\nThe European market has seen the emergence of smart flood resilience technology. Such technology may be based on automatic control of barriers and protection walls, or innovative materials for higher performance. SMARTEST partners worked with manufacturers, consultants, the insurance industry, environmental agencies and local authorities to establish standards and test the new products.\n\nA wide range of innovative flood resilience products was tested in the laboratory. Based on the results, the team created a database with reliable information on the performance of each technology as well as its limitations. SMARTEST identified performance tests as one of the keys to supporting adoption of smart flood resilience technologies. However, further research is needed before integrating the new technologies into flood risk management plans.\n\nProject researchers have developed models to assess the extent of flooding and help decision makers be better informed of the potential impact. Linked to the http://www.tech.floodresilience.eu/ (decision-support platform) available on the project website, these can be used to determine the benefits of flood protection technologies.\n\nThe SMARTEST project was innovative in the design of flood protection strategies.

The phrase \u201cPizza Effect,\u201d was coined in as late as 1970 by an anthropologist named Agehananda Bharati, and is used to describe a phenomenon that sometimes peolple lack of confidence in their own culture, but are eager to blindly accept all things new and foreign. Originally, pizza was looked down upon in Italy as the poor man\u2019s food: it was just simple unleavened bread with a little tomato sauce for taste. Then, accompanying the early emigrants, it made its way to America, where it was garnished with cheese, olives, peppers, various meats, and so on, totally transforming the original into a kind of delicacy. Years later, when it made its triumphant return to the land of its origin, it became a highly respected dish on the menu of even the most eminent restaurants. The new product was eagerly accepted and even given pride of place in Italian cuisine. \r\n\r\nThe venue for the Little Pizza Effect - Food Fusion will be in Budapest, Hungary. The youth will learn about how they can come together to combat prejudices, exchange knowledge and learn from each other based on common interests. The theme of the youth exchange is how a simple thing as food intake,when being prepared consciosly, can be used to unite one another and learn how we can be happy and healthy by addressing our true needs. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to bring together youth from different cultures to educate them about the unity in diversity that exists today through common interests. This will be done through helping participants realize the common goals that we all have for example what we are looking for in life in happiness. Young people can be particularly inspired and reach their potentials if they have a focus for what they want and we want to help them achieve their potential.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n\r\n1. To create an awareness and appreciation of different cultures. The Little Pizza Effect - Food Fusion is designed in such a way to help participants learn about the different cultures and the similarities that exist amongst different type of people.\r\n2. Intercultural learning for participants about sustainable ways of living, especially in the long term. This is one of the reasons we chose the venue in Hungary, since the ethos of the centre is focussed on sustainable living. \r\n3. To help youth realise their potential and open their minds to the great impact they can have on world and help them become active citizens and prepare them for European Citizenship.\r\n4. To promote a healthy lifestyle through healthy eating as well daily practice of sports, yoga and meditation. Our daily schedule has also been designed with this in mind - where activities of such a nature are scheduled daily. \r\n\r\nThe long term effect will be about how the youth can give back to the community. After the exchange activities, all partner organisations will hold a public event in their respective countries where the results of project will be shown (photo and video diary of the project, presentations by leaders and participants on subjects learned at exchange, presentations of physical and character improvement of participants etc.).

A review of the leadership literature led two academics (Day & Lord, 1988) to conclude that the research shows \u201ea consistent effect for leadership explaining 20-45% of the variance on relevant organizational outcomes \u201c. Consequently, leadership training exists as a multi-billion-euros industry, because it works. \r\n\r\nThrough the \"LEAD from inside out\" project, we give young persons the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to become quality leaders with high moral values. In the modern world,  organizations need a leader and developed leadership according to the vision and needs of all members. A leader motivates and inspires people to engage and builds a team, so that it is more effective at achieving a common vision. When organizations can't achieve their vision, they remain without a fundamental function - they can't contribute to the development of the community and can't have a long term impact on the society. This is particularly important in the case of youth workers who work or volunteer in non-profit organizations, because they need strong motivation and continuous support to carry on efficiently with their work. \r\n\r\nBy implementing this project, the objectives we are trying to achieve are: building the capacity of organizations for youth; fostering our transnational network of organizations active in youth work; strengthening the international project capacities of the participating organizations and youth workers who need to improve their skills and competences; improving and professionalizing youth work and key competences/skills of participating youth workers (managerial skills, communication skills, ICT skills etc.); and educating youth workers in proper leadership skills which will help them to deal in day-to-day work. Target group of the project are youth workers - 150 of them who are directly participating in the training activities, and a large number of those participating in dissemination activities and reading the Manual.\r\n\r\nThe youth workers will firstly participate in the online course that will last for 12 weeks and will be based on the previously developed Manual \"LEAD from inside out\". During this activity, they will learn how to improve their leadership skills, how to become good youth workers and how to live and work in a holistic way. The online course will be sufficient enough to improve the quality of youth workers and give them knowledge and skills for further development and materials to apply what they have learned in their organizations, but for those who wish to go a step further and become the multiplicators of this concept and have shown most success through the online course, the Training of trainers will be organized, which will be much more practical and result in youth workers that will be the carriers of the next phases of this project. In this way, by combining the Manual, quality youth workers as multipliers and an online course which will educate many generations of youth workers, the objectives of this project will surely be achieved and, in the long run, the project will contribute to the professionalization of youth work.\r\n\r\nThe 2 main methodologies used will be 1. non-formal learning guided by a formal curriculum and led by qualified educators with vast experience; 2. informal learning through sharing of experiences and good practices from educators to participants and among participants themselves, in a way that many experienced and expert individuals or organizations share their knowledge and in that way educate others through methods like presentations, exercises, lectures, games, debates, practical assignments, IT tools, writing assignments and any other method that shows to be the most suited for transfer of certain knowledge, tool or skill.\r\n\r\nThose youth workers who will participate in this form of education will be able to learn how to become strong and not \"burned-out\" in their youth work, develop their personality and professionalize their work. Youth workers from all over the EU will receive open access to educational materials which have been proven to work in practice, which will be the first step towards their professionalization.
