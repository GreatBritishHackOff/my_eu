EMIF aims to address this by developing a common Information Framework that enables improved access to these data sources, enhancement through linkage of the different sources and collection of additional new information. EMIF will focus on two specific research objectives in order to guide the development of the Information Framework:  identification and evaluation of biomarkers i) of the risk for metabolic complications in obesity; ii) of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease onset in the preclinical and prodromal phase, which in both cases will identify high-risk individuals for future intervention trials. To achieve this, a variety of data sources ranging from small-scale information-rich disease cohorts for biomarker discovery to large EHR data for population characterisation and biomarker validation will be utilised. An extreme phenotype approach will utilise the subpopulations at the extremes of a particular trait distribution using large-scale metabolomics and proteomics for biomarker evaluation. The development of the Information Framework will involve addressing data standards, semantic interoperability as well as ethics, data privacy, legal issues and the development of an IT platform for multi data sources access.

Existing motion synthesis algorithms are severely limited in their ability to cope with real-world objects such as flexible objects or objects with many degrees of freedom. The high dimensionality of the state and action space of such objects defies existing methods for perception, control and planning and leads to poor generalisability of solutions in such domains. These limitations are a core obstacle of current robotic research.We propose to solve these problems by learning and exploiting appropriate topological representations and testing them on challenging domains of flexible, multi-object manipulation and close contact robot control and computer animation. Topological representations describe motion in terms of more abstract, more appropriate, and better generalizing features: for instance, an embracing motion can better be described, controlled and planned in coordinates quantifying the `wrappedness' of arms or fingers around the object (as opposed to joint angle coordinates). Such topological representations exist on different levels of abstraction and reduce the dimensionality of the state and action spaces. This proposal investigates existing topological metrics (similar to the mentioned `wrappedness') and uses data driven methods to discover new mappings that capture key invariances. Given topological representations, we will develop methods for sensing, control and planning using on these representations.This proposal, for the first time, aims to achieve this at all the three levels of sensing, representation and action generation -- by developing novel object-action representations for sensing based on manipulation manifolds and refining metamorphic manipulator design in a complete cycle.

Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the assembly of cortical circuits is that pyramidal cells and interneurons are generated in distant germinal zones.  Pyramidal cells are born locally from progenitors located in the cortical anlage, while interneurons derive from progenitors in the embryonic subpallium.  Much progress has been made recently in understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate the migration of interneurons towards the cortex, but how interneurons find their appropriate partners to build cortical networks with balanced excitation and inhibition remains an enigma.\nThe general goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms controlling the precise allocation of different classes of interneurons into specific layers of the cortex, where they assemble into neural circuits.  We also aim to determine how the allocation of interneurons into specific cortical layers influences their function.

Mechanistically the treatment was shown to induce regulatory T cells in pancreatic lymph nodes and suppress effector T cells in an antigen-specific way.\n\nFocusing on the role of the beta cell in its own destruction, researchers used proteomics and gene expression analysis of beta cells from human islets exposed to cytokines.  A role for several candidate genes for T1D in beta cell responses to cytokines or viral infections has been identified.

Also, many control algorithms suffer from stability problems in the presence of unexpected conditions. Yet biological 'manipulators', like the octopus arm and the elephant trunk, can manipulate objects while controlling the stiffness of selected body parts and being inherently compliant when interacting with objects.<br/>Contributions: We will design, build and operate an innovative soft robotic arm that can squeeze through a standard MIS port (e.g. 12 to 15 mm diameter Trocar port or 20 mm diameter umbilical single port), reconfigure itself and stiffen by hydrostatic actuation to perform compliant force control tasks while facing unexpected situations.

Recently, Professor Hayday&apos;s lab identified a novel immunoglobulin-related molecule, Skint1, which appears to be a selection determinant for skin gamma delta T cells. Furthermore, in the absence of Skint1 and normal skin gamma delta T cells, mice develop spontaneous skin inflammation and are susceptible to skin carcinomas. Hence, Skint1 seems to underpin key aspects of skin immune surveillance. Interestingly, Skint1 shares close sequence homology with Btnl1, 4 and 6; moreover, whereas Skint1 is expressed specifically in thymus and skin epithelia, Btnl1, 4 and 6 are expressed specifically by intestinal epithelia. The gut is a site of chronic immune stimulation where the control of tissue inflammation and stress responses is very important. Therefore, the functional relatedness of Skint1 and the Btnl family provoked our hypothesis that Btnl1 and its relatives may be novel regulators of immunosurveillance, by interacting with intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) in the gut.

Previous scholarship has argued that colonialism created a rupture with past systems of knowledge in colonised musical fields. We will seek to show that the story is more complex: although musical fields did undergo large-scale changes, the continuity of pre-colonial systems alongside these changes suggests gradual transformation, not radical disjuncture. Colonial infrastructures in the eastern Indian Ocean did not, in other words, wholly displace the long-standing networks that preceded them, and even facilitated new exchanges of indigenous cultural capital that were otherwise unmediated by the colonising powers. The process we will map entails overlapping but chronologically staggered layerings of pre-colonial, colonial and hybrid discourses, undertaken in several language-cultures and by different constituencies over time. We will also suggest that viewing India and the Malay peninsula as a single, multiply-connected region (and not as separate cultural arenas as is still paradigmatic in ethnomusicology) throws substantial and unexpected light on these patterns of transition.

During the wiring of the brain it is important to establish mechanisms that act as safeguards to control and stabilize neuronal excitability in the face of large, chronic changes in neuronal or network activity. This is especially true for developing systems that undergo rapid and large scale forms of plasticity, which could easily lead to large imbalances in activity. If left unchecked, they could lead the network to its extremes: a complete loss of signal or epileptic-like activity. For this reason neurons employ different strategies to maintain their excitability within reasonable bounds. This proposal will focus on two crucial sites for neuronal information processing and integration: the synapse and the axon initial segment (AIS). Both sites undergo important structural and functional rearrangements in response to chronic activity changes, thus controlling the input-output function of a neuron and allowing the network to function efficiently.

They range from understanding the role of activity during synapse formation to how pre- and postsynaptic structure and function become matched during development. Finally, it tackles a novel form of plasticity that lies downstream of synaptic inputs and is responsible for setting the threshold of action potential firing: the axon initial segment. Here, chronic changes in network activity results in a physical relocation of the AIS along the axon, which in turn alters the excitability of the neuron.

This needs new thinking, and the development of architectures and facilitators for novel flexible radio technologies.

State of the Art and beyond: The first generation of targeted therapies in chronic inflammatory disease used RA as prototype disease for clinical development. These therapies are now also used in other inflammatory disorders. Although treatments have been developed that are effective in a proportion of patients, they are aspecific, relatively toxic and do not mediate cure. Currently, it is unknown which molecular effects need to be induced and/or targeted to prevent induction or persistency of RA. However, this is within reach through a strong international consortium of world-leading European groups that cover both basic- and translational research.  Work plan: The general strategy for the project is to enable parallel studies that are focussed on critical switch moments in the biological processes that drive chronicity of inflammation. As the consortium consists of a multidisciplinary team with basic- and clinical expertise, translational research will be conducted to delineate the molecular basis of dysregulated inflammation, the RA-specific autoimmune-response and organ specific pathobiology.

However, about 78\u00a0% of patients sought help too late due to gradual onset of RA symptoms, believing that their symptoms would resolve spontaneously. To ensure early intervention in RA, 'early arthritis recognition clinics' were opened in Europe. These clinics provided insight into onset of RA symptoms through donated blood serum samples.\n\nResearch into biological mechanisms demonstrated an auto-antibody response increasing in magnitude and complexity shortly before the onset of arthritis. Such an abnormality might serve as an early indicator of risk for RA-development, providing a window of opportunity to initiate early treatment and prevent disease onset.

It is known that many T cell signalling proteins (such as the kinase Lck and the scaffold protein LAT) are not randomly distributed within the plasma membrane thus giving rise to lateral organization which affects signalling efficiency. However, the biophysical mechanism(s) that control protein distributions and hence the rate of molecular interactions remains poorly understood.

In contrast, rare DNA mutations might confer a large proportion of the overall genetic risk, but cannot be easily identified at the present time.

However, there is a lack of knowledge on CDM and its outcome in long-term illnesses, especially in care for people with severe mental illness. Thus, this project entitled 'Clinical decision making and outcome in routine care for people with severe mental illness' (CEDAR) is proposed by participants in six European countries (Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Switzerland and UK). Methods: First, CEDAR will establish a methodology to assess CDM in people with severe mental illness. Specific instruments will be developed (and psychometric properties established) to measure CDM style, key elements of CDM in routine care, as well as CDM involvement and satisfaction from patient and therapist perspectives. Second, these instruments will be put to use in a multi-national prospective observational study (monthly assessments during a one-year observation period; N = 540). This study will investigate the immediate, short- and long-term effect of CDM on crucial dimensions of clinical outcome (symptom level, quality of life, needs) by taking into account significant variables moderating the relationship between CDM and outcome. Expected results/impact: The results of this study will make possible to delineate quality indicators of CDM, as well as to specify prime areas for further improvement. Ingredients of best practice in CDM in the routine care for people with severe mental illness will be extracted and recommendations formulated. With its explicit focus on the patient role in CDM, CEDAR will also contribute to strengthening the service user perspective. Beyond dissemination of results in scientific journals, a number of steps to ensure swift transfer of the results to routine practice are proposed.

Importantly, there is currently no reliable method allowing prediction of the risk of an individual to develop a psychotic disorder.\n\nThe risk of developing a psychotic disorder is known to be related in particular to both a person's genetic make-up, and environmental factors during his/her course of life. These factors include adversity during childhood, belonging to a society's minority group, drug addiction, or just living in a city rather than in a rural environment. Twin studies show that susceptibility to developing a psychotic disorder may be to 50 % determined by genetics. It is assumed, but still needs to be rigorously tested, that a person's genetic make-up also influences the role that environmental factors can play to enhance/or decrease risk for psychiatric disorders to develop.\n\nTo address this key question, a multidisciplinary, multinational collaboration within, and beyond, Europe has been initiated, the EU-funded 'European network of national schizophrenia networks studying gene-environment interactions' project (http://www.eu-gei.eu (EU-GEI)).\n\nEU-GEI is investigating genetic, environmental, behavioural and clinical variables in samples and data from more than 7 500 individuals, including families of patients with psychotic disorders, twin pairs and individuals from the general population.\n\nIn order to better understand fluctuations in behaviour and experiences in the flow of daily life, EU-GEI scientists have developed the PSYMATE device and application. This data collection and software tool, is able to capture multiple parameters during moments in the flow of people's everyday life, and is thus providing a 'film' rather than a 'snapshot' of the patient's day. Data from the PSYMATE tool helps to empower patients in managing their own lives, helps clinicians in terms of diagnosis and it can contribute to the evaluation of mental health care interventions.\n\nThe EU-GEI website is up and running, providing both information for the general public and patients as well as a web-based training package available for researchers in the centres that are participating in the clinical study under the project.\n\nA fully functional database has been established that handles the large quantities of incoming data from the large EU-GEI cohorts that will provide the largest set of data available on genetic, environmental, behavioural and clinical variables in psychosis, in particular schizophrenia.

Unfortunately, the V&V technologies already in industrial use are still too expensive while often not effective enough. MBAT will provide European industry with a new leading-edge V&V technology in form of a Reference Technology Platform (MBAT RTP) that will enable the production of high-quality and safe embedded systems at reduced cost in terms of time and money. This will be made possible by a new and very promising approach in which model-based testing technologies will be combined with static analysis techniques. Besides this combination, a further new approach is to use (and re-use) specially designed test & analysis models as basis for model-based V&V. This advanced model-based V&V technology will lead to a more effective and at the same time cost-reducing approach compared to traditional ones. In addition, MBAT RTP will be connected to other ARTEMIS RTPs to extend existing platforms.

The identification of the epitopes presented by \u201cdiabetogenic\u201d HLA molecules to these CTLs constitutes a major research target to understand how beta cells are killed. Preproinsulin (PPI) has emerged as a key autoantigen in T1D: a surprising finding made in the host laboratory is that the dominant HLA-A2.1-restricted-PPI epitope, PPI 15-24, localizes to the signal peptide (SP), being an unusual finding for self-, or indeed microbial antigens. The processing of PPI to derive such epitope is also highly unconventional in being proteasome and transporter associated with processing(TAP) independent. Preliminary studies in the host lab have identified more antigenic PPI-SP epitopes restricted to other \u201cdiabetogenic\u201d HLA molecules and the existence of a common cleavage motif among them within the intramembrane SP portion. This suggests the involvement of an intramembrane cleaving protease (I-CLiP) in generating these disease-related epitopes.\nThe hypothesis is that the generation of disease-associated PPI-SP epitopes involves novel I-CLiP-dependent processing and presentation pathway(s).

In this project we incorporate three potential pathologies which have recently been associated with depression. The first is stress which is known as a common cause of depression followed by adult neurogenesis which has recently been suggested to regulate stress. Finally, inflammation has most recently been suggested to develop into a pathology which can cause depression. Our latest research has shown specifically an association between depressed individuals who are exposed to early life stress and inflammation and furthermore that these exposed individuals have an increased level of inflammation even in the absence of depression.

How this balance is established and maintained in peripheral tissues is largely unknown and is therefore essential for understanding the pathogenesis of autoimmunity and chronic tissue inflammation. Current therapies focus on reducing pathogenic Teff responses while augmenting suppressive Treg pathways. Tissue-resident dendritic cell (DC) populations are intimately associated with tissue-resident T-cells. It is well documented that inflammatory conditions alter the function of DCs, which in turn influence T-cell differentiation towards Teff and Treg cells.

Utlising a novel and unique experimental model whereby self-antigen is inducibly expressed in the skin, this proposal will dissect the role of tissue DCs in: 1) generating Teff and Treg populations in the skin in response to cutaneous self antigen expression; 2) deleting Teff cells upon persistent self antigen expression; and 3) maintaining Teff and Treg memory populations in the skin. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the dominant mechanisms of immune regulation occur within peripheral tissues at the sites of antigen expression and not in secondary lymphoid organs.

The cytidine deaminase APOBEC3 (A3) proteins, and in particular APOBEC3G (A3G), are potent host restriction factors that can be packaged into assembling HIV-1 virions and severely compromise viral infectivity. To evade this powerful restriction, HIV-1 relies on the vif (viral infectivity factor) protein, which has evolved to promote proteasome-dependent A3G degradation.

Within this definition lie many different layers pertaining to mental health, nutrition and decreased sexuality, which in turn are tied to a plethora of cultural, economic and ethnic considerations. Against this backdrop, the project team worked on evaluating consensus among experts on frailty, particularly regarding its clinical and diagnostic components.\n\nUsing a communication technique known as the Delphi method, which is based on decisions of a structured group of individuals, the team produced over 130 statements to better define frailty. It clarified the difference between frailty and disability, reaching consensus on diagnosis and prognosis, as well as outlining biomarkers to identify frailty.\n\nSpecifically, the team agreed that frailty is a dynamic, non-linear process that impacts multiple body systems, is characterised by diminished resistance to stress and can be considered a clinical syndrome. It is different from vulnerability and disability in that over and above its physical components, it involves a variety of psychological, social, emotional and spiritual elements. The project team also emphasised that nutritional status, physical performance, mental health and cognitive status are key components in assessing frailty.\n\nIn parallel, significant progress has been made in identifying biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of frailty, representing a very important step in preventing disability.

Hybrid PET/CT systems using Computer Tomography (CT) to provide the anatomical reference for lesion localization have evolved to be the best choice for a number of applications in cardiology and oncology.

A hybrid combination of ToF-PET with a 3T MR has the potential to overcome these shortcomings, by fully exploiting the superior soft-tissue contrast of MR in combination with a new MR-compatible solid-state PET detector technology, and a sophisticated motion compensation enabled by concurrent acquisition of both MR and time-stamped PET data.

Using a number of volunteer families, they employed genetic methods to narrow down the causative gene variants that cause epilepsy and link this information with clinical data.\n\nThey found that the EEG trait is associated with variants at the ELP4 gene that maps on the human chromosome\u00a011. The speech sound disability was found to be due to defects in the timing of voice onset and vowel duration.\n\nWith respect to reading disability, researchers performed a genome-wide linkage analysis with known dyslexia loci. Although no association was found with these loci, a novel linkage was found between genes located at chromosomes\u00a01 and 7 and the emergence of rolandic epilepsy. Familial genetic studies showed that the siblings of individuals with epilepsy also had an increased chance of developing language and attention deficit, clearly underscoring the genetic component of the disease.\n\nThe work of the TRHE study extended to other idiopathic focal epilepsies and led to the identification of mutations in the glutamate NMDA receptor in patients with epilepsy.

Interoperability of neuGRID with LONI is facilitated by (i) the database structure of neuGRID being the same of LONI, i.e. that of the North American Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), (ii) an ultra broad band connection links Europe to US (GTRN) and (iii) neuGRID may adopt LONI's workflow authoring system for algorithm pipelining.outGRID will organize workshops in Europe, Canada, and the US to promote the exchange of technical information, direct the development of the infrastructures towards interoperability, and develop specific international calls and call topics for research and development activities aimed at achieving full interoperability. outGRID will be a first step toward a global scientific grid infrastructure, it will trigger convergence within the neuroscientific community and, in the long run, the biomedical research community.", 5890.0, 422334.0, "outGRID", null, null, null, null, "http://www.kcl.ac.uk", null, "fp7_93069_999981052"], ["2LS", "Development of Time-enabled Mapping and Dissemination Tool for Biofuels Projects", "King's College London", "This proposal involves the development of a time-enabled mapping tool to be used for dissemination activities for the projects supported (either completed or ongoing) in the European Union and Beyond.

What needs to be analysed is whether the movement was truly autonomous, organised by ground level Congress leaders, or was Gandhi, even as a distant figure in prison, in total control of the movement.

Dysregulated mitochondrial activity results in generation of free radicals which cause damage to cellular components. We reported that mitochondrial quality control by autophagy is essential for normal cardiac functions (Nat Med 2007). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contains bacteria-like unmethylated CpG motifs, which are inflammatogenic. We reported that mtDNA that escapes from autophagy-mediated degradation leads to inflammatory responses in cardiomyocytes and heart failure (Nature 2012). Damaged mitochondria in failing hearts are selectively removed by mitochondria-selective autophagy, mitophagy. Mitophagy is preceded by mitochondrial fission, which divides elongated mitochondria into pieces for autophagy. Although Atg32 is essential for mitophagy in yeast, no homologue has been known in mammals. Recently, we identified Bcl2-like protein 13 (Bcl2-L-13) as a functional mammalian homologue of Atg32 which induces mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy (Nat Commun in press) in mammalian cells.

But what exactly is the function of the additional plasticity provided by adult-born neurons? How does it influence information processing in neuronal networks? \n\nThese questions are vital for our fundamental understanding of how the brain works. We will address them by studying a unique population of cells that is continually generated throughout life: dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb. These cells play a key role in the modulation of early sensory responses and are renowned for their plastic capacity. However, the role of this plasticity in shaping sensory processing remains completely unknown. FUNCOPLAN\u2019s first objectives, therefore, are to discover novel experience-dependent plastic changes in the cellular features and sensory response properties of adult-born neurons. We will then go much further than this, however, by integrating our discoveries with state-of-the-art techniques for precisely manipulating activity in these cells in vivo. This wholly innovative approach will allow us to mimic the effects of plasticity in na\u00efve circuits, or cancel the effects of plasticity in experience-altered networks. In this way, we will break new ground, demonstrating a unique contribution of plasticity in adult-born cells to the fundamental function of neuronal circuitry.", 1746837.0, 1746837.0, "FUNCOPLAN", null, null, null, null, "http://www.kcl.ac.uk", null, "h2020_209498_999981052"], ["2LS", "Inflammation and AD: modulating microglia function - focussing on TREM2 and CD33", "King's College London", "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is an age-related chronic neurodegenerative disease with four main pathological changes in the brain: amyloid plaques, fibrillary tau tangles, inflammation and neuronal loss.

While much has been discovered about protein enzymology in the recent decades, the question of how mechanical force affects enzymatic catalysis remains vastly elusive. The main goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanobiology of proteolysis at the single molecule level. We will use the newly developed force-clamp spectroscopy technique, together with molecular biology engineering techniques and bioinformatics structural analysis to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie protease catalysis under mechanical force.

Upon mechanical unfolding, proteins unveil their buried substrate sites, also called cryptic sites, thus favoring the formation of the E:S complex and ultimately permitting the subsequent chemical reaction. A key feature of recent mechano-chemistry experiments at the single bond level is that the rate at which the reduction of a protein disulfide bond occurs in the presence of a nucleophile is exponentially dependent on the stretching force. Hence, it is tempting to speculate that, in the case of an enzymatic reaction, the catalytic rate will be also force-dependent.

In breast cancer, acquisition of stemness properties has been closely related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key process in cancer invasion and metastasis triggered via Rho-ROCK mediated actomyosin contractility. Interestingly, in melanoma, transition from elongated-mesenchymal to amoeboid mode of movement (MAT) driven by Rho-ROCK signalling has been associated with increased stemness. Furthermore, preliminary data from host lab shows that actomyosin cytoskeletal regulates glutamine metabolism in both melanoma and breast cancer cells. Metabolic cues participate in stem cell self-renewal regulation, suggesting that, in very contractile cells, the regulation of EMT, metastatic spread and tumour initiation might be functionally linked to stemness via metabolic clues. Nevertheless, how very contractile cells regulate genes involved in all these processes remains unexplored. As increasing contractility via EMT in carcinoma cells or via MAT in melanoma cells correlates with increasing stemness, we hypothesize a molecular link between the pathways regulating both migration and stemness abilities, which will be maintained across tumour types (from carcinoma to melanoma).

The goal will be achieved by: (a) improving efficiency of currently existing wing, by increased span at no excess structural weight, while establishing modifications by aeroelastic tailoring to carry the redesigned derivative wing; (b) developing methods and tools for very accurate flutter modeling and flutter control synthesis, to enable improved flutter management during development, certification, and operation, enabling to fly with the stretched wing at same airspeed as the baseline aircraft; (c) validating the accuracy of developed tools and methods on an affordable experimental platform, followed by a scale-up study, demonstrating the interdisciplinary development cycle. Manufacturers will gain cost efficient methods, tools and demonstrators for enhancing aircraft performance by integrated development of flutter control and aeroelastic tailoring. These inter-disciplinary capabilities will improve the design cycle and the Verification& Validation process of both derivative and new aircraft. Better control of development and certification costs can be achieved if these capabilities are used to address problems early in the design process.

We focus on youth organisations working with marginalised youth, NEETs or young people threatened by unemployment and social exclusion. During our events we connect them to capacity building organisations that provide training and networking opportunities.\r\n\r\nOur needs analysis with partner organisations showed that in order to put the abovementioned recommendations into practice, we should develop a training programme tackling the following fields of action: \r\n\u2022 Boost the self-confidence of youth workers and young people to dare more to put their ideas into practice (attitude),\r\n\u2022 Improve the operative knowledge on the structures, policies and mechanisms - especially as regards European youth participation (knowledge) - and making results tangible through social impact measurement (skills),\r\n\u2022 Coach participants to follow through upon their ideas over time (action).\r\n\r\nIn short we ask one question only: \"Who do YOU dare to be and which IMPACT do you want to stand for?\"\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS, ACTIVITIES,  METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS\r\nThe Arc Training assembles 32 youth workers, volunteers and young (aspiring) social entrepreneurs from 12 countries and 19 different organisations.

It also comprises a voluntary peer-to-peer post-coaching process lasting over a period of 6 months. \r\n\r\nOur methodology is rooted in the principles of non-formal education: Participants will be trained on the structures and mechanisms of European youth work. They will also be guided through a comprehensive coaching process where they will be given the opportunity to challenge their projects and develop an inspiring target which they are enthusiastic about reaching in the future. Towards the end of the training course a session on social impact measurement will empower them to add a quantitative dimension to the goal they wish to pursue. During the post-coaching process after the training, participants will not only be coached on realising their target, but to also on how to track their impact as a means for further internal improvement. \r\n\r\nWith The Arc Training we strive for the following impact as regards our participants: (a) increase in leadership skills, (b) increase in knowledge on EU structured and social impact measurement, (c) shift in attitude towards an outcome-oriented project management style, (d) an empowering experience of reaching an inspiring new goal for their project together with their coach. \r\nIn the long run the key competences developed during this process are also expected to increase their own employability and to significantly improve the work in their organisations at home.", "http://sandbox.is", null, "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA105-001536_8"], ["2LS", "Promote diversity, promote human rights", "English Law Students' Association", 11618.0, "In our EVS project \"Promote diversity, promote human rights\" (duration 10 months) will participate two volunteers - one from UK and one from Poland.
