The most recent figures bring to 14 the number of illegal mints discovered to date, accompanied with a significant cumulative total of counterfeit coins detected or confiscated. Over 80 classes of counterfeit coins and corresponding tooling and working methods are identified, which by European Technical and Scientific Centre directives lead undoubtedly to the conclusion that the vast majority of counterfeit manufacturing facilities remain in operation. At the same time conductivity measurements are widely used for characterisation of heat treatment of aluminium alloys and other non-destructive testing, especially for safety-critical applications in aerospace industry, nuclear reactors etc. Prior art in the field has led to technologies made to reduce at manufacturing time the spread of electrical parameters and at validation time the measurement of electrical conductivity of the metal respectively. Due to the large number of coins produced by European mints, material for coin blanks is sourced from different suppliers. Recent European standards to increase the security of the coinage by reducing the spread of parameter values result in significant challenges for manufacturers of coin validators used in vending machines and bank coin sorting machines. The SMEs participating have identified these challenges and consider they represent major product opportunities. The developed metal validation technology will be required to distinguish between increasingly sophisticated counterfeit and the tightly specified genuine coins and to characterise the metal quality. This will be accomplished by developing advanced signal processing and data fusion techniques, and by also developing planar electro-magnetic sensors and pulse eddy-current measurement techniques with increased field sensitivity. The market being addressed includes coin validators and aerospace and nuclear industries.", 308566.0, 1509728.0, "SAFEMETAL", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_97141_999521757"], ["2UU", "Open Source Modelling and Hardware Software Codesign of Embedded Systems", "DUNVEGAN SYSTEMS Ltd", "Europe has a strong leadership in the domains of intelligent communications, multimedia, and automotive systems. However, the exponential increase in complexity threatens the European competitiveness. Current challenges when designing mixed HW/SW embedded systems are (1) mastering the complexity of the integration between the HW and the SW parts, (2) shortening time-to-market, and (3) reducing design cost. Codesign is the next big step in the holistic ( design of embedded electronic systems; hence it is an essential enabling technology for solving these challenges. It formalizes the interface between the hardware and software parts, and improves the amount of re-use, by allowing one to design models that can be adapted to several different performance/power/cost requirements and to different interface protocols. OSMOSIS will develop a key component required to maintain and enforce the European competitiveness in the intelligent system domains: create an open-source codesign framework for top-down embedded system design. This goal is achieved by joining the numerous on-going efforts in industry and academia into a unified best-practice, industrial-quality framework that will enable an easier transition from research results to industrial exploitation. The OSMOSIS platform will enable experimentation with codesign algorithms, starting from languages such as SystemC and producing HW and SW implementations. The results of the project will have a significant impact on intelligent embedded systems design by promoting cost-efficient software and hardware integration and reducing software/hardware concurrent development time.
