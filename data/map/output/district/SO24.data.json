By focussing on early detection of logging activities, the system will provide the means to quickly identify the first signs of deforestation and thus act as a tool to control resource use and sustainable development within these fragile and valuable environments. The system will form a high-resolution add-on for existing (semi-)operational low- to mid-resolution systems, providing hot-spot monitoring for areas at highest risk of deforestation. As such, it could be integrated into national or regional forest monitoring centres and provide inputs for large scale carbon emission assessments in the context of the UN-REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) Programme.\n\nThe system will be developed in collaboration with investigators from developing countries on three continents in an effort to build lasting partnerships and transfer European expertise. Sites in Indonesia, Brazil and Mozambique have been chosen to represent a variety of forest types and deforestation issues, and thus to test the system\u2019s versatility.\n\nThe REDD-FLAME project will bring benefits to a wide range of parties concerned with deforestation in tropical and sub-tropical environments and build capacity in the host countries for managing forest resources and carbon balances. By implementing a dedicated version of REDD-FLAME for each participating ICP country, results targeted at their specific monitoring requirements, based on the strategies and policies for deforestation in place, will be provided to give timely information on logging activities and deforestation.", 140675.0, 518555.0, "REDD-FLAME", "Combating deforestation from space", "Tropical forests are among the most biologically diverse habitats on the planet but are under threat from illegal logging and mining activities. An EU-funded initiative is developing an early warning system that can rapidly identify the first signs of deforestation, thereby acting as a tool for ensuring sustainable development within these fragile ecosystems.", "The 'REDD fast logging assessment  &  monitoring environment' (http://redd-flame.info/ (REDD-FLAME)) project will design and test a system for monitoring logging activities in tropical and sub-tropical forests with the aid of very-high\u2013resolution Earth Observation satellites. The system will complement existing low- to middle-resolution systems that cover entire countries or regions, monitoring areas at high risk of deforestation.\n\nREDD-FLAME is designed to mainly use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, but a parallel approach employing optical remote sensing data is also being implemented. The project has identified a wide range of users, including indigenous peoples, forest managers, enforcement agencies, policymakers, and logging and mining enterprises. High-resolution SAR data will be used to create highly detailed maps of forest change to identify hotspots and detect indicators of illegal activity, such as camps and new roads. This information can then be matched with intelligence or circumstantial evidence acquired in cooperation with local partners on the ground.\n\nProject partners will determine what information is required for mapping and monitoring deforestation as well as identifying forest type and land cover. They will also assess the most suitable methods for implementing a near-real\u2013time forest monitoring system using data from multiple satellite SAR sensors.\n\nResearchers are testing REDD-FLAME in three countries \u2014 Brazil, Indonesia and Mozambique \u2014 to determine its potential as part of a forestry monitoring centre. The results are used for informing policymakers, providing information for monitoring programmes, providing evidence for law enforcement efforts and helping local communities to protect their lands from illegal encroachment.\n\nREDD-FLAME will therefore help build capacity in the host countries for managing forest resources and help combat deforestation, thereby conserving biodiversity and the natural environment.", "http://redd-flame.info/", null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813111955.jpg", "fp7_97918_984772228"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SO24"}
