A large, robust and consistent evidence base indicates that coordinated, high impact and comprehensive approaches are the most effective way to reduce smoking initiation, prevalence and intensity. Despite this, policy makers and public health procurers often lack the data and financial justification to make the case for investment in tackling the scourge of tobacco. The CER project \u201cEQUIPT\u201d brings together expertise from multiple disciplines and aims to provide health care policy makers with bespoke information about the economic and wider returns that investing in evidence-based tobacco control including smoking cessation agendas can generate. Learning from a very recent UK experience, EQUIPT will co-create and test a \u201creturn on investment\u201d (ROI) tool, designed for use by tobacco control advocates, policy makers and public health procurers. The first stage of the project will develop the existing ROI tool for use in four EU Member States \u2013 Germany, Spain, Hungary and the Netherlands. Following this, it will test the transferability of the ROI methods to other EU countries (including lower-income Member States) with a view to guiding comprehensive tobacco control policies. The innovation of this project is its focus beyond simply estimating the cost-effectiveness of individual interventions: instead it will evaluate comprehensive tobacco control in an approach that mirrors real practice, where various interventions are delivered concurrently. In combination with a structured dissemination plan involving key stakeholders, this will improve investment in effective tobacco control and cessation services, in turn reducing the incidence of major chronic diseases and improving quality of life at the population level.

Restricted access to these assets limits the range of NDT techniques available for in-service inspection to those capable of inspection from the top surface. Conventional ultrasonic inspection of high manganese steel is ineffective due to the inherent coarse grain structure and the highly anisotropic and non-homogeneous material properties; low material penetration, high scattering and beam divergence contribute to low signal-to-noise ratio of reflected signals. Conventional dual phased array techniques (with transmitter/receiver pair) have been applied in conjunction with processing features such as spatial averaging and dynamic depth focussing. However, this approach is highly inefficient and therefore inappropriate for practical deployment.\n\nThe SAFTInspector proposal will enable efficient in-service inspection of manganese rail assets by applying Phased Array UT full matrix capture in combination with a novel post processing technique called Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique (SAFT). This technique increases the available angular range of inspection by synthesising a large aperture transducer; therefore spatially averaging noise contributions from grain structure, allowing an increase in Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) and increasing the potential signal response from a defect.\n\nThe aim is to design a novel array transducer working in a full matrix capture (FMC) mode. This novel design will enable efficient acquisition of data for SAFT processing. SAFT post processing will generate 2D and 3D reconstructions of the ultrasonic volumetric image to produce a simple pass or fail indication for the user.

For the same reason, they are also the point of frequent explosive impact collisions from rolling stock.\n\nThe ability to detect fatigue and cracks early is of utmost importance to passenger safety and maintenance operator profitability.\nEU support of the project \u2018Ultrasonic synthetic aperture focusing technique for inspection of railway crossings (Frogs)\u2019 (http://www.saftinspect.eu (SAFTINSPECT)) is helping scientists develop a manganese-compatible in-service inspection technique.\n\nSAFTINSPECT is exploiting the synthetic aperture focussing technique (SAFT) to increase the signal - to - noise ratio and enhance detection sensitivity. A novel image reconstruction algorithm will enable full-volume inspection from the surface.\nIts commercialisation promises tremendous savings in life cycle costs to an industry whose maintenance costs have remained stable over the last 30 years.\n\nNow approximately half way to the finish line, the team has designed the heart of the system, an innovative two-dimensional annular array ultrasonic transducer. The design employs two separate arrays to optimise transmission and reception separately. Ceramic materials maximize energy output for transmission and polyvinylidene difluoride is used for reception. Manufacture is soon to be completed and initial SAFT algorithms produced excellent image quality.\n\nSoftware to control the scanner has been designed and image reconstruction algorithms were developed and tested for speed and image quality. Automatic scanner control will enable complete volumetric inspection even at oblique angles within 20 minutes. To ensure applicability in the field and not only in the lab, the team has chosen a rugged, light and portable site-ready ultrasound array controller. During the next project phase, all the components will be integrated in a comprehensive scanner design concept.\n\nCommercialisation of the SAFTINSPECT in-line volumetric inspection technology for railway frogs is expected to significantly decrease both accidents and maintenance costs.

Apart from these partners the European Biomass Industry Association (EUBIA) has joint the consortium in order to assure a broad dissemination of project results to a broad range of stakeholders (e.g. industry, biomass producer, research organisations).

In order to cover the growing demand for biomass raw materials as energy carriers, what are known as Short Rotation Coppices (SRCs), where fast-growing trees are cultivated within short rotation periods, are increasingly popular. The potential recognition of SRCs as what is referred to as \u201cgreening measures\u201d in the framework of EU agricultural policy and related betterment can give the sector a further boost. http://www.rokwood.eu/ (ROKWOOD) is an EU-financed project which supports the cultivation and effective utilization of SRCs in European regions. The objective of ROKWOOD is to overcome local barriers to the development of biomass regions in Europe. One of the principal and already achieved project results is a roadmap to strengthen the sector in Europe.\n\nOn the basis of an analysis of determining factors, the consortium identified six fields of action which appear to be particularly important for the success of SRCs. These include the implementation of pilot and demonstration projects in particularly suitable regions, the improvement of knowledge exchange between players, the setting up of an interest group at EU level as well as regular information and demonstration events. Activities have already commenced in the framework of ROKWOOD and the concrete approach was defined in a \u201cJoint Action Plan\u201d. A summary of this plan can be found on the http://www.rokwood.eu/public-library/joint-action-plan.html (project website).\n\nOn the basis of an analysis of the political, economic and social conditions for SRCs, various hurdles were identified which occurred in all the participating countries and therefore need to be overcome at European level. These include the fundamentally rather low level of awareness of SRCs and the low level of expertise amongst potential players, an often lacking or incomplete SRC infrastructure as well as limited political and financial support.\n\nThe ROKWOOD project partners are convinced that SRCs \u2013 once the barriers identified have been overcome - will represent an economically attractive alternative to other types of land use. A marketplace for SRC players and other interested parties is accessible on the project website. 93 players - from producers to users of wood energy - have registered so far. These include farmers, machinery manufacturers, contractors and energy producers.\n\nROKWOOD fosters cooperation between the six participating European research clusters in Sweden, Spain, Germany, Poland, Ireland and Great Britain with the aim of improving research, technological development and market response.
