From a European perspective, the traditional signalling is one of the most conservative parts of the railway system strongly bound to the national traditions by all involved parties.Since 1990 the EU is promoting the reformation of parts of the signalling subsystem under the ERTMS programme.However this covers not the whole signalling system.The implementation of ETCS could be hampered, in areas of the conventional European rail network, where interlocking will need to be replaced, if this cannot be carried out in an economically and technically efficient manner. Also the implementation of systems utilising centralised and automated route-setting of trains will be economically constrained.Railways are aiming for significantly reduced life-cycle costs of future interlocking and associated outdoor equipment. Standardisation, increased competitive tendering and significant reduction of implementation time are considered to be key requirements for the future.Without an approach, similar to that underway for ERTMS-ETCS, many suppliers will run into resource constraints, making it difficult for them to keep up with the many new concurrent developments.Therefore, railways and the signalling supply industry agree that the scope of INESS should be the interlocking up to the point of interfaces with the surrounding other signalling and train control systems like centralised traffic control, neighbouring interlocking, ETCS Radio-block centres and possibly object controllers for out-door devices.INESS will adopt the CENELEC norm with the underlying system engineering principles. It will build on the available results of both the Euro-Interlocking project and the ERTMS developments and it will especially not modify the current ETCS functionalities and solutions.", 216747.0, 13669978.0, "INESS", "Rail signalling streamlines EU transport", "Safer and more efficient rail signalling and interlocking systems are being harmonised, thanks to a set of emerging reports, best practices and guidelines.", "In the last two decades, EU railway stakeholders have been working fervently to harmonise railway signalling and foster cross-border interoperability, in line with the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). Together, key railway actors worked on articulating specifications for new interlocking systems and reducing the life-cycle cost (LCC) of signalling systems. The EU-funded project 'Integrated European signalling system' (INESS) took up the challenge to streamline railway operation, enhance safety and contribute to implementing the ERTMS.\n\nBuilding on the research of a similar previous project, EuroInterLocking, the project team mapped the value chain of interlocking systems and defined a new data model, including needed adaptations and applicability. It completed reports on a life-cycle\u2013based cost model for interlocking systems, market-specific cost drivers, and cost-saving potential within the interlocking life-cycle.\n\nIn terms of generic needs for new generation interlocking systems, the team mapped necessary requirements and interfaces to produce a strategy for verification and validation. It then studied safety constraints related to the interfaces and proposed one of several harmonised structures, outlining viable migration strategies to the new system.\n\nAmong the project's greatest achievements was defining how the system should be implemented. The new strategy was based on transferring relevant railway data to industry stakeholders in order to configure an INESS interlocking-specific application, a model dubbed European Unified Description of Railway Infrastructure (EUDRI). INESS also published a handbook on best practices for testing the interlocking system and developed an open source software support tool to reduce time and money in signalling while enhancing safety.\n\nAll these valuable initiatives and efforts have been detailed in around 100 deliverables that can be accessed on the project's website. In parallel, the International Union of Railways (UIC) produced a final technical report on the project's results and made it available to the public, paving the way for harmonised signalling and interlocking systems. This will help EU rail systems converge under one efficient system, improving rail transport, travel, tourism, commerce and industry in a safer and more agreeable environment.", "http://www.iness.eu/", "http://www.railsafe.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2011-02/53871.jpg", "fp7_90098_998092656"], ["6UX", "Development of a portable miniature mass spectrometer to monitor important, but technically difficult parameters in aquaculture", "Q Technologies Ltd", "The AquaMMS project will improve today's SoA by  developing a robust and portable miniature mass spectrometer, which will monitor online a wide range of vital water quality parameters simultaneously. AquaMMS will be suitable for use primarily in land-based aquaculture industry, but other markets are also relevant including environmental monitoring sector and the water supply industry. This technology will provide the fish farmer with advance warning of a broad range of potential pollutants, like toxic metals, phosphates, nitrites, nitrates, hydrogen sulphide and geosmins. These pollutants can otherwise inflict chronic stress on the farmed fish resulting in disease outbreaks and/or poor product quality, which means lost profit to the fish farms. Most of these parameters are at present technically challenging to measure accurately on a regular basis and may only be analysed when problems arise on the farm and samples are sent for more comprehensive analysis at external laboratories. Q-technologies (UK) has successfully developed miniature mass spectrometry (MMS) technology for the oil and gas industry, and has seen the need and potential in developing and marketing a similar system for the aquaculture industry. Therefore, they have taken the initiative to propose the AquaMMS project by combining forces with the  SMES, Faaltech (Ireland) and BAMO (Germany). Together, these SMEs will form the production and distribution chain of the product post project.

The EU-funded AQUAMMS (Development of a portable miniature mass spectrometer to monitor important, but technically difficult parameters in aquaculture) project is developing an innovative monitoring system that can support or replace equipment currently on the market.\n\nIn recent years the use of RASs has increased throughout Europe and around the world. This is due to its numerous benefits, which include reusing a large percentage of the water, thereby reducing water use, controlling effluent and minimising environmental pollution. These benefits can help give higher yields of fish.\n\nHowever, unexpected water quality problems can develop as a result of using RAS technology. These include pH decline, rising carbon dioxide concentrations, and an increase in phosphate and nitrate levels or toxic metals.\n\nTherefore, the new AQUAMMS technology will provide an immediate advance warning of potential harmful substances. This will enable appropriate action to be taken instantly, such as increasing oxygen flow or employing a particular water treatment to rectify the problem.\n\nAQUAMMS will develop miniature mass spectrometer (MMS) technology and use it in conjunction with existing know-how on specialised membrane inlet and sensory technologies. This will enable the consortium to develop sensors with unique and wide-ranging capabilities, which can detect low concentrations of important contaminants and pollutants.\n\nThe system will contribute to organic production since actions influencing growth conditions can be taken before any pharmaceuticals or other chemical treatment is needed. This will enable farmers to promote a higher value organic product with the aid of eco-labelling, giving it an edge over imported products. Moreover, by producing more farmed fish, aquaculture will help to take the pressure off of wild stocks.\n\nLand-based fish and shellfish farms, particularly those using RASs, represent the main market for the AQUAMMS system.

SNIFFLES is exploiting linear ion trap mass spectrometry to achieve its aims, based on the device's sophisticated ability to identify single atoms and complex molecules.\n\nThe flexible user-friendly device can even detect trace levels below parts per million, boasting as well a mass range larger than other mass spectrometry solutions currently on the market. It can take a 'fingerprint' of a substance and compare it with an online database to immediately identify it.\n\nAlready, the team has outlined the procedure and design, including gas load evaluation of the required vacuum system and sensor performance metrics. It built the linear ion trap, electronic control unit and inlet device, in addition to developing the required software. This was followed by experiments to evaluate vapour ionisation, a crucial part of the process.\n\nOnce commercialised, the device could be used in a myriad of ways, such as at border checks to prevent transport of illegal substances, including biological and chemical warfare agents.
