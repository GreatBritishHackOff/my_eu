There is hardly an economic sector which feels the effects of such changes as fast as the tourism sector. The people in charge have to react in a fast, professional and cautious way. Therefore, Tourism Schools Salzburg put a special emphasis on making sure that the training they facilitate is \u2018at the pulse of time\u2019. The future graduates do not only have to be ideally prepared for starting their career but they also need to be able to deal with the most different circumstances. Thanks to the Erasmus+ Project our students have a much clearer und comprehensible idea of the international job market and its demands. The effort which Tourism Schools Salzburg take in order to enable their students to go abroad is particularly emphasized by the internationally-oriented professional training in the classic disciplines such as service, kitchen, bar and reception. The subject-specific training at the schools matches top-quality standards and is targeted at the demands of the international tourism economy. Specific objectives are amongst other things an improved fluency in the foreign languages as well as increased skills in the areas kitchen, service, bar and reception of the respective country\u2019s culture and language. The cultural exchange and the personal responsibility which the students experience during an internship encourage the personal development and strengthen the self-confidence. The young people have to deal with topics such as mobility and cultural variety which, as a consequence, broadens their horizon as far as political topics of the EU are concerned and increases their interest to actively look into these matters. About 30 students from all 4 school locations of Tourism Schools Salzburg participate in this mobility program. Due to their training, they all have several years of experience in the areas kitchen, service, bar and reception. During the summer months the students will work in tourism related areas of the hotel and tourism economy and will demonstrate the skills which they have acquired at school. This project is characterized by an intense and permanent communication with the project coordinators of Tourism Schools Salzburg. During the project \u2013 before, during and after the internship - an active communication in this triangle between the organization sending the student, the partner company and the student will be necessary. This continuous communication will deliver valuable information for evaluation purposes and can also even affect the design of the curriculum at the schools. The target is a sustainable cooperation with the partners abroad which is documented by the respective Memorandum of Understanding. As a result, the Schools will benefit from having permanent partners abroad, the partners will benefit from the excellent know-how of the students and last but not least the students will be able to increase their competitiveness on the job market. The project results can be perfectly used for professional media relations and serve to improve the Schools image. Moreover, it motivates the students to look into the mobility offers. The European idea shall be carried on - both internally and externally - and shall also inspire other young people to go abroad. The use of ECVET criteria will be exploited more intensely in 2017. The experiences from 2016 serve as an excellent foundation in order to continue the future-oriented work on this project.", "http://www.kkhotels.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA102-034627_3"], ["0PT", "MUSIC FACTORY", "taNgoLe", 19704.0, "Multilateral Youth Exchange,  as part of the Erasmus Programme KA1 Plus, titled MUSIC FACTORY will be held in Naples (ITALY) between 18/06/2017 end 25/06/2017, 47 young participants between 20 and 25 years and 6 leaders (no age limit), from England, Spain and Italy. Young people from Naples have been in contact with their peers from Spain and UK, planning and organising this music project, claiming that these music projects are very important as they can spread their positive messages and voice themselves through music, helping other young people to reflect on the causes of social exclusion of disadvantaged and means to overcome such exclusion. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to involve groups of young people from disadvantaged socio-economic contexts in different European countries. The music will be characterized as a glue and an element of social solidarity and a fundamental tool of social inclusion. Music as high artistic expression is experienced in all its many forms. The young participants in the youth exchange will experience various activities conducted with no formal work methodology, will explore together their knowledge and musical styles and experience in a final performance, the creation of new music, from text to music. The sounds, the music will reflect the diverse cultural influences and traditional European countries involved in youth exchange. The music is used by young people as a reflection of their lifestyle, way of dressing, their thoughts, how to be, to express themselves and their culture. Participants will be involved in debates and discussions, workshops and other group activities to discover the similarities and differences of the common influences in the musical traditions of different European cultures. They will also examine the role that music has played and in today's society as a whole, creating trends and lifestyles, and how through the words you can send a message, giving the opportunity to express their personality and their views. The music will serve as a starting point for a more detailed discussion of the social problems that young people experience today, creating a hope. This young people, during the week, they will feel as a family try to find solution to their problems and they will be inspired to create further initiative like this to improve their European society. Their culture and skills will fuse making them feeling of a big community: Europe.\r\n\r\nProject activities are aimed at involving young people through active participation, which is a priority in the \"Erasmus +\".
