We propose the creation of a novel polymer processing technology. We will develop the ability to foam engineering grade thermoplastics without the need for chemical blowing agents or speciality moulding equipment. Our technology offers many advantages for SME injection moulders & extruders in sectors such as aerospace, automotive and construction. We will: \u2022 Eliminate the need to invest in expensive processing machinery to make foam parts \u2022 Eliminate the need for chemical blowing agents \u2022 Reduce material consumption \u2022 Reduce energy consumption through lower process temperatures \u2022 Produce low density, consistent foams with excellent mechanical properties \u2022 Reduce part cost and finishing operation requirements \u2022 Increase manufacturing flexibility We have selected engineering grade thermoplastics, which will be saturated with nitrogen gas at temperatures above Tg, where diffusion rates of gas within the polymer are significantly increased. The granules will then be cooled below Tg, \u2018trapping\u2019 the nitrogen molecules within. The granules will be packaged and shipped to SME moulders for use in standard moulding machines. During processing, melting of the polymer will release the trapped nitrogen, producing foam in the moulding machine. We will develop our understanding of melt processing technology to ensure optimum processing speed, density and mechanical performance. Initial trials have already indicated the potential of this process but the technology needs considerable further development for successful commercialisation. We strongly believe that our technological breakthroughs will benefit the European polymer processing community, which is facing significant threats from lower cost imports", 131597.0, 2232442.0, "LIGHT-FOAM", "Tiny bubbles with low-cost methods", "Production of high-quality foams from engineering-grade plastics currently relies on chemical blowing agents and expensive and specialised moulding equipment. Novel technology eliminates both for major cost benefits.", "Simplifying the production of foams and thus reducing production costs would significantly benefit the many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) working in the field. It would boost their competitive position and enable them to regain markets from foreign companies and their less expensive products.\n\nNovel technology developed within the scope of the EU-funded project LIGHT-FOAM promises to facilitate low-cost production with existing injection moulding, extrusion and compression moulding equipment. It centres on infusing nitrogen gas into the polymers, trapping it and releasing it during processing to create foaming activity.\n\nScientists used a commercial autoclave process to infuse high levels of nitrogen at a temperature above the glass transition temperature of five selected polymers. Here, gaseous diffusion is high. Cooling to room temperature traps the nitrogen molecules and reduces the free volume of the polymer granules. A predictive model of nitrogen dissolution and diffusion developed iteratively from feedback from lab-scale tests helped optimise conditions and ensure compatibility with current autoclave processes.\n\nA specialised packing and shipping procedure was needed to ensure nitrogen is not lost before polymer granules are delivered to end users. Specifications followed legislation for transport of goods under pressure. Researchers chose an inexpensive solution consisting of layers of polyolefin and aluminium containing a one-way valve to release pressure in case of build-up. Preliminary storage trials of gassed and non-gassed polycarbonate samples were quite promising.\n\nFinally, researchers optimised the moulding process for uniform nucleation and growth of nitrogen bubbles within the polymer. Numerous trials were undertaken and the effects of die design and processing parameters evaluated on product density, mechanical properties and microstructure. Three case study parts were manufactured for consortium beneficiaries, one for each manufacturing technique. Dissemination and demonstration has resulted in contact from several companies and identification of two commercial opportunities.\n\nLIGHT-FOAM delivered a novel technique to produce high-quality foams from polymers without the need for chemical blowing agents or special equipment. The significant reductions in cost together with continued optimisation according to end-user materials, processes and product lines promises major benefits to SMEs in the field.", null, "http://www.zotefoams.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/148723.jpg", "fp7_93391_998440983"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CR9"}
