Guidelines are also typically developed as a one-size-fits-all package. By developing and evaluating targeted dissemination strategies, DECIDE aims to increase the use of evidence-based interventions in a sustainable way and to reduce the use of interventions where benefits are uncertain.\n\nMethods: GRADE is a systematic approach towards assessing and communicating the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. It has been developed to address the weaknesses of other grading systems and is now widely used internationally. The DECIDE consortium, which is composed of members of the GRADE Working Group, will further develop this approach to ensure effective dissemination of evidence-based recommendations targeted at the key stakeholders (healthcare professionals; policymakers and managers; patients and the general public) who determine what happens in clinical practice. We will collect stakeholder input from advisory groups, consultations and user testing. This will be done across a wide range of health systems in Europe. The targeted dissemination strategies that are developed will be evaluated in randomized trials, refined and used and evaluated with real guidelines developed by the DECIDE partners and other guideline developers that we support.\n\nExpected results: Dissemination strategies for recommendations that have been rigorously evaluated in diverse settings, support the transfer of research into practice, and are adapted to real-world healthcare systems.", 183328.0, 3082480.0, "DECIDE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.healthcareimprovementscotland.org", null, "fp7_97693_955738285"], ["7AT", "WoodWisdom-Net+ Pacing Innovation in the Forest-Based Sector", "The Forestry Commissioners", "The overall objective of the WoodWisdom-Net\\ is to support the transformation of the European F-BI and sustainable forest management for increasing resource efficiency and adapting to and mitigating climate change effects.

Catering Mobility in Europe will create a set of ambassadors in the sector who are students, apprentices, graduates within a year or staff doing vocational qualifications.

This leap will have at its heart a 5 week mobility in Amsterdam (2 people), Tenerife (2 people), Gothenburg (1) or Helsinki (1) to first gain cultural and local food knowledge alongside further language lessons over 4 weeks at hotel and restaurant schools and then do a four month placement in a 4 or 5 star hotel from October to February, including over the busy holiday season.

While writing these blogs on cultural differences, local seasonings and the links to culture, recipes and the tourism sights, they will be acting as ambassadors for Scotland to their host countries and sharing their experiences with the sector back home, taking a step up in their career ambitions.While the participants are gaining passion for the hospitality and sharing it widely with their new discoveries, the consortium partners in Scotland will be learning about catering mobilities and making contacts in other countries.

This in turn has led to new partnerships being established, the ability to offer a broader range of VET mobility opportunities to both students and staff, an increase the number of inward flows, enhanced peer engagement and internationalisation of the College environment.    \r\n\r\nThe broader partnership has enabled NCL to offer mobility in a wider spectrum of curriculum areas across our faculties that include Health Care, Childcare, Hairdressing, Beauty Therapy, Make-up Artistry, Sport, Football, Rugby, Motor Vehicle, Motor Cycle Maintenance, Hospitality, Travel and Tourism, Computing, Dental Studies and Animal Science. New staff training mobility abroad will provide our academic staff the opportunity to enhance their CPD in Childcare and Creative Industries.\r\n\r\nThe REALISE 2017 project was developed by the NCL ERASMUS+ Steering Group, which has representatives from all faculties and 3 UK sending partners. Each faculty and external partner have signed a flow proposal outlining the number of students and accompanying staff they have identified to participate in a mobility experience in one of our 19 EU host partners in Austria, Spain, France, Italy, Ireland, Lithuania, Malta, Cyprus or Iceland. 3 host partners are new and were identified by staff on training assignments in 2016. The project will enable NCL to deliver a mobility experience to 978 students and accompanying staff with18 staff on training assignments in a partner country in the 2017/18 and 2018/19 academic years.\r\n\r\nAs with previous mobility programmes, we send accompanying tutors on all of our student mobility flows. The accompanying tutor has a pivotal role to play in selecting, preparing and supporting the students throughout the mobility experience; acting as a mentor to the participants while on placement and responsible for liaising with the host partner and companies on welfare issues. An additional requirement of the accompanying tutor is to monitor learner progress by liaising with the in-company supervisor and host partner to validate the participant\u2019s academic achievement, ensure the quality of the placements and ensuring attainment of mobility objectives and key performance criteria. In REALISE 2017 we will be seeking to adapt the role of the accompanying person through in order to better address ECVET objectives that will further enhance the employability of the individual through formal recognition of the knowledge, skills and competences gained during their mobility experience.\r\n\r\nAll of our partners are committed to providing a high quality mobility experience by informing the design and development of training activities, incorporating good practice, and where appropriate, arranging placements, accommodation, local transport, cultural visits, supporting accompanying staff and evaluation and dissemination of the project to ensure it meets the needs of the participants.  As an Erasmus+ VET Mobility Charter holder we will strive for systems excellence through continuous development of processes and procedures; in particular use of e-tools and social media for enhanced communication with partners, improved financial e-tools in flow management, use of on-line platforms such as Moodle for students to access preparatory documents and assessment and measurement of the impact of mobility our internationalisation strategy.", "http://www.sru.org.uk", "New College Lanarkshire", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA116-036233_3"], ["5PJ", "Skills Provision Abroad Resulting in Knowledge and Learning Enhancement", "Scottish Rugby Union Plc", 1465078.0, "New College Lanarkshire (NCL) is a provider of one of the largest mobility programmes in the Scottish Further Education sector and internationalisation is central to our planning processes.  The NCL European Internationalisation Strategy 2016 \u2013 2020 incorporates the best elements and good practice from previous projects and activities in order to integrate an international and cultural dimension into the teaching and service functions of the organisation and drive forward global ambition and aspiration. \r\n\r\nDelivery of the SPARKLE project will enable NCL to build on the number of learners and staff participating in mobility activities in a measured manner; better internationalising the curriculum and outlook of all participants. In the past two and a half years we have increased the number of staff who have participated in mobility training opportunities; resulting in the growth of the number of partner countries with which NCL is engaged. This in turn has led to new partnerships being established and increased capacity to offer a broader range of VET mobility opportunities to both students and staff, an increased number of inward flows, enhanced peer engagement and internationalisation of the College environment.  \r\n\r\nThe broader partnership has enabled NCL to offer mobility in a wider spectrum of curriculum areas across every NCL faculty, including Health Care, Childcare, Hairdressing, Beauty Therapy, Make-up Artistry, Sport, Football, Rugby, Motor Vehicle, Motor Cycle Maintenance, Hospitality, Travel and Tourism, Computing, Dental Studies and Animal Science.
