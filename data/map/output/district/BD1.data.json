Aside from the social costs in terms of suffering, they account for 70% on European average of public healthcare systems in the EU. A plethora of ICT based applications have been developed in the last years, allowing to tackle at least partially problems related to specific pathologies. However, even advanced experiences have had limited impact, mostly focusing on pilot applications entailing little or no change on the whole healthcare system. The RICHARD project arises from the need to make healthcare systems more efficient while managing effectively their costs. ICT can be a major change agent in this process, but only if systemic aspects are duly taken into account, such as the interrelation of ICT with organisational and non-technological components of healthcare systems. To do so, a significant shift is necessary to evolve from an application based model, to a comprehensive and sustainable chronic care model, likely to be adapted to the broadest possible range of chronic conditions. The RICHARD project will therefore focus its analysis on the pathologies-specific ICT applications being implemented in leading European regions and elaborate a Joint Action Plan oriented to the integration of those technologies for the deployment of sustainable chronic care models for European regions. This will require a strong coordination of research resources and innovation stakeholders (clearly identified in the first phase of the project) to design new research paths and innovation models. The Joint Action Plan will also be inspired by a medium-long term vision that looks at e-health services into a perspective of economic growth for the regions along the principles of open competition for better and pan-European healthcare services.

The next step was to develop a telehealth implementation toolkit (the Ready Steady Go toolkit, http://clahrc-sy.nihr.ac.uk/resources-project-reports.html)  to support stakeholders in defining, implementing and delivering effective tele-Health services.  The toolkit was developed in collaboration with the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care for South Yorkshire (NIHR CLAHRC SY).\n\nA third step was to exchange detailed information about pilots and models already in place in the four regions and to  cooperate to facilitate the cross adoption of them (mentoring activities).\n\nFinally, the project team published the acquired information in 4 languages (see http://www.richardproject.eu) and participated in 20 conferences presenting their strategy.

The strategy sets five strategic goals of which two are closely tied to the development and provision of lifelong guidance.The main objective of the Foundation Innove is to coordinate the lifelong learning development activities and implement the relevant programmes and projects and the EU structural aid in a targeted and efficient manner. Our mission is to  support the development of learners' life skills by creating and stimulating the learning environment and efficiently mediate European funds to organisations that implement educational, labour and social policies. The Agency for Lifelong Guidance act as Estonian Euroguidance (EG) Centre in Estonia, operates in the Innove with the aim to support guidance practitioners in promoting mobility and the European dimension within education and training and in the field of lifelong guidance. The Agency belongs to the Academia - a network of partners that have a long term experience in organizing international study visits for guidance practitioners - to support them to become familiar with relevant developments and trends in Europe in the field of lifelong guidance. To meet the needs of the changing labour market and clients the practitioners have to be aware of the current trends in globalized labour market and have experience in using modern and wide-ranging toolbox of methods. In addition, due to the fact -  there is no regular accredited basic training programmes offered to the career specialists in the public universities, it is essential to provide a consistent possibility of different high quality courses.The main goal of this project is to provide an opportunity for the specialists working in the field of lifelong guidance, to gain new experience and knowledge from other European countries and to disseminate best practices among other practitioners in Estonia. With this project we aim to improve the professional skills and knowledge of the practitioners and the quality of guidance services provided by them. The multinational study visit groups are of added value \u2013 this provides the opportunity to learn from several counties\u2019 practices all at once. Last but not least, all the other participants benefit also from Estonian experiences, shared by Estonian guidance specialists. It is also essential to raise the awareness of the practitioners about mobility as one possibility in lifelong learning. By providing this opportunity to the practitioners, they can have a personal mobility experience and this helps to better realise and promote the value of mobility to others. Besides that, the communication abilities and growth of professional network, along with improved language skills, can be seen as the benefit of this project.Main target group of this project are specialists working in the field of lifelong guidance. Our practitioners have various educational backgrounds; most of them are either psychologists, information specialists, youth workers or teachers. During the study visit in spring 2016 and 2017, thirty practitioners will be visiting their colleagues in different European countries. As the first step in implementing the project, we will launch a call for application among our target group. Based on the application, the selection procedure will be carried through, with the main criteria for successful applicants being working experience in the selected field, language skills and dissemination plans of the project results. There will be an information day organised for the participants, where they learn about practicalities, conditions and the project in general. Then we will sign contracts with the participants and carry on with practical arrangements. The participants have to prepare a personal development plan at least two weeks before the study visit, where they state both their personal goals and methods how to reach them along with planned dissemination activities. In the II quarter of 2017 and 2018, four-days study visits will take place.

Our Career Guidance Centre needs to have a dialogue with other European guidance organizations and to visit them to learn about method development, tools for professional guidance of newly arrived foreign youths. Research show that parental engagement during the youth's school years dramatically decreases the risk of Drop-out from school and increases the chances the youth will graduate from school. The drop-out problem is considerable in Swedish schools and we want to look at how this is dealt with in other countries. Modern career guidance counselling learns from other countries' experience and also wants to increase the understanding for other countries - and our organization wants to be at the forefront. We want to open up the possibilities for international exchanges in our entire organization and learn from good examples which we can implement in our regular activities. Through the Exchanges we will have a clearer picture of how to meet the challenges we have identified, i.e. developing methods and tools to meet newly arrived pupils from other countries, working with parental guidance and the Drop-out problem. We plan to let twelve employees from the different departments of our organization have the possibility to study how the partners in the proposed project deal with what we have identified as our development areas. Our staff, i.e. career guidance counsellors, social pedagogues, youth officers and heads of unit, will all contribute their various sets of knowledge and professional experience. These professions cooperate closely with youths and Drop-outs \u2013 first and foremost with those who risk to Drop-out, but also with getting Drop-outs back to school. The guidance counsellors are well experienced in how to inform about upper secondary education and VET in classes, in smaller groups or individually. They help youths to plan their future and give the individual the tools to make strategic choices.The task of the heads of unit is to create the conditions for their staff to work in a professional way, i.a. by offering competence development of high quality, nationally as well as internationally.

Their employment is not only set back by the lack of workplaces and working experience but also by the fact that the knowledge, competence and working culture of the young finishing formal education do not fit or partly adapts to employer demands, and they can hardly become self-employed due to the lack of their entrepreneurial skills. \r\nThe proportion of job-seekers under the age of 30 is 28% in the county that is higher than the national average. The number and proportion of early school-leavers have been increased significantly even in the county; to cease that and reduce their proportion under 10% - according to what has been defined in the EU 2020 Strategy \u2013 is a great challenge. \r\nThe major objective of the project is to help preventing the young from becoming unemployed, enhance the young in becoming entrepreneurs and the employment of job-seekers.

The members of the consortium will specifically study the particular professional fields, whose experts and professionals \u2013 because of their job \u2013 will effectively use the experiences acquired during the study visits and build them into the operation of their own organisation. \r\nThe participants will attend a target-oriented, 16-hour professional, cultural and specialised language course before every mobility visit. \r\nIn the project, one-week study visits with 12 people each in 4 countries are planned to be held.
