Aside from the social costs in terms of suffering, they account for 70% on European average of public healthcare systems in the EU. A plethora of ICT based applications have been developed in the last years, allowing to tackle at least partially problems related to specific pathologies. However, even advanced experiences have had limited impact, mostly focusing on pilot applications entailing little or no change on the whole healthcare system. The RICHARD project arises from the need to make healthcare systems more efficient while managing effectively their costs. ICT can be a major change agent in this process, but only if systemic aspects are duly taken into account, such as the interrelation of ICT with organisational and non-technological components of healthcare systems. To do so, a significant shift is necessary to evolve from an application based model, to a comprehensive and sustainable chronic care model, likely to be adapted to the broadest possible range of chronic conditions. The RICHARD project will therefore focus its analysis on the pathologies-specific ICT applications being implemented in leading European regions and elaborate a Joint Action Plan oriented to the integration of those technologies for the deployment of sustainable chronic care models for European regions. This will require a strong coordination of research resources and innovation stakeholders (clearly identified in the first phase of the project) to design new research paths and innovation models. The Joint Action Plan will also be inspired by a medium-long term vision that looks at e-health services into a perspective of economic growth for the regions along the principles of open competition for better and pan-European healthcare services. In this respect the project plans to build upon strategic initiatives already undertaken within each participating region.", 56395.0, 2655466.0, "RICHARD", "Regional ICT clusters for healthcare and R&D", "Four European Regional Clusters are developing models for the care of chronic conditions, with a focus on diabetes, cognitive diseases and stroke derived impairments.", "Since now, tele-health applications for the care of chronic conditions had  a limited success, and often they did not get over their experimentation phase.  More than for technical reasons, this is due  to the level of readiness of the Health Systems to support a organizational, cultural, regulatory, infrastructural changes.\n\nThe 'Regional ICT-based clusters for healthcare applications and R&D integration' (Richard) project intends to facilitate the definition and the implementation of novel models, using ICT, for managing chronic conditions in four regions (Tuscany in Italy, Lodz in Poland, Vasterbotten in Sweden and Yorkshire in the United Kingdom), leveraging on the direct cooperation of Health authorities with the Academic and Enterprise actors  (the triple helix concept) on a shared Joint Action Plan.\n\nThe team also recruited a set of external experts who formed an Advisory Committee assessing the implementation of these Joint Actions.\n\nFirst, the project identified major barriers to the implementation of tele-health services across Europe based on scientific literature. The next step was to develop a telehealth implementation toolkit (the Ready Steady Go toolkit, http://clahrc-sy.nihr.ac.uk/resources-project-reports.html)  to support stakeholders in defining, implementing and delivering effective tele-Health services.  The toolkit was developed in collaboration with the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care for South Yorkshire (NIHR CLAHRC SY).\n\nA third step was to exchange detailed information about pilots and models already in place in the four regions and to  cooperate to facilitate the cross adoption of them (mentoring activities).\n\nFinally, the project team published the acquired information in 4 languages (see http://www.richardproject.eu) and participated in 20 conferences presenting their strategy. They have also published a brochure, generated four press releases and participated in four web/radio programmes.\n\nThe Richard programme could be viewed as a reference initiative to improve Chronic Care management in Europe using ICT. Implementation of the project will help to combine resources, consolidate regional clusters on tele-health and disseminate the findings among further regions in Europe.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2013-03/54312.jpg", "fp7_95879_999913637"], ["3BN", "High Throughput Systematic Single Cell Genomics using Micro/Nano-Fluidic Chips for Extracting, Pre-analysing, Selecting and Preparing Sequence-ready DNA", "Genotype2phenotype Ltd", "We propose a technology that will sit at the front-end of sequencing pipelines, present and future, and will significantly enhance the quality and throughput of DNA sequencing.\n\nAlthough much attention has been given to throughput/cost of the sequencing process itself, the same cannot be said for the preparation of samples. Identified bottlenecks are (1) sequencing technologies require days of upfront sample preparation which is further increased when sequencing selected parts of the genome; (2) genome assembly relies on computationally intensive comparisons to the reference genome because existing technologies produce short sequence reads; (3) it is difficult to begin with small amounts of sample material comprising micro-biopsies and single cells.\n\nThe CELL-O-MATIC project will synergize efforts from SMEs, academics and large companies to address these bottlenecks by developing chip-based systems that process DNA from individual cells, ready for next generation high-throughput sequencing.\n\nSingle cell analysis has numerous applications in systems biology but we will emphasize DNA isolation and sequencing from circulating tumor cells (CTC), which have a strong prognostic value in cancer management.\n\nA second innovation will be to develop methods that enable up to whole chromosome lengths of DNA to be contiguously mapped using nanofluidics.

Among them, freight carriers and shippers are interested in minimizing freight logistics costs in order to maximize their profits, while maintaining a competitive level of service to their customers. City administrators and residents are oriented towards a decrease in traffic congestion, social costs and environmental nuisances, even though they are often direct beneficiaries of high quality delivery services. This leads to a multitude of differing and possibly conflicting objectives that are involved in urban freight transport planning and decision making, yielding a high level of complexity. This provides a main motivation for the development of tools for helping decision makers to reach higher grades of efficiency. \nDespite growing academic interest, the extent to which freight transport is acknowledged and formally considered in local authority transport planning varies considerably from country to country, and on a more local level, between towns and cities. As a result, policy development with respect to urban freight and city logistics is characterised by a rather fragmented approach, with many city authorities finding it difficult to address the complex set of differing views of a large variety of stakeholders. \nThe proposed project will be aimed at identifying local authority planning needs with regards to urban/city logistics activities and the necessary pre-requisites for inclusion of stakeholders in the process.
