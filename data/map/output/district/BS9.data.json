Modern applications show an increasing demand for better heat and electric current carrying capacity at the level beyond copper base materials. Nanocarbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have attracted attention due to their high electrical, thermal conductivity and exceptional mechanical properties.\nIt would appear that combining copper with high performance nanocarbons towards composite materials could offer immediate solution to problems encountered currently. Copper nanocarbon composites could form the next generation of conductors, where copper contributes the benefits of electrical conductivity, whereas nanocarbon brings to this composite its low weight, flexibility, mechanical reinforcement and thermal management. Recent breakthrough in the chirality control of carbon nanotubes could contribute significantly to the electrical conductivity of these composite materials beyond the performance achieved by bulk copper conductors.\nThe material and process costs required to achieve improvement of the overall performance of copper based electrical conductors, need to be compatible with large scale conductor manufacturing and overcome the issues such as the cost of the nanocarbons and the difficulty of scaling up the production processes.\nThis proposal is aimed at developing a copper nanocarbon composite with significantly improved overall properties, including electrical, thermal and mechanical performances over bulk copper. The proposal also aims to develop production process that will be scalable to large volume manufacture.  A key breakthrough will be the development/modification of the continuous carbon nanotube fibre process originating from Cambridge University for copper composite production, an inherently larger volume process for the production of carbon nanotube with high degree of structural control and molecular orientation.", 67832.0, 3907429.0, "ULTRAWIRE", null, null, null, "http://ultrawire.eu/", "http://www.invro.com", null, "fp7_108893_951175114"], ["2DA", "REsearch on a CRuiser Enabled Air Transport Environment", "Dr Rajendar Kumar Nangia", "This proposal is all about the introduction and airworthiness of cruiser-feeder operations for civil aircraft. Cruiser-feeder operations are investigated as a promising pioneering idea for the air transport of the future. The soundness of the concept of cruiser-feeder operations for civil aircraft is explained in the proposal, taking air-to-air refuelling operations as an example. A comprehensive estimate is given, which shows a fuel burn reduction potential and a CO2 emission reduction of 31% for a typical 6000 nautical miles flight with a payload of 250 passengers. This reduction potential is known to be large by any standard.The top level objective of the proposal is to demonstrate on a preliminary design level that cruiser-feeder operations (as a concept to reduce fuel burn and CO2 emission levels) can be shown to comply with the airworthiness requirements for civil aircraft. The subsequent Scientific and Technological (S&T) objectives are presented in the proposal. In the project, airworthy operational concepts for cruiser-feeder operations are determined and studied. The benefits in terms of CO2 emission reduction are derived and quantified. This is conducted in three integrating work packages, which are underpinned by research conducted in three disciplinary work packages. A conceptual and preliminary design study of aircraft required will be made, as well as automatic flight control concepts necessary to reduce the workload of the pilots and concepts to transfer passengers, supllies and waste. Finally, flight simulations will be conducted to investigate the cruiser-feeder operations concept.

This manoeuvre is virtually unheard of for long-haul commercial aeroplanes. Air-to-air refuelling (AAR) of passenger aircraft can result in considerable fuel savings and environmental gains.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'Research on a cruiser enabled air transport environment' (http://www.cruiser-feeder.eu/ (RECREATE))\u00a0examined the feasibility and potential benefits of the promising AAR concept for civil aviation. It also set out to determine fuel savings by replacing airport fuelling actions with mid-air refuelling.\n\nStudies carried out by project partners showed that fuel can be reduced by between 11 and 23\u00a0% for a standard 6\u00a0000-nautical mile flight with a 250-passenger aircraft. It was also revealed that the total operating costs can be lowered.\n\nProject members developed an automated flight control system and monitoring and supervision systems for use in a series of demonstrations. Approach and docking simulations investigated whether AAR can be carried out while maintaining required safety levels in line with civil aviation regulations and a satisfactory workload for pilots.\n\nResults demonstrated the feasibility of AAR, and feedback from pilots assured the safe handling of aircraft with the automated flight control system.\n\nThe team also researched how passengers and cargo might be delivered to a nuclear-powered long-range airliner. Findings revealed that advancements in technology are holding back its development.\n\nRECREATE proved the airworthiness of the AAR concept by analysing it from an economic, operational and technical perspective. Thanks to the project, the delivery of fuel to commercial airliners may become a reality sooner than ever expected.

Mobile surfaces are introduced in conventional wings to this purpose (ailerons, flaps, slats etc.), introducing at the same time inevitably additional weight, mechanisms, sources of vibrations and other well known limits.\nAn interesting alternative to mobile surfaces could be represented by \u201cself shaping wings\u201d, i.e. wings the surface of which can be elastically deformed through its entire length, and managed in order to obtain the required lifting profile. Such wing performances could be obtained through the application of composite hybrid materials where layers of new generation of piezoelectric fibers are drowned, and trigged by relatively low voltage.\nTarget of the research is the deep understanding of the technical feasibility and of the limits of such an application. Depending on the results, \u201cself shaping wings\u201d (or \u201cFuture Wings\u201d) could be more deeply investigated and designed in order to replace ailerons, slats, tail wings, rudders and, probably, even flaps: the relevant technology could have really wide fields of applications (helicopter rotor blades, satellite panels, etc.).\nProject objectives will be pursued developing at first theoretical models and computational new generation algorithms aimed at designing, optimizing and afterwards manufacturing a scaled model of \u201cFuture Wing\u201d on which experimental tests will be carried out in order to understand the viability of the original idea, which has the potential to bring a radical new approach to the design of flying vehicles lifting surfaces configuration.", 104550.0, 652877.0, "FUTUREWINGS", null, null, null, "http://www.futurewings.eu/", "http://www.ichrome.com", null, "fp7_109751_985914015"], ["3HQ", "RESPONSIVE OPEN LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS", "The British Institute for Learningand Development Lbg", "ROLE's cross-disciplinary innovations will deliver and test prototypes of highly responsive TEL environments, offering breakthrough levels of effectiveness, flexibility, user-control and mass-individualisation.

This approach permits individualization of the components, tools, and functionalities of a learning environment, and their adjustment or replacement by existing web-based software tools. Learning environment elements can be combined to generate (to mashup) new components and functionalities, which can be adapted by lone learners or collaborating learners to meet their own needs and to enhance the effectiveness of their learning. This empowers each user to generate new tools and functions according to their needs, and can help them to establish a livelier and personally more meaningful learning context and learning experience.ROLE's generic framework uses an open source approach, interoperable across software systems and technology.

All TEM techniques are in fact limited to the imaging and energy spectroscopy of the electron wavefunction. Moreover, when a single sample property is sought, most of the image information is useless, a waste that cannot be afforded in dose-sensitive materials. The Quantum Sorter leverages the recently-acquired capacity to structure e-beams, which implies that if, in a quantum experiment (tunable state preparation, interaction, analysis), the analysis is performed over the \u2018optimal\u2019 basis of quantum states, very few electrons are necessary for the full characterisation of a sought property, i.e. the TEM can be tuned to answer a single question but with maximum efficiency. To this end, Q-SORT introduces a new parallel analysis strategy, based on a suitable conformal mapping of the wavefunction: the starting point is the analysis of orbital angular momentum (OAM), but building a recipe for diagonalising a wider range of observables is one of the planned Breakthroughs of Q-SORT. This will in turn allow Q-SORT to achieve three other high-risk Breakthroughs of vast applicability: assessing the OAM of plasmonic resonances in select nanoparticles, achieving atomic-resolution magnetic dichroism, identifying different proteins based on selected properties. We believe that the Quantum Sorter will become so important that it will eventually be part of every state-of-the-art TEM, since the new technology is easy to integrate with energy-loss spectrometry.
